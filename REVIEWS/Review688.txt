		<shortDescription>Not really Star Trek. To JJ: Your audience is smarter than action and explosions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disappointed with this entry in the series. Star Trek to me isn't about motorcycles and loud music, it's more about exploring science fiction concepts and themes through great storytelling (which this film has very little of). The "twist" at the end is figured out about a 1/3 of the way in. Lazy storytelling where props are laid for action scenes for no apparent reason (why is there a motorcycle aboard a starship?).On the plus side, the cast is magnificent and the charm they bring to their roles makes this enterprise watchable. It's too bad the script and direction don't give them much to do. Mr. Lin, while a good action director, isn't a good storyteller. While that's good for the Fast &amp; Furious franchise, Star Trek deserves better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How is it possible to spend so much cash making a movie so utterly meaningless and bad? 185 million USD?This is 2 hours of your life that you will never get back.So, where to start? First off the story is so thin and seems like a child wrote it. It has no depth and right from the beginning you feel basically nothing for the bad guys or the good guys, and there are so many holes in the story.There happens to be a huge base far out in space where the Enterprise is going to restock? Isen't the Enterprise supposed to be out in deep space exploring?Next to this large space base there is a nebula and apparently a planet with perfect conditions for human survival. It seems to be right next to the large space base, which would seem very very unlikely considering the vastness of space. And the crew happen to land on the same small area of this huge planet so they can all meet up.Then they meet a character that seems to be a bad mix of Rey from Star Wars and Neytiri from Avatar who happen to have found an old federation ship (that of course they can get to work after 150 years on a deserted planet), very unoriginal.So the reason for the bad guy Krall to lure the Enterprise to his planet and destroy it seems to be a device that Kirk has that will help Krall kill people. But in the end of the movie it is very clear that using his ships alone he could have easily destroyed the base - so what was the purpose of this relic device in the first place?There is quite bad CGI during the whole movie. In every action packed scene especially the fighting the camera moves around so much it is hard to grasp what is happening. But even with this shaky camera trick it's impossible to miss how utterly bad these scenes are. The fighting scene between Manas and our Rey character is one of the worst Iv seen in a long time.The only thing decent with this movie are some of the actors and their dialog. Everything else, from story to script to CGI is just garbage.Im sorry I like Star Trek I really do, but this movie is not worth seeing in the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Science Fiction &amp; Action Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nine hundred and sixty-six days into its five-year voyage, the USS Enterprise arrives at Starbase Yorktown, a massive "snowglobe"-like station with its own internal atmosphere and cityscape, to replenish dwindling supplies while the crew takes shore leave. Struggling to find continued meaning in their mission, Captain James Kirk has applied for a promotion to Vice Admiral of Yorktown, and plans to name Spock as the new captain of the Enterprise. Meanwhile, Hikaru Sulu reunites with his husband and daughter, Spock and Nyota Uhura have amicably ended their relationship, and Montgomery Scott works to keep the ship operational. Spock also receives word from New Vulcan that Ambassador Spock, his elder counterpart from the original time-line, has passed away.An escape pod drifts out of a nearby nebula. The survivor, Kalara, claims her ship is stranded on Altamid, a planet in the nebula, and the Enterprise is dispatched on a rescue mission. The rescue turns into an ambush when the Enterprise is overwhelmed by a massive swarm of ships and is badly damaged. The swarm's alien commander, Krall, boards the ship searching for an alien artifact that Kirk had obtained on a recent mission. The swarm rips apart the Enterprise, and the saucer section crashes to the planet as the crew abandons ship in escape pods.On the planet's surface, Sulu, Uhura and other surviving crew are captured by Krall. Kirk and navigator Pavel Chekov, accompanied by Kalara, find the crashed saucer section. Kalara is discovered to be Krall's ally when she attempts to retrieve the artifact for him. To escape Krall's crew, Kirk activates the still-functional boosters, causing the saucer to lurch forward and crush Kalara. Meanwhile, a seriously wounded Spock and Dr. Leonard McCoy search for the other survivors. Spock tells McCoy of Ambassador Spock's death and that he intends to leave Starfleet to continue his counterpart's work on New Vulcan. Meanwhile, Scotty is rescued by Jaylah, a scavenger who previously escaped Krall's encampment. She takes him to her makeshift home, the wreck of the USS Franklin, an early-generation Starfleet vessel that went missing over a hundred years ago. With Scotty's help, the ship is repaired, and Scotty, Kirk and Chekov, and McCoy and Spock, reunite using the ship as a base. The group plans to raid Krall's camp to rescue the crew and transport them to the Franklin then escape the planet. Meanwhile, Krall coerces a member of Kirk's crew to hand over the artifact that she had kept hidden for Kirk. Krall reveals the artifact is the missing half of an ancient bio-weapon, created by the planet's original inhabitants, that can disintegrate a humanoid life form in seconds. With the device now complete, Krall intends to attack Yorktown and kill its inhabitants, and, using its advanced technology, go on to attack the Federation.Kirk and the others free the crew as Krall launches from the planet with the bio-weapon, leading his fleet to Yorktown. The Enterprise crew pursues Krall in the Franklin. Scotty transports Spock and McCoy into one of Krall's drone ships where they eject the crew. They discover how the drone vessels coordinate. Krall's communications is disrupted with VHF transmissions, causing mass confusion that results in the fleet's destruction. Krall and his three remaining officers crash in Yorktown. As Krall escapes into the city, Uhura and Kirk discover from the Franklin's logs that Krall is actually Balthazar Edison, the captain of the Franklin. A human soldier from before the Federation's formation, Edison became disillusioned with his life and purpose after peace was established with humanity's enemies. When he and his crew were stranded in the nebula, he believed he had been deliberately cast aside. Having prolonged his life using the planet's alien technology that also physically deformed him, Krall/Edison now plans to destroy the Federation in revenge. Kirk pursues Krall into the Yorktown's ventilation system where Krall attempts to unleash the bio-weapon on the entire station. Kirk forces Krall into a portal, causing the weapon and Krall to be ejected into space, where the weapon consumes Krall. Spock and McCoy save Kirk before he is blown into space.Kirk is offered the promotion to Vice Admiral, but he opts to remain as a captain. Spock receives a box containing some of the personal effects of Ambassador Spock; reflecting on an included photograph of the aged crew of the Enterprise from the original time-line (circa Star Trek V: The Final Frontier), he chooses to remain in Starfleet and resumes his relationship with Uhura. Jaylah is accepted into Starfleet Academy on Scotty's recommendation. As the crew celebrates Kirk's birthday, they view the construction of their new ship, the USS Enterprise-A.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge Star Trek fan. I absolutely loved this film. It was fantastic! I really liked how this film felt like a big budget episode of the Original Series! My favorite Star Trek film is The Voyage Home, followed by Star Trek 2009, and then Star Trek Beyond. This is one of my top 5 films of the year! It's that good! I had a blast watching this movie. It has a great balance of comedy, action, and story. The comedy is fantastic in this film. I absolutely loved Dr. McCoy a.k.a. Bones and Spock in this movie. They were without a doubt the best part of the movie. I almost wanted 2 hours of dialogue just between them! They were so great! The other actors were great too. Chris Pine is still really good as Captain Kirk, Zoe Saldana as Uhura was good, and Simon Pegg as Scotty is great. I also really liked Idris Elba and Sofia Boutella as Krall and Jaylah. Overall, I really loved this movie! If you're a Star Trek fan (or Trekkie) you are going to like it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They finally satisfied this old-school trekkie!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a trekkie who has watched everything Star Trek related from the past 50 years including every film and TV show. Although I've enjoyed the rebooted films, they never quite had the same magic as the originals. Until Star Trek Beyond, that is! Star Trek Beyond is the third installment in what is being called the "Kelvin timeline" of Star Trek with the rebooted universe of Kirk's storyline. Compared to Star Trek 2009 and "Into Darkness", this film felt astronomically more like a Star Trek film. I was absolutely blown away; what I thought was going to be a mindless, action-oriented Star Trek movie, was actually a brilliantly written and directed Star Trek film that felt more than fitting in the Star Trek universe.The spoiler-free storyline; the Enterprise is sent to investigate the disappearance of an alien race's crew in a nebula. The Enterprise (per the trailers...) ends up getting destroyed and the crew held hostage on an alien world that is used as a "booby trap" for countless other species that have also been tricked into exploring the nebula in one way or another. Throughout the story, we are not only introduced to new alien races, but also are introduced to past elements of Star Trek, included a desolate/abandoned NX-class starship! This film pays enormous tribute to not only "Star Trek Enterprise" and it's story-arch, but other Star Trek films/shows as well. For the die- hard trekkies, there is plenty to think and talk about after seeing the movie, as there are tons of references and connections made to the rest of the Star Trek universe (including ancestors of Star Trek characters seen in later series...).Furthermore, the movies makes a touching tribute to the death of Leonard Nimoy, by announcing the death of Spock Prime. It was done in a very tasteful and respectful way, and I believe most trekkies and die-hard fans would agree that it was only fitting to announce the death of his character in the film. Simon Pegg and the new director did a phenomenal job on this film. It felt so much more like a Star Trek film, at least to me, than the previous ones. The storyline was much more original than the retelling of the "wrath of Khan" events. Chris Pine is also really starting to hone-in on his role of Captain Kirk. Not only was the acting better, but the script this time around made him much more into the masterful Captain Kirk we grew up with in TOS and less of a party-boy. Overall, Star Trek Beyond fantastic Star Trek film. I can't believe I am endorsing and praising it as much as I am, but in my opinion, they got it right this time. After seeing this, I am starting to have more faith/confidence in the new cast continuing the Star Trek legacy and I look forward to the new films that come out in the series. If you're an old-school fan, give this one a try. It's a fun adventure and feels appropriate in the Star Trek universe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New High For Justin Lin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying, I LOVE Star Trek. I have grown up with it and I absolutely love the universe and the characters it has established. I am also a fan of the new Kelvin story line. It is different than the original series tone yes, but I think it works very well and I find entertainment in both mediums. Star Trek Beyond is the third edition to the Kelvin story line, but this time without J. J. Abrams coming back. When I first heard that I was very worried and the marketing campaign didn't help it either. I was hoping for a fantastic film to honor the Star Trek 50th anniversary, and I'm so glad that the trailers were wrong because this is a great film.The reason people love Star Trek is because of the characters. The characters have always been iconic and the re-imagined versions of them have always been "wishy washy" for some people. A lot of people think they did great and a lot think they are just pale shadows compared to the originals. I found the characters to be re imagined extremely well especially in this film. The inner conflict within the characters through this film is subtle but present. I enjoyed the arcs through Kirk, Spock, and even some other characters that had good conflict. They introduced a new character with Jaylah and I thought she was great. I loved every second she was on screen and I can't wait to see more of her. Idris Elba plays the main antagonist of this film, Krall. At first I was a little "iffy" on him. He lacked depth for me and I didn't really understand why he was doing everything he was. During the third act though there is a great scene that helps flesh him out though. It immediately made me want to re watch the film to see all of these events from his point of view. It gives a sense of legitimacy to the character and a fantastic villain for the film.Justin Lin was the thing that I was mainly worried about going in. I wasn't really that big of a fan of his work. Yes, the Fast &amp; Furious movies were fun, but nothing that I would call of exceptional substance. Star Trek is a much more meaningful and intellectual property that requires a certain amount of care and thought going in. Thankfully he really upped his game with the fantastic presentation of his scenes, every scene was visually interesting and felt important. The pacing was also very fast and fun making it a blast to watch. The sole complaint I had with the film was that there was some of that grit and realism in the space battles that was missing that I thought J. J. Abrams style really nailed. This is only a personal preference I know so take it how you want. I would've just liked for the whole film to have that grittiness the first two did. Another choice I found really intelligent was the style of film it was. There were subtle shots and ways the actors talked and acted that were subtle homages to the original. A non-spoiler example would be in the beginning of the film when Spock, Bones, and Kirk are walking down the hallway together the angle they used was the same angle they used in the original television series. The actors were even positioned the same way. There are a lot of interesting nods like that, that make it similar and more reminiscent of the original.Overall, this is a film I highly recommend. It can work as just a fun popcorn film for the casual movie-goer and an intelligent homage for big Star Trek fans. I enjoyed this movie thoroughly and I hope the next films can be as good as these last three were.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haters gonna hate...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My review is short and simple. I am both a Star Trek and science fiction fan. I decided to go in on full free fall mode. Despite what the haters were saying; they themselves not even having watched the film yet. I stayed away from that poison. If you're a Trekkie or Trekker, you'll love it. If you're into fantasy, you'll love it. If you just appreciate a good movie, you'll love it. If you're one of those "fans" who are never satisfied with reboots in general and think that nothing could ever top your original love, then you'll definitely dig around for something trivial to make you bash it. A true fan who loves the concept, the science fiction of it all, the art, the futuristic sense, the imagination, the escape that Star Trek undoubtedly brings, then you'll appreciate the story. The actors deliver. The character development is on point. The music? Amazing. Go in and watch the movie and accept it for what it is. Don't look for something negative because if you go in with that mentality then you'll find find it. Haters gonna hate. Ainters gonna ain't. Go on. Be an "ainter". When you walk out of there realizing that for two hours you had escaped the harshness of the world, a world Gene Roddenberry was so against, you'll thank yourself for allowing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so I'm a Star Trek fan being old enough to have watched the original series BEFORE it was in re-runs! But Star Trek Beyond just plain disappoints. It's not terrible? but it's not great either.It's Star Date 2263.2 and Kirk (Chris Pine) is into the third year of their "5 year mission" (which seems to somehow throw away a lot of potential sequel opportunities already doesn't it?). Less buoyant and confident than he used to be, Kirk is feeling a little emotionally 'Lost in Space': after all, as the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy put it "Space is big? REALLY big". Spock (Zachary Quinto) also receives some news of a personal nature that unsettles him. They are both in need of a vacation, and Starbase Yorktown (queue some spectacular special effects and an operatic Michael Giacchino track) appears to be able to offer them that. The crew disperse for a bit of R and R: Sulu (John Cho) goes off to spend time with his family (after the big internet furore, the gay aspect of this is very subtle); Kirk gets career advice from the Admiral; and Spock and Uhuru (Zoe Saldana) go their separate ways since ? like Ross and Rachael ? they are "on a break".The reverie is rudely interrupted by the arrival of a frantic alien called Kalara (Lydia Wilson) from the other side of a dense nebula. She needs help to rescue her crew, stranded on a planet there. Kirk's rescue mission however goes far from to-plan, and he and his crew are caught in the clutches of the warlord Krall (Idris Elba).What's nice about this film is that the core crew of Kirk, Spock, Uhuru, Bones (Karl Urban), Scotty (Simon Pegg), Sulu and Chekov (the tragically departed Anton Yelchin) gel together really nicely as an ensemble cast. The traditional by-play between the characters feels unforced, comedic and provides a warmth at the heart of the film. There is also a touching tribute to Leonard Nimoy, who died while the film was in pre-production, woven into the story of which I'm sure he would have approved.Supporting the crew as a potential new character is the strikingly attractive and kick-ass Jaylah played by Sofia Boutella (the evil amputee Gazelle from "Kingsman").There's also some fine and innovative alien technology on display with the 'swarm-like' alien fleet harking back (in an expanded scale) to the invulnerability of the nanites from an original episode.Unfortunately, all of these positives are severely offset by a largely planet-bound Simon Pegg and Doug Jung story (didn't the woeful "Insurrection" teach writers that this tends not to be a good idea?) and action sequences that are so manically fast-moving that it is almost impossible to keep track of what exactly is happening. (Perversely, this is a film that might actually make more sense on the small screen than the big one, which is just BAD CINEMA!). There was even one point in a final fight scene where I seriously feared Kirk and Krall might have a 'sharing of mother's names' moment (if you know what I mean) but fortunately this script apocalypse is avoided.At the conclusion the story actually makes no sense to me at all: without spoilers, it is difficult to discern exactly what the motivations of Krall actually were. Throw in a graphic in the final reel that looks like Krall is attacking the Death Star (no, seriously ? watch for it!) and the concoction just doesn't hang together very well. I know Simon Pegg and director Justin ("Fast and Furious") Lin are huge Trekkers, but ? sorry guys ? this was a C- for me.It's a mildly diverting popcorn movie, but with (for me at least) yet another disappointing film, its getting to the point where the best 'summer blockbuster' is likely to be Deadpool? and that was released in February!

		<fullReview>Will my review convince people to see it? Probably not. For I feel people will see it regardless if I review it or not. Star Trek is that type of movie, one that must be seen on the big screen, because it commands that they of viewing. So plunk down your dollars, get out of the heat, abandon your diet for the day and grab your popcorn and soda and enjoy a summer blockbuster that indeed earns that title. It is fun. It is energetic. It's everything a sci-fi fan ask for in a movie and especially if you are a Trekkie. The third go-round for the reboot cast is a joy to watch. They have such chemistry that they manage to do something great that The Next Generation film seems to miss. Excitement. It is gorgeous to watch in IMAX 3D (how I viewed it). It is a little bittersweet because it is the last we get to see Anton Yelchin as Chekov and this is the first Star Trek film after Leonard Nimoy had passed. But this cast is so up to the challenge that you just didn't want it to end. Justin Lin did an amazing job directing this film. It's a really good Trekkie story as well. And I don't write spoilers in my reviews, that is for the commentary pages and bulletin boards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refreshing entry in an entertaining series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly wasn't expecting much out of Star Trek Beyond after hearing Justin Lin (the director behind the more recent Fast &amp; Furious movies) was helming the third entry in this series. I simply wasn't sure how he would handle a science-fiction movie.I'm happy to say, he handled it expertly. I'm not here to dwell on the differences between this movie and the original series (which I am a big fan of) or say what it did and didn't do right as a 'Star Trek' movie. I'm simply here to say I had an absolute blast watching this fun science-fiction/action movie and personally felt it was the best one in this series so far. The acting was great, the writing was smart, and even the score was used perfectly. The movie also had a lot of heart which I really appreciated in-between the more intense action scenes.This entry was written by Simon Pegg and you can really tell he loves his Star Trek with the little touching moments he included throughout the movie. My favourite scene in the entire film (don't worry, no spoiler of course) was simply when Kirk and McCoy share a drink of scotch which they steal from Chekov's locker. Brilliant.If you're someone who compares the Kelvin timeline (AKA The Abramsverse) Star Trek movies with the original Star Trek series then you are probably going to notice they're quite different. They're a faster-paced, more action-packed Star Trek than you might be used to but that doesn't mean they aren't a whole lot of fun. Star Trek Beyond goes, well, beyond that fun and adds some genuinely heartfelt moments and not only would I recommend this movie to anyone but I also look forward to our next journey on the Enterprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful 50th Anniversary Star Trek Movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a life-long trek fan, I really appreciated the effort here. This very easily could have resulted in "pew-pew" only story with cheap fan-boy trek crap thrown in like we got in STiD. We didn't get that. I didn't leave the theater feeling like I had just got gut-punched as I did after watching STiD.Loved the opening scene (funny). Loved Kirk's monologue. We get to see the most beautiful, most scientifically accurate, presentation of a star ship traveling at warp I've ever seen. Right up there with the black hole depiction in 'Interstellar"!Kirk and Bones meet and have a few drinks, speaking of birthdays. Nice little nod to previous trek movies speaking of "old-age" etc. Their toast to "good eyes and a full head of hair" was also nice. (see STiD, this is how a little homage is done)The space station Yorktown a sight to see - BEAUTIFUL! The most bad ass detailed space station I can remember in SCI-FI, let alone Trek. Uhura and Spock break up! (yes!)We then see Kirk speaking with Commodore Paris played by Shohreh Aghdashloo. I think she has a great screen presence (and unique voice). We learn that Kirk is seriously considering leaving the Enterprise. While on Yorktown we see Sulu meet up with his husband and daughter. I sided with Mr. Takei and thought this change was a bad choice and not needed nor desired, but I have to say - it was done perfectly. They showed the relationship and appropriately didn't make a big deal out of. Nicely done. Then Spock is informed that Spock (prime) has passed away. I actually felt for our new Spock. Just how the hell would I feel knowing that an older version of me, that I met, had passed away? (a legendary one at that) Off to save Kalara's stranded crew. More amazing visuals as the Enterprise navigates the densest asteroid gathering in history albeit inside a nebula. I personally think a few of these scenes were too dark and I really wish they would put away the shaky camera. So hard to follow the action. It's already "fast and furious" enough Justin; the additional shaky cam was NOT necessary. The battle ensues with the swarm of ships. 1701 is getting the crap kicked out of it to the point of the nacelles falling off! We learn Krall is not just on board for the Abronath, he wants the crew as well! The Kelvin pods are pretty nifty? they change the uniform of all the officers that use them. Not sure I like the "away" uniforms, but they aren't all that bad. We get saucer separation and a crash landing on the planet with all that's left of the Enterprise. Visually epic.Our crew ends up divided into very interesting pairs. Bones &amp; Spock, Kirk &amp; Chekov, Scotty &amp; Jayla and Uhura &amp; Sulu. Great decision by the writers here. I think the best part of this movie is all the character moments we get because of this and how all of them work together. The entire ensemble is involved, not primarily Kirk-Spock centric as we saw in the last 2 movies. We learn that Spock is considering leaving Enterprise to serve his race in lieu of Spock (prime)'s death. The crew is being held in a camp and will be used as food for Krall who is using ancient technology to stay alive. Jayla is an awesome character and her "home" ends up being the USS Franklin (NCC-326). They all end up there and collectively figure out how to locate the crew using an amulet Spock gave Uhura. They can only beam 20 over the crew out at a time so they need a plan/diversion. The plan is set and Kirk gets to use the conveniently included motorcycle. I am thinking this is going to be pretty bad, but it doesn't turn out that way. Kirk uses the motorcycle and Jayla's holo-gadget thingy and it was is done pretty well. The rescue is orchestrated nicely and works IMO.Uhura's effort to warn the Yorktown was subverted by Krall so all their space ships are heading to the wrong point in space. Our crew figures out that a VHF signal will disrupt the swarm and of course - enter the Beasty Boys. At this point I'm ready for a huge let down. I just am not confident this will come off well and bracing myself for the worst. But I have to say I found myself smiling and enjoying the Franklin flying around to 'Sabotage'. Not bad, I was surprisingly pleased with how it all worked together. Kirk &amp; CO figure out Krall's plan and are off to stop him. The Franklin navigates the interior of the Yorktown and stops the invading ships. Quite exciting and enjoyable watching it all. The backstories for Krall and Jayla were cut from the final product. I don't think Krall's reasoning for revenge was bad, just not presented very well.Kirk is again conversing with Commodore Paris. She thanks him and Kirk says "it wasn't just me, never was". Kirk turns down the ADM position to stay with his crew and the Enterprise. Loved it; Kirk's maturation is complete. Then Spock is going through some of Spock (prime)'s trinkets. He opens a case we see a picture of the old Enterprise crew. Very emotional scene. Spock then realizes his place is on Enterprise as well.Could I have written a scathing review of this movie? Certainly. It is not without fault, but I truly do think that Pegg, Dung and Linn had their hearts in the right place and gave us a pretty damn good Star Trek movie for our 50th year celebration. I feel relieved. I left the theater wanting more from these guys. I can't say the same when I left the theater after STiD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an Asian man who is living with my partner, I am proud that the people who made this Star-Trek movie made the effort to include a brief scene with a two-male couple. They even showed the couple with a child, which was truly beautiful. Star Trek has always represented the best elements of Western society. The way of the future is tolerance and open-mindedness. NO religious people allowed! We are going warp-speed ahead into butt-hurt territory. I am positive that in the future the butt will contain ovaries that will be able to form babies. We will find a way!In the movie we see Kirk smiling at the couple. He must prefer both types, if you know what I mean. What a wonderful, progressive change to this classic character! I think Spock will find a partner as well, now that Uhurah is no longer his girlfriend. Warp speed a-head (male head!)Female Admiral - check. Brown Admiral - check. Two-man couple - check. No religion - check. Excellent!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where do I begin? As a lifelong Star Trek fan I had an uneasy feeling while watching this movie. I could not shake the sense that I was just looking at another mediocre summer popcorn flick; an experience that would evaporate from my brain just hours after I leave the theater.I remember sitting in the cinema with my head low embarrassed by the movie, although I wanted it to prove me wrong ever since I saw the "Beastie Boys" trailer back in 2015. Instead, it dragged along with that "proven" Hollywood formula of what a summer hit should look like. Constricted by its own creative limitations I was looking at a product that was not a science fiction in its core, but a creation that had only one intention since its birth: to milk as much money as possible.Star Trek Beyond was so devoid of the primordial concepts set up by Mr. Gene Roddenberry that it contributed to the confused identity of the picture. The plot of the movie is so "light" in its essence that it lacks the moral dilemmas, the exploration (inner and outer) and the development usually present in the Star Trek universe. There was neither message nor any character evolution and we did not learn more about anything really. Instead of Kirk, Spock and Scotty you could stick just any name over the protagonists and nobody would have noticed. The story was atrocious and full with plot holes patched up by unnecessary although flashy looking CGI. Star Trek Beyond also has one of the weakest villains in its history. It was definitely not the actors fault and such a shame to waste the opportunity of having a strong artist like Idris Elba. It was the fault of the writer and the director who missed the opportunity to take Star Trek back on its track. Instead they created a cute flick full with needless CGI scenes, explosions and dialogue written for "dumb" audiences. Everything had to be explained to the viewers, nothing was left to the imagination. There was nothing to debate with your friends after the movie or something to stir your imagination or to push you to prod its meaning. Nothing like that at all, everything was given on a run-of-the-mill plate for the audience to consume in a shortest possible time frame.The movie had its moments, so not everything was complete rubbish. I liked the character of Jaylah and some of the humor, but that was it. Some of the scenes were of course visually impressive though sometimes things would fly around too much and contaminate the image. Of course this movie was done by people, who know their job, but I am not pondering the execution and the skill of the artists, I am merely concerned about the soul of this thing we love so much. This thing we used to know of as Star Trek.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a Star trek fan, I'm a sci-fi fan. There's a difference. Loved the first, disappointed with the second, then this. I don't know why early reviews are so positive, but anyway, it's my view. Been so long since a movie of this genre has been the complete package, story, acting, directing, CGI, etc. This movie does nothing to address that. I got bored 2/3 way in, wanting it to end. So many plot holes, just so many. Go see it, but don't have great expectations. It was nice to look at, but that's all. The bad guy started out being very good (at being bad I mean). Opening was OK, nice special effects, just no credibility. And way too much shaky camera, way to much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For my money, the new star trek reboot, give to modern audience's the same feelings as the original films did for there generations. As painstakingly explained, this is not time line continuation but new exploration of what a star trek future could be. As for star trek beyond, in my opinion this is what it does. A few good nods to the previous franchise but an entirely good science fiction film in its own right.Story wise, the characters have great interactions as expected, some great one liners and beautiful costumes. For atmosphere, the music is well used, and again, consistently nods to previous films. Colours are fantastic throughout, but that is to be expected with modern film and projection. Star trek Beyond, stretches boundaries and looks like a future I would like to explore more of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tries to be more "Star Trek"-ish then previous reboot films, but turn actually less so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being less "Star Trek"-ish isn't bad per se. What's wrong with this (motion) picture is that it fails in trying the exact opposite.This feels like your "regular blockbuster" within Star Trek (reboot) universe. It's interesting because things keep happening, thus it keeps your attention, the time passes by quickly. But, at the end, you don't feel much, if anything. Nothing really interesting actually happened.It's somewhat unfortunate. It starts of good. There a few funny lines/situations. The story is Star Trek-ish, yet a little different. But, about the time that the rebooted JT Kirk mutters that his "life feels episodic", it starts to feel forced. Everything. The story, the visuals, the "funny". Take "gay Sulu", for example. Sulu's sexual orientation has no bearing on this story what so ever. So, the only reason to show it is to be able to say "we're good with LGBT". Thus, it's forced, plain and simple.All of it screams "we want to make a blockbuster". But, that shouldn't be the point, really. They should be wanting to make a good movie. If it were really good, given the extent of Star Trek fandom, you can bet it would have been a blockbuster.So, what we have gotten is watchable, but, oh-so-forgettable. Let me put it this way: for all it's many flaws, I actually prefer "Into Darkness" to this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This ain't your daddy's Star Trek (and the 3D is so unnecessary that it is NOT worth the extra cost):(1) The plot is close to incomprehensible (2) The directing is mediocre (okay, that is a characteristic in common with the original series) (3) The audience manipulation is palpable (4) The action is overblown (5) And did I mention the plot is close to incomprehensible?Don't get me wrong. The film is generally fun. But it lacked the heart and soul present in all five television series (ain't counting no cartoons). The "Spock Prime" character is about as confusing as it gets. And while the homages to Leonard Nimoy were touching, they were a bit heavy handed.But worst of all was the loss of any subtlety and heart. This reboot increasing seems to be solely about the money.And the negative reaction to Zulu being gay -- which was handled with taste and, unlike the rest of the film, subtlety -- was just plain crazy. I would think that fans would have been a lot more upset about the Uhura-Spock romantic relationship given the nature of Vulcans, even half-human, half-Vulcan ones -- now that's moving away from the Roddenberry playbook far more than making Zulu gay.All in all, Star Trek Beyond is a pleasant, but not very satisfying addition to the Star Trek compendium.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess in this day and age, we expect things in trilogies--or serials at least. But Star Trek Beyond isn't that. There isn't a lot of story tie-ins from the previous two films. It's just the same crew--albeit a little more mature and a little wiser--on a brand new mission.And as much as part of me wishes that it was like all the other blockbuster franchises these days, I can appreciate the solidarity.Chris Pine looks like he fits the Captain Kirk mold better than ever as he's debating whether or not he should leave the Enterprise and take a promotion as Vice Admiral--meaning he would be permanently grounded.The first 30 minutes are fairly slow, as the film is catching us up with these characters, bringing us to the point where they want us to be.Then, all of a sudden, the Enterprise ship is ambushed and all but destroyed, killing much of the crew and leaving the rest stranded on some Earth-like planet run by Krall--who's out to seek revenge on the Federation for unknown reasons.They actually happen to be very good reasons, but we don't know them until almost the end of the film. Up until that point, Krall just seems like another generic bad guy with unclear motives--which can come off as convoluted, and even frustrating at times.But once the ending hits, you realize what's happening and acknowledge to yourself that it was worth the journey. Even if it's perhaps because you want it to have been.The franchise is no longer directed by J.J. Abrams, but he's still signed on as producer. Instead, it's directed by Justin Lin--known for many Fast and Furious films. And Beyond has him written all over it. Just the increase in shaky-cam alone.But I really enjoyed the film. It's not as well-organized as Abrams' previous 2 installments, but it's fun and intriguing and has you on the edge of your seat. I'm excited to see what's next.Twizard Rating: 91</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nearly perfect film that transcended the last one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Trek: Beyond is film full of actions, excitements, and emotions, leading the audience to another adventure with the USS Enterprise and the crew we are familiar with. Overall, director Justin Lin has done a great job making Star Trek: Beyond into another sci-fy classic and successfully not turning this film into Star and Furious.Characters are the most important elements that made up this film. Kirk, unlike the previous two movies being impulsive and reckless, has turned into a captain that is rational, full of wit, and willing to take risk when it's needed. Bones and Scotty are the ones that bring up all the fun in the film. Scotty had continued his clumsiness and not-so-funny jokes and constantly bringing up brilliant ideas. Bones, as usual, keeps all his complains and the classic "I am a doctor, not a ?" which is always brilliant. I personally really enjoy the combination of Spock and Bones. This is combination works really well on the screen and you can feel the chemistry between these two characters, and I really appreciate that they gave the doctor more shots in this film compare to the previous two as he is one of my favourite characters/ actors. It is really nice, and sad, to see Anton appears on the silver screen for one last time. He maintained his brilliant acting in the new Star Trek film, confident as always. I personally appreciate the idea that JJ Abraham doesn't have the plan to find any actor to replace him.The introduction of new characters has brought a fresh stream into the film. Jaylah is a really strong, tough, and full of energy character. Her presence had made quite an impression. However, to me sometimes she just seems too "convenient" in order for the story to move on. It's she being a little bit too easy to convince? Aren't she supposed to struggle more when asking about her past? Also about the villain, Krall, in the film he didn't show much about his personality, about who he really was. All we know about he was that he wanted revenge on Starfleet. At the 2/3 of the film it revealed that Krall was the captain of the damaged star ship USS Franklin from the record video on the ship. Isn't that just a bit TOO convenient? I personally prefer the villains in the previous two films.The action scenes in the film were well conducted by Justin Lin. The experience of directing fast and furious had brought in the sense of speed and excitement. Although not an action scene, I really enjoy when the camera focus on the engines of USS Enterprise. The all scene of the engines started and the Enterprise took up. Bam! It was awesome. Unfortunately the great actions came along with too many shaky shots (which were in the furious films as well) and gave me a hard time of trying to understand what happened. And in the scene that Kirk tried to catch Jaylah so that Scotty can beam them up to Franklin, that was exactly Fast and Furious. I hold nothing against of the way to portray, but it just feels like it should stay in Furious, not in a Star Trek.The emotion scenes were also well carried out as well. My friend had complained that there were less talking ("sharing feeling") scenes in the film, but I found it just at the right place, doesn't need more or less. They all successfully conveyed the points, and the feeling brought to the audience continued as the film went on. The story gave a really nice ending for Spock prime and for Leonard Niomy, as we will remember the marvellous acting and contribution made in these years. The soundtrack is totally awesome, even better than Star Trek Into Darkness. Those tracks brought up the flavour of the whole film. I really enjoy the scene that were giving a whole shot for Yorktown, and with the soundtrack "Night on the Yorktown", that was just awesome. And about the controversial "Sabotage" by Bestie Boys, the use of the track kinda worried me in the first trailer, but it certainly hit a big "Bang!" in the film and stimulated all the excitement and intensity. The song also featured in the Star Trek (2009) film, so it was a great reference and genius used in Star Trek: Beyond.And by the way, anybody gives a round of applause of the designers working on the costume! The jackets worn by Kirk and Chekov were brilliant and I want one myself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Trek Beyond is a great addition to the star Trek series! i'm so happy to have seen watched this new addition of the Star Trek Franchise. Justin Lin has made this 3rd adaption very character-centric and also a film where this is more so Captain Kirks film!Chris Pine gives a great performance in this 3rd adaption. Kirk is struggling to know who he is, What it means to be his fathers son and to be Captain James T. Kirk.This film really gives you a sense of Star Trek and the community of other civilizations, there seemed to be more alien type characters involved in the film. All the main characters had their own screen time and had something to add that was important to the story.Spock's relationship with Nyota was great to learn more about and a good laugh at the same time, which those who've seen the film will understand.Krall acted by Idris Elba was near perfect but I would of preferred him to have had more screen time! Idris Elba is an actor who can make you aware of his presence. He felt slightly held back in this film. I think more definitely could of been done with Krall and I would of loved to have seen more of his back story.Plus I felt for just a moment Krall had an almost Darth Vader presence but then was held back a while in the film, that unfortunately disappeared for a while.If more risks were given, the film could of been an entertaining 3-hours long! Overall the time that was given is still a highly entertaining blockbuster for this summer!It was incredibly sad watching the film and watching Anton Yelchin act his scenes in the film. He was extremely talented and you can see that his character was only just evolving. I've always agreed that music is 50% of a film and in these recent Star Trek films that has been exactly right! The music is fun and exhilarating and kept you on the edge of your seat! Especially near the end. (Realism isn't fully correct in these films) But the ending battle is extremely fun! I started tapping my foot along with the characters in the film.Moving on from the JJ Abrams edition of Star Trek, it was maybe slightly worrying for some on how this new film would be. With the proved track record of Justin lin I was hopeful that he could keep the same entertainment with characters as he did in the Fast and Furious films. What he did though was develop the characters more and flesh them out and what we have is a film which is based on family, the unity that is Star trek!Go and enjoy Star Trek Beyond on its 50th anniversary. You will not regret it!Plus an extra note - Scotty said Lassie so many times in this film!</fullReview>

Yet I was amazed at the quality of the new Star Trek movie.I thought the scenario, the dialogue and the directing was extremely well done and felt natural.I like that it was finally a Star Trek that takes its time at the beginning to introduce itself. This IS Star Trek. It is a huge step forward in comparison to the 2 previous ones.The visuals are completely outstanding. I really liked that you had the time to appreciate it.My only negative point is that the ending was predictable. It would have been a masterpiece of cinema in my opinion is in the last 30 minutes they would have been able to turn the story upside down. However, the action was really good.A must see at the cinema, if you're wondering if you should wait to see it in bluray, don't. Just go see it now and get a good seat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edge of your seat action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been looking forward to the film coming out since they announced that there would be a third Star Trek movie. I was a bit nervous that the film wouldn't be as good when I heard that JJ Abrams would not be directing it and Justin Lin was the new director but I was happy to see that the film personally to me was as good as the other two movies.The plot of this film sees the crew having been in space for three years. Both Kirk and Spock are struggling with decisions that would see them both leave the Enterprise but they each don't know the other's feelings. The crew take shore leave but it is interrupted when an escape pod arrives with the occupant claiming that her ship is stranded on a planet. The Enterprise goes on a rescue mission but it is a trap and the Enterprise is attacked and destroyed by aliens commanded by Krall. The Enterprise crew are separated on a planet and there is mystery surrounding why Krall attacked and what his plans are with an artefact Kirk had obtained in a recent mission.The film was action packed and I felt myself on the edge of my seat as the film moved along. The special effects were still bang on and just as outstanding, just too many to mention. It was great to have the crew back but also sad when you saw Anton Yelchin in scenes knowing that he wouldn't be appearing in any new Star Trek films or any films at all. I also liked that they acknowledged Leonard Nimoy in the film as well.I did like that the villain was not someone that had been shown in the Star Trek world before and was completely new. Idris Elba was great as the villain but for awful moment towards the end to me, it appeared like he was about to do something good so I was relieved that my inclination was wrong and he maintained his villain status.Sofia Boutella as Jaylah is a new character introduced which I enjoyed watching and would like to see her in any future Star Trek films.I'm glad that for me I felt the third film lived up to the other film's promise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It puts most other Treks to shame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Put it bluntly, it's the movie that Nemesis should have been in terms of consistent action that still draws upon characterization, that remains true to Trek without using previous Treks like a crutch (the whole Trekish thing Simon Pegg talked about). It abandons the worn out Star Trek formula by drawing its strength on excellent writing that balances action, story, humour and character, but remains true to the core or the soul of Star Trek.Everyone, even the newcomers, did an exceptional job in their own regard while allowing themselves to grow on their own while still being true to the original series characters. The new feel gives it the old Star Trek vibe that allows the new generation to appreciate, while at the same time allows you to move with the heroes while you uncover the mystery of the villains such as Krall.Though numerous spoiler free hints to previous Treks, they don't infringe upon the story, nor do they take it over and without pushing it right into your face that this is Star Trek.One of the finest pieces of art I have ever seen, it keeps you on the edge of your seat, walk with people like Kirk and Spock, Trek at its excellence that is only overshadowed by "Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan" itself.One of the best movies this year, one of the best Star Trek movies of all time, give Star Trek Beyond 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a summer where mediocre movies are flying in from every angle, it is refreshing to see that 'Star Trek Beyond' is still as buoyant and engaging as the Trek films that came prior. Marking Star Trek's 50th anniversary with style, 'Beyond' explodes onto the big screen with just as much confidence as JJ Abrams' hugely successful reboot back in 2009. It lags slightly in terms of a firmly driven plot, nonetheless it amounts to the captivation that the Star Trek franchise so proudly embodies, making this possibly the most well-rounded and generally gratifying blockbuster movie of the holiday period.'Beyond' adjusts to the significant shift in creative forces behind the scenes well, this time written by Scotty himself, Simon Pegg, and Doug Jung, and helmed by 'Fast and Furious 6' director Justin Lin after Abrams committed to revitalising the Star Wars universe and Robert Orci, who penned the earlier instalments, dropped out of the running for directing and his script rewritten by the aforementioned pair. Abrams' constant use of lens flares are not deeply missed, and nor is his influence behind the camera overall, as 'Beyond' sustains the momentum of the preceding films fantastically and there is no noticeable change in tone or structure that these sorts of films may experience with fresh directors and creative teams (a la Batman Forever). In spite of the fact that the stakes couldn't have been higher for the filmmakers (having to triumphantly commend Star Trek's 50th anniversary is no easy task with such a passionate and devoted fan base), 'Beyond' maintains a calm and collected image; it knows what it needed to do, and it knows that it has achieved its goal prosperously (reference intended), thus it reeks of conviction and positivity, giving the viewer a great deal to be enthralled by.The adventures of Kirk and co. are now in full swing, with 2 films already under the belt for the cast, and years having gone by in Trek time since we last caught up with the crew, or 966 days to be precise. This is evident throughout the feature as every individual illustrates heaps of assurance when on screen, and it is clear that the primary cast are extremely comfortable in each other's presence, subsequently the chemistry is forceful and impacts the eventual end product marvellously. How the team will be able to proceed after the tragic passing of Anton Yelchin remains to be seen, and in relation to this, acknowledgements of the late Leonard Nimoy's contribution to the Star Trek universe are prolific and respectful. All round the acting is top notch, with each performance being believable and intriguing. Sofia Boutella is arguably one of the best things about this movie, playing an enticing original character named Jaylah, who is a fantastic new addition to the Star Trek universe, implementing a new female hero into the series that will hopefully continue to play a worthy role in future films. Idris Elba provides us with another intimidating execution as the film's antagonist; his character, Krall, is explored sufficiently to be able to grasp the motives behind his schemes and furthermore it can be said that the villain is not just one more under-developed mindless bad guy as has been seen regularly in recent blockbusters, which certainly is a strength that the Star Trek series has managed to preserve throughout the trilogy. However, the end game that Krall's eventual plan contrives is fairly generic and is rather reminiscent of Khan's in the preceding movie, suggesting that a new approach will be required in future chapters to keep the originality of the Star Trek universe in place.Despite having said earlier that the stakes behind the scenes could not have been higher, in the film itself the gravity of the story did not compare to that of 'Star Trek' or 'Into Darkness'. It's not weak, but it's not superb, though in the grand scheme of things, it works well enough in serving as a marker of Star Trek's great success in this prestigious year for the series. The script is coherent, witty, well formulated and gives each character a chance to stand alone and prove to be a worthy member of Starfleet, less so for Krall's crew, but there isn't much that can be said about these characters that would have truly driven the plot further. It does lack integrity in places and an overall better story, but it is solid enough to be recognised as yet another sound entry into the Star Trek series.'Star Trek Beyond' is a lively and pleasing motion picture in a time where alternatives are flimsy. It stands out as one of the strongest films of the summer, a noteworthy addition to the already esteemed continuity of films, boldly going forward with tremendous energy and promising further instalments of the Star Trek franchise to be just as entertaining and joyful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Star Trek Beyond" Is A Blast!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fast and Furious" director Justin Lin never lets the momentum slacken in "Star Trek Beyond" despite the formulaic Simon Pegg &amp; Doug Jung screenplay that delivers a lot of the right stuff during its warp-drive running time of two hours and two minutes. A multitude of melodramatic moments with surprises and suspense galore ensue as Captain James T. Kirk and the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise triumph over tragedy. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Zoe Saldana, John Cho, Simon Pegg, and the late Anton Yelchin must have had fun making the 13th "Star Trek" saga because they work so well together that it doesn't matter what they're doing. Basically, the "Beyond" in the title refers to the uncharted territory that our indestructible heroes and heroine must negotiate before they can vanquish a megalomaniacal villain and preserve the status quo. Mind you, I didn't fear that Kirk, Spock, Bones, Uhura, Sulu, Scotty, and Chekov would die and that their wicked adversaries would perish. What I liked about "Star Trek Beyond" was the way everybody in the crew contributed to the ultimate success of their mission. None of the main cast were neglected or given the short shrift. One character has been altered. Aside from generating controversy on the Internet about Mr. Sulu's sexual proclivities, the rest of the Enterprise crew remains essentially the same, and you care as much about them as what occurs around them. Similarly, the giddy action unfolding in "Star Trek Beyond" was sufficient to race your pulse, whiten your knuckles, and get caught up in this spectacular epic. Cinematographer Stephen F. Windon, production designer Tom Sanders and make-up designer Joel Harlow all deserve kudos for their outstanding work. Two settings?the Nebula and the Yorktown space colony?looked sensational by any science fiction movie's standards. As villains rate, the reptile-faced Krall provides more than enough obstacles with which Kirk and his crew must contend, and Krall's unhinged plan to wreak havoc is sufficiently audacious. Nevertheless, Krall isn't half as memorable as Benedict Cumberbatch's Khan in director J.J. Abrams' superior sequel "Star Trek Into Darkness." Three years into the Enterprise's five year mission, Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine of "Unstoppable") complains that "things have started to feel a little episodic." When an action-oriented character utters these words, they should cross themselves immediately and hold their tongues. No sooner has the Enterprise docked at the remarkable new star base christened Yorktown to gather provisions than Kirk winds up eating those fateful words. Three important events occur before chaos assails the Enterprise. First, Spock and Uhura break up. Second, Mr. Sulu comes out as gay. Third, Kirk submits an application for promotion to Vice Admiral, and he recommends Mr. Spock replace him as the Enterprise's captain. Complications take place when an escape pod lands at Yorktown. Its alien passenger, Kalara (Lydia Wilson of "About Time"), reports that her ship has crashed on the distant planet Altamid in the Nebula. The Nebula resembles a vast, impenetrable field of asteroids that constitutes a titanic barrier between Yorktown and Altamid. Commodore Paris (Oscar-nominated actress Shohreh Aghdashloo of "House of Sand and Fog") accommodates Kalara and mounts a distress mission to rescue Kalara's stranded crew. Kirk takes the helm and the Enterprise plunges into the Nebula, with Kalara--looking like she has a starfish wrapped around her head for a wig--aboard to show them the way. Predictably, Kalara turns into one treacherous dame as our heroes discover soon after a massive swarm of alien spacecraft reminiscent of those Earth faced in "Independence Day: Resurgence" attack them with deadly repercussions. Surprisingly enough, Krall and his legions cripple the Enterprise in record time. The doomed starship topples from space, and the crew find themselves separated after the crash. Scotty encounters a resourceful Amazon named Jaylah (Sofia Boutella of "Kingsman: The Secret Service") who knows a thing or two about survival. Boutella's face is made up to resemble a Kabuki mask and her appearance evoked memories of Darth Maul in the "Star Wars" prequels. Jaylah has been hiding out on Altamid, and her chief adversary is Krall. She teams up with Scotty, Kirk, and Bones, while the rest of the crew wind up in Krall's hands. Krall wants an artifact stashed aboard the Enterprise so he can perpetuate an apocalypse. He has no qualms about who he has to liquidate if he isn't given that artifact. Uhura watches in horror as Krall murders a helpless Enterprise crew member who poses no threat to him.Once Krall has thrown down the gauntlet, Kirk and company must pull off the impossible to thwart their fanatic adversary. In many ways, "Star Trek Beyond" reminded me of a traditional Cavalry versus Indians western. Our heroes arrive at a frontier fort, embark on a rescue mission, find themselves isolated during a journey of hardship, and encounter a do-or-die opponent whose primary goal is to destroy the fort with everybody inside it. "Star Trek Beyond" boots Kirk and company out of their comfort zone, forcing them to abandon ship, and then compels them to overhaul an older starship considerably inferior to the Enterprise, when they aren't raiding Krall's camp to liberate their fellow crew members. Naturally, Kirk must confront Krall in a death-defying face-off while the welfare of civilization teeters on the brink. Happily, director Justin Lin and his scenarists provide enough humor to sweeten all this mayhem and the eccentricities of the characters allow audiences a chance to chuckle at their foibles. Of course, Spock and Bones grate on each other's nerves. This installment of the venerable Paramount Pictures franchise marks the 50th anniversary of all things "Star Trek." Visionary producer Gene Roddenberry launched the "Star Trek" television series 50 years ago, and this captivating franchise has generated 13 films and six TV series, sold over 100 million books, comics, and magazines. If you're a hardcore "Star Trek" fan, you'll probably relish this roller-coaster of a ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great sci-fi and great Star Trek movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loved this film. It did much better at re-creating the feel of the original TV series. Light and full of humour at times. Visiting alien worlds and also great action. I like that they focus more on the whole crew this time and we get great interplay between these beloved characters. Really clever script well co-written by Simon Pegg. The action is also fantastic and overall it has everything a Star Trek movie should have in my opinion. The only weak parts I would say is the villain and the way his past is revealed seemed a bit forced and kind of confusing but Idris Elba did the best with what he was given. All in all this was definitely better that Into Darknes (which I still enjoyed) and about on par with the first Star Trek with this rebooted generation. Looking forward to seeing what they do with part 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the current re-boots so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm relieved that this movie doesn't follow the thread of the originals (with Shatner et al). While the second movies both had Khan as the main protagonist this movie goes its own way. This is good because Search for Spock was a stinker. I'm also pleased that they haven't rushed out a movie every two years. They did that with the first series of films and every other one was a turkey.Simon Pegg (co writer) gives his character a larger part than Scottie ever had before. Also not surprisingly he injects more comedy into it, but not in a bad way and this isn't one of the 'funny' stories that we used to get with the TV series.So that means this is good? Yes this is very good. The poor old Enterprise gets beaten up (again) and another despot reveals his despicable plans to make war on the universe. Our heroes are of course on the case.Good humour and proper "trekie" action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 3rd and best installment in the rebooted Star Trek franchise packs one hell of a punch and tons of heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2009 JJ Abrams brought Star Trek back from the dead and introduced it to modern audiences by making it more action orientated while maintaining some of what made the series loved by its rabid fan base, and even though I've liked his previous 2 films, Star Trek: Beyond is in my opinion far and away the best installment in the franchise, it successfully blends action with great character work and smart writing, you can tell the people behind this film are very passionate about what they're doing, not only is Simon Pegg once again playing Montgomery Scotty ;)but he also shares writing duties with Doug Jung, you can tell he has such a loving and understanding of this universe, the combination of his love for the series and Lin's steady hand behind the camera really makes this film click on so many cylinders, it's definitely not Fast &amp; Furious in space, it's a smart, heartfelt blockbuster and those are the best type of blockbusters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By far the best Star Trek movie so far and the best movie of the summer. Better than Wrath of Khan or First Contact and definitely the best in the rebooted series. Not a boring minute in the entire movie, paced extremely well for sure. The starbase was absolutely amazing to see (your jaw will drop). The entire movie was just beautiful to look at. Tons of alien races to see as well as building on the interpersonal relationships of the crew. People are still complaining they want the old Star Trek back and this is as close as you can come. It deals with the crew as they are well into their mission to explore the vastness of space. The movies have to be more exciting than the T.V. episodes were or people would lose interest, and this movie absolutely delivers. I saw a few complaints about the movie being too dark or too much happening, making it hard to follow. I really only thought one scene was too dark to clearly see what was going on one. Great to see Anton Yelchin and so sad that he passed away before this latest installment was released. He did an amazing job as Chekov as well as most of the other roles he took on. They did such an amazing job with the casting choice for every character in the reboot. I read the next Trek movie already has the green light but they will not be recasting the role of Ckekov. I created an IMDb account just to be able to give my opinion on this great sci-fi movie. If you're a fan of science fiction, you should really enjoy this movie. If you're a fan of Star Trek, you need to go and see it on the big screen for sure. I will absolutely be seeing this movie in the theatre again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely entertaining, a fine new Trek</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am giving this a nine because its probably one of the very few movies I have watched lately that I would like to see again. As new trek movies go this one is certainly a highlight. All the effects, sets, etc are absolutely first rate. The story is better than most, and it helps that it sets a very fast pace. There is always something interesting happening in this film. I cant see how any Star Trek fan would be disappointed. My only gripe is the new Spock. Somehow, he doesn't seem quite right but after Nimoy's epic portrayals Im not sure anyone who follows will fit the bill. However, I really like the Tuvok character from the Voyager series. Actually I would prefer him right now. Anyhow, its all minor whining on my part. Its a truly great movie, a real epic and the alien girl was a super nice addition. Uhura was great too, she really got to kick some butt. Pine makes an awesome kirk too...he really has claimed the role as his. Its a must see....much much better than all that pretentious "trust the force" drudge people love so dearly. Live Long and Prosper fools!!!</fullReview>

Each character was well played and entertaining. The visuals were outstanding - did not see it in 3D, (nor do I think I would want to) the action was very busy and just think that some would be lost in 3D...

		<fullReview>I watched the first broadcast of Star Trek TOS (The Original Series) in 1966 and have seen every TV series, sat through endless late-night reruns, and watched every movie (even the odd ones). "Star Trek Beyond" is as faithful to TOS as anything that's followed while adding great texture and depth to Roddenberry's vision. Hats off to Simon Pegg and Doug Jung who wrote the script and to director Justin Lin for recreating that original ethos. It brought tears to my eyes. Also hats off to Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, and Keith Urban for channeling the Kirk, Spock, and Bones trio while adding their own very special flavors to the mix. If you like your Star Trek straight and undiluted by some of the concepts that the Federation has accreted over the past half century, then "Star Trek Beyond" is your film. Please guys, make another real soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Movie That Captured the Themes of Trek Extremely Well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What you are about to read contains spoilers, go back if you do not want to see them. What can I say? This movie was spectacular. From the beginning to the end, it captured what makes Trek truly special. Not only did the movie explore diplomacy and cultural relations with other species on other planets, but it also explored the future and the past of humanity, which is ultimately what Star Trek is about. Gene Roddenberry created a Wagon Train-style Space Cowboy series to hide the real intent of his masterpiece: exploring what it truly means to be human and what issues we face, whether they may be related to war or discrimination or whatever else. You want to know what really sealed the deal for me though? The accurate source material. By God, Simon Pegg and Doug Jung created the perfect screenplay that followed the source material of all of the series, but mainly Enterprise. Now, I may have some bias here considering that Enterprise is my favorite Trek series (because of the premise of the youth of human exploration) but it truly was amazing how accurate it was. They had accurate weapons (spatial torpedoes and pulse phase cannons), accurate clothing on the video footage, they showed a shuttle pod in the video footage from the show, the cargo looked the same, it was a WARP 3 SHIP which actually fit the era! The icing on the cake here besides the accurate sourcing was the legitimate villain. I thought throughout the whole movie that it was just some random alien dude and I was a little disappointed, but HE TURNED OUT TO BE THE CAPTAIN OF THE USS FRANKLIN!!! That twist was amazing and I must say that I did not see it coming. Great plot, great writing, accurate sourcing, and most of all...it actually FEELS LIKE STAR TREK!!! This movie is rate up there with First Contact for me. I can't wait to see what the frontier holds for the future of Trek, in the movies and on the small screen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More universal appeal - very good addition to the Trek franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first found out that Justin Lin was directing the next Star Trek I was very nervous; I was never a huge fan of F&amp;F.Choosing a franchise like Star Trek, with a very dedicated fan base was dangerous. I watched the series when I was growing up.What Lin does with Star Trek is actually quite refreshing. I think die hard Trek fans might find it a little too mainstream, but I think Star Trek needed to break into new markets, gain new audiences and this film certainly does that. I've read a few negative reviews on here asking for the old Star Trek...it's disappointing that for something so ahead of it's time some people prefer to be stuck in the past. This is EXACTLY what the franchise needed and will definitely attract more movie goers to future Star Trek films!With any space film CGI is usually impressive; with Beyond it's beautiful. Seeing it in IMAX brought all the colours to life. Everything flowed well and particularly during the first 20 minutes I was in awe.I like how the focus has moved from Kirk and Spock. There's a lot more of the other crew members in this film which was needed after the first two. I really John Cho and the late Anton Yelchin. On that, it'll be interesting to see what they do with Chekov, I don't think Anton will be replaced easily.Idris Elba is a good cast, although Krall isn't a memorable villain. His back story could have really been built on more but overall, he's a decent addition.What I think this film does is start to shake off the 'Trek is for geeks' branding that you get if you even say you've seen Star Trek. There's still references to original Star Trek work, but what I liked was that you didn't necessarily need to know the fine detail to get into it.With a 4th already approved I'd be interested to see where they go. We've had Romulans, Klingons and Krall. Kirk's back story is the talk of the next film. You never know, Resistance could be futile (oh god, I'm crossing my fingers to hear this in a couple of years!) Overall, i'd highly recommend Beyond. Just the right length, great cast and Lin has proved me wrong. Well done.</fullReview>

The aspect that I thought carried through all three films was the crew growing or maturing and finding out about themselves and their place in the grand scheme of things. We know how they turn out, but how did they get there? You wouldn't ever dream of James T. Kirk questioning his desire to be the Captain since we know the character further into his Starfleet career. But, I liked how the movie brought up that question. The events in the movie hammered home his 'purpose' if you will,and answered the question he himself was asking. I also appreciated the 'props' given to the original cast/crew. It didn't seem out-of-place or forced into the story. A small bit is all it was, but more than enough.</fullReview>

The team instantly fall back in to the groove with comradery and witty banter a plenty. Chris Pine, Zachery Quinto and Karl Urban were all awesome. I really enjoyed the part played by Sofia Boutella, keep an eye out for her character Jaylah, very cool. I also loved the score hitting some real highlights at the right times, Michael Giacchino is a legend. I also noticed lots of Easter eggs to keep all the Trekkie fans happy, as it did me.

		<fullReview>I saw this film today with my wife and be both enjoyed it. It is not a perfect film but it is a step in the right direction. It is the first film since the reboot that sort of had a feel like one of the original crew films. There was more humor in this film than the last film and it was a welcome addition. McCoy definitely gets more lines in this film and has some of the most humorous ones too. Some of the themes will remind avid fans of themes from earlier films with these characters (Both Kirk and pondering their future) but this film did not try to take old characters and plots from previous films like Into Darkness did and that is a good thing. This is film is well written and directed. Having never seen a Justin Lin movie I was not sure what to expect but I am pleased with how the film turned out. There are few actions scenes that go by so fast that it is had to keep up at times. We saw this film at a Regal Theater in their RPX format. We liked the visuals and the sound at this theater. My wife and I will see it again and would like to see it in IMAX but neither of us wants to see it in 3D so we'll have to see what our options are. I hope that the next film is released in 2018 but anticipate 2019 as more likely. There was typically just 2 years between the cast of TOS films but that was a different time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been going to the theater to see Star Trek movies since Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan came out in 1982. While this latest release does not capture the magic that The Wrath of Khan did, it is still good addition to the Star Trek series. My 32 year old son went with me and he felt it was a pretty good movie as well. Some scenes were a borderline rehashing of previous movies, like setting in which McCoy and Kirk sharing a drink for his birthday, there is still plenty of originality. We though the concept of how the alien attackers boarded the Enterprise was one such example. We also liked the character of Jaylah and pondered the possibility that she could become part of the next installment, they certainly paved the way for her return.I must admit though, months ago when I first learned that Simon Pegg was going to pen the script for this movie I was pretty skeptical, but after seeing it I give it two thumbs up. Sure it could have been better....but it could have been a whole lot worse too. We liked this movie and think that most other Trekkie's will too!</fullReview>

It is great to see, that Suluhas a husband and they have a little daughter. True family Star Trek way. Like it was originally back 60's with black woman as one of the leading actors, true pioneer of it's own era and today. Star Trek Beyond is once again it's own originality which can be proud proud of all the old Trekkies as well as newer audience. Yorktown has set stunningly, way we never have seen before on silver screen. Movie visuality combined with it's camera drive is simply breathtaking. Two hour roller coast ride. Gravity is used cleverly on set and the movies action and speed nails you to your seat. Script is imaginative and even funny. Movie achieve beautifully Star Trek originality. It is a great honor for fifty year old saga. Movies visuality is best in 3D and I saw it under Finnkino's SCAPE concept. Camera drive and 3D makes movie enjoyable to watch. I know that I am a Trekkie, but I am sure that even newer audience can enjoy of it's thrilled action packet. Star Trek Beyond is simply stunning space opera, which retain it's interest even after many watching. Hopefully we can enjoy many great Star Trek movies in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It is stronger than Into Darkness and I will even go as far as to say I feel Beyond is better than The Force Awakens (and I thoroughly enjoyed that too). There is a genuine warmth to this film, which manages to give us some great character moments, despite everything else that's going on. This is Kirk and crew with their backs against the wall in a manner that truly stretches them, and we see how hard they will fight for each other. We get nice little touches and references to other elements of the franchise, including a touching tribute to Leonard Nimoy and indeed, the entire original cast. We also get an insight into the weariness of the crew whilst on their long voyage.If there is a theme to this movie, a message to take away, then it's one of the importance of fighting for one's family. Everyone is prepared to risk it all for everyone else - and they prove that unity is indeed a strength. In these troubled times, that's a good message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Captain, sensors detect an unusually large amount of spoilers ahead. Advise we raise shields and proceed with caution** First and foremost let me start by thanking Screen Writers Simon Pegg and Doug Jung for breathing much needed life and adventure back into this rebooted series that it much desperately needed.I love Trek. Period. Always have always will. Trekkie til I die. So once the announcement was made that they were going to reboot the series I was angry. Sure Star Trek Insurrection and Nemesis weren't our finest hours, but this was Star Trek, you don't reboot an almost 50 year old property like Star Trek.Fast forward to 2009 and the reboot (or NUtrek if you're nasty) and it was great. The idea of an alternate time line worked because they could create the 'new' universe they wanted while still letting the prime time line continue wherever it was.Warp to Star Trek into Darkness, the moment we realized as a collective nerd hive that this new franchise that had so much promise was dead in the water on only its 'second' time out. The idea that they would take an episode and 2 movies, chop them up mix it together with some over the top action and call it a 'New' Star Trek adventure was insulting not to mention damn lazy.So once the trailers for Star Trek Beyond came out the first thing that I thought was, "this looks like crap" plain and simple. After being burned with Into darkness I was ready to give up on NUtrek and wait for the new TV series next year.But being the Trekkie I am, I couldn't stay away for long. Plus I needed something to take my mind off the Ghostbusters reboot. So I put on my Starfleet uniform and went.I am SO GLAD I DID.THIS is what Star Trek is all about. The crew in deep uncharted space with only themselves and the Enterprise as they explore the beyond. The interactions between the various crew members were there just like I remember, the sense of family was there just like I remembered. THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT! It was over 2 hours but it did not feel that way as you are instantly drawn into a new yet extremely familiar world that you don't mind spending time in.Pegg is a fan (not to mention plays Scotty in the films) so HE would know what the series needs. I've never really understood it, studios want these mythologies and episodic based reboots of TV shows to succeed so what do they do? They bring in non-fans and expect something fans would want to watch. Where's the logic in that? Bringing a fan in to write is the smart way to go, It worked with The force Awakens and it sure as hell worked here. The ratio of humor to action was well balanced, there was not a boring moment to be had and many literal laugh out loud moments by everyone in the theater.There were a few things that I thought of as I watched and I'd like to point them out it I may? 1-Spock and Bones. I cannot tell you how great it was to see them back up to their old back and forth with each other. Each time they came up on screen together I smiled.2-The Vice admiral job. They were going to let Kirk have it? The young and reckless one? You're telling me no one in Starfleet questioned this BEFORE he saved them all? 3-The youth/energy sucking thing. Krall crash landed on the planet, found this alien technology and thought 'If I hook someone up to the other end I bet I could suck their youth out'. Not my thing but hey, everyone needs a hobby I guess.4-Jaylah, she has been down there for who knows how long, escaped Kralls death camp, linking on her own in fear, she just encounters Scotty and after a few words to him trusts him enough to take him into her secret 'house'? Much less didn't talk to Kirk or Chekov and instantly sets them free and lets them into her 'house' too? If she's that trusting, how did she survive on her own that long? 5-I have had to say goodbye to as many Enterprises as I have Doctor Whos. You have to hand it to the old girl, no matter what universe or time line she's in she will always go out fighting.6-The Star Trek universe really loves the Beastie Boys7-Bones and Spock crash on the planet, Spock is injured so Bones heats up this pointy piece of metal to cauterize the wound. Once he's done he pulls the point away and it's gone. Did he leave the super-hot metal point inside the wound? Why didn't he use the weapon to seal the wound and bypass the metal to begin with? 8-Gay Sulu. It's just a few seconds and quite honestly really didn't add or take away from anything so I say more power to them. Also, Sulu husband is played by the script co-writer Doug Jung.9-The Old Spock scenes were well done. Once Spock learned of it it was sad, but the end when we see the picture of the classic cast, there was not a dry eye in the theater. Well played Star Trek, well played.I could go on but I'm out of words for this review.Cliff notes version: GO SEE STAR TREK BEYOND! This is Star Trek at its best, a shutout out to the glory days we thought were past us. Beyond shows us that this Trek is new and different but just as familiar as it ever was and that is extremely comforting in this day and age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite of the Three Rebooted Star Trek Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Star Trek Beyond last night, and it was definitely my favorite of the three rebooted Star Trek movies. The director really seemed to learn from the mistakes JJ Abrams made in the last two movies. The movie had no huge JJ plot holes, better character development (ironically, since that's what JJ does best), no annoying lens flares, and a great many callbacks to the original series (and a couple of excellent ones to Star Trek: Enterprise). I literally did both laugh and cry. I was struck even more than in the earlier movies by just how powerfully Karl Urban evokes the feeling of DeForest Kelly's original Doctor McCoy. I'd very much like to see it again. :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great pick for both story and director. JJ entrusted the right person to keep the franchise moving along at warp speed and even the most fanatical Trekie will be hard put to find fault. Not only did they advance this story time line, but they stayed true to Gene's vision! The weave of old and new, scientific and pop culture, interpersonal relations and individual motivations are all of what made the original Star Trek grab the public's attention. Acting was spot on, everyone once again prove the profession by transporting the audience into that world. The tribute to both Leonard and Anton was appreciated and example of the class act from the franchise. Happy 50th Birthday Star Trek, Live Long and Prosper !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Constantly funny, amazing final battle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's here, it's finally here. Star Trek Beyond is now in theaters, we can laugh and cry together my friends! LAUGH AND CRY! Why? Because Star Trek Beyond is great, perhaps even better than the first two movies.What I LikedFrom the beginning, Star Trek Beyond is a ride, it doesn't start with its usual action buuuuuuttttt it does have a bit of humor. One of my favorite parts of Star Trek Beyond was seeing other characters take on a larger role. Sulu, Uhura and Doctor Bones (my personal favorite!) all have their own part of the story. Their relationships change with the other characters and form something new and interesting. Bones has to deal with Spock, Sulu and Uhura have to work together. I loved seeing them play a bigger role :) The best thing about the Star Trek movie is the humor. It makes the movie so much better because they break intense action with a bit of comic relief. Bones is hilarious as usual with his negative attitude I love. You know a movie is good when it makes the movie theater burst into laughter for a few minutes than die down once the action begins. Star Trek Beyond was engrossing! Like I said in earlier reviews, Star Trek keeps upping the threat level of its bad guys. While this new one doesn't seem as threatening as Khan, he's still a pretty big problem. They have to put up a REAL fight to take this guy down and it costs them, tremendously. Rarely does it happen, but while watching Star Trek Beyond, I forgot I was watching a movie. It was weird, halfway through I blinked and realized I was in a movie theater. That's how swept away I was! The new character Jaylah is so cool, I like her a lot :) plus I ship her with a certain character *whistles innocently* THE FINAL BATTLE WAS SO EPIC, OH MY GOSH. I have to say it was one of the BEST battle scenes I have ever seen. Seriously, the music just killed it. The mood was so tense and it looked so beautiful, it was so well done. I'd love to see the movie again, not just for the humor, but for that battle. Honestly, it was amazing.What I Didn't Like There was only one problem I had with Star Trek Beyond, the villain... He was kind of hard to understand, sometimes I had NO idea what the heck he was saying. Not only that, but his motives seemed kind of random and out there. I'm not sure if that's just me, but I was a bit confused, it might have helped if I could understand him, it would have been nice if they had subtitles or made his voice clearer... Part of why his motives might have seemed weird to me might be because I couldn't understand him. Well, that's just another reason to see it again :DOverallI'm glad I saw Star Trek. It was constantly funny, had an amazing final battle and let some minor characters take on a bigger role. GO SEE IT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I LOVE STAR TREK! I also loved the movie! I often wonder why so many people go into these extended reviews as to why or why not they liked or did not like a film. Hey! I just want to be entertained for a few hours and that's about it. The truth is everyone is different and the reasons, notwithstanding, it's each person's individual tastes in film. I think the same about music. With that said, I've loved Star Trek since the late 60's and I love the new crew of the Enterprise. I love the interaction and bond between them and that is what pulls me back, time after time. So, just go to see it for the crew, the story and the fun!</fullReview>

Boring Plot.I don't know who directed or changed the flow on this movie, but they got it all wrong.. almost more of a comedy with weak action. How about the old Planet of the Apes? Even it was much better than this! They ruined the New Star Trek Flow with this mess.I am very surprised it is above a 7 star rating.. must be a new generation for comedy sci-fi.

		<shortDescription>Beam me up, Scotty! I like what I saw! Star Trek: Beyond was awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Space. The Final Frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before. While, this movie didn't go to where no man has gone before. It did entertain me. It's highly illogical to hate this third film in the "Kelvin Timeline" that began with 2009's 'Star Trek' reboot of the 1966's 'Star Trek: The Original Series'. You have to be out of your Vulcan mind, if you do. Directed by Justin Lin, and written by Simon Pegg &amp; Doug Jung, the film follows off, where director JJ Abrams 2013's film, 'Star Trek: Into Darkness', left off, with the Enterprise crew of Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine), Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto), Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy (Karl Urban), Chief Engineer, Montgomery "Scotty" Scott (Simon Pegg), Communication Officer, Nyota Uhura (Zoe Saldana), helmsman, Lt. Hikaru Sulu (John Cho) and Ensign Pavel Chekov (Anton Yelchin) going around the galaxy, to share their knowledge and resources in peaceful cooperation and space exploration. However, the people of one planet, Altamid, leaded by villain, Krall (Idris Elba) thinks otherwise, hoping to stranded the crew of the Enterprise, and take their revenge on the Federation for leaving them to die. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, I like that the film doesn't feel like an obviously retelling of an older Star Trek film like 'Into Darkness' was. However, its plot is nothing near original or fresh. They literally lifted some plot points from the 1987 to 1994 spin-off show, 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' Season 3 and 4, Episodes 26 and 1 "The Best of Both Worlds' &amp; Season 5, Episode 15 "Power Pray'. Other elements were also taken, from other spin-off shows, such as 'Star Trek: Deep Space Nine' (1993?99), 'Star Trek: Voyager' (1995?2001), and 'Star Trek: Enterprise' (2001?2005). However, the biggest influence to the plot, was from the non-Star Trek 1959's sci-fi movie 'Forbidden Planet' that somewhat mirrors this film in story and tone. I also love the movie themes about how peaceful &amp; comfort life makes us, weaker, rather than stronger. Indeed, I somewhat agree with the villain, Krall. A monotony episodic life is somewhat mundane, but it's everything human want in life: order. Yet, it's our animalistic hunger for conflict and competition that really put innovations and technology in motion. Without some problems or chaos, we do become weaker. This human dilemma also shows the huge different between the television shows and the movies, in which it is based on. In the show, conflict is solve in mostly through orderly peaceful terms. However, in the films, it's a little more warlike. The reason for this, is because most of the movies relies so much on visual action orientated ploy to carry the viewer's attention, while the cheaply made episodes relies on clever sophistical writing to get the hardcore fans to invent more into the stories. It's the reason, why the "Kelvin Timeline" &amp; the later TNG's movies were so controversial. It's so-unlike, the creator Gene Roddenberry's vision of nearly peaceful futuristic society with its gritty war-like themes. Yet, for the most part, I felt the movie's main plot live up to the demands for both mainstream audiences and die-hard fans. It didn't stray too far from the source material. However, I don't think, this movie does a good job, establishing some other plot threads, it was going for, that well. A good example, is the leaderless drone army and the 'human turning into alien foundation of youth' technology. It's hard to believe that the original aliens would, leave without this technology!? The twist toward the end, with Krall's crew also seem like a last minute, add on. Like how did Krall not know, where the USS Franklin, was and what took him, so long to attack the Federation? Also jarring, was how did the alien scavenger, Jaylah (Sofia Boutella) got on the planet and where did the Abronath McGuffin come from, and how did Captain James T. Kirk obtained it!? Am, I missing something, here? Despite the huge plot-holes, the movie is well paced and the acting throughout the film was alright. I kinda got over, the fact that the new main actors, will never outdo the original actors of the TV Show, however, they did what they can, to shine, throughout this film. However, I was very disappointed, with the villain. Elba's performance, here, felt a little generic and forgettable. That said, the new character of Jaylah, by far, was the greatest thing about this film. The hand to hand action scenes with her, was very well-done. It was bright-seen, and well choreograph. It's so unlike, the earlier action scenes in the film, with unrealistic CGI visuals film in dark, shaking cam. I had a hard time, figuring out, what's going on, there. With that said, the ending 'gravity' fight was also fun to watch with its 2010's 'Inception' and 1999's 'Matrix' like moves. The movie also had some beautiful music from composer Michael Giacchino. Even the climactic action beat involving the Beastie Boys' song 'Sabotage' on the soundtrack, was well fit, just like in the trailer. Overall: This is a terrific fun movie. A wonderful entry in the Star Trek series and worthy 50th anniversary gift. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I enjoyed it ... but Star Trek is just an interchangeable Label for it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie itself was a great and enjoyable summer blockbuster. In my opinion - it is 95% summer action block buster movie and 5% New Star Trek. As a matter of fact - it would have worked better as a generic, non Star Trek sci fi movie.(but certainly would never attract as many movie goers of course)What i liked:- The 3d is mostly neat - although it does work better in swarm and space scenes than interaction scenes. - The movie never gets boring and draws you into its action frenzy. - The crew is still likable ... kind ofWhat i did not like:- 10 minutes less action and instead 10 minutes more character build up for the bad guy would have done the movie very good. - They loose their iconic ship early and are reduced to an away team sized group. Since the movie is not supported by a running TV series .. i really could not care too much about them. They are a generic group of people in yellow, blue and red shirts. - Is it just me or is the message pretty similar to the last movies message...: Guys meant for war become kind of obsolete in peace times and are unhappy. Khan and his genetically altered kin had a good reason to hate the Federation due to literally being "shut down", Krull however appeared like a frustrated veteran on PSD or something. They could have tried harder for a different bad guy and a different motivation. - The space station.... i mean ... really? And that is supposed to be the "old Trek"? The Federation would not have been able to build such a monster that is a mixture between the Citadel in Mass Effect and a death star .. in even a future episode of pretty much any TV incarnation of Star Trek. - There is very little time with the people. They are always in a frenzy. And as with the previous Star Trek movies ... The ship tends to loose an awful lot of crew members that die in space ... yet... no one really cares it seems. - almost nothing is explained about the bad guys group. So they were survivors - and yes.. most of the ships they use seem to be unmanned drones (although that is not so clear - cause whenever they capture one... there seem to be pilots in them) ... the drones appear to be multiplying with each scene. If Krull had THAT many people to follow him with such devotion ... he really must be one of the most incompetent leaders in Trek history never to manage to get to a nicer planet. (not to mention that he is very much able to leave the nebula ... so what is that about?!)Many many plot holes. So why the 7/10 rating? Well... it was fun to watch. Looking at it while expecting a Star Trek movie would lower the score to 5/10 making it mediocre. Caring about plot holes and inconsistencies in a summer block buster would lower it another 3 points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star trekking among the CGI...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and foremost, I can't claim to be a Trekkie, not by a long shot. Always been a "Star Wars" fan, always will be. But still, I have seen the occasional "Star Trek" movie here and there, but not fanatically keeping track of the series or anything.This 2016 installment into the franchise, was an entertaining movie for sure. But it was ultimately a special effects movie, driven by action and dazzling CGI.The story, while entertaining enough for what it was, sort of fell short and merely served as a backdrop for the special effects galore. I dare even state that this 2016 installment at the directorial hands of Justin Lin is the type of movie where you just unhook your brain and just lean back in the seat, strap in for an action-packed ride and just go along without having a care in the universe.It is good to have the actors from the previous movies return to revisit their roles, because it does add a good sense of continuity to the movies. But there is a far distance between the Kirk character portrayed by William Shattner to the one portrayed by Chris Pine. It is just like the revamped James Bond of the latter movies in comparison to the old school charmer as seen in the movies up to the mid Eighties.I watched this movie in the cinema, but it was solely because of a lack of anything better showing when I was there. "Star Trek Beyond" proved to be adequate entertainment to me for what it turned out to be. But then again, I didn't enter the cinema with any expectations to the movie, so I was easily dazzled and impressed.The villain in "Star Trek Beyond" sort of fell short of being memorable or impressive in my opinion. And as such, then there was a void in the movie - no pun intended. The movie surely needed a more memorable villain.I am not sure how "Star Trek Beyond" resonates with fans of the "Star Trek" universe. But for me, a non-fan, then the movie turned out to be a good action ride, spiced up with a heap of impressive CGI effects."Star Trek Beyond" scores a solid seven stars out of ten stars from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bad visual effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my second review on IMDb. I am a huge science fiction fan, I love the reboot of star trek, the first two films so I watched all of them in a marathon, as the final the newest Star Trek Beyond. Immediately at the beginning I saw the difference. The first two so crystal clear the visual effects so stunning, beautiful. But here, it seems a layer was taken off, it lacked detail. While the film progresses it only gets worse, so dark everything, vague, I almost couldn't follow the action. Scenes which could have been so spectacular were now a great disappointment. For example the attack of these pieces of metal, it was a blur. For me something terribly went wrong with the visual effects. So I write this review because it seems almost nobody has noticed this. Exactly in a science fiction film the visual effects are very important because almost nothing is real. Also the scenes on the planet looked so not real, artificial, the rocks. The story was OK, nice story but for me, because of the visual effects much of the pleasure, the joy was taken away. I liked the Fast and the Furious a lot, but really Justin Lin, don't do this anymore. Karel</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Popcorn Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big Star Trek fan, beginning with the original TV series. With that said, this film is okay, but not outstanding. It is entertaining and dialog is quite good at times. However, do not expect a "Wow" movie. The special effects are quite good, but you expect and deserve it in a film like this. Effects are what makes movies like this, so that part of the film is outstanding. I enjoyed the cast and they do have good chemistry. The plot line was a bit shallow in my opinion which is one of the biggest gripes I have. The other main gripe, without giving away any spoilers, is the same with some of the old James Bond movies - where does the leader get all these people to fight and risk their lives for? And what reward do they get? These questions are not really addressed or answered. If you want a good popcorn movie, then I recommend this film, but do not expect to be blown away with a deep, thought provoking plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining film with a lighter tone and great characters, but little emotional weight and an over-reliance on CGI.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Star Trek Beyond' is the thirteenth instalment in the long running Star Trek franchise, one of the most lucrative in existence due to a plethora of films and spin-off shows. In preparation for this movie, the third to take place in J.J. Abrams' alternate time-line, I decided to watch the previous two entries. I thought that 'Star Trek (2009)' was a decent film, but that it spent too much time on setting up the new canon and characters, and found its sequel - 'Star Trek Into Darkness' - enjoyable despite its weak villain and numerous other issues. 'Beyond' is, in my opinion, the best of the three newest iterations. It isn't perfect but I had fun with it and it had far less problems than its predecessors.This time, the film is helmed by Justin Lin - as J.J. Abrams was already committed to making 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens.' He makes a point of using more advanced camera movements and, with the exception of a couple of fight scenes, frames all of the action cleanly. There are a couple of shots that tilt the camera which honestly started to give me some motion sickness, but I commend Lin on picking unconventional angles. The direction is interesting, and on par with Abrams' work; there aren't as many lens flares either. The fight scenes are perhaps the weakest part of this movie, with the choreography being largely uninspired and the violence being less brutal than it was in the last two movies. The other issue is that the camera is fairly shaky in these scenes, which makes them slightly harder to follow than I would have liked. However, they're still filmed competently and are not unpleasant to watch.The other main new edition behind the camera is that of Simon Pegg who, along with co-writer Doug Jung, wrote the film as well as starred in it. It's apparent straight away, with this movie taking a lighter approach immediately. The script is good and satisfying, you can tell that both Pegg and Jung have an affinity for the franchise; this is a picture for the fans, written by the fans (Pegg in particular.) The plot is probably the best of the three, but it does take a back seat to the characters. This isn't a bad thing, since the characters are the crux of any good 'Star Trek' series/ film. It feels, in some ways, like an extended episode of the original show - although it is still primarily a glossy action blockbuster. Occasionally, though, the dialogue is very corny, predictable and downright cheesy. This is probably as an homage to the original series which was quite camp in places, but if you're going to reference the original series than you could at least include Kirk performing a 'double-fist' in combat. There isn't really a sense of danger or mortality either, even though the characters are in constant peril. It also took a while to get going, so the first act was pretty slow, and there are a few predictable revelations and contrived character exchanges. It was an entertaining movie though, and when the writing worked it really worked.As I mentioned, the characters are the crux of this narrative. They are all brought to life extremely well, and you can tell that Pegg and Jung are familiar with them. The only exceptions are Uhura and Sulu, who are unfortunately relegated to "rescue me" roles. The cast has also settled in nicely, with each of them turning in believable performances. I liked the fact that the film focused more on the ensemble this time around, giving Chekov, Bones and Scotty bigger roles. This is a welcome change as I always felt that these were underused. Bones and Spock's somewhat confrontational relationship spawned some great banter and Scotty's side-plot was the most interesting. The two major new additions to the cast are Idris Elba and Sophia Boutella. Both of these portray well-realised and engaging characters, especially Boutella's Jaylah who was one of the best new things. Elba's performance was good but he didn't have much to do until the third act. He is probably the best villain in the new time-line, but he is still underutilised and not as threatening as he should be.The picture opens with a scene featuring some really horrific CGI, looking like something out of a mid-2000s animated feature. It had me worried, but thankfully the visual effects improved exponentially. There were still a few dodgy moments, such as some rough tracking and green-screening, but the majority was well realised. The only issue is the over-reliance on it, with the whole picture feeling less tangible than the last two. The set-pieces in space didn't elicit the emotions they should because it was all CGI, with less focus on the ships' palpable interiors; it's impressive visually, but doesn't feel like honest danger. Thankfully, the make-up department didn't go to waste though. The film features some outstanding practical make-up effects, most notably the work on Idris Elba who is almost unrecognisable. The aliens looked like aliens, as well as acting like them, and they felt real - as though you could reach up and touch them. You can tell that they were actually there on set, which makes them more believable and helps the performances too. Overall, 'Star Trek Beyond' is a fun flick with flashy visuals and an occasionally witty script. Its focus on characters is refreshing, and the whole film feels like an episode of the original series. It is a little camp in places, but the great writing and directing allow me to look past this; an entertaining movie with a lighter tone but little emotional weight and an over-reliance on CGI, 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great entry to the reboots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have noticed a trend with opinions for recent films, it seems that everyone has at least several things to complain about with very little positives, these complaints seem to revolve around using buzzwords a lot of the time like "character development", "film pacing", "plot holes" etc. This leads me into this film, I noticed on the message boards people using these buzzwords to justify why they did not like the movie without going into depth, this is another trend with movies people seem to throw these terms around without fully understanding the consequences of it. So lets go into the movie, its background, the good and then the bad of it. Star Trek Beyond is the third film in the rebooted franchise of Star Trek-the original series. What we need to look at are the previous two reboots that had been made, the first one 2009 was an overall good film, it did to me in my opinion suffer from attempting to redo old characters, was this necessary for the film? to me in hindsight it wasn't, it felt shoehorned in but at the time I enjoyed it, will I watch it again? probably not I have seen this film twice and it has very little replayability beyond the first 10 minutes most of the rest of the film is forgettable.Into Darkness was very much similar to this with a few extras, it brought back beloved villain Khan for some good old fanservice had 2 excellent sequences one being on the Klingon Homeworld where Khan obliterates lots of disposable Klingons showcasing how awesome he is and another where the new dreadnaught class vessel appears. Apart from that though not much in so far as looking into the characters. Does this film have replatability? more so then the first, Khans character is definitely worth watching, however there was a fair bit of fanservice packed into this one with very little progress.Now to Beyond, this film feels different to the first two, its not as frenetic, which I am honestly surprised at from the director of several Fast and Furious films and I found myself liking the characters as they have been fleshed out more, there was far more interactions in this film with the main characters more so than in the previous two combined in my opinion. Most of the character interactions I remember from the first two boil down to Kirk trying to get into Uhuras pants, Sulu saying he is good at fencing, Bones talking about drink and lots of fanservice for Spock saying Spocky things, beyond that not a huge amount to say about the characters, I suppose Kirk does learn to better himself bar that there wasn't much in the first two. The character interactions were interesting, we had several great moments with the Kirk, Bones and Spock Triangle, a hallmark of ToS and it didn't feel forced either! Scotty was good, Simon Pegg has made a new character out of him which I liked, the bad guy is interesting if not clichd. Overall the characters just stand out more for me, there interactions were more natural and fluid then the previous ones where the previous ones felt not much more then fan service.Another complaint I noticed about this one was either "it was too actiony" or "it was boring" hang on a minute, it cant be both so which one is it? This film to me was well paced, the "talky" scenes complimented the "action" scenes and vice versa, I did not find in this film any scenes in which I would have gone "get to the action!" or "god this talking scene is long!" mainly because they rolled off one another well. The third act of the film is mostly action admittedly however, this is to be expected and not only that the scenes here are again complimented with discussions on how to beat the villain, much like the original Wraith of Khan when they figure out how to fight Khan. My main gripes with the film are that it ends up with characters who are iconic and in a way irreplaceable, however this is not the films fault you can thank "Star Trek 2009" for that, also there are a few points which in the previous reboots make some sequences far fetched, think interplanetary transport making a lot of things null and void another thing you can thank for the previous reboots!Is this film more watchable then the previous two? To me it is, there was a lot happening in this in the same way there is a lot happening in the movie "Terminator 2" which gives it a lot of replayability and likability to the film, I enjoyed the characters interaction, the villain was good although a little Darth Vadery at the beginning with a little bad guy from James Bond exposition, the action scenes were well done, the humor was good and not forced, some of the dialogue was clich think "I am expecting that". Overall very impressed will watch again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The USS Enterprise crew explores the furthest reaches of uncharted space, where they encounter a new ruthless enemy who puts them and everything the Federation stands for the test.Director Justin Lin brings his action energy and a certain nostalgic flair to the series. The dimension of the original series that turned fans into lifelong nerds is that it pushed boundaries, it kept spinning your head with space marvels and awe. You could argue that the philosophical, political and sociological subtext is what always set this universe apart from other tech-heavy space adventures. This film brings back the old philosophical lessons in an old-fashioned way. In fact, some of Kirk lines are relevant to the whole of humanity. Star Trek Beyond fits smoothly with the universe J.J. Abrams started, though, it's lighter and funnier than Abrams' movies with a welcome sense of adventure after Into Darkness. Abrams always had intuitive grasps of the hearts and minds of die-hard fanboys and girls. He knows what they want and gives it to them. Abrams already reinvented the series once, he did it brilliantly, casting the series with such accuracy for the inner qualities of every Trek crew member. Like the show, it lets the audience share quality time with cast members, who now seem like old friends.The set-up is, in my opinion, the smartest part of the script by Simon Pegg, now pulling writing duties as well as co-starring. Splitting up the characters into unexpected pairings opens up the interactions giving some of the lesser-seen players a platform and reducing the screen time of the usual Kirk/Spock bromance. Simon Pegg injects plenty of fun, wit and certainly doesn't hesitate to give his own acting role, chief engineer, Montgomery "Scotty" Scott, a touch more dramatic significance than before. Zachary Quinto's imperturbable First Officer Spock, who conveys logical calm, whimsical humor and a kind of martyred romanticism; also rules the movie with a single raised eyebrow. Without Spock, this might be a bit ordinary. Pine is as usual charming and very effective as Kirk, this time, his character is wrestling with the ghost of his father and a monumental career decision. Once again, he manages to blend the perfect charming action hero with a slight touch of a smirk and a gleam in his eye. Plus, him jumping on the back of an antique 20th-century motorcycle at one key moment, where he goes full Steve McQueen in the Great Escape is a highlight. If there's an area in which the film disappoint, it's in the choice of bad guy. For all his faults Benedict Cumberbatch's Khan was a glorious highlight of Into Darkness. Krall after an amazing entrance worthy of a master villain retreats to the edges of the movie. His motivations are unclear and his machiavellian grand plan somehow shady. Until the third act, no spoiler, but wait and see. I have to pay a tribute to Anton Yelchin work as Chekov because we've come - through the course of two films - to love and appreciate his character. He did an inspired job of making Chekov's face match his heavily accented words, demonstrating his light comic touch. Yelchin as honoured in the closing credits with a simple "For Anton", slyly disappeared inside this role and in that very act of disappearance, he was never more himself. Here is a movie where the emphasis is on good, old-fashioned fun, and that feels in a good way, almost like an extended episode of the Trek TV Show. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see why director Justin Lin was handed the reins of the Star Trek series from the outgoing J.J Abrams. Justin Lin, director of four Fast &amp; Furious entries, is a master at making vehicles fly through the air (here space), as Star Trek Beyond has a few of the most spectacular set pieces ever seen in the series. When the action starts, Lin is more than capable of handling it. Most notably in the extended sequence when the Enterprise is ripped to shreds by Krall's bee-like ships or the final battle. Which takes place in a Federation outpost, that looks like a mix of the Aristocratic Satellite in Elysium, the city of the future in Wall-E and an Apple Store. Those sequences are ones you won't soon forget. Finally, Lin gets the job done remarkably well and it's got a likable retro vibe that takes us right back to the TV series spirit. Overall, Trek isn't going to start challenging Wars as the dominant Star franchise, but there's plenty of evidence it could still prosper (see what I did there?). It also serves as a sensitive send-off for the both beloved Anton Yelchin and legendary Leonard Nimoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those of us who know and love Star Trek are fully aware of the enormous wealth of its universe (indeed several parallel universes, and even recently this reimagined timeline that is anathema to some, but acceptable to others including myself). The whole comprises tens of films and hundreds of episodes in many series, and even life-imitates-art aspects like comments made by makers and stars at Conventions years later! This all has the paradoxical effect (also very visible with series like the BBC's Dad's Army) that the version we hold in our imaginations is now always likely to be richer and more meaningful and greater than any individual installment - past or present - that we actually get to see. And that is as true of ST "The Original Series" as it is of Abrams's new offering "Beyond", not least given that many of the Kirk-Spock-Scott-McCoy outings from the 3rd season of the "Original" were weak, and only erased as turkeys from our memory by reappearances of the original cast in great films like STIV and STVI.All of this is a lengthy if relevant way of building up to the idea that criticism of "Star Trek Beyond" (what a bad title, BTW!) for failing to match standards is inevitable, given that NO individual ST item can fully represent something that has notched up thousands of hours of screen time! Personally, I'm prepared to accept the revamped timeline in order to meet up again with beloved characters. And I don't even find the crossovers between timelines provided (perhaps now for the last time) by Nimoy-Spock and Quinto-Spock annoying. They touch the hearts of those of us who have been faithful to Star Trek for decades. It's also right that Quinto plays it a little differently to (if worse than) Nimoy, Pine likewise compared with Shatner, and Soldana with Nichols. Perhaps Karl Urban's McCoy is closest to the prototype (from DeForest Kelley), and after coming to that conclusion on the basis of three films, I'm not sure it's a good idea.Anyway, these are characters we somehow know, diverging gradually from the universe we remember, but it's mostly OK and even fun. Scotty in this film resolves into a semi-comic character from Simon Pegg (who also co-wrote the episode), and even that's OK.But of course a huge aspect of Trek is the way the key characters interact with each other - and with aliens they encounter. Idris Elba as the bad guy here does alright, but far more so in the last 10 minutes of the film than in the whole of the rest. Jaylah the alien played by Sofia Boutella is also moderately interesting in and of herself, and in the way she connects with our heroes. There are also moments here when all key characters seem to contribute to resolving a problem in a way that the Original would never have done, so plus-marks for that.On the minus side, some dialogue is just plain banal, and we do get rather few of those profound moments so vital to the ST concept. To be fair though, these are NOT absent altogether, so the standard criticism of "dumbing-down" cannot be applied fully here. We do have some interesting and novel McCoy-Spock moments in this film, as well as Sulu-Uhura moments. The fact that Sulu has a male partner back in port is reasonable, and a fitting enough tribute to George Takei (art imitates life in this case). The Spock-Kirk interactions do not give us much that is new, and the idea that Captain and Number 1 both might have had faltering commitment at the same time is surely inconceivable for those of us who know and love those characters!! As others have pointed out, the whole pseudo-military and naval side of ST is vanishingly weak in this film. Clearly this matters less and less to 21st-century viewers, but hurts a bit if you're an old-timer.Which brings us to the plot of "Beyond", which is neither especially interesting nor especially inspiring (but then that too could be said about many individual ST episodes). Many aspects are implausible (even beyond what we are used to), and not everything seems to gel into a logical and satisfying whole. Like several large-scale (and long) films of recent times, this one rather flies by without quite seeming to have given a full 122 minutes worth of content.Effects take up quite a lot of that time (too much, of course), and in quality terms they naturally go way, way beyond what we remember from the old days - but also annoyingly so. Things go whizzing by at such speed that we still don't know at the end of a 2-hour film what we have really been seeing! To me that's an inexcusable sacrificing of substance for the sake of style. Likewise, the Bridge on the Enterprise is to a design so ludicrously "busy" that no crew could possibly function in it for 5 days, let alone 5 years! However, very much on the plus side is the boundless imagination that has gone into conceptualising both the Yorktown Space Station and the planet Altamid. These aspects made the film for me, along with certain serious and comedic interactions between the main characters.Overall, then, this is a mixed bag of a Star Trek film that will doubtless prove quite acceptable to viewers with less historical and emotional Trek baggage. Old-timers may find it more problematical, but will probably (mostly) conclude as I do that better this Trek than no Trek at all. Given my own clear conviction (expressed in other IMDb reviews) that better no new "Independence Day" than the new outing, and better no contemporary "Star Wars" than the latest offering, this may be considered reasonable praise for the makers of "Star Trek Beyond", and for the film itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I admit I wasn't keen on Into Darkness, in fact I hated it, but Star Trek Beyond is a much pacier, racier movie with great performances from all the principal actors, who have really matured into the classic Trek roles. Glad they saw fit to honour Leonard Nimoy with a respectful mention; the baton is passed.Chris Pine is perfect as Kirk Alternate; Quinto has tapped the spirit of Spock Prime, but it's Karl Urban's laconic, witty delivery that somehow most channels Dr. McCoy that I'm increasingly impressed with.30% great effects, 30% great action, 30% great acting and 10% plot that keeps the action going, it's hardly cerebral, but it doesn't need to be.I'm sold.

		<shortDescription>Feel-Good-Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just wanted to write a few quick sentences, concerning the movie. I watched it the day it was released, in 3D and with German dubbing. With the knowledge, that Justin Lin is the new director, I expected an action packed movie with a lot of unnecessary puns and stupid moves. (Just like the last few "Fast and the Furious", which I absolutely hated).But surprisingly it was good. The story was nice and had a few unexpected twists. The action scenes where well choreographed, still a bit over the top like i feared before, but tolerable when it's combined with a great sound track.So as I mentioned before, I watched it in German. So I don't know how the English conversations were, but the German ones sounded so incredible superficial and insignificant. Grown men using childish sayings or forcing a pun as often as possible. This is seriously the only point that bugged me. And I was afraid, it would ruin the movie for me. But paired with all the positive aspects I mentioned before, I felt really good watching this movie. Specially the last "fight" against the swarm of drones. Besides knowing, that the "winning-blow" was a really cheap act of writing, I was on the edge of my seat and pretty much excited.To sum it all up. The movie won't stay in your mind for ever. But it is a great flick, if you just want to have a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>95% excellent visual effects and production, 5% worthwhile story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that for "fans of the original series" (all of whom are now 68 and older) that the new Star Trek is very good in terms of visual effects, CGI development and wide angle spectacle, and has almost no story or depth in terms of narrative whatsoever.Somewhat like the (superior) 60s cult series the Prisoner, Star Trek was supposed to be two seasons of allegory, political intrigue, cultural analysis and mystique, alongside some really batsh*t crazy episodes that could be best described as "camp".The Star Trek universe was created by two men (or rather: "MEN"): Gene Coon and Gene Roddenberry, who stopped work on the "franchise" before any films were released, and as much as some people like the film series that followed, it was often episodic, dull and weighty, as if the quality of the friendship between two middle aged men (Kirk and Spock) was enough to market a high-profile franchise. Be honest though, Trekkies: the cast hated Shatner, and that's a fact. He's a goon, an egotistical, self- revering fool that the rest of the cast detested.Anyway - for a writers vehicle that has a lot of memorable props, Star Trek has survived for many-a-decade at the cinema . . . I claim due to the excellent soundtrack work, mostly. The rebooted Star Trek is far better than the old film version (the franchise was at at extreme low before Abrams offered to retool the intellectual property for further sales), so I guess you can be thankful that these films actually are well made, and the first outing had some real depth, or at least pathos in a handful of scenes.The latest episode, simply called "Beyond", has three things going for it: excellent color palette, outstanding visual effects work and a genuine balance of immense sci-fi spectacle and generally good cast work on-the-ground, mixing a little humor with the drama, to good effect.Now for the not-so-great part: this film has practically no plot. It DOES have twists and turns, and it does have visual ingenuity and creativity, compliments of the visual effects director and various CGI studios hired out for various sequences, but the plot could be best described as "bad guy has evil weapon, good guys fight bad guy, bad guy nearly wins but at the last moment: good guys win."There's a great female character in this film, but a few of the action sequences feel more like computer game sequences. Also there's some sensitivity about Anton Yelchin among fans because he accidentally died due to a Chrysler engineering problem on his property after the film was made, but besides his success as an actor he never looks or acts remotely like Pavel Chekov. I literally thought both he and Simon Pegg had both been cast to play Scotty, and that at the last minute someone had reminded him he was Russian . . .or Scots/Russian . . .or something.Its a good movie, and I got my money's worth, but basically, an action film with no decent concept could be described as a pretty stupid, straight-forward action film. You could partly blame Simon Pegg here, for writing chunks of the material that ended up in the finished script. Last note: the post production has been simplified for the better. Relying on composition and color palette means a lot more than endless lens-flares. Thank god they chucked those out. Overall the film breathes a little more than 2013's overcooked sequel Star Trek: Into Darkness, so is a better film than that one in most respects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond clich and needlessly melodramatic self-importance: the final Fun-tier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood has taught us to anticipate the third part of a trilogy to be the grandest, darkest, and most personal - the triumphant, kitchen sink conclusion wrapping up everything preceding it. It wouldn't be amiss to expect the same of Bad Robot's recent Star Trek 2.0, even if that might bring its fair share of apprehension - how wise is it to go darker than a film literally titled 'Into Darkness'? Thankfully, a much needed changing of the creative guard has ensured that isn't so. As it stands, Star Trek Beyond is as jaunty and unapologetically enjoyable as its title suggests, and the closest the franchise has shown to a feature length episode of the show. It's a surprisingly wise move, even if all that lingers after viewing is a vague sense of disorientation and dizziness resulting from unleashing the director of The Fast and the Furious into space. Director Justin Lin appears to relish the upgrade from cars to spaceships, and his schooling in kinetic, frothy thrills makes for as summer-friendly a film as anyone could hope for. Correspondingly (and ironically for a film where the central antagonist keeps trumpeting the necessities of conflict), Star Trek Beyond is the lowest-stakes big- budget blockbuster released in years - and this isn't even intended as an insult. Gone are the artificial, normally mandatory trappings of melodramatic, 'this time it's personal' character angst plot devices - indeed, Simon Pegg's screenplay appears to almost mock this trope, by introducing each character by nature of their primary troubling conflict, only to almost never revisit them again. Instead, Lin and Pegg's space odyssey is firmly an excuse to hang with our hugely endearing Enterprise gang, jaunting around like a four-pronged buddy cop space adventure, where the crew, paired off as scene partners, exchange perfectly honed banter, like Shane Black being introduced to the Syfy channel. It may not be a perfect balancing act - pleasantly, Bones and Scotty get major upgrades, while new introductions Jaylah and Kalara are enigmatically intriguing, but Uhura and Sulu disappointingly verge on a glorified cameos (and 'damsel in distress' ones, to boot - sigh) - but each character shines in whatever capacity that the strength of the ensemble holds and carries the film like nobody's business. Still, amidst the cavalier sense of adventure, there's an unshakeable sense of the film playing to its strengths in its simplicity, but also playing it firmly safe. While there's none of the vitriol-inciting pseudo-remake machinations of Into Darkness, Beyond, enjoyable as it is, is the polar opposite of 'boldly going where no one has gone before.' There are no story surprises to be had whatsoever, and traditionalist Roddenberry stalwarts may be ready to combust at the lack of philosophical inquiry at play here. Similarly, the thick glaze of fun tends to strips any inherent tension or thrill from story beats doubtlessly intended to pop more ("The Enterprise is splitting apart and crashing? Oh, that's okay - they'll all be on another ship within minutes"). Indeed, Idris Elba's baddie may be as generically forgettable a monologuing plot device as Eric Bana's whassisname from Trek 1, but his evil motivation is almost genius in its loony simplicity - 'peace is boring.' Thankfully, it's the only time anything boring crops up, as Lin's voracious pace is too incessant to stress superficiality, keeping cameras careening over every surface of every planet and ship in sight, lovingly lapping up locomotion at all costs. The visual effects are top notch as always (and nary a lens flare in sight!), while Michael Giacchino's score, happily chirping away in the background, supplies all of the elating soars it needs. Speaking of: that Beastie Boys reprise? The most indulgently ridiculous, and epically awesome movie moment of the summer, hands down. Don't pretend you didn't roar along. Chris Pine continues to carry the Trek 2.0 series with his Kirk's perfect cocktail of impish swagger and begrudging introspection, and his cheeky charisma is still in full throttle here. Similarly, Zachary Quinto continues to live and breathe Spock, and appears to relish using his perfectly dry affect as more of a comedic foil here than his naval-gazing moralizing of the past. As his main detractor, Karl Urban's cantankerous Bones is an endless punchline machine, with delightfully grumpy retorts ready for any given scenario, while Simon Pegg's Scotty is as boisterously hilarious and lovable as ever. The tragically late Anton Yelchin is is so adorably affable as Chekov he's almost too heartbreaking to watch, while Zoe Saldona seethes with impressive emotion in her all-too brief moments as Uhura, and John Cho nabs every possible scrap of badassery in his fleeting presence as Sulu (including a pleasantly tasteful nod to his clarified sexual orientation). For all of his character's one-dimensional familiarity, Idris Elba's indignant growls lend Krall a ferocious energy, while Sofia Boutella's finds welcome punchlines in Jaylah's fierce franticness, enough to make her a welcome new addition to the pantheon. Star Trek Beyond, despite initial appearances, marks somewhat of a new (or at least long buried) frontier for Hollywood: the souffl mega-blockbuster. Gone are Roddenberry's Big Questions, but Lin's cheerful insistence on oodles of fun without the stale, artificial trappings of self-important grandeur, lends it a welcome simplicity. More than anything, the rock solid ensemble work of the cast show that plot be damned - we're here for them, while the dazzling sights and breathtaking adventures that befall them are only the cherry on top. And that's a formula that's hard to sabotage. -7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needs the old writers back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watch an action film, I tend to like the ones that have depth to them for example: emotions, comradery, a well thought out smart plot/plots, and some uniqueness. An equal amount of an interesting story and good action.This film has all of these - in very small doses. The first two films were beautifully and wisely written. I wouldn't say as much for this one. I took my son to see it, he's 21 and a fan of the first two like me. We both felt a bit restless and tired throughout the movie, losing interest here and there...I'd like to add we were in comfortable recliners and still felt this way.Unfortunately when we left, my son said, "that didn't feel right and wasn't the same". I agreed - disappointingly. It is way better than most action films, I am comparing this only to the first two movies of this series. I would not have chosen to see this at the theater, nor would I talk about it to people as a "good movie to see".It lacked all the magic that was in the first two. When I came home, I looked up the info on all three movies. I would have to blame this one IMHO on the writers. the first two movies had the same writers. This had completely different writers including wonderful Simon Pegg. And I'm a Simon Pegg fan hands down!!! Yet this movie would have been better served for the fans, the director, the actors, the movie series, and the long lasting memories, if the same writers wrote it. If the same writers on this movie write the 4th one. I'm not going to go see it. I'll wait till video.I gave it a 7 because the other two were both a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Blend on This Edition of the Reboot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this thinking I was not going to be impressed. I was surprised by the end of the movie how impressed I was. Beyond might stand for next generation in this film series after this one.While a true die hard Trekkie would have some issues with the script, spoiler- the homage paid to the late Leonard Nimoy is extremely correct for this film. The problem for the true Trek fan is these films started out as taking place before the original series. While yes the cast looks like younger versions of the same people, the photo of the original cast used in the homage to the original Spock, throws that entire idea out of warp drive.Put your brain away and enjoy though as this one has all the hope and spirit of Star Trek. It no longer matters if this is really before or after the original series, the fact is this blend of action and comedy succeeds on almost all levels. The secret is in the script. We have a star ship Captain who appears to have lived to more 200 years old. The choice of who this is could be controversial (Idris Elba is excellent in his role) but hey, this is Sci-Fi, and in Sci- Fi, only the ideas matter. Sofia Boutella as Jayla is an excellent add to this cast as is Lydia Wilson. The action sequences are superb, though poor Spock (Quinto) takes a major beating in this one, but as only a Vulcan can come through this one well. I am as crazy for Zoe Saldana as I used to be for the original Uhura. The use of music in the plot is actually a throwback to how often on the original series an unearths way is found to solve an unsolvable situation. I saw this is 2D but I could tell where the 3D could be quite effective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond Soars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always said that if I was wrong about something, I would own up to it.Well over the last year or so, I've been immensely skeptical of Star Trek Beyond. I became iffy over the problems with the script, I was skeptical over Fast &amp; Furious director Justin Lin being put at the helm and then the first trailer seemed to confirm all my worst fears about what the film would become. I about washed my hands of it, deciding for the first time that I wouldn't see it in cinemas. Then it came out and people whose opinions I trust sang it praises. So I decided to give it a go after all...Well folks I was wrong. Star Trek Beyond wasn't the wham bam, action driven and plot less film that the trailer made it to be back in December. Far from it, truth be told.Though it didn't start out that way. The opening minutes of Beyond are comparatively slow compared with the openings of the two films that proceeded it though it does do a nice job of bringing the audience up to speed where this version of the Enterprise crew stand some three years into their five year mission. The film finally gets going plot wise though that ultimately leads into the first major action sequence which felt like a long retread of a big part of the climax of Into Darkness. That was just the opening of the film thankfully.Once it moves beyond that slow and at times clunky opening, Beyond soars. The plot is an intriguing mix of Trek elements including exploring elements of the series mythos including tie-ins to one of the franchise's spin-offs that came as a pleasant surprise. Not only that but the film contains quite a few little Easter eggs for long time fans which range from references to lines of dialogue. These are things that will make those fans happy while not alienating an audience of new viewers, something that has been key to the success of the this new Trek film series. Not only that but that but Beyond's ultimate message about strength in unity, not giving into the prejudices and patterns of the past is also a timely one as well. Despite the issues with the early part of the film, it's a significant improvement over the plot of Into Darkness three years ago.The action sequences of the film also work splendidly. While the trailers gave the wrong impression of many of them, in context they work splendidly from chase sequences to fist fights that take full advantage of what a big budget film can do over what the series did back in the 1960s. The climax is a tour de force of the kind of sci- fi action/adventure that Trek does well even if it does include a Beastie Boys song as part of the action (which I have to admit didn't work in the trailer but actually works in context here). Actually that last sentence sums up so much of the action sequences, most especially a sequence involving a motorcycle which makes no sense until you see it in the film itself.In the midst of all that though, it doesn't lose track of its characters. There's quite a bit for everyone to do in this film after some of them were sidelined in the past. Simon Pegg's Scotty comes across quite well and there's more screen time for Zoe Saldana's Uhura and the now sadly late Anton Yelcin's Chekov. The focus though is on Trek's three greatest lead characters and it is a genuine pleasure to see Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Karl Urban grasp their roles and run with them. The film's supporting cast does well with Sofia Boutella's Jaylah coming off the best of the lot. Idris Elba's villainous Krall is effective in his scenes though Elba as an actor is effectively lost behind layers of makeup. All told though, it's a solid cast with the Enterprise crew really getting a chance to shine here.Despite what is one of the poorest marketing campaigns in the history of the Star Trek film series, Beyond is definitely worthy of the franchise as a film. While not on the level of the 2009 reboot, it is definitely a step in the right direction that proves that this fifty year old creation of Gene Rodenberry is far from being done. So forget the terrible trailers and boldly go see it at a cinema near you.</fullReview>

I gave him a chance, because after all, its Star Trek. What we got was Fast and Furious in space. Just running, fighting, explosions, one frantic scene after another with no time to develop characters, motivations, or even plausible Sci-Fi. It feels shallow, a promising plot sacrificed to the alter of YA expectations. Another Star Trek movie where the enterprise is destroyed, again? Is this sci-fi disaster porn now?The dialogue is forced, the banter off tempo, and in the end, the actors talents and IP were wasted on what feels like a B movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic third instalment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the jj Abrams star trek films and after the final trailer I was excited for this film and once again this film is a fantastic addition to the star trek lore. The premise of this film sees the crew of the enterprise 3 years into their mission attacked by a mysterious enemy which sees the crew stranded and separated on a planet. Chris pine is back playing captain Kirk and in this film I would say he is more like the character then ever before. He is a likable captain but also keeps that humour and cool guy that he has been in all these films. They also add a bit of drama to his character in this film involving his father. Zachary quinto plays Spock and he has allot of development in this film as he becomes even more interesting and even funny in this film. His chemistry especially with bones is great. My favourite character in this film is Dr McCoy played by Karl urban. He was really funny in this film and he develops as a character especially with Spock. Zoe saldana plays uhura and she is great, she has a interesting dynamic with the villain and I thought her relationship with Spock developed in this film. Simon pegg wrote this film and he is really funny as Scottie who is given more to do in this film and his character is given way more depth. Sofia boutella plays jaylah a new alien character who is great in this film and works really well with the cast. Idris Elba plays the villain krall and he does a good job his voice is very booming and his presence is felt. His character is interesting and has a good twist to him. The story never stops moving and I like the way the characters are separated but all of them feel important. The villain plot is simple but towards the end of the film it does become interesting and the stakes are pretty high. The script is really good, it has some really good humour in it mixed with some good dramatic character moments that truly make you care about the characters. The style has some great visual effects and great space battles. Unfortunately, some of the hand to hand combat scenes have allot of shaky cam that is hard to follow what is going on. This is a fantastic fun star trek film that is definitely worth a watch. Also rest in peace to Leonard nemoy and Anton yelchin who is fantastic in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3rd Movie Out is Fun and Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Third movie is a very good movie. It is an inventive story, which is hard to do given all of the many stories, Captain Kirk has helmed the USS Enterprises through.The cast that they put together comes through again and the added characters in Krall and Jaylah are pitch perfect in their roles. The story line and intensity is kept in tempo. There was no noticeable lull. Now that I am thinking about it, there is nothing that went wrong and every thing went right. Perhaps that is it's only flaw. Things may seem a little too perfect. while there was great suspense, like a Bond Movie, there was never really concern that the main characters would die. It was just exciting the positions that they got into and how they got out of them. If you like Star Trek, this movie is a must. If you like Space Action Movies then you will most likely enjoy this. I highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refreshing during a summer of disappointments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So far I haven't disliked any of the newly rebooted Star Trek franchise. They're exciting, fun, and for the most part well balanced. I know a lot of Star Trek fans are turned off by J.J. Abrams's new timeline, but Star Trek was dying, as a matter of fact it was dead. Abrams revitalized it, actually producing watchable Star Trek films. The reins have now been taken over by Justin Lin and he does not disappoint. I'm not the biggest fan of the Fast &amp; Furious franchise, so I had my apprehensions, especially after that mediocre first trailer, but he delivered. His characterization of the F&amp;F characters always felt two-dimensional and I was always annoyed at the redundant and not so subtle theme of family and sticking together in that franchise. I love it when movies provide subtly, and to my surprise some of those familiar themes Lin likes to use are done with care and subtly, so it never feels cheesy or awkward like it did in his F&amp;F films. As expected, he delivers in the action sequences and the visual effects are done with flare.Splitting the crew up was a stroke of genius. They are fleshed out more and have more to do. Some more than others obviously, but it was good to see them do more outside their duties in the Enterprise ship. Chris Pine and the late Anton Yelchin's arcs provide some cool action. Karl Urban is a giant highlight in the film. His banter with Zachary Quinto's Spock is hilarious and brings levity to the film. John Cho and Zoe Saldana brought some incognito, sneaky stealth like elements. Simon Pegg shines as well in his supporting role as Scotty, but his bond with Sofia Boutella's Jaylah, an alien scavenger is what really makes the film interesting. Jaylah is a welcome addition to the newly rebooted Star Trek franchise and I'm positive she'll be a hit with the audience.Chris Pine's Kirk in this film is my favorite of the three films. He's grown up now and plays it straight. I liked seeing a more mature Kirk who's less cocky. For him to evoke Kirk without a Shatner impression makes him stand out and at this point I don't compare him to William Shatner at all, he really made Kirk his own. Pine and Quinto can literally play these roles in their sleep at this point.The part where the film falters is the villain. While I did enjoy Idris Elba's performance as Krall, there wasn't much to explore with his character. His plan, his motivation, and his backstory are just sprinkled in, rather than really being explored. His doomsday like device in the film is just as confusing as his motivation. What's really frustrating is that he is a threat, and he's given some layers of depth, but the film doesn't give enough to justify his position. More scenes of him could have really helped. Compared to Nero, Krall is the better villain in this rebooted franchise. Personally for me, Benedict Cumberbatch's Khan was more menacing and more threatening. I'm aware of the Star Trek Into Darkness vs. Wrath of Khan controversy, but that's another topic to discuss for another time.Aside from Captain America: Civil War and The Shallows, this is a summer filled with disappointments. Thankfully this film breaks that streak, it only took about a month or so. Star Trek Beyond is the lightest one out of the three, more in tune with the original series, with decent character moments, and just pure fun. The film respectfully sends off Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Trek as it should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No spoilers here, enough will see this over time and those who have not, well, will not ruin their night. Star Trek per se is it's own universe with trusting and sometimes rabid fans who criticize everything. There are acolades for this film and few who hate it as bad as The Phantom Menace is to the SWars crowd. I found it immensely entertaining and, for once, a film that went in other directions entirely, quite kindly in many respects and many scenes of the cast interacting in pairs, alone and in an alien setting. No pun intended. Action was 1st rate. Writing superb and perhaps the villain needed a bit of explanation but this is STrek where almost anything can be explained. We finally also have good scenes of the Kirk-Spock-McCoy trio. They are now aged a bit, closer to their earlier persona(s) and old friends now. I felt I was back in the comfortable armchair of the old classic series too, once could almost see the DesiLu head at the end of the thing. So, set your entertainment level to a good evening in the cinema, buy popcorn - and be blessed you are not watching Jar-Jar in that other awful movie. Thrusters on full.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The third installment packs a punch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third installment of the rebooted series brings in the new director Justin Lin and sees the crew of the Starship Enterprise exhausted from over half of their five-year mission. The routine weighs on Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) as he reflects on another year past with his best friend Dr. Hank "Bones" McCoy (Karl Urban). The duration has frayed relationships between Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Lieutenant Uhura (Zoe Saldana). A stop at the magnificent spectacle space station Yorktown brings a new mission that has the crew of the Enterprise traveling beyond an unnavigable nebula. When the action starts rolling it never lets up. Lin is an expert at showing ships swooping and soaring at breakneck speeds. The close-quarters gunfights and hand-to-hand combat suffer a bit from the rapid, shaking camera movement but other times, he hits the sweet spot of sci-fi action. The crew is scattered across a planet and each separate pair takes on a mission from Uhura and Sulu (John Cho) held captive by the villainous Krall (Idris Elba) who has mysterious motivations. Simon Pegg pulls double duty as a co-writer and starring as Montgomery Scotty, adding welcome humor to the script.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fitting "End"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a proverb in danish, which roughly translates to: "quit playing, while the game is still fun" and this movie feels just like that. This is a great movie; better then expected for my part. The acting and the chemistry between the actors are just perfect and every person gets their fair share of the spotlight (although Sulu is a bit underused, in my opinion). This, I would say, also concludes the trilogy, that is was supposed to be (I know the fourth part has just been announced), but the ending compares to being the final act, which leads back to the danish proverb, that the trilogy ends on as high note. There are few hints to movie nr. 3, 4, 6 and 8, but , again, in this movie this just feels right story wise; because it is made the right way., and not just retelling of the same things from the other movies.I can recommend this movie highly, but It is a bit better, if you have seen the first 2 movies (but that is mostly to get into the "Kirk" character; why he acts as he does in the beginning of the movie)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Preposterously enjoyable Star Trek, don't take it seriously!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always enjoy films where the character interaction is good. Star Trek was always about the crew for me and here the old characters are interacting in the true ST way. They have as much life and enthusiasm for a typically preposterous plot and ending. There are the CGI versions of shaky sets and the solutions to problems are both hilarious and action packed.Just don't take it too seriously - after all in the original series you didn't just have tribbles but Nazis and 'rock men' made from polystyrene! If you take it seriously you will be taking something like the Bond films seriously or the Expandables no less. Sit back and enjoy the interplay of the characters, their team spirit, the few introspective moments and the humour - something that was lacking in say the remake of Dad's Army.SPOILER? I personally felt the sadness when Spock sees his parallel self dead. I thought Leonard Nimoy was always the best character. Later the photo he finds stirs fond memories.The gay thing about Sulu - if I hadn't been told before about it I would have missed it. So underplayed he might have been giving his brother a hug in the space terminal. Why was it even mentioned? It added nothing.Simon Pegg criticised by some for writing himself a big part - well what actor given the chance would write himself a small part? As for the accent - well it is the 23/24th? century who knows what Scots will sound like then - don't take it seriously or you might also wonder what his relationship with the 'wee fellow' is! Interspecies with someone who has acid for saliva - ouch.I thought that overall the script brought out the original Trekkie feel brilliantly and everyone including Anton (RIP) played their parts well. Sad that he cannot live long and prosper.I hope the series continues and that they all have peace and long life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To infinity, and Beyond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my review for Star Trek: Beyond (spoiler free)****(4/5) Cast:Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, Karl Urban, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, Sofia Boutella and Idris Elba Plot: The USS Enterprise crew explores the furthest reaches of uncharted space, where they encounter a new ruthless enemy Krall (Elba) who puts them and everything the Federation stands for to the test.Now I just want to say that I am not a full Trekkie but I am a fan.After J. J Abrams left to make Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) Trek was left alone for a little while until it into the hands, of a fan that's right director Justin Lin also known for 4 Fast &amp; Furious movies, which were then left to the hands of horror master James Wan. The first motion picture in 1979 was made by a fan Robert Wise now deceased and it go so well but that didn't stop Trek. Now when the first reboot came out in 2009 a lot of older generation fans didn't want to see it but in my perspective I like both Treks old and new I think that new introduce the new generation into the franchise. In my personal opinion they are brilliant and it's the same with this one.Set a little under three years into the exploration journey with the Enterprise and the crew are little tired, as they enter the uncharted parts of space, and the CGI is absolutely stunning and is a brilliant continuation from Star Trek: Into Darkness (2013) and this time they are under attack from an even newer and meaner villain, in the form of Idris Elba's Krall or Krawl as it's pronounced in the film he is Klingon by origin but not really Klingon. If you remember the last time we saw the Klingons was in Into Darkness for a few minutes until they were killed of by Benedict Cumberbatch's Khan on their home world Kronos. However the Enterprise crew discover that he was never a monster at all eventually but I won't reveal anymore because spoilers.Just like the other two reboots this has insane fast-paced action and talking although the dialogue in this one is much more funny and much more fast-paced, but don't let put you off. One other thing a lot of people were concerned if this would turn into a Fast and Furious movie well no of course it wouldn't, it looks nothing like the Fast franchise. Even though this is set a little under two years into the journey does that effect the story? answer no it may have two new writers but the story is still the same dynamic story as the other two apart from a new meaner villain but that's to be expected.Once the Enterprise is stranded on a planet they seek the help of Sofia Boutella's Jaylah who's family was killed by Krall and his clan when she was young, she is just as good as she is in 2014's Kingsman although more bad-ass than Kingsman which is weird, anyway she has a lot of new toys for the crew of the Enterprise. Also another thing Sxotty's (Pegg) is a lot stronger than the previous Trek reboots. The entire of the Enterprise is separated and some of them are forced to work together even though some may not like it, yes I'm talking about Bones (Urban) and Spock (Quinto). Although Kirk (Pine) more bad-ass than ever and Chekov (Yelchin) do get to know each other a lot more, if you remember in the previous Trek's Checkov didn't really speak that much well not as much as we'd hoped. Anyway Beyond ends promisingly and in terms of previous summer blockbusters like Legend of Tarzan this one is certain to not disappoint to even the most veteran fans, who prefer the older Trek's.Finally in the end credit's and throughout the film we do see a firm but memorable goodbye to the old Spock Leonard Nimoy, and in the end credits it says for Anton because of his shocking untimely demise last month but that doesn't stop the performance that you see Checkov pull off. He had many great performances like in Green Room (2015) one of my favourite films of the year. But unfortunately his very short and promising career came to an end and this is just one of his last films, but his performance is still as good as ever. Remembering Anton Yelchin 1989-2016.Apart from that all-in-all this new Trek will not disappoint and is certainly one of the best and most kick-ass films this year.Verdict: Beyond delivers all the fast-paced action like the other reboots and has certainly made Trek good again. This is a brilliant start to the 50th Anniversary, but let's see what the next 50 years holds in store for Trek.8/10 a rip-roaring good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third installment of rebooted Star Trek series offers a strong comeback of the starcast. J.J Abrams was replaced by Justin Lin as the director and it created some disappointment for Abrams fans. Taking over the directing chair from reboot mastermind J J Abrams, Lin delivers some exciting space battle action staged against spectacular digitally-enhanced sets. Justin Lin was good enough to manage the story with very good VFx effects. It is one of the best Sci-fi movies watched in 2016. One of the chief strength of the Star Trek Beyond is that it remains its appealing young cast, who approach their iconic characters with respect. I go with 4.5/5 for this Sci-fi action flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some say a movie that plays out like a "good episode" is a bad thing. These people are wrong. This is the best yet for a movie that feels like an episode. Self contained goodness. Insurrection tried to do what Beyond succeeded at; create a self contained entertaining film for the fans. Justin Lin has embraced the high energy Abrams brought before but Pegg's script lets FUN HAPPEN! Its not a heavy, dark adventure. It is a great adventure that brings our favourite crew back together and breathes new life into the franchise. The score is epic in scope but personal in tone. There are many themes that come back from the first movie (2009). As a self proclaimed Trek veteran, the nods are all in the right place, this movie has heart. The main goal of any Trek movie/episode is to make you want to live in this future, and I do!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a love letter to the fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved it, loved it, loved it! Admittedly a fan since The Original Series, and really love the reboot movies as well. I felt this was much better than Star Trek Into Darkness, but still not quite the masterpiece the 2009 Star Trek became. One of my friends called this movie a love letter to the fans, and I have to agree with it. The themes of diversity continue with this new film, embracing new civilizations, showing Sulu's same sex partnership as no big deal. The inner struggles Kirk and Spock had of duty vs. their obligation to each other was continued from the original series, and it was very well portrayed, weaving in the story line of Leonard Nimoy's passing as the call from beyond the grave to today's Spock. When he opened Spock's belongings and saw the group photo of the original crew, I started bawling like a baby. I was so moved to see them honored like that (as so many of them are no longer with us), and the dual meaning - a signal to Spoke that he belongs by Kirk's side, as Spock Prime told him in the first movie. I also loved that they managed to pay tribute to Anton Yelchin's untimely passing in the credits. Yes, there were holes in the plot, as others pointed out, and sure I'm biased, but our entire family went together, loved it, and walked out happy. A joyous respite from the horrors going on in today's reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Trek goes Beyond its 50th</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Trek BeyondContains SpoilersThis year marks the 50th anniversary for this sci-fi series franchise. This is also the third film in the rebooted or alternative universe of Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the crew of the USS Enterprise.There had been a lot of rumours about this film and given the anniversary, many wondered just how it might show the Star Trek universe at its best. As with all reviews, I won't give the plot as I hate spoiling things for others. So, what one word would I give this movie after seeing it? Brilliant.It is the best of the three by far, this adventure for me, goes beyond everything. There has been a subtle move away long title introductions to grab the viewers and hold them like hell for the ride. Star Trek Beyond mixes humour, action, adventure, edge of the seat drama along with character development while not forgetting to carry the audience. It is very hard not give away anything here. So sort of spoiler alert. The actors certainly appear to fit 'their' version of the roles in this movie, which is sad for one given the well-publicised news of Anton Yelchin's death. There was all sorts of 'drama' over what was a minor element of the whole movie, that of Sulu's partner. It just flashed by, so ? The plot was good - yes there might be holes as I have said a number of times before what film has none - very few. It is well put together for my liking it flows, no stopping, just action. One bit I really like was the Enterprise travelling through wrap, that was rather good. There are a number of things in the movie which pays tribute to the original actors and the 50 years that has past. You do have to listen to some lines very well in order to get the in-jokes. Again some sadly delivered by Chekov. The sadly bit is that we won't hear those again.The underlying theme of this movie was unity is strength and to be honest, has always been a central element of Star Trek. Together no matter what, we are stronger. Kirk and Spock realise their true friendship which again, should be clue to people in the real world. It takes McCoy to 'link' them together pointing out what they both miss. Highlights: Very difficult to say anything here without giving the game away. There is one scene which for a Star Trek fan is brilliant and you won't miss it I am sure. I will be seeing the film again, I almost walked out of one screening and into another, I don't do that for many films at all. Simon Pegg did a very good job on this film as both Scotty and one of the main writers. I would hope he has a hand in the next script. Star Trek Beyond runs for 120 minutes, full colour, 3D and 2D, full of sounds and is good.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2660888/fullcredits/Tagline: "To boldly go where no-one has gone before"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Management Guru's Dream and entertaining for the rest of us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Entertaining and familiar, yet different, Star Trek Beyond pushes the franchise into a new realm in both story and style. 24 hours out from my opening day enjoyment of the film, I'm still digesting and mulling over what I saw, which is itself the mark of an effective film. As we might expect at this point in the franchise (and with a cast member as co-writer), Star Trek Beyond is NOT a single hero's journey but celebrates the achievement of a team. I'll carefully avoid spoilers to simply highlight that the entire familiar crew (RIP Anton), along with new original characters, make critical contributions to the ultimate outcome. Management gurus would likely applaud this future of evolved leadership and teamwork, but it might make Hollywood veterans cringe. In storytelling, the lack of a definitive hero (set off by a truly villainous villain) is generally considered to be a very bad thing indeed. I tend to be more forgiving but can acknowledge that this film only works because we already know the characters and their world. If sometimes the film reaches a little too far beyond the story for its messages (I couldn't come up with a story-based reason to include Sulu's sexual preference, to site the most egregious departure noted....It just - IMHO - didn't matter to the story), it's likely just a case of mere mortals trying to live up to 50 years of history. Star Trek Beyond is a worthy contribution to the franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily the best out of the reboot franchise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Star Trek reboot series was the most frustrating series out of a franchise I've ever got familiar with. Looking past the grand spectacles and brilliant casting, the series cannot help but fall short in capturing the true spirit of the original shows. The first one cripples its visual flourish and charismatic leads with a multitude of plot conveniences and the insistence of appealing to the average movie crowd. Doubly so with Into Darkness, which tries and fails to implement political infighting and the series original lore. With plenty respect to Abrams and no respect from his bumbling screenwriters, all their efforts of emulating the same intelligent charm of the original series taints this reboot series, making them what extents to bloated, stupid action movies. So who would've guessed that the series saving grace amounts to just being an action movie that strips all the convoluted pretense and tedious self-referencing in the process? That is probably the biggest secret to Star Trek Beyond's greatest success: executing a lean, small-scale, surprisingly character-driven piece of action movie devoid of any extra weight. The result is not only the most action-packed movie of the summer, but one that pays true to Gene Roddenberry's original vision of space exploration and monster-fighting. The story picks up after the Enterprise crew depart from Earth after the events of Into Darkness as Kirk, Spock, and the gang set off to find new life in the outer world. During this mission, they come across a new species of aliens, led by Idris Elba as Krall (who is easily the best use of a great talent as a villain in this series EVER!) that threatens to attack if they don't comply to give them what they want. So once they refuse, the Enterprise crashed and burned in a nearby remote planet ? yeah, get used to seeing that happening all the time now ? which separates the crew. So it's up to the scattered crew to find themselves once again, save the rest of the crew, and stop Krall. Along the way, Scotty (played by Simon Pegg, who still rocks!) finds a new alien companion who just so happens to inhabit a working Starfleet called the USS Franklin, which may or may not holds deeper information about Krall's past. So if any of that sounds more or less like a filler episode rather than a grand scale third entry, that's because it mostly is, but by no means to a fault. The hidden genius of this film lies in how much its invested in finding compelling ways to keep its small scale reminiscent of the classic pulp adventures of the show. Which means fist fights are more upfront and abundant, character drama gets more of a focus ? which is a breather since we don't have to be reminded constantly on how important Kirk is for a change ? the science is utilized in the best of its abilities when it comes to encountering danger, and there is not a hint of the plot bending over backwards to heighten the stakes with bloated BS. It's the type of deceptively simple approach I thought I never get in a Star Trek movie in this decade, and I'm glad we get it now than not at all.The actors are all terrific once again. Simon Pegg's script strips out all of Kirks personal baggage and just have him be a full-fledged commander, which allows Chris Pine to finally shine. Zachary Quinto finally convinces me that he's the OG new Spock, Pegg and Karl Urban are still the films comedic charmers, and Zoe Zaldana can still remind us that, even after the shitty Nina movie, she can have real screen presence. More impressive in this series is the more credible yet menacing villain in Krall, who sole motivation stems from his depleted faith in his commanding officers who failed to find him, thus descending him to physical madness. All that is due to new director Justin Lin, who honestly deserves more credit than what he gets. Sure it seems sacrilege to have a guy from the Fast &amp; Furious movies taking the helm of a smarter series (which is honestly not much the case. See the original series) but his love for the material, joint with Simon Pegg's script, shines through more than Abrams in two movies. The leads finally get some well-deserved banter as they crack jokes and attempt to fix their issues rather than ponder on them while at the same time we can enjoy some inventive camera-swooping space combat. The type of character dynamics mixed with over-the-top action that defined the Fast series could not befit this series more than what we could expect. Which ultimately comes with a crutch, although not as big as the last movies. There's probably too much action and not enough downtime, most of the connective tissue - though still effective - feels undercooked, there is still familiar story beats (like another McGuffin) and some might not like the smaller scale. It's not much of a deal breaker as this is a blockbuster, which pretty much comes with the territory, but credit where credit is due. Still, this is probably the Star Trek movie I always expected would happen yet never thought we get. One that stays true to its simplicity and makes the most out of it rather than failing from doing too much. Who would've thought we needed three freaking movies to get to the good stuff. Overall, I recommend this! PS: The tribute to Leonard Nimoy will make you cry!For more reviews, check out my blog!http://hydebarker.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, this is the best action film I have seen this year but that is not to say that it is all action as thankfully it isn't there are many tender and emotional scenes. This is the best film in the new rebooted Star Trek universe with the crew now more of a family and this love and respect for each other shines through. It is quite sad when you realise that this is the last time this family is complete with the tragic loss of Anton Yelchin. The cast are fabulous and they are all given something productive to do to keep the plot moving. The villains of the piece are truly villainous, the action sequences are full-on but not overdone or too long. My only problem with the film is that the identity of bad guy was telegraphed too early but all in all it is a terrific film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I write a review I like to browse through the other comments posted first. To surmise, many have got it quite right, this is not the best Star Trek movie, but it is a good one. The story is reasonable, although there are plenty of plot holes that you have to overlook and not delve into them too deeply. I also think that the size of that deep space station is just OTT even for that century, it is far too advanced! Anyway, get over the minor flaws and you will begin to notice that they are starting to focus more on character development and interaction of the personalities within the crew. It is what real fans enjoy the most, including the odd bit of humour.As for the highly negative reviews on here, please start to put your rankings in perspective, this is by no means a shocking movie and definitely is fit to join the Star Trek Universe. It really winds me up when people rank this movie in the same breath as some of the real shockers we have seen in the last few years!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Explosive, action-packed fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Trek Beyond is directed by Justin Lin and stars Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Anton Yelchin, Simon Pegg, John Cho, Zoe Saldana, Idris Elba and Sofia Boutella. The USS Enterprise crew encounter a new enemy in the furthest reaches of uncharted space that will push them and everything the Federation stands for to the test.With a director such as Lin in charge of a beloved franchise - reignited with Abrams' previous two vibrant instalments - and having only been widely recognised as being the helm of many Fast &amp; Furious movies, I was worried. Yet, only now I realise how wrong I was to be worried. Lin's direction in this movie is deeply and firmly rooted in the ground of which Abrams set during the making of the first two instalments. This may be due to him looking over Lin as he takes the producing credit, but Lin's vision is clear and wonderfully thought-through.The returning cast of Pine, Quinto, Urban, Saldana, Pegg and Cho are as great as ever. But, the role that felt really huge and important in contrast to the previous movies, was Anton Yelchin's final performance as Chekov. A truly brilliant actor, always taking the screen whenever alongside other cast members, giving us his very best in the trilogy. The franchise will not be the same without him. Another highlight was Urban and Quinto's undeniable chemistry throughout. It was very grounded and touching to watch. Newcomers Idris Elba and Sofia Boutella, are both energetic additions to the story. Elba's villain, Krall, is a powerful and evil force, creating many problems for our heroes. Boutella is awesome as Jaylah and quickly became a favourite of mine during the running length of this movie. Beautiful, bad-ass and perfect for her character.Michael Giacchino returns with another heavily explosive score with many new leitmotifs paired with the colourful visuals and locations, whilst bringing back the main theme from the 2009 movie, re-recorded with new directions in mood and texture. My love for his music lives on as expected, delivering another soundtrack to add to the collection.While the special and visual effects are amazing throughout, there were some moments where I felt they could have been touched upon just a little more. However, this doesn't distract and never impacts the overall enjoyment of the movie.One of the reasons I was more intrigued and excited for this instalment was having Simon Pegg as a writer. The screenplay is fun, dramatic and comedic. Straight away, you can tell you're watching a film written by someone as genuine and diverse as Pegg. Some of his efforts haven't always been so rewarding, but I believe he has done a fantastic job with this and should definitely take control of the fourth instalment. He has a deep understanding of the characters and it shows. The story is great and kept me fully entertained throughout. This is honestly some of his best work yet. Another thing this movie delivers is a gentle tribute to the original cast of the Star Trek series, including Leonard Nimoy's well-known portrayal of Spock. Following the sad death of Nimoy, the writers had to work on a way of rounding off his story in the franchise, and they do this wonderfully. 50 Years of Star Trek is celebrated perfectly and I'm sure the fans will greatly appreciate it.My verdict; Star Trek Beyond is fun, action-packed and visually stylish, surpassing the greatness of the previous two instalments. This is a treat for all movie-goers and Trek fans alike. Pegg has done an impressive job and I hope he will return as writer for the next outing. Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin will be greatly missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>if you have a wild imagination about whats out there in deep deep space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is for the person that has a wild imagination about what could be out in deep space. ! loved it. The director was able to capture the essence of the original Star Trek television show from the 70's with todays CGI. Hard to really explain it, you just have to watch it, and preferrably in an IMAX or Arclight theater to get the whole experience. The CGI was spectacular and didn't leave you feeling drunk off of it in the end.I found myself getting lost in the "what if's"... like, what the bad guy had control of... What if there were weaponry out there (like what the bad guy had control of) somewhere in deep space!! Probably one of the craziest type of weapon EVER in a scifi movie haha Really cool concept they came up with. Many other reasons this movie was one of the best scifi flicks I've seen. The visuals and direction was exceptionally awesome. Just enough humor in it for it not to fall flat on its face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old school charm paired with impeccable visual storytelling!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Paramount Pictures and Bad Robot, Producer J.J. Abrams once again returns audiences to the world of Captain Kirk aboard the U.S.S. Starship Enterprise (NCC-1701) in a film that encompasses much of what was loved about the original series/movies, and combines that soul with the film production technology of today. Despite the subdued anthropological subtext, which is one of the primary differences between the Star Trek and Star Wars universes respectively, this story will definitely keep you entertained with brilliant writing and a nostalgic feel. For long-time fans of the franchise that's been around since the 1960s, you will find that Abrams handles the settings and characters with care and respect. The third film in this reboot series, Star Trek: Beyond is one roller coaster of a ride that boasts a narrative pace that moves at warp speed. If there is one fallacy in the storytelling of this installment, in the Abrams reboot of the Gene Roddenberry classic, it is the lack of social commentary on the human condition that has been at the core of Star Trek since its creation. With a fantastic cast, incredibly strategic direction, and beautiful cinematography and visual effects, Star Trek: Beyond will whisk the audience away to the final frontier and "boldly go where no one has gone before."As a long-time Star Trek fan myself (TNG &amp; Voyager), one of the very first elements I picked up on at the beginning of this installment was the trademark bridge sound effects from the original Star Trek TV series. Employing a little suspension of disbelief, what with all the flat panels and touch screen displays and all, the bridge of the NCC-1701 Enterprise still boasts the old soul of the bridge that started a universe of adventures that continue to this day. Fortunately, visionary producer J.J. Abrams, director Justin Lin, and writers Simon Pegg &amp; Doug Jung craft a story that mostly takes what made the franchise so endearing and channel it into an exciting story for audiences today. From the characters to the dialog, and from the interpersonal interactions to the settings, this Star Trek movie effectively leads the reboot of the franchise in the right direction. Having just watched Abrams' Star Wars: the Force Awakens back in December, I was very curious as to how similar Beyond would look and feel as compared to the aforementioned. Forced to decline the director's chair for Star Trek: Beyond, Abrams turned the reigns over to Lin while still serving as the creative producer. Directing Star Wars and producing Star Trek could have left audiences with similar cinematic experiences; however, both movies are vastly different but provide fans with excellent additions to the respective universes.Prior to screening the movie, I was very skeptical going into it since the various trailers for the film were disappointing?looked like the film was going to be cheesy. To my surprise, the film was definitely not hokey and played out exceptionally well. Compared to the previous two films, I definitely like this one much more. That is mostly attributed to the fact that Beyond felt like a Star Trek movie. The previous two installments felt like a Star Trek movie taking place inside a Star Wars-esque universe. Hopefully, this film will redirect the reboot of the motion pictures in a direction more closely aligned with the original series and movies. With Star Wars and Star Trek trying to find their respective places in today's culture of media, entertainment, and gaming, it is important for both series to be distinctly different from one another. Now, I don't mean different stories or characters?obviously, that's a given by default?but I mean the feel of the stories needs to be unique. Star Wars is an action-adventure mostly concerned with good v evil and Star Trek is science-fiction that concerns itself, traditionally anyway, with the human condition. Both take place in the future, but are different experiences. There is demonstrable evidence in Star Trek: Beyond that the franchise is seeking to stay true to its roots in anthropology and psychology; whereas Star Wars: the Force Awakens is staying true to its roots in futuristic good v evil in a galaxy far, far away.From a technical perspective, the film is flawless; however, it would have been nice to have seen more practical effects and miniatures more so than digital effects, albeit, the effects were impressive. I appreciated the focus on the interpersonal relationships between the characters, and how it upstaged the actual conflict. Yes, the conflict in the story is important and is what drives the action, but it's the characters themselves that are the most important element in the narrative. Does this film shift the dominant focus off Star Wars and onto Star Trek? Not particularly. But does this movie pave the way for the Star Trek movies to be on par with the Star Wars movies? I believe that we could begin to witness that trend. Star Wars has the massive advantage of being owned by the Walt Disney Company; and therefore, TWDC is integrating that IP into the parks, cruise line, and merchandise. That is HUGE. Unfortunately, Star Trek does not benefit from being owned by a distribution company and legacy studio with theme park investments in the United States, anyway. Paramount did have amusement park investments, but sold them off to Cedar Fair many years ago. Perhaps the interest in the Star Trek movies and upcoming TV series in 2017 will generate a desire for this IP to become part of a themed entertainment property as well.Whether you are a fan of the original series or movies OR you are a new fan to the Star Trek universe, I feel confident that you will find much to enjoy in this newest installment in the Abrams reboot. Hopefully the film will perform well over the weekend and begin to generate an interest in the upcoming TV series as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No words can describe how amazing this film is! The prologue was a heartfelt sequence that gives us insight into Kirk's thoughts on the long span of time they were in space on their mission. The first part of the movie was an intense action sequence. Really heartbreaking to see the USS Enterprise being torn apart in that fashion. The movie was quite unpredictable and kept us on the edge of our seats. I would say, compared to the first 2 films, this film had no super impactful emotional scene. (that made me tear up) Probably because the scenes were too intense for tears to come out after that. The film ended with a lovely tribute to the old Star trek crew, Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin. The Star Trek films just keep getting better and better! Not going to spoil too much, so just go watch this in cinemas!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the first trailer that came out, I expected this movie to be like fury road. Boy was I wrong (the motorcycle was barely in it).Anyway, I REALLY enjoyed the first movie, and this one was almost as good. It didn't drag, didn't bore me, didn't set off my "that is stupid" alarms, and had a pretty cool plot line.No point in giving a lot of information, I'll just say if you enjoyed the other new Star Trek movies, you will enjoy this one.If you get all whiny about lens flares or some shaky cam in some heavy action scenes, you may have some beefs. If you can't follow half a dozen story lines, well, Star Trek probably isn't for you. But it was great, and I'll be buying it on blu-ray as soon as I can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a Trekkie since I can remember and I happily watch any TV show or movie, repeatedly, even the fan funded episodes with the eagerness of a true Star Trek fan. Without complaint, just happy to have it.With that out of the way Star Trek Beyond, for me, was a super cool movie. It was action packed, funny and with some outstanding special effects. I am so thankful to J.J for reigniting the series, and even though we now have a new director, it still had the wonderful light adventurous feel and look, (even the lens flares). It had some great scenes, some poignant and reflective, others just plain funny. Lots of in-jokes and a few pop culture references. I had to chuckle at the Comandeer Paris line since I am currently watching 'Voyager' in my spare time. And the scene with Spock and Dr McCoy on the planet has become my favourite Star Trek scene, EVER!!!So, if you're after a great fun time at the movies go watch Star Trek Beyond. I can't wait to see it again. So being a 'true Trekkie' I give it a 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Justin Lin (director) spoiled this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie opened with spectacular graphical allure that I appreciated, but the new director failed to capture the emotion and angst that J.J. Abrams provided in the first two movies. There were too many stolen scenes from other movies and he failed spectacularly to tie up loose ends. He tried to duplicate the angst and "just in time saves" that JJ did so well. Although it wasn't completely sad, it definitely didn't have the luster and shine of the first two. Where the first two drew tears at times it feels like a half hearted effort was made and generally felt like a watered down version. As a Star Trek super fan I will always watch every movie, but next time I will watch out for who is directing before I decide to do it in cinema or at home :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely a step down from the previous movie. Weird plot holes... Did Ambassador Spock fly through the black hole with his photo album?You have a solid cast here and yet it feels so hurried that all you get is a taste of them, even Kirk. A wasted villain who should have been able to take out Yorktown without using the deadly MacGuffin. An inability to convey a menacing mood like we had with Cumberbatch's Khan. The relationship development between Spock and McCoy was a rare bright spot. The irony is Kirk talking about his life becoming episodic, and yet some episodes of ST:TOS or ST:TNG have more substance than this film. This one is for SF fans only. Pity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want a movie that has a lot of action, fighting and graphics, this is the movie for you. If you want a well developed plot and good acting, it just doesn't deliver. The acting is uneven. The Spock character seems to do the best job and is believable. Some of the others seem like they are at times still reading from the script. The old original Star Trek movies had well defined relationship stories in them but in this, it seems like the characters are secondary to the graphic presentations and fighting scenes. I would even say they don't click together like the original cast. So, to me it was entertaining to a certain extent, but disappointing in that the plot was not as developed as it could have been. The actress who played the "helper" in the end did seem to be very strong and believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different but still a fun popcorn flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a bit of a different Star Trek film compared to the previous two rebooted installments that was directed by J. J. Abrams. And although I think J. J. Abrams is the better director and still think the previous 2 installments are better. This film didn't didn't disappoint, as a matter of fact it tries to aim for the traditional Trekkies that are going to view this film. Which can be a hit or a miss for this franchise, because not everyone that sees this film is going to be a Trekkie. I am not a Trekkie myself, but I appreciated the effort they put into bringing out the traditional Star Trek elements from the TV shows into this. Which includes a bit of campiness during few of the scenes. This installment doesn't try to go into a emotional and dark area but more into the purpose driven direction that revolves around existentialism. And yet it still is a fun popcorn flick that was actually fun to sit through. I watched this movie in 4D thinking it would really add to the experience. Since it's Star Trek, which deals with space ships and space travels. But I wouldn't recommend it, it actually detracted from the experience when it comes to the story instead of making the experience more immersive. I liked the cinematography from the previous two films, but I really did enjoy the creativity behind the camera work in this one. When it comes to the camera work, Justin Lin and Stephen F. Windon really seemed to have put in quite a bit of effort into the creativity of zooming in and out, moving from place to place. Especially during the scenes where the USS Enterprise gets invaded and the crew runs around trying to fight back and escape. Unfortunately Idris Elba is wasted in this as Krall, his motivation as a villain wasn't built up all that well. He reminded me of Big Boss from the "Metal Gear Solid" franchise when he becomes the villain but without the charisma and influential presence. Even the final face off scene between Kirk and Krall just seemed rushed. It's like they just added a villain in this one, just for the sake of having a villain to invade the USS Enterprise. Overall thought, this is a fun flick and it does have one of the best action sequence in the franchise so far...It's the part where the song Sabotage starts up. For a third installment it still isn't stale.RIP Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin.7.3/10</fullReview>

I am not saying the movie was bad, I thought it was pretty good but it should be so much better. The cast, as always, is excellent I just felt the script was loose. This was an epic about Bones, Scotty and the Blonde-alien-girl-wearing all the make-up. Spock and Kirk parts are not needed. For that matter, the bad guy is not needed. It was like the script wasn't even. written in time for all that special effects stuff. I wish I could put my finger on it, but interest almost seemed to dwindle. Ah well, Hollywierd never listens.

		<fullReview>I was raised on Star Trek re-runs and original TNG episodes. As a child born in the very late 70s, Star Trek in its various incarnations was an important part of my journey through adolescence. This film, however, offered very little of benefit to me.Justin Lin's camera style gave me nausea. I saw this coming, and was not disappointed. What was a brilliant script by Simon Pegg became largely incoherent under Lin's directorship. Uhura was under-utilized, Sulu's relationship and openly gay status was fascinating but not really developed in the film. Pine was, and pardon the pun, a bit wooden in his acting. The film relied too heavily on camera gimmicks and special effects.I still believe that it is possible to make a great Star Trek film. Plot holes and the systemic destruction of all that Gene Roddenberry and Rick Berman had created aside, Into Darkness came closest to being a great film altogether. Beyond had that capacity, but Justin Lin blew it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Witty dialogue paired with good unique cinematography and decent visual effects, Star Trek Beyond delivers on many "box-office" checklist fronts. However the film falls short emotionally with uneven pacing, weak story progression and lackluster character development. I'll start with the good. Witty dialogue. I'll credit this ti Simon Pegg who co-wrote. Spock and Bones really carry the movies soul with good banter that consisted within the first two in the trilogy. Unique Cinematography. It was good to see a new take on Star Trek. J.J gave us lens flares, that although they kinda look ridiculous do give the first two a distinct look. Justin Lin mounted camera angles in CG and practical to the enterprise and a cool bike sequence that kept the movement fresh. The film was on Par visually with the first two, with great production design set on an alien world. Good performances by the majority of the cast helped keep the film grounded in an alien environment and held the context of events to a sense of believability. Now the bad. Poor Villain. The villain in Beyond played by Idris Elba was a step down from Nero played by Eric Banner and Khan played by Benedict Cumberbatch. The character never felt menacing, his arc although reversed was still clich and felt unbelievable. His presence in the film was underwhelming both in physical stature and script. Next. Poor Character Development. The arcs of the existing characters felt lackluster besides that of Spock and Bones relationship bonding. New characters were barely fleshed out including the villain, his right hand man (who felt extremely tacked on for an excuse for a fight scene) and the new Heroine Jaylah, played by Sofia Boutella. Although this new heroine seemed fun and interesting on the surface the inconsistencies within her character were revealed as the stories progressed, an opportunity missed in my opinion.In conclusion, the movie was a well executed fun cinema flick, however I never felt truly invested in the characters' journey. I never felt that the characters were threatened by the villain, however I did like the premise of the story. It all felt like a really good TV episode with Hollywood budget rather than a fleshed out movie. 7/10 good try Justin not quite at J,J's level yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Getting' there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A short review, because - to be honest - you get what you expect. Star Trek is not a movie-sort of franchise. It is at it's best in (some) TV series. This is why it clearly lags widely when it's movies are compared with, for instance, Star Wars. So when you go to see a Star Trek movie at the cinema you will be served a watered down product with the Star Trek flavor. The universe is huge and the exploring of the final frontier is, mainly, uneventful. So when you want to make a movie where the whole time something incredible is happening, you are bound to have a lot of plot holes and inconsistencies... or wild coincidences at best. It's a pity that every movie has to end with some sort of boxing match between the main characters, but that's Hollywood today... Still, this movie has some nice dialogues and the characters are growing on me, so I liked it. It's not Star Trek at it's best, but they are (slowly) getting there. Even my wife sort of liked it... so go for it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Gene Roddenberry's legacy is nowhere to find in this film. This Star Trek movie feels more as a Marvel Comics flick than a Star Trek movie. One- dimensional characters, a whirlwind of imagery, a meager story and over the top villains and hero's. A true Star Trek movie for me is one with a nice story, sound science, a spec of humor, real characters, and last but not least; always in search of the human condition. Star trek is more than the sum of episodes and movies, its a way of thinking, and inspired millions of people -personal and professional- to make the world a better place. The brightest people off all humanity, like Stephen Hawking, NASA scientists, all love Star Trek. If Director Justin Lin had seen all of the Star Trek series and movies, he would never made such a terrible -for me- horrible movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Into Darkness and the Preview</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(spoilers) I went into Beyond with low expectations and it surprised nicely. This movie's trailer was abominable to the series, and so I wasn't expecting much. I cringed when the related Beastie Boys music showed, but it wasn't horrendously bad. Luckily the movie is better than its trailer. It is not a masterpiece by director Lin, but it manages to be fairly entertaining. The adversaries have good design and great makeup along with the look and the imagined settings. Spock though was poorly underwritten in Beyond. While Quinto helped keep the 1st in the new series good, he and Spock have been sidelined more in Beyond. Spock has always been the centerpiece of TOS and was so in the reboot, so there was mild disappointment. Indeed Karl Urban's Bones gets much of the screen-time and the mostly one-note humor. So while the visuals are excellent and story serviceable, the direction seems a bit lacking and acting flat sometimes. Still a decent entertaining outing. Around 7/10 - recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Trek fan's perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of the original series. What I came to love about it (rather than the Roddenberry vision of the future) was the individual quirks of the characters and the ways they interacted with each other. Those aspects developed over time, as you watched from episode to episode. It felt very organic and rarely artificial or forced. In the movies with the original cast, those elements started to feel forced with the 4th movie and got worse with each new movie thereafter (to me, anyway). My enjoyment diminished accordingly.In the new movie series, there have been only a few moments where the characters and their relationships have drawn me in. Besides that, I'm sorta put off by the "impressions" of some the characters, like they are trying to channel the original actor.Having said all that, this third movie (to me) seemed to include more of the classic relational aspects than the two previous. But I struggled with the feeling that they were being forced, drawing upon history that the original characters/actors lived through and developed over time, but that these new versions had not achieved in their own right. To be fair though, how could they in the really short lifespan they have had in this new movie franchise (a total of 6-7 hours over three movies now)? Finally, having said all that and more, I can affirm that by the end of the movie, I really liked it--but not until the end (and pretty much for the reasons I laid out in the first paragraph).Bottom line: If you are a Star Trek, I think there's no question but that you must see it. And like all the rest of us, you'll decide for yourself if it's a worthy entry into the larger ST-verse.</fullReview>

AAAAAAAGH!!!!production values... check. casting... check. sexy new alien.... check. banter.... check (sort of, sometimes). pacing... check, i guess. visually stunning sets.... check. but star trek? no, no, no, no no no. this is a sci-fi action film that happens to use characters from the abram's cast.the villain is bland and the plot uninspired. oh, no, the galaxy/enterprise is in danger. granted that's going to be part of any plot line here, probably, but how it's executed does make a difference. did they do even one thing to continue the expansion/reimagining of the star trek universe? did they, for instance, pick a thread out of "into darkness" and start to develop the human/klingon conflict plot line? did they make good and interesting use of their talented supporting players? not even close. no real character evolution. lots of exposition for disposable characters, though, done in what is frequently the least interesting way--the character merely relating details of their history (without even good dialogue or tension to add to the moment).sorry... i've been a fan since TOS... i loved abram's vision. i was saddened to see this release and i hope it doesn't kill the franchise, but i also hope it's not a sign of things to come.as a final word... anton, you will be missed. regardless of the ultimate quality of this film, your marvelous contribution as ensign chekov and many other creative works will stand testament to your considerable talent and gift to all who enjoyed them. taken from us far too young.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I want to give it more - but couldn't in good conscience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going right into it: Star Trek can be a controversial franchise. Like so many other things many will love it or hate it simply based on the name. Add to that, that there is a legacy to uphold for the entire universe AND this is a reboot of said universe.Those are a lot of bars to overcome. And, for the most part, Beyond achieves that - and is able to do so on its own without having to immerse oneself in Star Trek lore.Out of the 13 Star Trek movies, this solidly belongs on the on the better half, nearer the top than not. Not inasmuch as this movie is especially great, but remember Star Treks 1,3,5,7,9,10,12. That's not to say that each didn't have their moments. But...Beyond has a lot to offer: the acting in the crew is by far the best of the reboot. There are a lot of good action scenes and special effects and elements of sci-fi. For the 'classic Trekkie' there's also a lot to offer in the way of homages and memorial. And the sound track is as solid as its two predecessors.That said, there are still enough plot holes to hold the movie back. And while much of the action was well done, much could have been edited away without loss to the overall film. Lastly, the film sought to accomplish more than it could - it's ambitions were high, but it still felt lacking.Perhaps that's the hardest part to quantify. Yes, plot holes needed closing - but beyond that, I don't know exactly what the film needed to be better than it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Returns to the series roots in style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review, so bear with me. I'm a Sci-fi nut, I'll confess, and a huge fan of all Star Trek iterations. After a disappointing reveal trailer I was skeptical, but I can safely say that this film blew me away.The film focuses more on the crew this time, drawing similarities with the Mass Effect series, and I actually felt sympathy for the poor red shirts who got smoked early in the film. Idris Elba's villain is suitably menacing, and Sofia Boutella's character was a good addition to the crew. The FX were top notch as was the acting, and I was immensely pleased by the way the film handled the death of Leonard Nimoy.All in all, a well deserved 8/10 and I will sorely miss Anton Yelchin in the inevitable sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Trek BeyondI had a wonderful experience watching the latest Star Trek. I'll get out of the way that I'm a Star Wars fan first. That being said there were moments in this new one that made me smile really wide. The film is not without some flaws, some minor and some major. Overall my experience was good.Direction: the camera working and angles they shot were intentionally disorienting. Also some of the cgi was off. Much of it was spot on, but some of the creatures didn't look at all real. The action/intense scenes were great which is something that Justin Lin is know for with the Fast and Furious.Writing: you can really tell which scenes were written by Simon Pegg and which ones were done by Doug Jung. I didn't watch Dark Blue, and now a part of me doesn't feel it would be up to stuff.The dialogue between Karl Urban's 'Bones' and Zachary Quinto's Spock was spot on. Chris Pine has some brief moments as the film seems more focused on the entire crew rather than Chris Pine as the main character. I enjoyed that.Simon Pegg's 'Scotty' and Sofia Boutella's 'Jaylah' had some great scenes together and I'll leave it at that to avoid spoilers.Verdict: All in all I had a good experience and if you can watch it in theaters, do so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A return to form for the new crew, that pays great homage to the classic series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a moment in the film, in which the young Spock looks at a photograph from the classic crew, that belonged to old Spock. It was a wonderful, wonderful scene, that for me captured the whole essence of the new Star Trek movie. In the 50th year of Star Trek, this was a perfect homage to the classic series, that manages to find it's very own look and feel at the same time. The movie starts with the crew, and especially Captain Kirk, lost in space. After three years out there, Kirk feels tired and exhausted of the mission. However, his brooding thoughts about leaving the Enterprise are heavily interrupted, as the crew is attacked by an alien force and strands on a distant planet. Kirk, Spock and the rest of the crew discover, that the alien leader Krall is trying to get hold of a weapon, that could destroy the entire federation. What this movie gets perfectly right, is the balance and chemistry between the different crew members. In contrast to his predecessor "Into Darkness", which was mainly centered around Kirk and Spock, this one is more of an ensemble piece, in which every character gets his moment to shine. Simon Pegg has written a witty script and Justin Lin manages to make good use of it. The plot paces along, there are some good character moments and some fantastic nostalgic moments to spice it up in year 50 of the franchise. The sets, costumes, hair dresses all feel very "classic series", but still modern. This was truly excellent work from the team. You can criticize, that Idris Elba is being a bit underused here, but he still makes a very good villain. Also, some plot devices do not work very well, like the strange alien woman, that gets the whole movie going with her distress signal. But these points do not harm the joy of Star Trek Beyond, which is a great sci-fi-movie with a finale, that is pure rock'n roll!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**NO SPOILERS** I like the movie, don't be quick to judge me on the Summary (title) that I game. I really did like the movie the CGI landscapes and futuristic technology shown in it were awe inspiring...WHEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE IT. With the sweeping camera shots with EVER SINGLE wide shot you can't see any of it clearly because on screen that translates into a blurred moving picture. The only shot that was clear in a real wilderness shot that was done slowly with, you guess it, a panning wide shot. There IS NOT A SINGLE SCENE that isn't a set camera. The action shots were done, I am guessing, by tossing a camera down a hill and then given to the CGI teams to put in graphics with what came out of it. The action scenes have more KICKING AND SLAPPING OF THE CAMERA than the actual people in the fight. When the shots over the city or of the gadget clicking into a holder is done with so much spinning I felt like I was watching Twister again and I got sucked up into the vortex. At this point I started contemplated WHERE I SHOULD THROW UP. I thought, "should I pour the soda out and vomit into the cup. What would people think?" then I looked at the popcorn bag but it was still half full and I thought it would not keep the vomit contained well. YES I LITERALLY THOUGHT ABOUT WHERE I SHOULD THROW UP.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just left the new Trek movie and really enjoyed it. It actually felt like a long TOS episode (with a MASSIVE budget, lol) because it got back to the relationships between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy...at first I didn't like Idris Elba as the 'bad guy', but by the end, when they reveal who his character is, and why he's doing what he's doing, I liked him...I enjoyed the role of Jaylah (even though she's Rey from Star Wars: TFA), thought the Sulu being gay thing was VERY low key, and flowed naturally from the story...plenty of eye candy space battles (spoilers ahead!), including blowing up the enterprise, and using an old NX class ship (albeit from the 'alternate time-line', so it's a little different) and space station Yorktown was really cool...Insurrection and Nemesis (last of the 'old guard' Trek movies) don't hold a candle to these new reboot movies... I give it 7.5 out of 10, or 3/4 stars (since 7.5 is not an option, I'm bumping it up to 8)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Trek Beyond, the third installment in the recently rebooted Star Trek film franchise has arrived, and it's definitely the most spectacular of the three.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Beyond, the crew of the USS Enterprise are halfway through a five year mission exploring deep space, when they are drawn in to help save a missing ship and it's crew, only to be attacked by the villainous Krall (Idris Elba), who is on a mission to secure a death-dealing artifact from Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and the crew of the Enterprise. Kirk, Spock (Zachary Quinto), Bones (Karl Urban), Scotty (Simon Pegg) and newcomer Jaylah (Sofia Boutella) must all band together under great odds to defeat him.As far as stories go, it's not a very original or intriguing one. The screenwriters have played it safe and stuck to a formula that works, whilst focusing primarily on the spectacle of the whole thing. That's not to say the story is bad in any way, just don't go expecting something you've never seen before. The villain is also a bit lacking when it comes to the motivation department. Again, it's a pretty basic reason why he's out to hurt the Enterprise crew and we saw this happen in 2009's Star Trek, with the lackluster villain Nero, played by Eric Bana in that film.Nevertheless, Idris Elba is outstanding in the role of Krall, especially under all of that heavy makeup. The returning cast of Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, the late Anton Yelchin, John Cho and Zoe Saldana are all fantastic, which is what's expected when you consider they've played these characters twice before, and now have the experience to bring their characters to life in a believable fashion, while staying true to their distinct personalities. The new recruit to the team, Jaylah, played by Sofia Boutella is a standout of the film. Her story is probably the one you can empathize with the most and it's mostly due to her delivery.One of the biggest highlights of Star Trek Beyond is seeing how far the overall character development has come. After the first two films, the relationships between the characters have come into their own and it really shows on screen. It makes up for where the story suffers, as we can really connect with the characters and forge an attachment to them based on the actors' performances.The other big highlight of the film is the epic action, which comes at no surprise considering the film is directed by Justin Lin, who's had huge success directing three films in the Fast &amp; Furious franchise. Justin Lin has nailed the art of high-flying, edge- of-your-seat action and it shows here in this film as well, just based in space. The set pieces are huge, extravagant, fast-paced and completely intriguing.In 2009's Star Trek (which rebooted the series), director J.J. Abrams managed to provide an entertaining, well balanced film that warped the classic Trek time-line to suit the direction he wanted to go in with the new films. He gave us an excellent new cast that fit so well it's hard to imagine replacing any of them. In 2013's Star Trek Into Darkness, Abrams once again upped the ante, providing us with bigger and louder effects and sequences and by casting Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead villain role. Star Trek Beyond is the natural result culminating from the first two films, where Lin had to go even bigger and louder, but also got to really have fun with it. In that regard, he succeeded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. The trailer looked pretty poor. The movie is actually rather good. There are some plot holes but it is enough fun to let them go and enjoy the great work of the Enterprise crew as they turn certain death around once again. The cast, again give some excellent performances - the Spock / McCoy relationship is given a good workout as you might expect. New characters are generally well introduced and well used, though it might have been good to actually see a little more of the wonderful Idris Elba. There are some really affective, postmodern nods to the world of Trek in the first 20 minutes or so and another at the end, that will have old-school Trekkers welling up. Over all, it is a romp that never lets its pace flag. Effects are top- quality and I, for one, hope there will be more in the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Trek Beyond gets back to what the reboot does well. It tells a fun action story that acknowledge the past but also that times have changed since then. Hardcore fans of the original series were never going to like this and neither are people who dislike JJ Abrams. If you go into this movie wanting to hate it you won't be disappointed you never are. However if you go in without any preconceived ideas then you might like it. It is a fun action movie in its own right but it also tells a fairly good story. Three years into the crews five year mission Captain Kirk is doubting his place among the crew and the federation. He is just tired of the routine of space. When the ship docks at a newly designed space station he considers a promotion then the crew is sent on what appears to be a rescue mission but ends up being a whole lot more. This story works on several levels for me. Where Into Darkness made the mistake of trying to tell the story of what was arguably the best of the original movies this remember's the past by simple acts of nostalgia. No one is ever going to forget that this is a reboot of a cult series so the movie doesn't either and yet it is smart enough to tell its own story that is relevant to our time. This may not be as good as the first of the reboot but it gets itself back on track for any further reboots that may come..,.beyond this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action, entertaining, and good CGI. Questionable plot and planning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, I think in terms of entertaining, the film did a sufficient job of that. Plenty of action. There are two areas though that I must comment on. The first is the references to Spock and the real Enterprise crew from TOS. While I understand the first instance where Spock (Nimoy) is mentioned, it seems out of place in the film, as it doesn't really tie into the plot as much as I had hoped. The second instances towards the end when young Spock is going through a chest, that one seems to be out of place as well. As for the film as a whole, I'm not sure where it fits in the Star Trek timeline. I guess that's the other problem I have with the film. Granted, the Star Trek franchise is huge, and they have covered many different series, and (for the most part) they all align with each other. But it seems that in the three Star Trek films so far, at least some of the timeline has been "stretched" a bit to make the story work (for example, the death of Spock's mother in the first film--but we should keep in mind that it is noted (somewhere) that Sarek had three wives over his lifetime, so this may still align with the rest of the Star Trek films and timelimes). Other than those two concerns, the film was interesting, and entertaining for the most part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Trek-y of the New Trek Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has often been said that Abrams modern Star Trek films are just Star Wars stories with a Star Trek facade. Beyond, the third entry in the Star Trek prequel franchise, is much closer to what universe-pioneer Gene Roddenberry created: a character driven narrative as worried about ideas as it is adventure. Screenwriter Pegg has penned a story more akin to the original series and movies, only with a modern skin; a welcome reprieve from the "cover song" movies Abrams helmed. That inherent Star-Trek-iness may make it a bit less accessible to larger audiences, but its cool confidence will please millions of fans. By becoming more like the original series, it's surprisingly less beholden to specific lores within the universe (original Spock, reboot of Khan). Instead, we get a beautifully written opening Captain's Log about purpose, followed by a Titanic-esque destruction of the Enterprise, character survival team-ups (Bones and Spock buddy film please!) and a brand new breed of cool alien villainry. The plot is effectively mind-bending, and the big action visuals are propulsive. The cast, however, is still the star of the show, with the returning actors falling into their characters like a cozy old spacesuit, and newcomers shining brightly. With Pegg's script, I can't help but wonder what Edgar Wright could've done with this film, but still director Lin filled the filmmaking captain's chair with ease and assuredness. He found a way to please both my modern movie-buff cynicism and the 12-year-old nerd that lives right underneath that. Beyond is (arguably) the best Star Trek film since the original cast departed in the early 90s; visually impressive, carefully plotted, and philosophically stirring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, while may be drawing on some elements of past Star trek stories, Star Trek Beyond was pretty good. While fast paced and action driven, the two new characters introduced Jaylah (Sofia Boutella) and Idris Elba's Krall are really pretty good... particularly Jaylah who comes across as a female action hero, the sort of role that Star Trek has never really embraced (so it's hoped that her character carries on, perhaps to replace Chekov). The dialogue is perhaps more witty than usual, with Simon Pegg's writing, and I find the crew seem to getting into their roles perhaps more than usual. The effects are top notch and the production values and sets are spot on, though this is pretty standard for the Star Trek Movies. Justin Lin has done pretty well with Star Trek, he has acknowledged that he is a fan, as is Simon Pegg, - it's good to have them both together on the team. Overall, a may be a bit action oriented (though this will appeal to many) but I would actually just as good as the other movies, and a worthy addition to the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sequel Worth Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The GoodI was incredibly excited to see this film, especially considering how much I seriously enjoyed the first two in this new franchise, both directed by J.J. Abrams. While Abrams may have moved back to only producing, not directing, Beyond, his footprint is still all over this movie, and that is no way a bad thing. This film is an excellent blend of relatively new ideas mixed with exactly what was so great about the first two, and I thought Justin Lin brought his expertise (Fast &amp; Furious films) into this franchise and did a solid job directing.Chris Pine continues to shine as Captain James Kirk, being just as charismatic and enjoyable to watch as ever. Pine may be struggling to find his footing in some of his other films, but he has perfected the lead role in this massive franchise.All the returning cast members are great, with Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, and the late Anton Yelchin being the standouts. Quinto as Spock just feels right, and his quick comedic moments, as well as some well-done emotion just show how well he fits the character. Urban may have been the funniest character in the film, as he nails the vast majority of his jokes as Bones while also being an interesting character to watch. Seeing Yelchin on screen was a bittersweet feeling for very obvious reasons, but I'm happy to say that he is fantastic in his final chance to play as Chekov.The action and the comedy that has worked so well in the first two films of this franchise are back and as good as any installment before it. While I enjoyed how much it stuck with what I loved, I did enjoy the new characters, especially the villain played by Idris Elba. No spoilers, but one specific scene in this movie that I will call the "Sabotage" scene, may be one of my favorite moments in a movie this year.The BadWhile I said I liked how familiar this movie felt to its predecessor, there is a pretty constant feel of familiarity from start to finish. Not that the energy and style of these movies are getting stale, but I do feel that Justin Lin had a shot to make this series go in a much different direction, but instead he just went a little off course and stayed in Abrams' lanes. Because of all this, sometimes Beyond just falls under the shadow of the incredible 2009 film.The film takes quite a bit of time to pick up in pace, and I found myself pretty bored for the first fifteen to twenty minutes. Besides that, there's just some small scenes here and there that feel like they don't belong in the rest of the movie, either for being out of place or for being simply uninteresting.ConclusionStar Trek Beyond is a much-needed blast of energy in this incredibly dull summer film season. The action and visuals are a delight, as are all of the performances, and director Justin Lin does a solid job at not only keeping this film franchise moving but at making a truly entertaining film to watch. It may not be as great as the two films that came before it, and it all may seem familiar, but more of the same is perfectly fine with me when it comes to this series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the new Trek movie I've been waiting for; one where I didn't just love the cast, but the actual movie (and also the cast). It even does a few things I thought were impossible, like making me leave with Kirk in the running for my favorite character. For the first time, including in the TV series, I really feel like we get to see the ballsy, tactical genius that warrants the legend Kirk is supposed to become, and I've gotta hand it to Chris Pine because this time around he knocks it out of the park, as does everyone else in the cast. Beyond is still very much an action movie first at its core, but it finally has the heart that the others lacked to make it really feel like a Trek film (funny how replacing someone who doesn't care about the series with Simon Pegg will do that). One of my problems with the previous movies is that I kept feeling like ridiculous things would happen for no reason other than JJ Abrams thought "wouldn't it be _awesome_ if...", without regard for whether it actually contributed to the story or, you know, made sense. I always left feeling like my intelligence had been insulted a bit (or more than a bit). This movie doesn't just avoid those ridiculous things, it does them, and then actually pays them off. Like, three or four times I started thinking to myself "oh movie, you were doing so well, but now you're trying too hard to be cool again, and it's totally not going to wo-- HOLY CRAP THAT WORKED AND MADE SENSE AND WAS Awesome". There are also little nods in memory of both Nimoy and Yelchin, and a couple of well-placed love letters to the franchise as a whole that... well, let's just say there was a lot of dust in the theater by the end. To sum up: Simon Pegg and company get it. The new Trek cast finally has a movie worthy of them, and it's about damn time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beyond is well, beyond my expectations. This is a polished, well directed, well acted film that has a mostly decent storyline that fits beautifully into the Star Trek universe. To my mind the key reason this film works, is there are no pretensions. Its a sci fi action film and it sticks very sanely and sensibly to this formula. The pacing is good and it manages to capture the essence of the original series and transfer it to a new generation of films, with new faces but familiar characters. There's a little nostalgia thrown too, that pays gently tribute to the late Leonard Nimoy and doffs its hat to the of the original films cast, including lead actor William Shatner. Perhaps the only criticism I can make and its a small one, is the story is a little weak towards the end, particularly as it relates to the key villain of the piece. Its simply does not hold together all that well or to my mind, make a lot of sense. Nonetheless, this is for the most part an excellent film you must see, if you are Star Trek fan or for that matter, even if you are simply someone who likes sci fi in general. Nine out of ten from me.</fullReview>

That was little disappointing, but overall it's really fun movie. I haven't watched old movies of Star Trek, so it's little bit hard to get old references that related to old movies. Entire case gives their best performance, they are really comfortable in their respective roles. Character's comic timing is also good. Third movie is most humorous installment of the rebooted series. Content of this movie feels like fresh air in this season. I just heard that they are planning fourth movie, that's a relief.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, fast pace sci-fi adventure that feels like an extended episode of the classic series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After being attacked by a huge swarm of unknown ships the crew of the Starship Enterprise are separated and spread across a mysterious planet, there they must search for each other and battle a new villain who is against all that the federation stands for.Star Trek: Into Darkness was well received when first released but afterwards many fans changed their opinions and it began to receive less than lukewarm feelings from people who went back to watch it, due to it's non Star Trek feel. So with new writers (Simon Pegg and Doug Jung) and a new director (Justin Lin, known for directing some of the Fast and Furious films) is Star Trek Beyond able to recapture the original feeling of Star Trek? Yes, it more than does this. In fact this ,the third film in the new series of Star Trek movies, feels like an extended episode from the original series. There is a lot of fun to be had with this film and in all honesty it might actually have a running time that is just over two hours but when watching it the pace is so fast and the action is so well shot the running time only seems to be just over 45 minutes. Another thing that new director Lin has been able to successfully do is bring the audience into the actual adventure, the audience doesn't just watch the film they are almost taking part, they are made to feel as if they are in the same world, the exact same situations as the characters causing them to not only laugh along with them when there are comedic moments ,which nearly always hit the right mark, but also feel involved in the action and the adventure. The chemistry between all the characters is always on top form and all actors clearly get on well making the on screen chemistry more realistic especially between Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Bones (Karl Urban). The characters of Spock and Bones ,helped by Pegg and Jung's script, go together so well creating a really well thought out and timed double act while still keeping the frame of the original characters, still providing the much needed action and adventure that is vital to this sort of film. As for the Visual Effects ,next to Ghostbusters, they are some of the best to be seen on the big screen this year and go towards creating an even greater sense of realism and once again pulling the audience in with immense ease.Fans will be pleased by this new entry into the Star Trek series, because Star Trek Beyond not only feels like a successful extended episode but the acting, story, characters, action, effects and so much more go towards creating a fun, crowd pleasing sci-fi adventure.**** &lt;-- Four Stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first trailer made me say 'Fast Warp, Furious Phasers' will kill Star Trek...then I watched it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fun. Huh, would you look at that. I had fun! I didn't expect I would but I did! I've been a Trekkie for thirty five years and I honestly thought Star Trek was going to just devolve into another mindless, Bay-esque popcorn consumption tool...especially when I saw the first trailer. My heart sank. Just as with Ghostbusters recently, I didn't let the trailer dissuade me (or the enormous campaign of smear that Sony pictures set in motion. Crappy movie? No problem, just call anyone who doesn't like it sexist. Pathetic. I was PLEADED to, for Pete's sake, by the main actresses of Ghostbusters during the trailer reel before the BFG. 'Please go see our movie, it's awesome! Girl Power!', they begged. Disgraceful use of every trick under the sun, Sony and if you continue to bankroll garbage like it or Adam Sandler's crew you will become even more of a laughing stock than you already are and not even PlayStation division will be able to prop you up), I went in with no expectations and asked to be entertained. Unlike with Ghostbusters, I was. Lots of great references for the fans, great dialogue, taught actions sequences. My only gripe was a slightly underdeveloped bad guy and the shoe horned SJW bait of Sulu now being gay for no good reason. He just is now, a move that even George Takei thought was 'disappointing'. I guess you just have to have crap like that to appease those people checking off their bizarre quotas these days. Or not, completely without merit. Fantastic film, though. Star Trek is back!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved it! more please!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film? I half heartedly watched ALL the old trek growing up, from TOS to Voyager but never really got into them. Till I went to see 'Into Darkness' at the cinema. And finally saw what all the fuss was about. Since then, I've watched them all again with new eyes? but I have to say. Beyond is the best film from the whole franchise. I loved it!Action, adventure, finally a good use of all the cast, the graphics were astounding; the plot just kept running through the whole film with hardly a pause for breath.There were some goofy bits, but I forgive what little there was.I thought it was original, fun and thrilling.It's baffling to me how some people don't like it.Also, little spoiler? I never felt sorry for the Enterprise before? omg, I do now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun action flick as well as comedy. The series keeps getting better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This new Star Trek series has been debated by many as being good or bad. With the majority leaning toward the favorable side of the spectrum, I must say that I am on that side with them. Star Trek continues to improve with each installment. While it has not been something absolutely mind blowing, it is entertaining nonetheless. 'Star Trek Beyond' did a great job at involving Kirk's large crew in each of their respective screen times. Sofia Boutella did a fantastic job as Jaylah. Each time she was on screen, I was highly entertained by her character. I was a big fan of all the action that was in the film as well as the comedic moments that are inputted in many various scenes all throughout the film. One thing I did laugh to myself about was the large amount of dark environments that occurred during the film and I joked to myself thinking that this one should have been titled 'Star Trek Into Darkness' versus the second installment being titled 'Star Trek Beyond', but that is just me. Overall, a greatly entertaining film and a great installment to the series. I do not foresee this series dying out anytime soon as long as it keeps up this trend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great, But Very Busy, Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took me a second viewing to really appreciate this movie. Perhaps that's because the first time I saw it my mind was other places and it was hard to concentrate. Or perhaps it's because I hadn't seen the first two in the reboot series since "Into Darkness" came out three years ago. Or perhaps it's because there's just a lot going on in this film. Whatever the case, the first time I saw it I wasn't overly impressed. Indeed, my friends all agreed as we left the theater that the first two films, directed by J.J. Abrams, were both better than this third installment in the series which is now under new leadership.Still, the movie was good enough to inspire me to go back and watch the first two films over again, and those two are such great movies that they inspired me to give "Beyond" a second chance. And I have to say that I'm really glad that I did. This movie is actually on pretty even ground with the first two movies?it's just that there's a lot going on and you have to pay attention throughout to keep up. That's especially true if you're someone like me who is the casual Star Trek fan but not a huge enthusiast, and so you might be trying to remind yourself who all the characters are and what species certain different aliens are along the way.One thing that was especially confusing for me was the alien race of the main antagonist, Krall. Throughout the film his species is not revealed until closer to the end. Without spoiling anything there, the thing is that there were other folks with Krall throughout the movie?like his female minion that boards onto the Enterprise and follows Kirk and Chekov for some time. The point here is that his species eventually is revealed, but when it is it leaves the identity of his fellow antagonists sort of up in the air. I also found myself confusing the aforementioned female member of Krall's group with a random Star Fleet alien at one point (the latter has crab legs for hair, and looks a lot like the other female alien I mentioned).I guess the point with all this is that there are some things that the movie leaves a bit unanswered or up to the imagination. Those things are not necessarily plot holes, but they are left open to debate.Despite that point of contention, the film is strong overall. There is some sense in which it feels the most like an episode of a Star Trek TV show rather than a movie?its scope feels a bit more self contained, so to speak, than the two previous movies which were an origin story and a continuation of that origin event, respectively. This movie is the first of the reboots in which the Enterprise is officially on its five year mission to explore uncharted space, and so, again, the film takes on a different feel. It's not a bad one?just different.All this having been said, I've given this movie 8/10 stars, having given 10 and 9 stars to its two predecessors. It's a great movie, but still my third favorite in the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will say when watching the film it didn't feel like an anniversary film and more of a somber one because of the passing of Leonard nimoy who passed during production and anton yelchin before the film release. However i will say in my personal opinion, it found the film to be a vast improvement over into darkness which felt more like a wrath of khan remake. The story deals with Kirk who is 3 years into the 5 year mission and growing restless of exploration considers promotion to vice admiral. Meanwhile Spock is considering a possible career change when he finds out about Spock prime passing. However Kirk and crew are stranded on an alien planet when the enterprise is crippled during an attack. I loved how the film had separate story lines for the cast while giving each something vital to do</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"There are numerous examples where terrorism has successfully promoted political change. Is it therefore not fair to say that terrorism is acceptable when all options for peaceful settlement have been foreclosed?" - Commander Data "We killed 20% of the population of Korea. 20 killed, everyday for 1100 days." - USAF General Curtis Lemay.Directed by Justin Lin, "Star Trek: Beyond" opens with one of its better scenes. Here Captain James Kirk (Chris Pine) of the United Federation of Planets attempts to broker a peace treaty with comically tiny aliens.Unfortunately, because no "Star Trek" movie can go two inches without ripping off Nicholas Meyer's "Wrath of Khan", Lin then gives us a familiar scene in which Kirk and his buddy, Doctor McCoy (an overacting Karl Urban), discuss "birthdays" and "getting old". Because Kirk looks like a teenager, because we barely know him, because we've seen better similar scenes in "Khan", and because we've never watched Pine's Kirk meaningfully grapple with regrets or the passage of time, this sequence feels exactly like what it is: a hack writer's attempt at pathos. The film was written by Simon Pegg.We're then introduced to Lieutenant Uhura and Commander Spock. They're having a rocky "romantic relationship"; a series of formulaic domestic disputes which the filmmakers mistake for "depth" and "substance". To hide the fact that she's been reduced to a nagging housewife, Uhura occasionally "subversively" kicks butt and "rescues men". But counter-clichs are still clichs.Kirk and his spaceship, the U.S.S Enterprise, then arrive at Starbase Yorktown. Emblematic of Federation values - cooperation, sharing, caring etc - Yorktown serves as a meeting place for different species. But where previous Trek bases looked elegant or functional, Yorktown looks like eye-candy for morons: unnecessarily busy, vulnerable and over-designed. The Enterprise docks with it, in a sequence which unintentionally flaunts much needlessly dangerous engineering.Kirk is then tasked with investigating a nebulae. Here the Enterprise is ambushed (why doesn't it warp away?) by thousands of vicious mining vessels; they decimate and destroy the Enterprise. Lin and Pegg offer the ship's destruction as a "big emotional moment", but it's not. This rebooted franchise has never treated the Enterprise as anything other than fodder for ridiculously powerful enemies. Unlike its previous incarnations, this Enterprise has no character, is not a home, never feels like an extension of its captain, and has never been something its crew could rely upon.And so our heroes escape to an alien planet. Here we're introduced to Krall (Idris Elba), an evil Starfleet officer who crashed on the planet hundreds of years ago. Krall blames the Federation for his abandonment. Yes, another vengeful super-villain.Things get stupider: Krall found a fountain of youth and an army of a gazillion mining drones. This fountain of youth allows Krall to "suck the life-force out of living beings" because apparently all modern super-villains must be contractually able to "steal your energy". More stupid is Krall's fleet of mining drones; instead of using them to fly home, Krall stays on this planet and embarks upon a 100 year quest to find an alien Mcguffin which Kirk randomly finds and which turns out to be an alien weapon. Krall wants to use this weapon to destroy the Yorktown, despite the fact that his drone fleet is much more powerful.Things get stupider. Because all adventures need a random local chick to help point the way, Kirk runs into Jaylah, an alien girl who lives in the cloaked wreckage of Krall's old spaceship. Why can't Krall find this ship? Doesn't he know where he landed his own ship? Doesn't its sudden disappeared throw up red flags? The film ends with the usual dogfights and fisticuffs. Throw in some ticking time-bombs, the Beastie Boys, much ignored property damage and a series of cliffhangers which would be easily avoided if our heroes simply used their transportation devices - and why are they still using spaceships? This franchise has made it clear that transporters can beam human beings across entire solar systems! - and you have one dumb, unimaginative climax.The film's final scenes see our crew inheriting another Enterprise, a moment which highlights how disposable and hasty everything in this franchise is. We also learn that Kirk turned down a promotion - he inexplicably jumps from kid to Captain to Vice Admiral in the blink of an eye - because he "enjoys being an explorer" and "hanging out with his buddies". But what this franchise says it's about and actually shows are completely at odds: we've never seen Kirk do anything other than engage in slaughter, carnage and mayhem. He's James Bond in space.And like Bond, "Star Trek: Beyond" is political in the worst ways. Here is a film in which an angry black terrorist decides to blow up a "bastion of democratic and co-operative values" because he "hates our freedoms" and "refuses to get with the times". In other words, like all mainstream Hollywood terrorists, Krall is an utterly irrational strawman without a coherent motive. He must thus be destroyed by our enlightened, multi-ethnic, tolerant, multi-coloured white boys, who apparently can't solve anything without themselves resorting to gigantic levels of violence and carnage. The film's politics might make sense in the context of its supposedly Utopian future - Star Trek is, after all, the product of 1960s hippies - but is mostly superficial and dangerous when overlain upon our real world. Ours is, after all, a world which deifies democracy, co-operation, multiculturalism, trans-nationalism, tolerance and the binding of all nations under a "common market", all for the purpose of ransacking nations and ecosystems, fostering class divisions, scapegoating, finding cheap labour and pushing down wages. Most major acts of barbarism over the past century have been hypocritically done in the name of the very values "Beyond" deifies. A better film would examine this.2/10 ? Highly illogical.</fullReview>

Action scenes are very well handled, cause this time it's directed by Justin Lin, who directed Fast 7. Performances don't disappoint either, from Elba, Pine, Quinto, and Pegg to name some.

		<shortDescription>Star Trek goes beyond.....mostly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a swarm of hit and misses for the 2016 Summer blockbuster season, Star Trek Beyond quietly but surely surges to the top of what the season has to offer. Beyond, the 13th in the ever ageless franchise brings the reboot series another well oiled addition. Positives: DIRECTING - New comer to the franchise Justin Lin brings his Fast and Furious expertise and shows them off incredibly well. He hits the mark on most occasions, showcasing he understands the source material well without diverting it away from what made the franchise iconic. ACTING - All actors involved play their part with expert precision, what makes the film so much enjoyable is seeing supporting characters received increased screen time over previous installments. SCRIPT - Simon and Doug's script is well written and adds smart character humour that makes character banter all the more fun to watch. TECHNICAL FEATS - From the films perfect score to its dazzling special effects, the films Audio/Visual qualities are top notch. Negatives: STORYLINE - Whilst exciting 1st and 3rd acts are fun to behold it is quite pedestrian in its ambitions particularly the films 2nd act which slows the film down. The film does feel like a 2 hour TV film due to it's structure. PREDICTABILITY - There were times where it became easy to read where the film was heading and how problems were going to be resolved. Film Highlight - The Enterprises deterioration and Krull's entranceFilm Lowlight - Sluggish second actWhat could have made the film better - Krull makes an impressive entrance to the film and really brings an energetic kick to the scene playing around him. But with most villains in cinema these day (see a good chunk of the Marvel Cinematic Universe villains for reference) he is no Darth Vadar/ Voldemort/ The Joker. Which is a shame as he fits perfectly into the Star Trek canon of Villains. A little more fleshing out and he would stand out from the crowd contending to enter into the same league as the ones listed above. In Conclusion: With so many intended blockbuster failing to impress this season, the latest Star Trek films flies from the beyond bringing with it a much-needed-tent-pole-franchise-boost to your local cinema. It's a well executed film that will satisfy all that associate the Star Trek brand as high quality entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Adventure, Plot Kinda If-fish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest installment of the franchise is packed with action and physical combat, and is an enjoyable enough adventure in itself, but breaks no new grounds in terms of sci-fi film- making nor advancing the Enterprise and it's crew in any longer term arc.The plot is kind of loopy and unconvincing, and one kinda of have to just ignore the weaknesses and just go with the action. The motivational element of the villain(s) is more of a 'really? That's it?" The Enterprise and its crew seems to have gone into 'unchartered' space rather carelessly and unprepared, and too easily overwhelmed. Also, Krall, the villain, could have simply threatened first to get the 'thingy' he wanted, and effectively demonstrated the efficacy of his threat, rather than go into the, "Who is he? Why is he doing all this massive destruction? What does he want?" Anyway ?. see it for the adventure, not the strategy and logic (despite Spock).Some plot devices are just overly retro and tacky in a bad way e.g. playing loud metal-rock music to blast the smithereens of the rival multitudes of space pods =&gt; really? Some parts can also be a tad too Indiana Jones.There are probably too many scenes on terra-firma (almost three quarter of the movie). Being a Star Trek movie, one would probably expect more intergalactic actions.There is a reasonably good attempt at humor and most are worthy of a smile, though the overall dialogue could do with more oomph and sufficient gravitas. Chris Pine's Captain Kirk somehow does not come across here as sufficiently Captain-ny, and he looks a little blotted and not quite in tip-top shape. I think Idris Elba would have been a much more effective menacing villain (he has the look and the talent to pull it off) if they had NOT alien- masked him. As it is, he is indistinguishable, and is just another space-age movie villain. The stand-out character would be Sofia Boutella's white-bodied Jaylah, who flowed into the character smoothly and would likely see her again in future installments. (Sofia also did an excellent job as the blade-legged lady in 'Kingsman The Secret Service') Sadly, this would be the last outing for Anton Yelchin as Chekov (though he has four other upcoming movies in the pipeline). Also included is a little tribute to the late Leonard Nimoy. As for the 'gay Sulu' thing - hardly noticeable nor matter - that little non-dialogue scene could just as easily be about his brother and niece. Enjoyable enough, nothing disappointing, but nothing to write home about either. Worth a watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Trek: Beyond is a Solid Continuation of the Best Aspects of Star Trek</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really loved the reboot of Star Trek in 2009. It seemed to fill a hole in the genre and even though there were complaints from the hardcore fans that they changed the series too much (making it more like Star Wars, more action, more jokes etc.). But it definitely renewed interest in the property. I also liked Star Trek: Into Darkness even though the backlash against it was pretty strong. The parts where they seemed to try to callback to previous movies were pretty forced, but the movie still delivered on the big budget action and the great ensemble that they've put together were still good as their respective characters. The marketing for Star Trek: Beyond wasn't particularly good, even though I really liked the both of the previous movies, I almost passed on going to see it. But my love of the Star Trek franchise won in the end and even though it might be the least favourite of the 3 movies, it was perfectly enjoyable and reaffirmed how good this franchise is.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* When we last left the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise they were about to head on a five year mission into deep space. We join Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) 3 years into the mission trying to negotiate a truce between two alien civilizations. He tries his best but he can't communicate effectively with them and he ends up being attacked (they are the size of dogs and aren't terribly threatening). Montgomery Scott (Simon Pegg) beams him back aboard and they continue on. They're scheduled to go to a space station called Yorktown to get their next mission and have a short leave. Kirk is having a bit of a crisis of faith, he's questioning how valid his missions are and is unsure if he wants to carry out the duration of the overall mission. His birthday is coming up and he's cornered by Dr. Bones McCoy (Karl Urban) to have a drink in celebration. Meanwhile, Lt. Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto) have broken up. They're being civil about it but both are hurting. Spock is also questioning whether he should remain with Star Fleet and instead try to help re-populate New Vulcan.I won't spoil anything further and I'm confident that I haven't given too much away. One of the things that I liked about Star Trek: Beyond is that the plot was more contained. It wasn't about trying to save the universe, I found it to be more about the crew of the Enterprise growing through the stagnation of their mission and their interpersonal relationships. Almost every crew member gets their own respective character arc and a lot of the joy of this movie isn't their fight against Krall (Idris Elba), it's how they interact with each other and their situation. It does eventually come to the big conclusion but Beyond felt like it was a little more character based and I liked that a lot.One of the other reasons to go watch Star Trek: Beyond is that this is one of the best ensemble casts working in big budget movie making. I want to credit the writers for building strong characters for them to work with but it's also because of the actors that you want to see the adventures of the crew of the Enterprise. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto have been perfectly cast as Kirk and Spock respectively since the beginning and they are both consistently strong here. Simon Pegg gets a little more screen time and he makes the most of it (it makes sense, he's one of the writers). I've also always liked Karl Urban as Bones, he's pretty funny and he's an underrated part of this franchise. In terms of the new cast members Sofia Boutella was one of big highlights of this movie. Her makeup is great and between her acting and how cool her character is, she's an excellent addition and although she's great in Kingsman too, she's definitely growing as an actress. I wish Idris Elba was given a better developed villain. His makeup is also interesting but his performance was only OK and part of that was how Krall is written. Krall's backstory is cool but they wait to introduce it way too long and it feels just tossed in, if they had brought it in earlier, I think Krall would have been much more memorable.As much as I want to tell you this is the best Stark Trek movie, I can't do that. The first 2 out of the 3 parts that make up Star Trek: Beyond are pretty good and the middle is the strongest part. The crew is separated into teams and when they're trying to find each other, the movie excels. It's both thrilling and fun to watch. I feel like when the movie reached the third act, it begins to fall apart. The destruction of Krall's army was disappointing considering how devastating they were at the beginning. They also crowbar in a franchise staple which seemed really corny. Krall's development as a character gets shoved in and everything gets wrapped up in a neat little bow. The ending just wasn't as strong for me and it lowered overall grade.Is there room for both Star Wars and Star Trek? I think this movie shows that there is. I would say despite the box office for the Trek franchise declining, don't be too quick to toss this franchise aside. There's a lot to like in Star Trek: Beyond. I'd still consider it the weakest of the 3 but it's not by much. They're all good movies purely on their own individual strengths and weaknesses. I would commend the team behind this franchise for coming up with a fresh film and one that validates the continuation of this series. I found this to be pleasantly surprising and there's plenty of life left in this franchise.</fullReview>

What more can you ask?There are some actor greats here, and quite a lot of surprises. You can feel Lin's touch, but he didn't overdo it. You can also see Peg's influence on the script, which, in my opinions, has been very positive.There are some emotional scenes, characters are coming into their own. There are some winks to fans of the series. I like both the series, old movies and rebooted movies and am looking forward to the new TV show. This movie is definitely the step in the right direction for the franchise.Plan to see this several time and am already looking forward to Star Trek 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Trek "Beyond" literally rocks ;-)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the first trailer somewhere in the beginning of this year, I didn't quite know what to expect. It was just action but it never revealed what the story line was gonna be. When I read that J.J. Abrams was not gonna be directing this one but Justin Lin, I was somewhat afraid the 3rd Star Trek was gonna be like Fast and Furious in space: "To boldly race where no one has raced before". I mean for a fast action movie without a real story line, Justin Lin is your man. But doing a Star Trek movie is playing ball on a much higher level. But how wrong was I. Last night I saw "Beyond" on premier night and it really blew my socks off. This 3rd part really exceeded all the expectations I had. This movie really is Star Trek worthy. Compared to the first movie (2009) all main characters have really matured. The have really grown in their parts. I'm not gonna name them all separately, they all gave a great performance. Idris Elba played Krall in the same way as Benedict Cumberbatch played Khan in "Into Darkness", very convincing. And Soufia Boutella as Jaylah? Let's just say she is a real kick ass alien. Simon Pegg and Doug Jung wrote a hell of a script with just the right balance between the action packed sequences and humour, even in the music, but there was also room for a few really nice tribute to the original Star Trek crew. What the story line is, I'm not gonna reveal, you'll really have to see for yourself. But I promise you that as a Star Trek fan, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good stand-alone Star Trek episode, rather than part 3 of a movie trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a 39 year old die-hard Star Trek fan. I've seen every episode of every series. I loved The Motion Picture. I loved Final Frontier. Heck, I even loved Nemesis. Star Trek Beyond was a very good entry in the Star Trek film universe. I would compare it to Nemesis, in that it felt like something you'd get in the midst of a season of a Star Trek series rather than something written for the big screen. Don't get me wrong, the film was epic, but budget aside, the script was small-screen material.And that's not a bad thing! After all, Star Trek was made on the small screen. Star Trek Beyond almost felt like a love letter to the Original Series at times, filmed on rocky sets made of Styrofoam, and it just felt smaller than the other two films due to these B-movie sets, and smaller cast. But I loved that about this film. Star Trek is supposed to be filmed on Styrofoam sets and it added a certain charm to the film that the modernity of CGI cannot match. Speaking of CGI. There were some amazing action scenes, and the best one was bittersweet, during the scene where the Enterprise breaks apart. Wow. Beautiful, yet sad to see such marvelous technology get obliterated. I was also surprised by the fight choreography in this film, especially the fight scenes that involved Jaylah, an alien that joins Kirk and crew in the fight against Krall, a rather one-dimensional, but menacing villain portrayed very passionately by Idris Elba. This will surely rack up another Oscar for best make-up and possibly costume design. Oh my goodness, those uniforms looked amazing! Even the pajama shirts looked expensive!But back to the script, I give Simon Pegg credit. He's clearly a Star Trek fan and he knows the characters. The chemistry was there, just like the previous two films, and the acting was fantastic all around. Justin Lin did a fine job at establishing a good mix of campy and serious tones and isn't that what Star Trek was always about? Trek was always both fun and enlightening. I laughed a lot during this film, it was definitely lighter than Into Darkness, not as preachy, but it had 2 or 3 good philosophical scenes, albeit, no where near as deep or esoteric as many of the old Trek films and series.One thing that surprised me was just how shallow Spock was written. There was no emotional conflict that you get with Vulcans, and no battle between his logical reasoning and human side. In this movie he cries, laughs, and showed no hatred for emotion. But hey, it's a different Spock. I think Scotty was absolutely hilarious in this film, and Pegg had more scenes in this once, which makes sense, given that the script was written by Simon Pegg. I really felt that Spock took a back-seat in this one, but 2 particular scenes of his really got me teary-eyed even though they were not so much about him, but the "other Spock." But then again, this wasn't a character driven film. Kirk had a scene that mentioned him breaking out of his father's shadow, and there was some love dove stuff between Spock and Uhura, but overall, Star Trek Beyond was a very plot driven film, with an unique, innovative Villain named Krall, despite being a bit one-dimensional. Krall had some good philosophical lines and he reminded me of a psychic vampire. But there was no reason to hate this villain other than the sheer fact that he destroyed the Enterprise and many other Federation ships due to his vendetta against Star Fleet. The shocking twist at the end finally revealed why, and it was unexpected too, which made the villain a bit more sympathetic, but just a bit. Final rating is an 8 out of 10. Not as good as the the best Trek films, but better than some others and the quality acting, action, jokes, and philosophy will surely leave both the new and old Star Trek fans satisfied after leaving the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Justin lin is a pretentious fake with no basic skill of cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If watching 120mins of violence shaking, ultra blurry close up in every action scene is your sense of fun and enjoyment, do watch this , i was this inside a large dobly atmos hall, and it almost make me want to throw up, both my friends, my wife and almost the whole the cinema was signing and booing during those action scenes.The actors are great, visual effect are awesome but the director way of composing the frame of each shot is horrible, way too close and lazy. One of his favourite signature technique he use repeatedly was using a single wide lens shooting a subject from far then instantly turn to a close up subject cruising by without proper follow focus or basic composition in photography. This cause the next subject he follows on end up appear blurry and cover 70% of the scene. One good example is near the climax scene where the shooting a person running from a distant then suddenly turn the camera into Kirk on a bike passing by all this without zooming out, correcting the focus or swap to a different camera, angle or different lens. And all the while these happening he also added artificial violent shakes and vibration to the camera, its like u watching the movie on a Symbian horse vibrator turn to max!Gosh!! i miss jj abram so much!!! after seeing the fraud call Justin lin, and the choice of music was horrible.To cut it short, the script are rush, with tons of plot holes, not mystery no charm and totally lazy camera works by a unimaginative immature sorry excuse name Justin Lin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Going boldly where no Star Trek has gone before...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey guys! I just got back from a special advanced screening of Star Trek Beyond (not advanced by much, I know!) here in Australia. I have to say, the film was great! In short, it fits snugly within the "Abramsverse" and pays homage to the original series quite well. Whilst I did have a few gripes, overall the film is quite good! Before I get on with the review, I'm going to fully disclose a few things. Firstly, I never saw any of the original films or the TV show (however, I know most of the references etc). Secondly, I was a massive fan of the 2009 reboot and can confidently say it is one of my favourite science fiction films - J.J. Abrams delivered a film that was both visually stunning and successfully rebooted a timeline in an extremely efficient and clever way that I now hold as the standard whenever I see a reboot. Now that that's out of the way...Director Justin Lin (known for his work on The Fast and Furious franchise) is new to Star Trek and Sci-Fi in general. Going in, I was worried that he couldn't handle the elements that go into making a great Star Trek film and wasn't familiar with Sci-Fi elements. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Lin directs the film at a breakneck pace - but with a pretty big issue, which I'll touch on shortly. As a whole, the film feels very complete and tight with no loose ends. Simon Pegg and Doug Jung's script is excellent, balancing solid action sequences with a surprising amount of heart and humour. It is very evident that Pegg's gifted sense of humour shines through the script resulting in some genuinely funny moments - particularly several interactions with Bones and Spock who go off on a little bit of a side adventure. The old cast are amazing as always. Chris Pine as James T. Kirk turns in an excellent performance that brings the character arc of Kirk full circle from the first film by playing Kirk as a more mature version of the character that we saw him in the 2009 film. As for Spock (Zachary Quinto), his arc primarily revolves around his relationship with Uhura (Zoe Saldana) which I was a fan of as their relationship wasn't as fleshed out in the earlier films. Bones (Karl Urban) and Scotty (Simon Pegg) are both excellent here, but are mainly used as comic relief. Onto the newcomers - both Idris Elba and Sofia Boutella are great in the film and make fine additions to the already brilliant case. Boutella plays Jaylah, an alien who the crew meet while stranded on the planet that Elba's character maroons them on after destroying The Enterprise. Jaylah is an excellent character who provides a few laughs but, as Kingsman fans would know, knows how to kick ass! She brings another level of physicality to her fight scenes and has an array of gadgets which make the action scenes fun to watch. Elba on the hand is a great villain and I certainly liked what they did with his character toward the end, he brings a certain menace to his character that was missing in Cumberbatch and Bana's villains. On a technical level, the film is stunning visually with brilliant CG and an amazing score once again composed by the brilliant Michael Giacchino. However, I felt that the action sequences were sometimes poorly shot with the framing being too close to the action making it hard to make out who was who and where they are geographically within the shot. This also results in a lot of shaky-cam which is not very appealing. Additionally, the film suffers a bit of a slump during its second act and does tend to drag. This is very noticeable because the first and third acts are amazingly done and come and go with a very quick pace, particularly a VERY fun third act which involves a great call back to the 2009 film with Beastie Boys' - Sabotage.All in all, Star Trek Beyond is another excellent film in what is now an excellent trilogy. Justin Lin has made an excellent science fiction film, full of action and heart that fits very well in the pantheon of the better Trek films within the sprawling franchise. The fan service also toward the end was also a nice surprise to those who have followed the franchise from the TV show and the original films. I give Star Trek Beyond 8 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still in the Shadow of the first Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*At first i have to apologize: Sorry for the bad English, I am not a native speaker.*I am a big fan of the Star Trek Series and when I was young I loved the old series and movies. When in 2009 the first "new" Star Trek movie arrived I was excited about the good cast and the intelligent Plot. The second one doesn't have this tricky intelligent story the first film has, but was also a good movie. The Third one with the sub title "Beyond" is unfortunately more like the second movie, but pro's first and here we go. Star Trek Beyond from director Justin Lin, who is known for Fast and Furious, bring some good action on the big screen. In "loud" moments Lin is in his element. Lin knows how to make some good dynamic action scenes. My personal Highlight is the Enterprise fighting scene with Beastie Boys ? Sabotage underlaid. This part of the movie is very entertaining and in these points the movie has his great strength. Also so the Cast is very lovely and with Sofia Boutella as Jaylah there is another coherent likable character. The whole cast perfectly matched and I hope to see all of these guys back in Star Trek 4 (a silent minute for Anton Yelchin, Rest in Piece!). So the action is strong, the cast is strong, whats wrong with the movie? Why it is not a 10/10 for me? So I think the story is the first problem for me. I can't help me, but the whole story is for me more a reason to go beyond different places, then a real continuation of the Star Trek saga. The hole film feels like a episode of the series but in a negative way. There is a bad guy who is bad and good guys who are good. Lin just manages not quite the whole to give it more depth and make the plot more interesting. I don't want to Spoil anybody, but the motivation of the antagonist is not very resourceful in my opinion. We all know why Captain Kirk and his crew do what they do, but there enemy is a little bit "flat". Maybe I don't get it right now or doesn't understand the big point and when I see this movie a second time I will find it, but for now Beyond has the weakest Plot. The second Point is very subjective, but for me the tracking shots were a bit to fast so that the motion blur make some whole scene not pleasant. Maybe the 3D supports this effect, but the many "moving the camera" in a circle about objects and characters were a bit too much. I never become Motion sick in any Movie. I saw the movie "Hardcore Henry" without motion sickness, but in Beyond there were some moments I have to close my eyes. With 48 frames per second I think this problem would be fixed, but with cinematic 24 frames a second it was not perfect in my opinion. Otherwise you become a typical Star Trek movie and it is fun to watch it. I think it is a Cinema Cinema Film, so watch it on the Big screen with good sound. So guys please don't hate me, but in my opinion this is the weakest one of all 3 Movies. Please don't get me wrong. "Beyond" is not a bad movie, but it stands like "into darkness" in the shadow of the brilliant first "new" Star Trek movie. So the "genre-rating" for fans is around 8.5. For everybody else it is a solid 7. So all in all it's a 7.75 what we can round up to 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good But Nothing New</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the new "rebooted" Star Trek was a TV series then this would be a low point episode that makes you want to watch the next episode. The best thing this movie has going for it is the dialogue between our main characters and the visuals. I did like how it focused on other Star Trek Characters other than Kirk, Spock and Bones for once but I just found the story kinda ho-hum and predictable. Half way through (when I caught on to the plot twist that was coming) I felt I had seen this episode before or a variation of it. I really felt with an awesome title like Beyond that the villain in the film should have been nature. Like they end up in the "Beyond", a part on space that NO ONE has been before and have to deal with unthinkable situations in that area. Oh well that's my opinion. Good movie but not great and I think its the highest of the low points in the whole Star Trek series of movies. Star Trek (2009) and Into Darkness were better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film doesn't know what it wants to be. It can go from being quite serious to rather silly from scene to scene. The film clearly suffers from the writing of Simon Pegg. He's a funny guy and has made some great films but we see far too much of his style in this film and, frankly, he wasn't a suitable writer. I quite liked Scotty in the last film but he's even more of a clown and has far too much of a central role in this one.I don't really come to Star Trek for humour and there are far too many attempts at it in this.Add in the ridiculous Beastie Boys music to disrupt the ships and we have the makings of a Star Trek parody. I left the cinema pretty disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the team slowly comes together ... but is it not too late?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It takes time to build mythology. The original Star Trek was a TV show that ran for years and was followed by next and other generations of space-ships, commanders and crews, some of them memorable, other easier to forget. The latest generation on the big screen debuted in 2009 and are now at their third adventure and movie together. The one big achievement of 'Star Trek Beyond' may be the fact that the team is now coming together, the characters have slowly won the hearts and minds of the fans, and if they did not erase the memories of the members of the old crew (mission impossible!) they have become at least compatible with them and have now a life of their own.Screen direction for this 3rd series is trusted in the hands of Taiwanese director Justin Lin of 'Fast and Furious' glory. As one may expect there is a lot of action, speedy editing, special effects which to a large extent are different than the ones in other Star Trek films. As many critics and viewers noticed since the previous installments, Star Trek and Star Wars starts to converge to something that is less specific to the worlds that each of the movie comes from and is closer to the Hollywood big action movies of the 21st century. Do I like this trend? Not really, but I cannot but admire the art direction and set decoration. The cities of the future will be fantastic if they will look like in this film, these are no orthogonal worlds, there are no right angles, but a number of dimensions that largely exceeds the commonly accepted figure of three. It's a cheap bet that some Academy Awards are around the corner for the technical categories.(I had some problems with the 3D projection though, especially in the lower-lit scenes. I cannot comment if this was because of the film or of the conditions in the theater we saw the movie).What about the story? Characters development? Some new and original villains we can cheer and feel sorry at the same tine after the final fists fight? None of these happen in too large amounts in this movie, it's only the clich that seems to gin ground, although the film enjoys some acceptable acting from Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, and Zoe Saldana. The connection between the new frontiers explored by J.J. Abrams and the good old world that was imagined by Gene Roddenberry is pretty casual. There is some retro-technology as the heroes use an older model of the Federation space-ships to flee a planet the Enterprise crushed on, and there are some memories of the new Spock for his father who does not appear but in photographs (the late Leonard Nimoy).The difference between my generation of fans and the fans of today (some are our grandchildren) is the almost infinite number of options the younger folks are exposed to. Yes, there is some evolution, coalescence, more consistency in the characters of the latest film in the series. The question is whether this does not come too late.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit that this chapter wasn't as good as the first two, but it was still quite enjoyable. The best part about this movie is how utterly beautiful it is. The special effects are wonderful and everything is so nice just to look at. There's always fine details and creative execution. The best parts are still probably when the various crew members get separated. This is what makes a franchise as big as "Star Trek" so much fun. It's just great to see how the characters interact and play off of each other. I couldn't get any synopsis out of this film here other than the characters going somewhere new and fighting a new enemy. Don't most characters do that? I admit the plot could be better and the villain is a bit confusing. It's still a film in good spirits and I like all the little references to the old show, how subtle or blatant they might be. One important note. I remember hearing that in this movie the character Sulu was going to come out as gay as a way to honor his original actor, George Takei, coming out. Takei himself didn't like this idea. It is never stated that Sulu is gay, but we do see him briefly hold hands with another man implying he is. I guess it was sort of a compromise with George Takei. I like the idea of openly gay characters, but if the actor or people involved don't want it, that's just fine. It's great to see how creative and beautiful this amazing world looks and you really in on the action with the Enterprise. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a sci-fi movie that gives you a sense of escapism!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been a Trekkie. I grew up with Star Trek Enterprise, and even when I was six, it warranted nothing more than a "meh" from me. So going into the J.J Abrams films, I hadn't any idea what to expect. But I can't resist a CGI-heavy space opera, so I went to see them. And once again, they were "meh". I wasn't expecting much from this one either - but to my surprise I ended up liking this one a lot more! Pros: The CGI is fantastic! I'm a little bit biased when it comes to Action/Adventure blockbusters, but when ever I see a scene with really well done VFX. I can't help but give the rating some leeway.Humour! There's no scene that made me completely loose control of my lungs. But the jokes only really made me chuckle - the reason it's one of my pros however, is because it adds to the overall tone and gives the film a personality.Cons: The Screenplay - It feels to me that the screenplay originally didn't have anything to do with Star Trek. Much like what happened to 'The Cellar' which eventually turned into '10 Cloverfield Lane'. Call me a conspiracy theorist - but I wouldn't be surprised if it was an original script adapted into Star Trek. The problem with that is the film feels like Nikki Minaj. A good - but not that impressive - looking woman. Then injected with all sorts of plastic and surgery substances. They don't belong. Some situations feel forced is what I'm trying to say.I am trying to watch more story oriented films, like the short films on 'Vimeo Staff Picks.' But there's nothing like a good blockbuster. And this one is sufficient escapism for a weekend off work!8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastical Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the film going into its second week in Europe - even further down the road in the US- I guess I'm a bit late with my review. I made my choice to go watch this movie despite the negative criticism and the numerous flaws in this film as has been mentioned. One thing has to be said though: Star Trek revolves around a 'fantastical' universe that has nothing to do with future possibilities within space exploration. So there's no need to go into the many many flaws that has found its way into this movie. To name one - a flagrant one-: no one would ever be appointed captain of a spaceship with a personality profile and capabilities as portrayed by the Kirk-personage in this movie. This guy has the fundamental aspiration of being a hero and brings his crew into trouble the moment he sets foot on a spaceship. Going into an unknown nebula without even making a sound risk assessment and management is just ludicrous. And if they made it they would have sent a scout ship in first. So the bigger, more valuable vessel - the Enterprise- would never have been in this situation. This said one shouldn't nitpick about this or that flaw: it's all part of a universe fit for movies and nowhere else. But even within this 'universe' the movie isn't all that interesting. A give it a 5, perhaps a 6. Enjoyable if your brain is offline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Five-Word Review: Forgettable Summer Fun; Great Chemistry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Continuing (and possibly concluding) the new trilogy started by JJ Abrams in 2009 with the cast led by Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Simon Pegg, Zoe Saldana, and Karl Urban, Justin Lin of the Fast and Furious fame helms this romp which sees the crew of the Enterprise out of their depth and stranded when attacked by a mysterious villain named Idris Elba, with nefarious intent. Though I have never been a 'Trekkie', I thoroughly enjoyed the 2009 take, appreciating the excellent cast and accessibility. The 2013 sequel (Into Darkness) was more lightweight, though did feature a spectacular turn from Benedict Cumberbatch. This third instalment, however, is the weakest of the three, though still solid. Undoubtedly the very best thing about Beyond is the cast. This team has absolutely wonderful chemistry together, the sort that could rival other ensemble pieces like Lord of the Rings and The Avengers. The best scenes are all just the characters interacting instead of the big explosive action and end of the world prevention. We've seen Quinto's Spock and Pine's Kirk build a great relationship in the previous two films, but that aspect is put on the back burner here in favour of developing other characters and interactions. For instance, Urban's delightfully gruff Bones gets more screen time than in his previous two appearances combined, Pegg is clearly having a lot of fun as engineer Scotty - having also co-written the often sharp script, and Sofia Boutella is a great addition to the cast, whilst Pine and Quinto are reliable as ever. Beyond tries to expand and develop the characters a bit by pairing them up outside of their comfort zones, which works for the film, even if some of the characters feel a little shafted in favour of Kirk, Scotty, and Bones: Chekhov, played by the talented Anton Yelchin who tragically died before the film's release, and Saldana's Uhura, are little more than one-note stereotypes. The latter has little more role to play than 'Spock's girlfriend', though there are at least other female characters to prevent the film overall becoming too one-dimensional. All told, it's a great summer romp with some zinging dialogue and likable characters, along with eye-popping visuals rendering the action scenes a cornucopia of events unfolding. A standout of these such scenes features Beastie Boy's 'Sabotage' in creative and fantastic fashion. A lot of the rest of the film, however, is disappointingly predictable and dull. Though admittedly visually resplendent, the action scenes are simply uninspired and just boring to watch. They're akin to a Transformers film, with lots of machinery and faceless villains all clashing and clanging together amidst explosions. For example, when the Enterprise is first attacked the scene in which it happens takes 15- 20 minutes, but none of it is exciting, instead being mindless and far too generic. Another problem is the pacing: there is a moment which seems like a climax, but there is still a long stretch of film to go with some more endings. And Elba's villain is just a misfire, with the actor labouring and Vader-breathing under layers of makeup and prosthetics. His intentions are unclear, he's not memorable, and the seeming attempts to make him appear tragic do not land. Overall this results in a film which is probably worth seeing if you've nothing to do, but don't expect much more than a mindless blockbuster. It's worth seeing for the talented cast alone. 62/100</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An okay movie... unfaithful to the characters of the original series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like the 2009 reboot of Star Trek. Into Darkness was interesting in it's complete reversal of the Kirk/Spock roles in the original 'Wrath of Kahn' -- but Beyond, while hearkening as much as it could back to the original series, just betrayed the characters tremendously.First, the bad...Spock is directed, written and acted poorly. He is much too emotional. Instead of his scenes of emotion being a fleeting moment that shows his humanity, he is a whiny character who has little presence on screen. You just don't end up caring about him much.Kirk's character is phoned in by Pine. He seemed to be enjoying himself in the first installment of the series, but so much less so here.And finally, our enemy, Krall played by Idris Elba, just wasn't menacing. Maybe this is a problem of "Star Trek" in general, but it fails compared to the Borg or Kahn in the original series and for the action movie this wishes that it was, a strong antagonist was required. The writing failed to deliver.But there were some good parts:Simon Pegg was thoroughly enjoyable as Scotty, but Karl Urban's 'Bones' was the standout character here. The attitude was perfect while totally making the character his own.All in all, nothing worth bothering to see unless you just have nothing to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Beyond Expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>recently I watched Star Trek Beyond. This had a new director at the helm, but was being produced by the guy that had directed the last two, so one would hope that it would still be in safe hands. I personally felt that this film had a lot to live up to. I thought the last Star Trek movie (Star Trek into Darkness) was brilliant and for a difficult third album, it wasn't a bad effort. Yes there was still far to many flare effects and the plot line was a bit ludicrous, but then this is sci-fi.So what things did the film do well on. Well first the film didn't feel long, its run time is only 122 minutes. The movie also stays true to its Star Trek history and timeline, so if your a true treki you won't be having too many arguments either.The comedic moments in this film is on point, but then again what do you expect when Simon Pegg is lending a hand in terms of the script. The case were brilliant, you almost forget that Idris Elba is the villain in the movie. I didn't see any glaringly obvious movie mistakes but I am sure there will be some somewhere. The only downfall of this movie is that the ending, in terms of the closure of the action, is a little bit well, its all over before it began. But in saying that if it had been dragged on for ages I would be moaning about that but I do feel that more could have been made of it. There was a lot of chat about the fact that one of the crew of the enterprise is gay, to be honest, not a lot was made of it in the film and one could argue that unless you interpreted it that way you wouldn't have known about it either. The triumph of this film is that as you sit back and enjoy it you start to think about where the direction of the franchise could be going and if this could be the last movie in the franchise. Thankfully the story plays through and there is a way that it could continue. In short this film is a sit back, relax and switch your brain off, with plenty of humour and action. OK its not as good as Into Darkness but it gave it a good run for its money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lin offers an enjoyable instalment, Elba and Boutella shine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The USS Enterprise crew are tricked to a nebula in the furthest reaches of uncharted space, where they encounter a ruthless enemy who wants to tear the Federation apart.Director Justin Lin offers a fast paced third instalment with plenty of explosions and phaser laser shoot-outs. The action comes at full velocity especially after the Enterprise (is unnecessarily destroyed again). With the established cast of well loved characters Lin effortlessly helms what feels like a big budget Star Trek episode as they crash land on a planet. The effects are for the most part excellent, even if larger-than-life for epic set-up sake, especially in the opening attack and closing with the fleets star ship USS Franklin, zooming about a giant space station Starbase named Yorktown. With Kirk regulars (Chris Pine), Spock, Bones (Karl Urban), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho), Chekov (Anton Yelchin) and Scotty (Simon Pegg) the cast look more at ease, seemingly settled in their established roles and bring the well loved characters to life suitably. Echoing Wrath of Khan (1982) thankfully protagonist Idris Elba as Krall has a strong screen presence and is one of the better Star Trek baddies, for a moment in the closing it appears he's going to become sickly honourable but appreciatively the writers were wise to avoid the trope. The new addition Sofia Boutella as Jaylah is excellent on all accounts, her character fits universe perfectly. There are flashy moments where she uses a holographic device similar to Total Recall (1990), Escape from L.A (1996) and Superman II (1980) etc, still, her character is well developed and Boutella breathtakingly executes the fight scenes (there is an opportunity for her to join the cast of characters with untimely death of the excellent actor Yelchin). Under Lin's direction Elba and Boutella simply shine throughout.While it lacks any real nebula exploration writers Simon Pegg and Doug Jung offer a straight forward story, the usual fitting Star Trek speak and relationship touches, echoing past films and series of the original crew, notably Bones' interaction with Spock and Kirk. If anything it on the nose honours the original outings a little too much while not investing time in investigating the planets vegetation or natural life forms in place of a survival piece. It retains the series' sci-fi roots, but skimps on the science and discovery, replacing it with blockbuster exploits. The staging, sets and costumes are perfect; Star Trek Beyond has some great visuals and it is wonderfully produced. Michael Giacchino's great Star Trek theme finds it way throughout out and his additional scored music is more upbeat and less sterile, fittingly taking chances like Lin's Beyond in whole. It's interesting that they use the Franklin an old Starfleet ship, with Pegg and Jung's transparent twist being reminiscent of H. G. Wells' Morlock or the Cave (2005) to name a few. Touchingly there's not only a tribute to Spock Prime ( Leonard Nimoy) but to the whole original time-line crew where Zachary Quinto's Spock comes across his older alternative time-line self's belongings. The joint mission statement brings it casually to a Star Trek 50th Anniversary fan servicing close, enticing a fourth adventure. Overall, Beyond feels like an expensive and extended action packed episode, while not boldly going to places they haven't been before, it's an enjoyable comfortable stop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its the future and the Enterprise is still journeying through space, where Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) rules and Dr. Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban) are still trading barbs. Just back from a voyage, the crew docks at the space colony, only to be sent on a mission almost immediately. This happens because an alien lady lands and relates that HER spaceship was attacked and her crew needs rescuing in a nebula. Off they go. But, once there, things go awry. There is a dangerous alien ruler on the main planet, Krall (Idris Elba) and he captures half the crew. Captain Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty (Simon Pegg), and others are left to try to rescue the others. They may indeed need the help of another stranded alien, Jailah, whose own family was killed and who has extensive knowledge of the enemy they are fighting. On a surface of dangerous cliffs, thick woods, and caves, the crew also finds evidence of another Federation spaceship that landed on this planet long ago. Will Kirk and crew beat Krall? You know it! This nice film is made all the better by the wonderful cast. Each one is a perfect fit for well-known roles and the interaction and jesting between them is the main asset. In addition, the alien worlds, lifeforms, sets, costumes, and all of the other film elements add up to a greatly entertaining flick. Go beyond your door and step out into the closest theater for a night of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Closer to the Shows, but can't Break Away Entirely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beyond follows the crew nearly three years into their five year deep space exploration that they embarked on at the end of Into Darkness. When they land in a neutral Federation space station for shore leave, a distress ship is picked up and the crew of the Enterprise take it upon themselves to go and investigate, met only with a swarm of attacking ships that completely annihilate the Enterprise and strand it's crew on the planet below.Generally speaking, Beyond follows the original exploration ethos of the Star Trek franchise a little closer than it's predecessors. After meandering around our immediate vicinity for the last two movies, the Enterprise and it's crew are finally in deep space, uncovering new worlds and species. Or at least, that's how it starts. The opening scenes of Beyond were the most Star Trek this reboot has been, complete with a scene-setting captain's log and montage of life aboard the Enterprise. Even the brief moments they have on Yorktown go a long way to this feeling, but as soon as they investigate the distress, it's back to the action-packed tone of the previous movies, right up to the big climax at the end.Which leads me to probably my biggest criticism of Beyond; it just wants to rush to the action and takes no time just to linger. It's pace is frenetic, even in it's slower moments. It wants to move everyone from point A to point B and doesn't take too much time holding at either point. Most poignant for me was at the end when the movie wants to linger on a starfleet badge, but cuts almost immediately, offering no time to just linger in that moment at all. The opening montage of life aboard the Enterprise was great though and goes a long way to developing some of the more ancillary characters. We also get a sense that the ship is crewed by a full and large crew of people rather than just the core seven characters.The other two movies have even had trouble trying to develop all of those seven core characters, but Beyond goes out of it's way to give a bit more to Sulu and Chekov. Chekov in particular finds a lot more development beyond just "that Russian kid", as he's now that Russian kid who likes his women and his scotch (the former of which played really well, to the point where I spotted Chekov slyly checking out Jaylah when they first meet her). And of course they've given Sulu a husband and daughter, but most crucially they don't make a big deal of his sexual orientation, and it slips in effortlessly as a good homage to George Takei, the original Sulu. On this note, I agree that there needs to be better representation of the LGBT community in movies, and the treatment of Sulu in Beyond is the best way to do it. When a movie goes out of it's way to make a character gay, even though it serves no point, that's when I have a problem with it (for example, the LGBT's calls to turn Finn from Star Wars into a gay character just wouldn't work, not least because he's already hit on Rey, but because I don't see how it would serve any narrative purpose whether he's gay or not).I thoroughly enjoyed Star Trek Beyond. It felt new for the reboot and yet familiar to the old shows, and showed a great potential going forward. There's still promise that this franchise can produce a proper Star Trek movie rather than over exemplifying the Hollywood sci-fi/action plots. There's some great effects, some great uses of music, and some much needed character work. Simon Pegg's writing felt truer to the franchise than Orci/Kurtzman's did, and I'm intrigued as to where the fourth film will take us. I give Star Trek Beyond a solid 8/10. Would recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's OK.... better if you like CGI action better than acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked "Star Trek Beyond"... it had all the right elements... action, good connection between the characters (which is vital for ST), emotional issues, &amp; questions about right &amp; wrong. However, there was so much more time devoted to CGI action, explosions, space battles, ground battles, etc. than there was to the actual character plots &amp; acting that I'm not sure the actors earned their pay. While we see all the relationships at work &amp; there are subplots of personal questioning for Kirk &amp; Spock, they seem abbreviated. There just wasn't enough acting to balance out the flash-bang for fans who enjoy Star Trek because of the characters &amp; their relationships. The film was 2 hrs. I think that some of the explosions could have been cut ... or maybe the film could have been lengthened by 10 mins. to allow an extra scene or 2 for the actors to practice their craft. It was like being a fan of hot fudge sundaes &amp; you go to a place famous for hot fudge sundaes. You order &amp; all you get is 1 scoop drowning in some great fudge &amp; a few morsels of really good toppings. You got the taste... a lot of 1 thing... too much, in fact... but it wasn't satisfying &amp; didn't live up to expectations. BTW.... if I'd seen it in 3-D my stomach contents would have been all over the floor..... just too much swirling, diving, zooming, etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Justin Lin does the Star Trek franchise justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Star Trek Beyond" (2016 release; 122 min.) is the third Star Trek movie since its 2009 reboot. As the movie opens, we see Capt. James T Kirk doing a log entry that this is day 966 in deep space, year 3 of their 5 year mission. The USS Enterprise is heading towards Yorktown base, a massive man-made planet, for some much needed R&amp;R. Alas, it's not long before a distress signal comes in and the USS Enterprise is on its way into unchartered nebula. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this chapter is directed by Justin "Fast &amp; Fruious" Lin, based on a script by Doug Jung and Simon Pegg (who also plays the role of Scottie, of course). Under the careful eye from executive producer J.J. Abrams, Lin brings a rousing adventure. The movie is eye-candy from start to finish. Check out the eye-popping scene when the USS Enterprise first arrives at Yorktown (and reminding us again what a trailblazer :Inception" has turned out to be). About half the movie plays out in space, and the other half on the planet Altamid. For my money, the space scenes are more enjoyable (some of the battle scenes are jaw-dropping). The film makers are able to bring all of this with a respect for the original Star Trek spirit, but of course are also helped tremendously by the palpable chemistry between Chris Pine (Kirk), Zachary Quinto (Spock) and the other lead performers (sadly the last time we'll see Anton Yelchin in a Star Trek film). In the movie's end titles, both Leonard Nimoy and Yelchin are specifically mentioned. Bottom line: Lon has done the Star Trek franchise justice, and I'm looking forward towards the next installment (already announced)."Star Trek Beyond" is now playing into its 4th week, and the Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended very nicely, somewhat to my surprise. If you are a Star Trek face, you cannot go wrong with this. "Star Trek beyond" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Trek Beyond is a truly watchable film which fits into the Star Trek film universe like a missing piece of a puzzle. The modern Star Trek trilogy has been a pleasure to watch. All of the acting has been brilliant since the first film but I have particularly enjoyed observing Kirk and Spock's relationship evolve throughout the films (portrayed by Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto). Sofia Boutella's role as Jaylah is also a welcome addition to the movie. Star Trek Beyond also beautifully pays homage to the late Leonard Nimoy.The special FX in this Star Trek film is extremely impressive. You can tell that a lot of hard work and brain power were put into creating these spectacular visuals. Justin Lin and J.J. Abrams have clearly spent a huge amount of time choosing the correct tone and unique visual style of the film. This is also demonstrated by the magnificent costumes seen in the film. The makeup really helps bring you into the world of the film and truly helps to ignite passion for such a beloved film series. Star Trek Beyond has been fantastically written; nothing about it feels stale or reused. The film is not afraid to take itself too seriously; a feature no doubt added by Simon Pegg, who also acts well in this film. However, for me personally, I feel Idris Elba's acting is slightly off towards the end of the movie. It is very hard to understand what he is saying in the end sequence. Krall's origin also feels shoehorned in, but this is not a huge issue as the film flows very naturally and works well. Overall, I would give Star Trek Beyond 8 out of 10 as it was interesting and humorous throughout and fits perfectly into the trilogy. I look forward to seeing the next film added to the series. I really hope they choose a villain such as the Borg.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those who hated it, I'm sorry but this movie rocked! People in the theater with me laughed, cheered and I even heard sobs at certain points. The plot is out there if you search, I did read it but it did not give the movie justice. It is very hard to write a script that includes so many cast members and make all their lines meaningful. This team for Star Trek and the Marvel team make it all work, other studios do not. Even the very end, where the classic Star Trek script is read about their five year mission included the entire cast. There is a picture near the end, since I have watched the original series and subsequent movies, found very touching. The action is almost non-stop and Jaylah stole the show. I hope she appears in future movies along with Carol Marcus. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto so handsome, the rest of the cast the greatest and then there's Karl Urban who is my absolute favorite. I am so excited to see Karl in the next Thor movie, he will be fantastic! Don't let people make you think this movie is inferior, it's not, see it and judge for yourself, please! Some movies drag when they top two hours, I could name some but will not, but Captain America: Civil War and Star Trek: Beyond are not two of them, the time zipped by. If you loved the first two, please go see this one. I also believe some of the dialog is setting up the next movie, go see and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Trek Beyond returns the triad of Kirk, Spock and McCoy and finally gets all three thrusters going full throttle. This is a fun movie, finding itself more in the vein of the original series. The Enterprise, after a failed diplomatic mission, return to the new fabulous Federation Station known as Yorktown. Almost a Dysonsphere, it is a self-contained, rotating man-made planet. There, we find Kirk and Spock contemplating a life beyond The Enterprise. Interrupting the reflection is a mystery alien woman who needs the Federation to help her rescue her lost shipmates within a mysterious nebula. It is up to The Enterprise crew to provide the help. Once they get to the hidden planet, they are attacked by an alien race led by the mysterious Krall. The Enterprise crew has to abandon ship as the Enterprise is wrecked on the planet surface. Split up, they must reunite and then rescue crew members who have been taken hostage. Scotty finds a new friend named Jaylen. McCoy and Spock help each other try to find their shipmates. Uhura and Sulu have to work hard to find out the secret of Krall and preserve the crew. Chekov and Kirk have to find the crew and rescue them. As the three sub-plots unfold, we find out Kralls true identity, and his nefarious plot not just against The Enterprise, but also Starfleet. This leads to a lot of space battles, hand-to-hand combat, and great relationships between our characters. What is refreshing about it is that our screenplay (by Simon Pegg) finally utilizes McCoy as a full character and not just the comic relief of one-liners and humorous metaphors as in the previous outings. In fact, the best part (I thought) was McCoy and Spock were together for a good chunk of this movie, finding a relationship between the friction between emotion and logic. That was sorely missed in the previous outings, which was a central part of the original series. Another big show was the Yorktown and how the gravity works well on the outer rims where it spins, and how the core has zero gravity. There is also a desperate gamble on reviving an old Nexus class starship from the early Starfleet days of Captain Archer. My only gripe is a common one about the last 45 minutes not giving an audience any rest from special effects, battles, and constant odds-defying moments. Also, sadly gone are the philosophical nature of the the old Star Trek movies. However, this is a new reboot with fresh characters, and with movie making as it is, you take what you can get. I liked the last one better, but Star Trek Beyond is far better than the first reboot. Thankfully, the movie was dedicated to the memories of Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goes Beyond the second film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The CLAW here, bringing you another, should you see it in theaters, or wait for the DVD. Here we go: We are once again Blasting off into the unknown the the crew of the USS Enterprise for the 3rd time! A lot of times the 3rd installment can be the weaker one(Back to the future III anyone?), but not this time! Justin Lin, of the Fast and Furious franchise does a excellent job of bringing us on a fun ride full of action, humor, and drama. Pine gives in my opinion his best performance as Capt. Kirk. He portrays a man who has been at space for over 3 years, showing us that it can be, lonely, fun, dangerous and monotonous. The whole cast is back and they also deliver great performances, as you would expect given the deep talent of the cast.The movie is a well balanced, fast pace thrill ride, never slowing down. It starts off with a distress call, and the action doesn't let up until the end. The tone of this movie definitely felt a little big darker, and that can be seen visually, with darker uniforms, and a drowned out, dark planet. Sofia Boutella makes her way into this movie as Jaylah, a inhabitant of a undiscovered planet, that helps the crew get back together after crash landing. I was a little disappointed that, overall, she didn't get much screen time. At the end of the day though, this is the story of the crew of the Enterprise. Idris Elba takes his turn as the villain, Krall. Once again however, his story seemed to fall flat, and had a rushed, if not predictable conclusion. However, this did not take away that much from the overall experience as Elba gave a great performance. Im sure given a little more run time, Lin could have incorporated a couple extra scenes that could have added to his character. Maybe in the directors cut!Overall, this was just a fun, action driven space adventure with great visuals and performances. Quinto, Saldana, Yelchin(RIP), Pegg all give great performances that makes this movie, in my opinion, the best of the series so far! Recommendation: See it in Theaters!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Trek Beyond brought me back to old friends even though they were portrayed by different actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first start by saying that while I grew up watching reruns of the original "Star Trek" series as a kid of the '70s and many of the movies made with the original cast, I don't consider myself a "Trekkie" or "Trekker"-what die-hard fans of the show are often referred as-since I don't spend time watching every ep or going back to watch over and over again. But I do know of the characterizations of the main crew as originally created by Gene Roddenberry so I was highly amused by the banter between "Bones" McCoy and Spock. As for new developments-like Uhura and Spock being in a relationship or Sulu being revealed to be in a gay relationship, to reflect originator George Takei's real-life status-I didn't mind those and highly welcomed it here. I also liked the tribute to the late Leonard Nimoy in showing his picture from the first rebooted entry of this series and of him with the original cast at the end. To tell the truth, this is the first of the rebooted entries I watched but the characters were so familiar to me because no real changes were made to them other than what I just noted that I highly enjoyed a lot of what transpired on screen as me and my movie theatre-working friend were watching old friends together on that big screen...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another solid installment in the surprisingly consistent Star Trek reboot series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a Star Wars fans, I'm typically uninspired by the releases and announcements of Star Trek material. However, my love of sci-fi has still lead me to watch every movie in the new Abram's reboot of Star Trek, and I must say, I'm a fan. Although it will never beat Star Wars, Star Trek has done an unbelievable job of creating three great films that introduce fantastic new stories while also paying tribute to the original TV show. The decision to go with Justin Lin as the director of Star Trek Beyond definitely pays off as the film features action and amusement that was previously lacking in the earlier entries. The film also takes a risk by ditching the typical space setting, and instead is primarily set on a planet. This setting as well as the situation the characters face forces the crew to work together and as a result furthers the bond between the Enterprise crew as a whole while also taking time to focus on the relationships between the main characters. The introduction of the new character Jaylah is also a very welcoming addition as she provides most of the films highlights with both her action and humor. The ending proves to be the film's high point as it answers many of the lingering questions throughout the film while also providing a very entertaining and satisfying finale. The biggest weakness of Star Trek Beyond lies in its story which takes a while to really get moving. Like I mentioned, many of the motivations are unclear at first and make the story appear bland and even confusing at times. Also, in its efforts to imitate the original Star Trek, the movie, while entertaining, seems overly clich at times. Star Trek: Beyond is an all around enjoyable movie that in a way boasts the feel of a typical summer blockbuster. All of this, and yet it's still considered the worst in the trilogy. No, that's not an attack on the movie's quality, but instead shows just how good these three Star Trek films have been. Not to forget that the film also serves as a memorable tribute to the amazing lives of both Lenord Nimoy and Anton Yelchin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better, but still missing the most important ingredient</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the post-reboot entries so far, this is the closest to the original series in tone. At last we see the Enterprise doing what it was meant to - exploring strange new worlds (well BC's south coast anyway). It's also so much bigger. The Yorktown station finally offers a glimpse of the star spanning civilization of the Federation of Planets that the original series could never have dreamed of. And Krall's swarm ships were so much more terrifying and effective than those pokey web spinning Tholians.It provided the rest of the crew a lot more screen time as well, fleshing out relationships between Spock, Bones, and Kirk especially, while offering lots of big moments for Scotty, Sulu, Chekov, and Uhura, as well as newcomer Jaylah. It also offered nods to the original series and crew, and to Leonard Nimoy especially, that were quite touching.But it still suffers from many of the same failings that have plagued most of the other movies, both new and old. The focus on hyper-kinetic action might give a generation raised on video games their fix, but it does nothing to further Star Trek's original "mission". This series needs big ideas to match the over the top action. It needs to explore moral questions, like those raised in "A Taste of Armageddon", "The City on the Edge of Forever", or TNG's "The Measure of a Man". It needs to push boundaries, provoke thought, and rise above the kind of mindless violence we see in so many other sci-fi destruction fests.(Spoiler if you haven't seen the trailers) And could we please try to get through a movie without destroying the Enterprise? This outing saw Kirk crash not one but two starships. And they still offered to promote him to vice-admiral afterwards. Instead of calling the new ship the Enterprise A, it should really be called the USS Kenny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Trek Beyond continues it's flight into the frontier with a satisfying space adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before."These words are from the introduction to one of the biggest franchises of all time, Star Trek. Unlike Star Wars which was the brain child from the mind of George Lucas, Star Trek remains one of the few TV shows that have lasted as long as fifty years. Even after it's three season run, it has created a universe of other shows (The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, etc?), movies, books, games, and so much more.You have to give the series credit that it took it's characterization and dialogue seriously, even if it's techno babble can get in the way for mainstream audiences. The J.J. Abrams reboot/prequel Star Trek reintroduced the iconic characters of Kirk, Spock, Bones, McCoy and the rest of the Enterprise crew to a new audience that gave us the world that modern technology can finally bring. Star Trek Into Darkness was next to which people found fun, but retreaded Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan a little too much. Star Trek Beyond goes for an original story that might win back some fans that wanted more of the old series. The USS Enterprise is within it's third year of it's five year journey into deep space. The ship docks at a new space station Yorktown where Captain James Kirk (played by Chris Pine) is considering leaving the crew, not sure what the point of their exploration is. He's looking to recommend Spock (played by Zachary Quinto) to take over, but is unaware that his Vulcan friend may want to leave as well. Before they can tell each other of their plans, Starfleet sends the Enterprise to an unexplored Nebula to retrieve an escape pod. Within this pod is a survivor Kalara who says that her ship is on a uncharted planet within the nebula. They are suddenly ambushed by a swarm of ships that tears the Enterprise apart. Some make it to the escape pods, but some are stuck on the ship as the alien ships commander Krall (played by Idris Elba) captures Sulu (played by Jon Chu), Uhura (played by Zoe Saldana) before the ship is destroyed. On the planet, Kirk and Chekov (played by Anton Yelchin) are separated from Spock and McCoy (played by Karl Urban) as is Scotty (played by Simon Pegg) who need to make a plan with no ship and no way to communicate with Starfleet.One thing I'll say right up front is that Star Trek Beyond feels the most human out of the reboot movies. Screenwriter Simon Pegg and new director Justin Lin interject some good jokes along with some interesting team ups that I haven't seen from the other Star Trek movies. In a way, this is the new franchise returning to what made the old show great; good characters and dialogue. Speaking of which, the weakest thing about the new movie is one of two new characters, the villain Krall. Though we do get a good backstory on this guy at the end, I would have preferred to know as little as possible with this guy. The other new character Jaylah on the other hand, feels like the kind of character that's both accurate to the universe of Star Trek and modern. I hope she returns in the next movie. Action wise, you get what you expect, though I felt it was done better in Star Trek into Darkness. I'll give this seven blue uniform shirts out of ten. Star Trek fans should be satisfied and a mainstream audience looking for a summer popcorn movie will also probably be settled with this. While not exactly going where no man has gone before, Star Trek Beyond at least feels like it's going into further frontier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Much Needed Improvement from the Into Darkness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This new story, pitting The Federation against a mysterious and powerful Krall, brought a fresh addition to the Trek film franchise. Flat out, personally I hated Into Darkness. It's rendition of Khan was reduced to an flat angry guy with no other dimensions. It had none of the power of the real and original Khan conflict. It seemed as though there was no future for these reboots.Star Trek Beyond broke the fear that it's getting worse and instead delivered an enjoyable film that balanced well the nods to the original productions with the new story arc.While loaded with typical Hollywood special effects and fight scenes, there was fortunately a reserved amount of screen time featuring CGI actors or recreations of the main cast. There was at least one scene where the CGI replacements looked hokey, but the majority of it appeared to be live actors.The characters continued along the same trajectory as with the previous films. The pokey interpersonal relationship between Spock and Bones remains ongoing. The love story between Spock and Uhura touched upon. Kirk and his adventurous spirit lives on.It appears that Trek is trying to appeal to a wider audience by luring non-Trekies with some over-the-top action. This is partly where it suffered, adding in garbage thrills which require "cartoony" CGI and impossible physics.In one scene, Kirk finds an ancient motorcycle, and he apparently is a master rider. He shows superhuman ability as he rides this fully fueled machine across the unstable rocky terrain at full throttle and where no vehicles have ever been. Roads be damned!This motorcycle later winds up being a key tool for a highly illogical rescue. It's scenes like this that remind me of why I'll never watch the ridiculous 2012 with John Cusack driving through buildings as they fall (and somehow missing all the desks, support columns, and walls all the while keeping his tires fully inflated). In this case, it was one of two scenes that required your brain to be on the lowest flame to enjoy.All in all, the movie does impress. There is humor, there is feels, there is plenty of action and hardly any if any dragging scenes. It's about time that the new Trek gets a movie worth watching more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Federation goes out to search for more life forms in space until they stumble upon their mad antagonist, Krall.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To explore the far stretches of deep space and inquisitively unearth the vast conundrums of its galaxies is a reality every kid's eyes could only dream of . Through these young sentiments , the press, our peers and a pool of reputable movie buffs consider science fiction as rising star of all genres. This is why, This month of July is definitely no stranger to Star Trek Franchise. 3 years after Star Trek: Into the Darkness (2013) was released, Star Trek Beyond (2016) captured more attention and love from fans as Director Justin Lin shows our protagonists ? Captain Kirk , Spock and McCoy? posed with their own dilemmas and are often doubtful on their capabilities to lead and explore space along with the crew boarded in the U.S.S Enterprise. The main plot twist to this story is that it is found out that Krall is Captain Balthazar Edison, who was described as very honorable captain under the federation. Disappointingly, Captain Balthazar Edison succumbed to developing deep hatred for the federation to the point of wiping it out. In the impending advent of Captain Balthazar Edison succeeding in his plans to destroy the Federation, Captain Kirk manages to save the day by subduing Captain Balthazar Edison in a hand to hand combat at the center of The Federation. To start it off, it is important to mention the good points of Star Trek Beyond . Star Trek Beyond has many sweet spots in their script writing, as a great dynamic with Sci-Fi, and comedy is grandiosely presented in the blockbuster. The way Simon Pegg &amp; Doug Jung manages to orchestrate the lines of Bones and Spock and many other characters in the movie from comedic to a retrospective personas were very well knit. Each line provided relevant information for each upcoming event in the film. Examples of these would be Spock's ever philosophical attitude which was well justified as he was on the brink of death by Krall's Troops. Bones on the other hand showed both a mental and physical alertness in both his speech and actions The lines were witty, smart and unpredictable for the most time which made all the more exciting to watch. The actors and actresses of the current movie franchise create a new feel to the Star Trek and brings it to a whole new level by introducing the degrees of each emotion it characters. An example of this would be the how Spock's persona is brushed off as stony-faced in the beginning, but ends up as being a soft and loving person at the end. Another example would be Captain Kirk's persona which embodies doubt but later transforms into a person who embodies self- assurance and leadership in the end of the movie. It can be said that each character in Star Trek was able to poise himself uniquely from others and through that we learned to love them more. One thing that Star Trek Beyond had that Star Trek : The Original Series did not have was that Star Trek Beyond allowed the audience to deconstruct each character's persona and hold sentiments to them individually. In terms of lighting and visual effects, There were many scenes in Star Trek Beyond that was just perfect in every sense. The visual effects involved In the production of Star Trek Beyond can be credited as it showed iconic scenes and shots of The Enterprise that left me in awe as soon as I saw the incredulous image. In a similar note, the costume design for the alien species in Star Trek Beyond is so well refined and realistic that it surpassed all the expectations I had with the film. The CGI in the film is also worthy to mention as it redefined and stepped up the scale of how heavy CGI movies should produced. In terms editing, Star Trek Beyond showed no deficiencies as each moment was well thought of and had no editing plot holes whatsoever. An example of this would be how Star Trek Beyond did not include any sound when any battle happened in space because due to the normal physics conventions which stated that there is no sound in space. In addition to this, the musical scores, dubbing and re-recording of the audio behind Star Trek Beyond gave way to another iconic moment in Star Trek history. Star Trek's music score went from elegant all the way to hard rock from The Beastie Boys that captured the essence of the moment correspondingly. On the contrary to all the good points of Star Trek Beyond there were also some shortcomings of Star Trek Beyond relative to all the Sci-Fi movies out there. Star Trek Beyond's has shortcomings with regards to presenting the new movie with a more action that would make the movie even more thrilling to watch. The way Captain Balthazar M. Edison was defeated in the end lacked a closure to it that made the film feel incomplete in a way. Other than this Star Trek Beyond is definitely worth exploring as it makes the Star Trek franchise entirely more interesting and a treat to watch. Overall, Star Trek Beyond is a great movie with a dynamic cast and a exciting script; Moreover, it is definitely a peculiar type of Sci-Fi film because it emphasizes the social struggles of every normal person out there. Star Trek Beyond allows the audience build sentiments and learns to sympathize with the characters and understand each one of them as an individual with fears, dreams and hopes just like all us humans in our own world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as boldly but certainly beyond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the final frontier, the crewmembers of U.S.S. Enterprise have spent over half of their mission's duration exploring new worlds, seeking out new civilizations and extending the Federation's influence into deep space at warp speed. Each voyage however, seems episodic to Captain Kirk now and rightly so. Akin to many of the TV series' loopholes, the third adventure of the J.J. Abrams revived 'Star Trek' attempts to go beyond general logic. But that is what Justin Lin ('Fast &amp; Furious' series) brings on the creative table as a trekkie. He is furious with the pace and extravagant with the action. The special effects depicting the starships, the new Federation city and nebulae are the best the franchise has offered. The emotional or mental investment maybe limited here compared to another stars franchise but rest assured that it is an enthralling experience at the cinema. When a diplomatic mission with an eccentric race goes awry, the Enterprise heads to the starbase Yorktown, a spectacular creation by the special effects team, where the crew disembarks to regroup with their families and find some respite from their arduous voyage. Suddenly, a pod carrying a survivor from a stranded ship within a nearby nebula reaches Yorktown and requests aid from the starfleet. Convinced about his ship's exceptional navigational technology and his crew's dedication, James Kirk (Chris Pine) leads the rescue aboard the Enterprise and after passing through the daunting nebula, they detect a massive ship in the planet Altamid's orbit. They soon realize that the ship is actually a coordinated swarm of smaller ships that soon target the integral parts of the Enterprise. Shocked by the ambush and reluctant to accept defeat, the Captain orders his crew to abandon ship and as he escapes on a pod, he witnesses the destruction of his beloved starship that soon descends violently into the planet's atmosphere. The comprehensive attack was led by Krall (Idris Elba), who captured the surviving crewmembers while the officers on the deck were split into pairs before escaping. Bones (Karl Urban) treats the wounds of an injured Spock (Zachary Quinto) and the real intentions that led to Spock's disrupted relationship with Uhura (Zoe Saldana) are revealed. They yet battle each other at wits and Karl Urban makes it quite entertaining. Captain Kirk and Chekov (Anton Yelchin) learn that the attack was all a well planned ambush to obtain a world conquering relic, the Abronath, that Kirk had acquired during the failed diplomatic mission. Meanwhile, Montgomery Scott (Simon Pegg) is found by Jaylah (Sofia Boutella), a survivor of a previous attack by Krall's forces, who then brings him to her hideout which is an old, crashed U.S.S. Franklin. Along with Jaylah's resourcefulness, Kirk and the others have to plan a daring rescue of the crewmembers and prevent Krall from executing his malicious plan. Simple enough, considering the individual capabilities but Krall has already departed with the swarm of ships towards the nebula with a destructive agenda. It will take some incredulous motorcycle riding on an alien planet, some daring stunt-work aboard a starship, the Beastie Boys and some gravity defying fist fight to disrupt Krall's plans but the crew is prepared with all that and more. Chris Pine portrays a matured James Kirk who has yet to find a mission to relate to for the rest of his life. Yet, he is always keen on embarking on an adventurous voyage, risking his life but with absolute certainty that he will emerge victorious in his cause. His dynamic with Spock delineates far more trust and respect for each other's talents and skills. Zachary Quinto has always been the lucid, logical stronghold of the franchise who can clearly distinguish between right and wrong. Yet, we see Spock now evolving into a character challenged with decisions that remain in the grey area. Simon Pegg's Scotty is frustrated with Kirk's decisions to push the ship beyond its capabilities but with Jaylah by his side, he finds renewed enthusiasm to innovate and fix things. Sofia's Jaylah on the other hand, adds a fun new character to the franchise that was rather male dominated except for Zoe Saldana's despondent Uhura. Karl Urban is in perpetual disbelief with Kirk's adventurous ideas but he lends a helping hand to Spock in dire circumstances. It all makes him the most entertaining crewmember in Beyond. The late Anton Yelchin engages in more action sequences than ever before while he fixes the ship's broken parts and greets the Captain on the bridge. His spontaneous wit and easy likable performance will be sorely missed. Finally, Idris Elba is his recognizable self outside the prosthetic makeup for some time and he completely dominates the scene then, but there was perhaps too much of an expressionless Krall. Justin Lin's approach to Star Trek involves some breathtaking visual effects that bring the imaginative Yorktown to life and the details of the Enterprise's structure as it is gradually destroyed piece by piece. The action is frenetic and highly engaging because he ensures that we have invested in the characters involved in the sequence. There is a certain old school style that he has also adopted that showcases more hand-to-hand combat, blasting music through space and keeping the action really intense even though incredulous on many occasions. The action may be the strength and weakness of this one. In remarkable contrast, Lin also manages to get deeper into the chemistry between the crewmembers and the highlight is the poignant scene when Spock stares at a photograph that will bring bitter joy to ardent fans. It's quite a shame that the general interest in this franchise has fallen to such lower levels as Star Trek Beyond truly makes the case for the most fun in the final frontier.8.114 on a scale of 1-10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The narrative ark stayed at a steady average 6.5 out of 10. Nothing special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film's narrative felt exactly like an episodic TV version of Star Trek. The narrative peaks were weak and stayed at a safe margin meaning the whole film was forgettable within minutes. There were no real stakes, no one was in a real danger and the balance between the comedy and the action writing was unbalanced. Simon Pegg is a good writer but not a great one when it comes to pinpointing the main character and focus on him/her. It is hinted that the movie is a unity/communal interaction but. I think that its where the faults lie because those kind of interactions are most suited for TV and not Film. Film needs to be "concentrated" gritty, focusing the best parts into a burst of fine writing and performances and not dragging and stalling like in a TV series. The Star Trek movies are starting to fall to the course of the last generation star trek films that feel like TV episodes rather than films. Find the best Star Trek stories and capitulate on them (Mirror Mirror: How about Enterprise vs an evil Alternative Universe Enterprise battle aa? or how about an origin story of the Borgs? How about going a bit dark but also maintaining the comedy, it needs to be scary so the stakes are higher. I can't believe that the Star Trek Beyond story was picked. It was weak...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't Decide if it Wants to be Slow or Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Trek Beyond is the third installment of the new Star Trek movies starring Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto and directed by J.J. Abrams. This one follows the crew of the Enterprise as they hit the 3-year mark in their 5 year space expedition when an alien attacks them in the hopes of gaining a weapon that they happened to pick up along the way. As usual, the whole cast pulls off some great performances, especially the two main leads. Idris Elba as the main antagonist is as good as it sounds, and in case you don't know what that means he was great, and Sofia Boutella is great as Jayla. The characters stayed mostly consistent, but it expected that they would change over the course of three years (and they did). The new character, Jayla, I particularly liked. She managed to be both adorable and badass at the same time, and yet neither side of her felt out of place or anything. I wish that there was more of her, though. More of everyone actually. Half the movie is pretty fun to watch, and although I never felt scared or worried for any of the characters' well-being, I was able to enjoy it well enough.The other half of this movie, however, was quite simply boring. This is one of those movies where I will yawn substantially more over the course of 20 minutes than I will at any other time. Problem is, the movie keeps switching between boring and interesting. It's almost like the movie just flips a switch and suddenly I'm bored, then it flips it again and it's interesting and fun and stuff. It just could never really decide what to do with it's pacing. The movie tried too hard to be a formulaic mainstream movie, which I wasn't at all fond of. Sure, it wasn't entirely formulaic, but with the previous two movies in mind it ended up being very apparent that this movie was just another mainstream sci-fi. The other two were, while far from perfect, different enough that they weren't blatantly formulaic and unoriginal. Star Trek Beyond lacks that level of creativity that J.J. Abrams managed to achieve with his first two films. This was, of course, partly due to the writing. It wasn't always very good. Most of the time it was fine, but some lines were forced into the dialogue simply for the sake of making a couple cool one-liners for the trailer. They didn't really have a place in the movie, yet there they were. And on top of all that this is easily the least interesting plot line of the three. It's super simple and easy to follow, yet it tries to be something more from time to time. With the other two it wasn't always clear what was happening or who the bad guy really was, but this movie was super clear. Here's the bad guy, here's his intention, here's his motivation, end of story. Sure, it doesn't reveal everything right off the bat, but there's never any complications with the story or even the bad guy. He's super straightforward. Furthermore, the movie was extremely rushed. Maybe it was just me and my expectations for what it'd be about, but it focused heavily on action and not so much on development. It all felt abrupt and over too quickly. Sure, the other ones could be rushed, but this movie just breezed past everything simply for the sake of throwing loads of crazy battle sequences at you. Overall Star Trek Beyond is, despite everything, an entertaining end to the new Star Trek trilogy. While I certainly wish J.J. Abrams had taken the reigns with this one, Justin Lin did a decent job. In the end I'd still recommend this movie, particularly if you liked the first two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond J.J.'s Direction...A New Frontier?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Star Trek Beyond as part of a triple bill following after Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darkness, now whether it was tiredness or the fact that I had just watched all three in such close proximity I wasn't quite sure what to make of it and had reservations that I couldn't quite put my finger on.However I have since seen it in a right sense of mind and although a couple of those initial reservations still remain I've come out happier and more pleased than I initially expected.Now we have newcomers to the franchise that J.J. Abrams rejuvenated with such tremendous gusto and success seven years ago with a new director in Justin Lin and new scriptwriters in the form of Doug Jung and actor Simon Pegg, these significant changes can't be overlooked and it is most certainly noticeable in the feel and tone of the film, so in many ways this was always going to be a different beast of a film and this is really where the film is either going to win you over of lose you, I myself really enjoyed the previous two films and thought as pure grand spectacle cinema they are superbly entertaining.So with this film we have a different style and it kind of harks back to the exploration feel of the TV series in a sense although that is not to say that the film skimps on the action I mean this is from a director who was involved with the Fast and Furious series of films, with an astonishing first act destruction of the Enterprise and a final act attack on a federation space station that are just a feast for the eyes, if sometimes a bit busy, busy like a bee some may say, in-joke there.Our main cast after the destruction of the Enterprise from an unknown enemy initially all end up split up from each other on an uncharted planet so whether it's Kirk with Chekov, or Spock with Bones, or Sulu with Uhura we are presented with different character interactions and dynamics than we are generally used to witnessing, the most effective of these team-ups without a doubt is the combination of Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Bones (Karl Urban) and the main source of humour from the film comes from their character interactions throughout said film, the humour in general throughout the film could be described as a bit dry or hit and miss some could say but like I said just previously when they get it right my word do the get it right, a certain piece of Vulcan jewelry certainly springs to mind.Also in reference to the action set pieces earlier although a bit busy there are two moments where you go 'hell yeah' well I did anyway, one being a jump-start spaceship drop and a Beastie Boys inspired destruction of the enemy in the final act that was just ridiculously well done.The music score is actually rather underplayed throughout the film having certainly felt its effect much greater in the previous installments, so when it does spring to life you go 'I wish this was in-play more'.One category the film deserves a ten star rating is the truly phenomenal makeup effects of principally Idris Elba's (who himself is on good bad guy form) big bad Krall but in general all the alien races/species that appear on screen, I love this kind of use of practical effects that lends such a vividness to the film that is not utilised enough elsewhere in the industry, so in the spirit of Siskel and Ebert this aspect is given a full 'Two Thumbs Up' Not everything works though and there were certain passages of dialogue and certain elements to the story structure that I felt made the film feel slightly disjointed and not as smooth as its predecessors had produced, the film does sometimes give off the impression of being a more personal and character interactive experience but not all of these interactions are fully successful, this would be hard to achieve given the number of characters in play, I do however appreciate some of the effort to break out from the usually typical exchanges we've become accustomed to seeing.However in light of what I would regard a rather critically tame year for spectacle blockbusters I feel Star Trek Beyond more than compensates for it's faults with more than enough wit and insider love for its genre and therefore existing fanbase.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out-of-this-world?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This latest 122-minute episode of the Prequel series is co-scripted by Simon Pegg, who also plays Scotty the dour but endearing engineer who sooner or later we know will manage to kick-start the Warp drive of another damaged starship.Responding to a distress call on the far side of the universe, the Enterprise is attacked by a swarm of alien ships and crash-lands on a craggy planet with an Earthlike atmosphere. The scattered crew reunite and help the good alien (female) confront the bad alien (Idris Elba in Borg-like makeup) who is after the key to a new superweapon that, if unleashed, can destroy the Federation.OK, this is a plot we have seen before ? several times ? and there are chase and fight scenes that date back to cowboy or kung-fu movies as much as to early sci-fi. The CGI is outstanding and the scenes on the space mega-city Yorktown are seriously out-of-this- world. The cast, settling into the roles most of us still associate with Leonard Nimoy and Co, have become likable in their own right - especially Zachary Quinto as Spock the Younger. Chris Pine's Captain Kirk is slightly wooden, which may be a deliberate homage to dear old William Shatner. Pegg's script includes some welcome humour and the occasional nod towards Intergalactic Philosophy that has always been a clumsy but welcome feature of the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unoriginal but workmanlike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the 13th "Star Trek" movie and the third in the rebooted version of the franchise, so you'd be wrong to expect much originality but this is a very workmanlike and entertaining addition to the canon. J J Abrams, who directed the first two segments of the reboot, has moved on to the "Star Wars" saga so, although he remains as one of the nine producers, the directorial responsibilities are taken over by the Taiwanese American Justin Lin who has helmed three of the films in the "Fast And Furious" franchise. The cast of the crew are the same (and Simon Pegg is now a co-writer), but original actors come in the form of Idris Elba as the villain Krall and Sofia Boutella as heroine Jaylah, both of whom look great and bring some charisma to their roles.Some of the special effects are spectacular, notably the realisation of the world of Yorktown, but some of the sets - especially parts of the alien world - look little better than the original TV series. As so often with "Star Trek" movies though, the major weakness is plotting which is unoriginal and, in this case, hardly credible. I mean: what's the most unlikely thing that could happen to the USS Enterprise? That it is actually destroyed, right? And what could be more unlikely than that? That the crew manage to find another functioning starship, right? So, I don't want to spoil the story for you, but let's just say that the narrative is unlikely in the extreme. But then, who cares? This is "Star Trek" - enjoy the warp speed ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch other Star Trek things before this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been more of a Star Wars fan, but I can see the appeal of Star Trek to many. I kinda enjoyed Into Darkness, so when this came out, I thought it would be alright. I knew I wouldn't like it as much as others, considering at that point the only Star Trek thing I'd seen was Into Darkness. When I left the theater a few hours later, I felt half satisfied that I saw it, half wishing I had seen more Star Trek so I could understand more about what was happening.For example on that last half, the twist at the end is that the main villain was actually the captain of Discovery, which crashed many, many years back. And he now thinks that the Galactic Federation is the worst thing ever to happen, and wants it dead. Thing is, I felt like I was supposed to be gasping when that was revealed. Like, "OMG! THAT'S THE GUY FROM (insert Star Trek thing I have not seen here)!!!!!1!". But, that never happened. There were other things too, but that was the main problem.The story was good, the action was good, the humor was good, everything about it was good. But I haven't actually seen other movies or shows in the Star Trek franchise, so I couldn't enjoy it as much as the average Star Trek fan. So maybe when I've watched more Star Trek things I can come back and give it a higher (or lower) score, and maybe write a second review. But for now, it's a good movie with some good things. Just make sure you watch the other things first.</fullReview>

There were heartfelt character moments, and the action scenes were entertaining and well filmed. It goes without saying that the effects for the series are impressive, but they take it up a notch this time. Co writer and super fan Simon Pegg brings some great humour to the series after the overly serious Into Darkness.The heartfelt send off to Leonard Nimoy was handled well and Idris Elba brought menace and gravitas to a role that could have been "villian of the week". A resteady of the series after the shaky Wrath of Khan film. May Star Trek continue into the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Space Motorcyles! But No Stakes...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Trek Beyond is not a bad movie. It's deeply, resoundingly "okay." I can't say that any one part of it was particularly memorable?to the point that if I didn't write this review soon after seeing it, I would surely forget it?but it was certainly a worthwhile way to spend an evening. The visuals are stunning; Yorktown space station was glorious enough that I almost wish the entire movie had taken place there. The interaction between Karl Urban's Bones and Zachary Quinto's Spock was a joy to behold.Still, the movie feels somewhat lop-sided. I laughed way more at the end than at the beginning, even though the latter fourth of the movie really shouldn't have been funny at all since it's where we finally (finally!) learned the enemy's motivation. But even that isn't particularly well-developed: a rather generic old-warrior-knows-nothing-but-war kind of tragedy. Had they let us know about this from the beginning?and I really can't see why they couldn't have?I would have felt more invested in the conflict between the Enterprise and the mysterious bee ships, who for most of the movie were just evil for the sake of being evil.The whole conflict between the Enterprise and the bee aliens was mishandled. Seemingly invincible at first?wrecking the Enterprise completely in mere minutes?they rapidly become incapable of guarding prisons, detecting intruders, or defending against radio transmissions. The spectacular defeat of the enemy in the final battle sequence felt ludicrously out of place, not only because of the simplicity of their defeat, but because it was way too comedic. As I mentioned earlier, the movie is not very funny at the start, but becomes so just as it becomes most serious. This is an awkward juxtaposition that makes the final victory seem so assured that it was obviously only a matter of time before the plucky crew of the Enterprise vanquished the enemy and saved the day.This really goes to show the central problem of Beyond, which, ironically, Into Darkness did quite well. Namely, it never feels like there are any consequences for Kirk and his crew. Sure, half the ship's crew is killed in the first battle with the soon-to-be-way-less-frightening enemy, but they're slaughtered so casually that their deaths seem unimportant. In comparison to the motorcycle escapade in Beyond, Kirk's attempt to fix the broken engine on the Enterprise as it plummets into the Earth, subjecting him to deadly levels of radiation in the process, is less visually exciting, but it's much more emotionally immersive. Spock's inability to save his dying comrade is poignant and affecting, whereas no such self-sacrifice is to be found in Beyond. Opportunities to threaten the beloved bridge crew of the Enterprise are squandered, and at no point is the audience concerned about losing one of its main characters. Indeed, even when the Enterprise is utterly destroyed by the bee people, no one is actually concerned that they've seen the last of the fabled ship. Early on in the movie the commander/admiral/honcho-in-chief of Yorktown drops the least subtle hint in history that Star Trek's most fabled vessel will live on in a new form.Despite the plot problems, the cast mostly rose to the challenge. I like Zachary Quinto as Mr. Spock. His version of the analytically minded half-Vulcan is as charming and endearing as it's possible for a near-robot to be. Karl Urban as the always exasperated Bones is believable and eternally re-watchable. Zoe Saldana is little used in this particular film (a side effect of the also underdeveloped relationship drama between her Lt. Uhura and Spock), but does just fine where she appears. Chris Pine's Captain Kirk continues to puzzle me though. Pine cuts the right figure for the role?I would even call him the "natural" choice to play Kirk?but his portrayal has nevertheless left me thinking that the captain of the Enterprise is genuinely taken aback by every trap or surprise lurking behind the corner. Perhaps it's the writers' insistence on portraying him as perennially incapable of dignified composure, but Pine's acting does little to reassure the viewer that he is firmly in control of the situation. He seems to flap about his own star ship, stumbling his way into and out of trouble while somehow keeping hold of his overactive eyebrows, which are constantly trying to fly up off his head. Still, when he is called upon to act dignified, Pine can do it, but the script just doesn't give him the opportunities he needs.Instead, the writers seem to think that giving Pine daredevil stunts will convince audiences that the captain has it all in his grasp. But self-sacrificially riding around a desert encampment on a motorcycle doesn't communicate tactics. It really just looks like attention-seeking histrionics.Sometimes, it almost feels like Abram's version of Kirk, now inherited by Lin, was the original, but misplaced, incarnation of Star Wars' much loved Poe Dameron. But Dameron is a fighter pilot, not a captain. Kirk's antics wouldn't seem out of place if they were performed by a character who had that kind of role in this movie. Perhaps it's just my own lacking ability to suspend disbelief, but I feel like Kirk simply does too much in these latest Star Trek films.But it's still worth watching because it is fun. The new writing team of Simon Pegg and Doug Jung may have written only half a plot, but they know how to draw a laugh, if not exactly when is best to draw it. If the Star Trek franchise is to continue making films the core component of their business into the coming years, I would like to see a return, at least partially, to the more philosophical bent of the television series, but honestly I would also be content with the characters just having actual stakes to their moral decisions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awesome Film if you can ignore the shaky cam Star Trek Beyond in my opinion is worthy addition to the Star Trek Franchise however it does come with some awful pieces but I will get to that later. What it improved on from the previous installment was the characters. The first movie introduced the legendary characters and the second movie kind of shoved some of them into the background and we really never got to know much more about them such as McCoy, Sulu, and Chekov. However this film gave them all more screen time and their interactions especially with Dr. McCoy and Spock. The plot also felt like a throwback to the original series and in my opinion was decent. Now for the cons. The biggest one was the action. In my personal opinion I hate shaky cams when they are not needed. It makes the action hard to follow and to make matters worse during the first act the sets were too dark to know what was happening making it a big mess. But after the first act the action got better but overall I felt that the film is good addition to the franchise and did well handling Leonard Nimoy's death. Overall rating 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Trek Beyond; welcome back TOS on steroids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Trek Beyond is TOS (the original series) on steroids. This movie was a welcome home for me of what Gene Roddenberry envisioned when he created the TV series. Mr. Roddenberry used TOS to spotlight social and political issues of the day. This film is a return to that vision. This movie is a perfect metaphor for the 2016 US presidential election campaign; it speaks to real sacrifice, teamwork and unity in the face of terrorist threats. I always preface my comments by saying my age (I am currently 72 years old) and that I saw the very first episode of TOS the very first time it aired and have been passionate about these characters ever since. For those who only saw Star Trek Beyond once and were disappointed, please see it again. Star Trek fan(atic)s like myself have great expectations for each movie in the franchise and it takes more than one viewing to appreciate each movie for what they do bring. I didn't start to appreciate and enjoy STB until I saw it the 2nd time and as of today I have seen it 7 times. With each viewing I spot something I wasn't aware of before. It's a very complex script with both great dialogue and action. Every one of the command team had their moments in the limelight using their professional skills; the incredible humor of the series is back (loved Bones and Spock interactions); and the crew has really grown up. Chris Pine as Kirk is remarkable (and gorgeous). He has matured to the point that he is fully the Captain of his soul and of his crew. The best part was being able to laugh with an audience that appreciated the humor; and most of all, the audience applauded at the end of this film.No one in the many times I saw Star Trek: Into Darkness applauded at the end of that film. I thank J.J. Abrams for bringing the series back but I have to say that I prefer Justin Lin's take on the series and Simon Pegg as part of the writing team. There was too much destruction of people and property in the first two films. My vision for the next film in this series is to keep the Enterprise intact. While visiting a new planet have Captain Kirk use his considerable charisma and diplomatic skills to persuade two warring factions of the same planet to unite; have Dr. McCoy perform medical miracles, have Mr. Spock use his incredible scientific knowledge and everyone else in the command crew working together (and having fun). I am terribly saddened by the tragic loss of Anton Yelchin at such a young age. He was adorable as Checkov. He will be missed. It would be really nice if Jaylah could join the command team to keep the continuity. She is a welcome addition to the chemistry of the crew. And I cannot say enough about how great Simon Pegg is as Montgomery 'Scotty'. He has so much heart. I love the way he interacts with Kirk, Jaylah and Keenser. Live Long and Prosper Star Trek AOS and my fellow/gal trekkies/trekkers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Line Between Good and Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Growing up I wasn't the biggest Star Trek fan, it was all about Star Wars for me. In 2009, however, the reboot of the beloved franchise took my interest to new heights, and its 2013 sequel cemented my newfound love for Star Trek. I came into the theater with high expectations for installment number three, and while there were undoubtedly hiccups and some moments of disappointment, Star Trek Beyond is a good film, continuing the franchise's string of exciting adventures.One of the first, most noticeable differences in Beyond, for better or for worse, is a new director in Justin Lin, taking over the chair from J.J. Abrams, and a new lead writer in the form of Simon Pegg. The overall feel of Beyond is much more lighthearted, humorous and contained due to Pegg, changes I did not completely welcome, compared to the previous two films, which were mainly emotionally- driven and larger in scope. The new approach to storytelling left me internally conflicted, I found myself at times sincerely entertained and other times utterly uninterested. The antagonist, Krall, started as a promising villain but turned weaker as the film progressed, his motives became less clear and his intimidation factor nearly disappeared. Again, Krall is solid towards the beginning, but mediocre writing of the character spoiled a chance of another great villain, like Nero and Khan before him, which bring me to my next point.The character arcs built across these films are strong, something that wasn't played on nearly enough in this film. Although the characters gel together better than ever on screen, the further development of the characters was stalled in Beyond, and in turn left me a little less emotionally invested in each characters outcome. At large, the story was solid, for sure the weakest of the three films, with noticeable plot holes and clichs, but enough humor, decent pacing and big- budget action to keep the film entertaining as a whole.The ensemble cast put together for the reboot series has been fantastic to say the least, and in Beyond we see the return of said wonderful cast lead by Chris Pine (Captain Kirk), Zachary Quinto (Spock), Zoe Saldana (Uhura) and Karl Urban (Bones). The top billed cast all give solid performances, the largest setback being the aforementioned lack of further character growth, leaving it behind for more quips and one-liners, a trait that becomes borderline annoying from certain character, especially Bones. The supporting cast is equally as solid, and while there's no doubt that each actor is great, there's a sense that most of them weren't as invested in their roles as before, something that could be directed back to the new writing and direction style. I would b remiss to not mention the touching homage to Leonard Nimoy and the rest of the original Star Trek cast, or the life of Anton Yelchin, who was excellent in this film and was taken from the world too soon. All in all, I can't say that the cast was as good as their first two outings, but they weren't bad by any means.Sci-fi settings are prime chances to introduce enticing new locations, weapons, technology and action, and Beyond did a splendid job keeping my eyes glued during the largest action scenes, with wonderful CGI and a couple of epic space battles that are extremely fun to watch. We've basically traded out the lens flare of J.J. Abrams for the shaky-cam of Justin Lin, which makes some of the up close action less enjoyable, but the majority of the action is either grand space battles or ferocious firefights. The Enterprise and her crew are executed very well in the beginnings of the movie, but its importance unfortunately drifts away later on. The action doesn't get too messy or uninteresting, it's explosive fun, and with added humor sprinkled in, Beyond's action is a different kind of satisfying compared to the last two films.While it's hardly the films before it, Beyond delivers on many of the quality traits that brought the series to my attention in the first place. No question, there was a shift in feel for this film, however. With new direction and new writing, the less emotionally engaging plot and limited character arc expansion give way to some clear inconsistencies. But even so, Star Trek Beyond is pleasing enough on several levels to plant itself as a worthy entry into glimmering franchise which can only get better from here.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent attempt at a Star Trek outing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, as a lifelong Star Trek fan and not a big fan of the last movie, I had serious reservations about this one - especially as it was directed by Justin "Fast &amp; Furious" Lin. However, credit where it's due, he made a great attempt at this, and it turned out to be good fun (and WAY better than Jar Jar Abrams' "Into Darkness" mess). It's STILL not Star Trek like the REAL Star Trek - there are no memorable lines here and you won't be playing particular scenes over and over in your head, but this is the world we now live in. They've given all your other favorites the same treatment (and ruined them too), James Bond and Star Wars being among the countless franchises to fall victim. Somehow we've got the point where ALL movies need to be a politically correct as possible, have as a diverse a cast as possible, and appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Hollywood want EVERYBODY to be fans of EVERYTHING from here on - no more closed communities thank you very much. Given all this, and that Star Trek now has to fit this terrible template, this movie could have been SO much worse. Yes, it has plot holes galore (they're on purpose, don't you know? So the fans can have "insane theory" videos on YouTube), but it also has lots of references to the Star Trek Universe over the last 50 years to celebrate the 50th anniversary. These are subtle enough to indicate that they were put there for the real HARDCORE fans, which I thought was respectful and made me sit up and pay a bit more attention every time I spotted one. One thing that really bugged me though - some of the actors, as they get older, look even LESS like the characters should on screen. For instance, Simon Pegg would want to start piling on the pounds to play an older Scotty, and in the same vain Zachary Quinto should probably lose a few. But these are minor details for sure. To finish on a positive note, Sofia Boutella who plays the alien Jaylah is really good, and a very likely contender to replace Anton Yelchin who sadly passed away recently. As I've read they won't be recasting Chekov (good!) then I think she would make a fine addition to the crew. Someone make this happen!If you're a Trek fan at all you SHOULD go see this one. It's SLIGHTLY dragged out near the end, but there is at least a solid 90 minutes of big screen action to be enjoyed in there somewhere. A fitting way to celebrate 50 years of Trek? Maybe. I certainly didn't feel like walking out like during the last outing.. and during Star Wars... and during SPECTRE....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe Not Star Trek as It Should Be, But Star Trek as I Like It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a fan of the 'Star Trek' franchise. It's as plain as that. I enjoy two or three movies out of a twelve film franchise, plus whatever TV shows have existed over all these decades. I wouldn't call myself a fan for that. But sometimes, one of these films manages to capture my attention, and 'Beyond' has done that brilliantly. So for the Trekkies out there, this review really isn't for you. I don't know crap about this universe besides what little I've managed to learn from the films I've seen. This is a review coming from an audience member who used to think that 'Star Wars' was miles above 'Trek'. And maybe that's still true. But with the recent release of 'The Force Awakens', Wars has lowered itself on my overall rating scale. Wars and Trek, for me, have now sunk to about the same level. They both now have more average to bad films than good ones. For this reason, I've recently decided that I'd like it if Trek decided to pick up and entertain me more than it has in the past. Star Wars is about to be worn thin and the OT will become our only refuge. While nothing can ruin the greatness of those first three films, it sucks that the franchise has now received too many black marks to disguise. I admire Trek in how well it has endured all these years. Let's talk about why I like 'Beyond' in particular: character development. Yes, there is plenty to talk about with this movie. There are some problems with the plot (I don't know if I would call them plot "holes", rather there are certain things that just need a little more explanation. But they aren't too severe in my book). The CGI is mostly well done, though the scene with the motorcycle is somewhat cartoony and could use a little touching up. But none of this matters to me as much as character development, and it's something I've always felt Trek did much more poorly than Wars. Harrison Ford once said, "It's finally about the people" and I think that at the time, he was right. A New Hope surpassed Trek because it focused on telling a great story about great characters that happened to take place in outer space. Trek focused much too greatly on dialogue and storytelling related more to the technology and the mere fact that the story takes place in a futuristic space rather than focus on characters. And that gets old after a while. The reboots have progressively tried to give me what I look for in a sci-fi action film. In fact, Trek '09 basically did give me this, but it manages to retain a rating a star below 'Beyond' for it's revolting attempts at humor, particularly Kirk's "giant hands" if you remember that scene ('Beyond' gets more points for lacking almost any unforgivable, unfunny jokes). But again, they both, especially 'Beyond', take time to explore Kirk, Spock, Bones, and the rest of the gang. The villain may be somewhat underdeveloped and poorly done, but I'm so glad that the heroes in this reboot are not only well-written but also call back to the Shatner/Nimoy days, as they should, that I can overlook Idris Elba's antagonist. Is this film perfect? Hardly. All of the Trek reboots are flawed beyond belief, but I really praise them for trying. I hope that any future installments can continue where '09 and 'Beyond' left off, and do even better. I think I'm bordering on the path to being a low-brow fan of the franchise. For now, I'm simply a fan of 'Beyond'. This review is dedicated to Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin, as was the film 'Star Trek: Beyond'. It was a great way to say goodbye to these two late stars. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not all that big on special effects. But with this at IMAX 3D wow. I really enjoyed the movie. During all the Special effects you kind of are thinking "they're going to die". Great cast. Wondering what will happen with the Chekov character since the tragic death of the young man that played him. Looking forward to the next. I did not give it a 10 because It had a bit TO MUCH special effects. Needs more people stuff. But I grew up during the Original Series so I'm spoiled. The ending was a surprise. Cool to see them build a star ship. Nice to see the cast back. Scoot and Kirk are my fave I think. I will recommend this to a friend and did on FB. Got to See this in IMAX 3D.

		<shortDescription>Loved the first 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest Star Trek "Beyond" is above average summer entertainment, thanks mostly to the stunning CGI and special effects. I really enjoyed the first 2 Star Trek movies with this cast but I'd guess the novelty of seeing the original characters again (in their younger bodies) is wearing off. This reboot seems to be settling into a feeling like it's a TV series--some episodes will be better than others, different directors will take the helm but at the end of the day it is still Star Trek--ground-breaking and entertaining and worth watching. "Beyond" had a feeling like we've seen this all before--but the scenes of the "Yorktown" space station were worth the price of admission. I liked the female alien character--she reminded me of the blue female character in "Avatar". Hopefully we'll see her again in future Star Trek films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie that moves the story line forward.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three years into the five year mission, and a malaise has set into the crew and our heroes from the previous films - Kirk and Spock in particular - questioning their purpose and destiny. The first two movies could be seen as an origin of the Enterprise crew and the family unit, and this third entry into the rebooted franchise, what happens to the family when forced together for extended periods.There was much to like about the film, and there is much to its credit: a change of writers and director has shifted the tone somewhat, and this movie feels much like an extended episode of the original series - albeit with the alternate history. That is not an entirely unwelcome shift after the breakneck speed of Star Trek Into Darkness, and the galaxy building of the 2009 Star Trek, but it also doesn't sit well alongside those previous titles.The choice to separate the crew and to see how they interact together in moments of adversity is an interesting one; and given those groups, it leads to some humorous moments. Though I did get the sense that, with Simon Pegg writing, that much of Scotty's moments were to give himself more screen time and a greater sense of heroism. I couldn't escape that feeling every time he was on screen, despite the fact he looked like he was having enormous fun as the Chief Engineer.The crew look leaner, and trimmer than they have before. This is a nice touch given that they have spent a long time in artificial gravity on board a spacecraft where, I imagine, food and water are somewhat rationed. It added a lovely sense of realism to a sci-fi franchise. And, agree with it or not, the decision to have Hikaru Sulu as an openly gay character is one I fully support and I found to be very affirming.I wish I could say the same regarding the female characters, but sadly I cannot. With there really only being four named female characters in the cast, it really doesn't smack of the egalitarian future utopia that Gene Roddenberry envisaged. That said, I cannot solely level that criticism at this title in his Universe. The movie's treatment of people of colour, though, is better. Not great, but better.Idris Elba is on great form as Krall, and he's doing much more acting than I've seen from him in recent movies, to the point that it took me several moments (and his first th/f switch) to notice. Sofia Boutella is pretty great as Jaylah, an impetuous and child-like character, who has a real sense of drive and agency. Her abilities reminded me of a cross between an Eldar ranger (see also: John Harrison taking out the Klingons) and a Dark Eldar Archon. Perhaps our writers have been playing a little Warhammer 40,000.The story, as previously mentioned, feels like an Original Series episode played out over two hours, and that was not an unwelcome shift in tone and style. If anything, it was nice to see the story move forward rather than rehash the origin story yet again simply to crowbar in another famous face from the canon. That's what this whole movie felt like, moving forward, and Justin Lin's direction, although not perfect by any means, was a welcome change to the franchise. The opening does take a little too long in establishing where were are in the story, and it does feel a little too full of references, nods, and "ooh, look at that," moments to maintain a coherent viewing experience.However, once we leave Yorktown - itself a nice little Easter egg for the Trek fans - things do take off at pace, and the audience is thrown deep into the action, spectacle, and emotion. I'd be lying if I didn't become emotionally involved in the movie, because I did. I felt the characters' emotional journeys as the film progressed, and despite some minor issues I had with the writing, a film that engages me on that level is a film that works.Sure, there are some cheesy parts - particularly the musical call back to the first movie - but it works in the context set by the film, and Krall's ability and changing features is deftly introduced and developed. I didn't spot him in the first play through of the video footage in the movie, and it wasn't until Uhura identifies him, that I did. That's some good editing right there. His motivation isn't revealed until the last, but when it is the rest of his actions are then made clear in an interesting mirror for the crew of the Enterprise.There was a minor shonky visual effects issue I had during one sequence that brought me out of the action, but the rest of the action throughout is done with great flair and attention to detail, which is something I'd expect from the director of some of the more successful Fast &amp; Furious movies.Star Trek Beyond doesn't have the same galactic scope or scale of the first two movies, but what they lacked this has in spades: characters and relationships. The action is given context, the events have consequences, and the crew are made to suffer and triumph through their adversity. Kirk isn't the brash rule-breaker of before. Spock is still trying to reconcile his emotional and logical sides. Bones is just as ornery, but more level-headed; and his relationship with Spock is a great spine on which to build the rest of the movie. It's an older, more resolute, more mature crew we find this time out; and they are given an ensemble story to match.Though I enjoyed the movie, it wasn't the action packed thrill ride of Star Trek Into Darkness, nor was it as interesting a watch as Star Trek (2009). But it was more satisfying on an emotional level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>something was missing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It should have been better. I am a Star Trek fan and on that level I liked it. The familiar characters, and familiar tropes were all there. The make up and costuming, design and CGI were all outstanding. The acting was pretty much phoned in during any of the dramatic bits and the action bits were loaded with testosterone. There are some tropes that I really dislike and this is a bit of a spoiler but why is the big villain is quite often a big black guy and it is possible to pick out the victims even without seeing them wear a red shirt. Where it all falls down is in the story. It really tries hard but it just falls flat. It was like the director made a choice of having action or plot and action won.</fullReview>

She steals the show on the screen. Put her on the sequel, she kicks butt ! And the Entreprise crew itself reminesces of the Original Series with specific lines, which all Trekkies remember (to quote Spock: fascinating).Movie gets slow to start, but once on the stranded planet, things are moving at a fast pace...A movie Trekkies can enjoy...RIP Leonard and Anton...

		<shortDescription>Tell me what happened</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I will admit we were stuck in the front row of a nearly sold out theater (they put in recliners and now every movie seems to be sold out), this may not entirely apply to everyone. But 1) the fast frame jerky CGI made it impossible to tell what was supposed to be happening in nearly every action sequence, and 2) the muddled, half-baked plot didn't help matters much. I'll make my obligatory Quinto/Spock comment and move on: he doesn't act like Spock, nor does he act like a Vulcan. I would suggest he watch say several episodes of the original series. So they could have made him a Vulcan and that would be okay, but making him Spock and then acting quirky human like he does is screwy. Speaking of the original series (the ONLY series for me), there was a significant degradation in plots from the first to the third seasons, I would put this one at about a beginning third year episode: the story really is sort of half explained, jumbled and eventually uninvolving and derivative, but the character interactions although sometimes stilted made it bearable (and newcomer Boutella as Jaylah stood out). This was definitely not up to Star Trek Into Darkness, and my 11 year old was out like a light 30 minutes in through the final credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This is where the frontier pushes back!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After two successful entries of the rebooted Star Trek series, it's finally time to bring the adventures of the Enterprise to the final frontier. What will they find on the edge of space? The latest film finds the Enterprise crew in the middle of their five-year assignment--in the heart of a wicked-looking nebula, they'll come face-to-face with a menace that could wipe out the Federation for good.Surprisingly, the film kicks off on a rather dour note--after an amusing opening scene, Kirk reflects on three years of mundane exploration. Once the set-up is out of the way, the film delivers ample amounts of action that just gets bigger and bigger. Grand space battles. Phaser-beam fights. Lots of running and gunning. In one epic finale, Kirk and the gang has to save a thriving space colony from certain destruction, overcoming swarms of ships before duking it out with the bad guy.There are cool scenes in Star Trek: Beyond, but it's far from the end-all-be-all Trek adventure. Despite the action, the film drags between the major action swells. Part of the issue is that outside of JJ Abrams' hands, a certain something is missing. Color, spirit, and energy are dampened--Beyond is surprisingly dark in its lighting and mood, and slightly bland in its style and writing. Fortunately, the experience is funner in its second half than the first--some light comedy (thanks to McCoy, Scotty, and a lovable alien named Jaylah) and absurdity (a few unlikely stunts, and a certain scene with Beastie Boys music) makes this a fair (but not exceptional) blockbuster experience.The story this film tells is an interesting one for the Enterprise records (and it's most welcome after the uninspired events of Into Darkness). By nature, it's a story that challenges the series' classic themes of exploration and utopic peace. In turn, these themes carry over to the character arcs, as Kirk finds his mojo again in the face of death. Characters are as strong as ever--they are familiar and mature at this point, and they feel more at home as the Enterprise crew than they did in the previous films. The villain adds an interesting dimension to things as well--I found the big twist predictable, but it is an interesting turn that keeps the action going and keeps enough brain cells firing. The film offers a few sentiments concerning certain characters and events before its closing, keeping it from being a total throwaway.The film boasts plain photography and editing. Most scenes in the first half seem really dark and drab. However, there are some impressive standouts (including a great time-lapse shot of a spaceship being built). Acting is great: Chris Pine seems most mature as Captain Kirk, but still kicks plenty of butt and shows all the right attitude we know and love. Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, John Cho, and Anton Yelchin still deliver great performances. Idris Elba is a decently-menacing villain, and I was fairly smitten by Sofia Boutellas' character. Writing is not bad--it's nowhere near as low-key as the last two movies, which I think makes the film more creditable as a Trek movie, but it also comes off as a little dry (even with the humor). This production uses decent-looking sets, props, and costumes--a lot of things match up with the Trek universe well, and Yorktown might be the most imaginative space station I've seen. Most special effects are great. The music score is lovely.Star Trek: Beyond doesn't have the same punch as its predecessors, but it is an enjoyable film with an original, fairly thoughtful story. While the film won't leave as big of an impact, it has its fair share of fun.3.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Trek classic!(minimal spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched a lot of sci-fy movies and TV shows and though I haven't watched the old Star Trek series or movies, I've seen some glimpses and some scenes especially from the original movies, so in general I know how a Star Trek and especially a sci- fy movie should feel like and how should it look on the big screen.When I went today in the cinema, I was hoping for a movie just as good as the soundtrack I've downloaded several days ago. And what stayed with me after this movie was how mature and serious this movie was compared to the other new Star Trek. Although I haven't watched the whole series and all the "old" Star Trek movies, I entered this universe when I first watched Star Trek and Star Trek into Darkness in 2013. I absolutely loved them, although those movies were a little too light and maybe to childish at times, but were very good, especially the second one, although setting up a villain and his backstory was probably the weakest point of these movies. This one is no exception. Here's my opinion on the movie:God: Again I'm very pleasantly surprised by how mature this movie is, especially the crew. I'll start with Kirk who is light years away from the dumb and a**hole character that he was in the first two movies. And after seeing this movie and thinking about the whole picture of Jim Kirk throughout the this three movies, I realize why his character was such an a**hole in the first two, it was his beginnings along the Federation, and he didn't learn some lessons, while here there is a more mature Kirk, a one that has been through some things in life and last but not least, a more closer one to the original version(I'm no expert but it's my opinion).The best prove of this is when he saves his crew(no details, I'll leave you to see it for yourself). Next Spock receives a important news, and it changes his character completely, it becomes so sure of himself and involved in what will happen next, while also maintaining that robotic allure from the original series. Next, McCoy, Uhura, Chekov, Sulu, Scotty are all not overflowed with jokes or funny moments but rather they have a very mature attitude while being in a difficult situation. Jaylah fits well, but it's more of a helpful character introduced only to serve the Enterprise crew, her backstory is not well explored(maybe due to the short runtime). Krall is an OK villain, although again he like all other from this new series have a weak background story and setup, but his story in this movie is very clever putted on screen. Just when you would think he's background story is left unexploited, the movie has a twist. And this is one of the things i liked about this movie, the twists. Sure in a movie that showed you so much in the trailer, it might be predictable, but there are a few fine twists in the movie, that makes it entertaining and enjoyable. The score is absolutely amazing. It's that kind of soundtrack that stays with you and makes you listen it again, probably one of the best from Michael Giacchino, especially the scene where Yorktown is showed, the score reminded me of 2001: A Space Odyssey with that amazing classical score. The script is OK to say the least, and it's very good in only a way, that brings more maturity to the characters and to the action overall. An last but not least, I am very pleased with how the director Jusin Lin handled the movie. I liked that there was no ridiculous action or CGI extravaganza, instead the movie was alternating well from action to sensible and more "peacefull" moments.Bad: The villain of course hasn't really a very deep and emotional motive to what he does, and it doesn't convince you, just like Apocalypse early this year. Maybe at times is too predictable, but then again there are some very clever scenes that really keep you guessing what's going to happen next. Background story for Jeylah is simply a phrase, which is annoying for a character that'll be important in the future films, her backstory is rushed.Overall I was very pleased with this movie. I might watch it again, if I'll have the opportunity, but for now I give it a 8. Although this movie's rating of 7.5 at this time it's fair enough, seems that many critics are still calling it good but with low rating, that just shows that they have no idea how a Star Trek or a general Sci-fy movie should be like, and neither some of the angry trekkies who might appear with bad reviews as they did to the previous movies. But maybe the maturity in this movie might please some of this fans, who knows?So all in all, this is my personal opinion of the movie. I wanting to be objective as I could, tried to pin out the good parts, and the bad ones, hope you agree with me, and even if you don't that's fine, we all have different opinions, that's what makes us unique.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pegg-penned script takes us back to the best of TOS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After experiencing the clumsy dead-hand of unoriginality, that was 'Star Trek Into Darkness' (2013), this reviewer had resolved not see the new Star Trek film, but was persuaded by a fan to go and see it. A decision that turned out to be a very satisfying one.Paramount Pictures 'Star Trek Beyond' opens with the iconic mountain. Thereafter, from the opening scenes, and those that followed, we were presented with a lightness of touch that also paid homage to TOS of TV and the later films with that original cast. Credit for this must go to writer Simon Pegg.Unlike the dusted-down script of 'Darkness', Simon Pegg's script is original, whilst at the same time true to the characters and their universe. TOS fans will find their characters maintain their integrity, though with a few slight tweaks, and the film contains that humour of TOS, both with the interplay of the characters, as well as a playful handling of situations too. The big themes that Gene Roddenberry had from the beginning are also there for some of the more serious parts of the story. All are shown with a familiarity that is pleasing to the eye.The opening scene, starts rather like one in the old 'VI'. Kirk is using his diplomatic skills as he faces a fearsome crowd of aliens. The said aliens are unimpressed by Kirk's diplomatic skills, viewing his explanations in the worst light possible, and working themselves up into a rage. This first scene is handled in such a way as to make the viewer immediately comfortable with the film and what is to follow.Kirk however, is not comfortable. He is a little introspective, as are other members of the crew. There are some little scenes that show us a life on board ship that we have never seen before. This film, like the other ones in this new series, looks at relationships much more than TOS did.There has been much talk about the character Sulu. George Takei who played Sulu in TOS, has been critical of his character's development, and the contact with him has clearly been clumsy. However, the said development was handled in a subtle way in the film, so subtle in fact, that it may not even have been noticed by some. George Takei complains that the character development was not envisioned as such by Gene Roddenberry, however it should be said that Gene Roddenberry always pushed for futuristic scenarios that were meant to pose a question to present day audiences. Thus this Sulu, must be seen as fitting in to that Roddenberry universe.The film is rated 12A in the UK, it is rather dark in places. The style of filming was found to be far too fast and furious by this reviewer. Many action scenes were made up of far too many fast short takes in which it was unclear what was happening. This was made worse by many scenes shot in dark locations, like dark corridors. This may have been done to give a realistic look, but sadly meant little could be made out much of the time.There were some very impressive scenes in space. Here the Director excelled. Some of the very best scenes, were not only visually impressive, but emotionally too. There are similar themes to the old 'III', we also see some, as already said, that are familiar from 'VI'. All handled well.The blurring and unclear action scenes also included some hand-to-hand combat. However, some of the very best hand-to-hand combat involved Algerian-born Sofia Boutella. She was one of the top-trending actresses at Comic-Con, and it's easy to see why. With her good looks and fighting abilities, she must be a dream-girl for many comic-reading teenage boys. Miss Boutella was in a lot of scenes and gave a commanding performance. She was also able to portray much emotion in her performance, despite being so heavily made up. Miss Boutella had an accent that this reviewer thought was vaguely eastern-European. It was light and attractive, as well as throaty and guttural too. Perhaps it is Arabic. The accents used throughout the film helped fill out the characters in the film. They were well used.As is usual in the Star Trek universe, the main characters are Kirk, Spock and McCoy, and the interplay of their characters was in the classic mould. They were well played by Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Karl Urban. There was good support also from Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, John Cho and Anton Yelchin as characters Uhuru, Scott, Sulu and Chekov.TOS fans will enjoy this film. On the whole they will find it true to the original, one particular scene they will find very poignant. This new Star Trek incarnation pays homage to the TOS characters in it's newly written script, as such therefore it is on a par with the very best of the old. A roller-coaster ride through space during the end- credits is well worth seeing in it's entirety.Warp Factor: 9</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, you are, mister McCoy. And Enterprise is a discovery ship, not a military vessel. And Federation of 23d century is a highly developed society, not a bunch of Harley-riders and leather-jacket-wearers.Before i begin, can someone explain to me why this movie is called Beyond?I gave this movie a high score, because it's highly enjoyable, reasonably interesting and visually appealing story about an adventure of great charismatic (potentially) characters. 120 minutes finished like a quantum and i wanted more. But i couldn't miss noticing some elements, that from a point of view of a hard core sci-fi fan could be pretty disturbing.It seemed like Paramount wasn't happy with the box-office of the first 2 installments in the reloaded franchise. So they decided to make third one more appealing to wide audience. This resulted in trusting Simon Pegg to write a script, which promised to make Beyond more a simplistic comedy than serious deep sci-fi stuff. Remember the two Spocks story from 2009 flick? This was some seeerious stuff comparing to what is happening here. Director's seat was taken by Justin Lin, that is most famous by his Fast and Furious movies, which are ultimate examples of pure entertainment without a hint of thought.So studio wanted to make Star Trek an easily understandable action-adventure with jokes instead of traditional moral-dilemma packed science fiction with a lot of technical detail. It seemed disastrous, if you ask me. But final result is not so bad after all. I wouldn't say that newest Star Trek got rid of all the possible wit and became lame as hell, but as I've said, there are some disturbing things.First of all, plot became simple. And they couldn't hide it under never ending downpour of dynamic scenes and quickly dropped in the heat of a battle dialogues. In the end, the main thing, the main motivation for all that happens was pretty simplistic and hard to cope with. While it was appealing with its great idea about civilizational dilemma of sacrifices that successful society makes to be successful, it hid this idea beneath meaningless violence and characters' reaction to it.Then goes the effort to try to make society of 23d century galactic Federation look like a modern society. Captain Kirk rides Harley Davidson, McCoy wears a bad-ass leather jacket, Jaylah listens to Public Enemy and aliens wear cocktail dresses to parties. But what bothered me the most is the way Scotty proposed to deal with enemy cyber-swarm fleet. If you thought sound in space is dumb enough, you have to see this. I don't know, maybe the idea itself from a scientific point of view is not so unrealistic, but in this movie it was presented like a terrible move.Nevertheless, i liked the movie. Comparing to other expensive visually appealing block-busters it does it's stuff very well. Watching it in IMAX i enjoyed visuals and sound production. CG looks decent, space battles, low gravity fights, laser firefights, some punch-and-kick struggle. Impressively looks a new character Jaylah, both in fight scenes and overall. While jokes were not hilarious, occasional Bones and Scotty phrasings were fun enough.One of the typically disappointing elements of block-buster movies is a lack of dynamics. In Star Trek Beyond this problem is non-existing, but the thing is - it's too active sometimes. It doesn't give you any time to think about what you saw, what you felt, it just keeps pushing with more perilous situations for Enterprise crew. Maybe it's not so bad in this case, because when it does give you some time to listen some conversations, dialogues seem written not really good. Most of the movie happens on the surface of one planet. We don't travel to a lot of places with characters, which feels lacking. So probably this powerful stream is what makes Beyond enjoyable.It's not a classic Star Trek, but i'd call it decent modern film that is based on Star Trek universe. First two installments were better, in my opinion, but Beyond is still totally worth watching. If you're ready to forgive it agreeable level of contemporary Hollywood block-buster silliness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the 3 so far! Fantastic-well done Simon Pegg and Justin Lin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Be warned of spoilers: After watching the first trailer, I feared the movie would be terrible. I feared the comedic writing from Pegg, the direction from Lin as well. I really liked the 2009 Trek, and I did not care for Into Darkness, but this movie was better than both. It had visuals including the ship's destruction, and the visit and attack on Yorktown that were worth the price of admission alone. The dialogue was quite good, and the characters behaved as one would expect and hope. I liked the white haired female alien. I liked the reveal that Krull was former federation captain. The main thing that I liked was that this felt like the plot of the original series, with the adrenaline and imagination(movie-making technology) available today. It was a very Star Trek(TOS) story, except that the fears mentioned in the story are able to come to life. The idea that planet earth itself is in danger and only the Enterprise can save it has been done to death. The series is really about exploration, with the ship getting in trouble and figuring a way out of it, alone at the frontier, no safety net, beyond help from federation. Technically, this story was somewhere in between, but a step in the right direction. It seems that this franchise gets loads of criticism for not staying true to the original premise, yet it also appears that while some critics among the public demand that, the public, in the form of movie goers, have no real interest in seeing this. If Trek fans are Luke warm about this movie, then there really is a fairly small market for the material. Making these movies more like Star Wars, like Abrams did, alienated some trek fans, yet making it true to Trek(Beyond) drew even fewer fans? I am forced to agree with comments I recently read, that concluded that if there aren't enough fans to support a $185,000,000 budget, then Paramount should just recognize that this franchise does not have a Star Wars sized audience, and make more modest films on lighter budgets, say $120,000,000. It breaks my heart to say so, but I would rather it survive that way than just die. Fans will go in droves to see the brain-dead "Force Awakens", but not Trek, with its superior story, superior acting and snappier dialogue, and more sci-ency fiction. This movie is not perfect, but it is terrific! I highly recommend, but expect a whole bunch of snarky comments from people who go to the Star Trek movie but don't actually like Star Trek. Its like they wrote their review before they even saw it, then submitted after the movie lived up to their poor expectations. I will never understand why people go to movies of genres that they do not care for. I see this a lot particularly for science fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Science and exploration was missing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR TREK is a not just sci-fi, but the use of abstract and imaginative twist on real science , exploration and the human element. A lot of this was missing and replaced with fast action pow wow shots.The soul of Star Trek, the quirky humor that reflect human attitudes and behavior was lost. Also, the Enterprise which i felt is the show case of imagination was destroyed too quickly without much to show. It start of great with a lot of detail and CGI which gets hopes up that this is going to be a great movie , but then quickly degenerates in to action routines. Hope they can keep future movies true to the themes on which the epic of ST was built over a generation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Trek in its original concept was all message, with a little violence. Now, its become the opposite. To attract teenage boys, I guess, "Star Trek: Beyond" is 80% shoot-em-ups, fistfights, and explosions. What plot there is seems like a last minute addition. If you like that sort of thing, by all means, go and enjoy. Otherwise you might want to download some of the original TV episodes. You'll save five bucks or more and will gain an appreciation for fine writing and plotting. BTW, this was the last film by Anton Yelchin, killed in a freak car accident not long ago. A good young actor. May he rest in peace. Also, I read they will not recast the part of Chekov. Another brick pulled out of the wall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Trek Beyond (2016): Dir: Justin Lin / Cast: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, Sofia Boutella: Another impressive entry to the newer films of the franchise. This time the USS Enterprise heads to a rescue mission only to be met with an ambush that shredded the ship to pieces. The crew escape into pods and land on a barren planet while others became prisoners by an army led by a creature by the name of Krall. We learn in the third act who Krall is and his anger is warranted but it affects innocent civilians. Chris Pine returns as Captain James T. Kirk who is contemplating leaving the fleet but this new mission has him rethinking his position. Zachary Quinto as Spock is injured upon landing on a planet. He also is contemplating leaving the fleet to redirect his focus on his Vulcan heritage. Karl Urban returns as Leonard McCoy the medical officer who is given many comic moments as he escapes in a pod with Spock. He helps medicate Spock while trying to understand his logic. Simon Pegg as Scotty is another comedic scene stealer whose engineering comes into play when he encounters another victim of Krall on the planet they landed on. Her name is Jaylah and she is the lone surviving warrior of a fleet destroyed by Krall. She is played by Sofia Boutella and her makeup with bleach ponytail and facial markings completes the picture of a character who steals her scenes. She is a fighter who is convinced to assist Star Fleet when a rescue mission is planned. Director Justin Lin is backed with explosive special effects resulting in another entertaining entry in a franchise that moves beyond. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feels more like Trek. Brings back the humour. Directing wasn't mind-blowing but I was entertained.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In general, I like Star Trek. I haven't seen the majority of the various series but I've seen the films and I enjoy the concepts and franchise as a whole. I really enjoyed the 2009 reboot and even after seeing the sequel I came away having had a good time despite problems. So going into this film I was expecting to be entertained.And entertained I was. I really enjoyed Star Trek Beyond. Chris Pine again leads a spectacular cast who all do great jobs in their roles, making them their own while still channeling the portrayal of the original cast. Simon Pegg helped write the script for the film and for the most part I thought he did a great job. The dialogue was perfect for ones like Bones &amp; Spock when they banter between one another, and although there were references and nods to the past it didn't feel forced and it wasn't overdone. Star Trek Beyond had a lot of moments where it felt like Star Trek, with just the landscapes, the technology, the story, I thought it captured the feel of the original series more than the previous two did.Two new cast members for the film included Sofia Boutella as Jaylah, who did absolutely fine in the role, the character could have done with a bit more fleshing out but acting-wise, Boutella played the action-ready alien girl well through all that make-up and was entertaining enough. Talking of acting through make-up though, Idris Elba is brilliant as the villainous Krall. I enjoy Elba in almost every role of his but a menacing alien baddie suits him perfectly with his voice adding an intimidating aspect to an already frightfully- looking character. Kralls motives and background I also found enjoyable and unexpected; they left a lot unexplained until the third act but I enjoyed his arc none-the-less.Just quickly I'll mention the visuals of the movie. The Enterprise looks amazing, as it should be, there are some shots at the start of the film I really liked, both inside and outside the ship. Justin Lin did an adequate enough job as director although I would like to see someone else take on the next installment.Talking about visuals allows me to move onto one or two negative things I felt the movie had; some of the CGI, where people were concerned, wasn't perfect. Space, and landscapes and spaceships look great but I did notice moments where people had to fall through the air or do something that needed to be computer-generated and it was obvious to me. Now another problem I had might just be my personal feelings but the very first scene of the film, I won't spoil, felt a bit off, like it didn't belong in a Star Trek movie, it's very short and I like what they were going for but the execution felt to me a bit silly. One last thing is that the overall plot is quite simplistic, probably not a problem for a lot of people, and it didn't bother me too much, but the whole story wasn't as complex as previous ones have been and if you thought about it then you could probably predict a lot of things that were going to happen.In the end though I thoroughly enjoyed Star Trek Beyond, it was funny, it was Trekkie, it was pure summer fun and I look forward to seeing where the franchise goes with these films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining on its own, worst of the three though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this in English and no 3D. I enjoyed it, it's a pretty entertaining movie. Good stuff in it is pretty much the same as previous two: LOVE the trio of Spock-Bones-Kirk, I think they really get it right ESPECIALLY Karl Urban with McCoy whose quotes just are right out of DeForest Kelley's mouth. Uhura is also very good. I thought the action scenes were pretty fair and entertaining. I don't want to compare it too much to the other two films as I'm not reviewing them, but this one definitely seemed to have the least ambition of the three and for that is probably my least favorite. Jayla the new character was well acted but very poorly fleshed out I thought, I won't say more to keep from spoiling anything. Villain was decent but very run-of-the-mill. Simon Pegg did a good job on the script I thought and there are some funny moments.. Scotty says "lassie" a little too often for me though but fair enough. :P I do wish more time had been allowed for old and new characters to be really fleshed out, in some points you seem to sort of jump into someone's past or current problems and it does feel a bit forced.To conclude, if you enjoyed the first two films and are looking for an entertaining night out, I think this is pretty good, it was worth my 10$. This one is not as good as the first one though who had it all for me. Are they trying to dumb it down? Perhaps unfortunately. But yeah do go see it, people around me seemed to enjoy it quite a bit too. CHeers</fullReview>

Don't know why some gave such a low rating cause compare with all the Star Trek movies this one is really good. My whole family enjoyed it. Some people compare it to the Fast &amp; The Furious .... Why Star Trek can't have a fast motion in the movie ??? Have an open mind then you will enjoy it. I did not watch it in 3D cause I never can really enjoy 3D in any movies, it just make me feel dizzy. I usually don't write much about movie review but after read some negative reviews I felt it's really not fair to this good one. Go see it yourself to relax and entertain yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A completely disposable Trek film ... logic flaws EVERYWHERE.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILERS*A completely disposable Trek film that's certainly not awful but certainly nothing remarkable. Beyond is officially the hat-trick of the rebooted franchise where logic flaws rule. Again, a lot of time is spent watching a moody and neutered Captain Kirk getting his butt kicked with the viewer constantly asking themselves, "why didn't he just..." I'm growing tired of rolling my eyes watching these sequels. (SPOILER: The ultimate example of this is at the finale when Kirk gets the drop on the villain and shoots him once hurting him. Instead of finishing him off and saving millions with no fuss, he engages in dialogue with him and allows him to escape able to set off his weapon of mass destruction. WTF? Also, basically a loud hard rock music video is written in to the script and literally saves everyone. WTF?) On the positive side, the cast chemistry is strong and the new female alien character is a very cool addition. There are some very nice nods and tributes to the original cast including fitting tributes to Leonard Nimoy's Spock. Overall, a disappointment that feels unworthy to be called a cinematic adventure. Despite all the big CGI, the flavor of this thing feels like a disposable TV episode and not a very smart one at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, Fast Paced, and Action-Packed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Trek: Beyond is here, and it is truly unlike any other Star Trek movie you've ever seen. Directed by Justin Lin, who directed four entries in the Fast and Furious franchise, the film continues on the more fast paced and slightly bombastic feel of the rebooted franchise. Star Trek: Beyond is often funny, fast paced and action packed, and features a cool new villain. The film is also co- written by Simon Pegg, and thus has a lot more moments of humor, sometimes resembling the Marvel mold more than Star Trek.Star Trek films have historically been inconsistent when it comes to humor, some like Star Trek: The Voyage Home or Star Trek (2009) have been very funny, and some like Star Trek: Wrath of Khan, forwent humor for seriousness. This film may just be the funniest Star Trek film yet, because it's not quite as silly as some of the other films, but manages to have a lot of good quips. The film's sense of humor is most likely a product of Simon Pegg co-writing the film, and that has proved to be a great decision. It should be stated that the humor does make Star Trek: Beyond feel slightly more like a summer blockbuster than a Star Trek film, and they are different.Star Trek Beyond is structured slightly more like an action film, as the pacing grows in tempo until the end of the film when it culminates in a big finale. This is more consistent with the pacing of the rebooted franchise, however the film never quite elevates like the previous two films did. The action sequences in this film are very good, which comes as no surprise given that Lin, who is experienced in shooting action sequences was in the helm. One surprise of this film was the villain character, Krall.The rebooted franchise of Star Trek movies has done an amazing job forming well-rounded villains. The villain in this film feels weak at the beginning, but as the film progresses his motives become more clear. Both Nero and Khan were good villains, and while Krall isn't as well rounded he is a serviceable villain. That being said the other characters in the film aren't very well developed, besides Captain Kirk, who is given some development.All-in-all this is probably the weakest of the rebooted franchise in my opinion, but that doesn't mean it's not a good movie, it is. Star Trek Beyond is very entertaining, fast paced, action-packed, funny, and has a very good villain. The film is a very good time at the theaters, and is fairly family friendly, for those who love summer blockbusters this is a perfect summer movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Getting The Hang Of It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Star Trek Beyond", starring Chris Pine-Into the Woods, Unstoppable; Zachary Quinto-Hit-man:Agent 47, American Horror Story_tv; Sofia Boutella-Kingsman:The Secret Service, StreetDance 2 and Idris Elba-The Thor movies, No Good Deed.This is the 3rd in the new Star Trek series-the first one in 2009 and Into Darkness in 2013-and I think they are getting the hang of what made the original TV series good. The comradery between the main characters and the hopefulness for a bright future. Chris returns as Kirk, as does Zachery as Spock. And, of course, all the other newbees are back, too- Karl Urban/Bones, Zoe Saldana/Uhura, Simon Pegg/Scotty, John Cho/Sulu and Anton Yelchin/Chekov. FYI: Anton died about a month before the release of this movie-6/19/16-and is acknowledged at the end of the movie, as well as Leonard Nimoy. The plot goes something like this, Chris and his crew are sent to rescue a ship that is in distress in uncharted space when things go south quickly. They discover a planet that lures ships into their clutches and then Idris/Krall plunders them for slave labor and other, more evil intentions-he has some kind of energy siphoning powers that he uses on people. Of course, it's hard to recognize Idris in his alien make-up as Krall but they do show what he looks like before he became Krall, so you know it is him. Idris uses these neat mechanical drones-they look like a swarm of bees-to attack and disable his victims. When Chris and company are stranded, they meet other castaways and the most interesting and helpful is Sofia/Jaylah. There is lots of action and humor scattered throughout the movie and several nods to the original cast members are also there-and I do mean all of the main actors. It ends with a teaser for another installment in the franchise so don't be too worried about this being the last one. It's rated "PG-13" for sci-fi action and violence and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 2 minutes. I really liked this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie as a whole was decent. It did not quite capture the magic of the first entry nor the intensity of the second. Being third often comes with these issues and we've seen it many times before. Ahem..Dark Knight Rises anyone?That said, this movie does have many very entertaining moments and more than a few tugs of the heartstrings for those who reserve a special place in their lives for Star Trek universe and it's characters.I offer no spoilers, and I may be only speaking for myself, but there is a critical moment in the film that literally gave me goose bumps with some accompaniment from a certain New York based trio that everyone will recognize in this franchise. This moment alone made the price of admission worth while.See it in a theater, rent it on DVD, wait for it to come on television, it doesn't matter. If you are a fan of the franchise, especially this rebooted universe, Star Trek Beyond is worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A review of Startrek BeyondI had not been to the cinema for many years (36) and so finally the day came and I went. I chose Startrek Beyond which premiered in Dubai yesterday. I thought it would be a good movie to see with full effects and so we chose the IMAX version. In order to while away the time while watching the movie I composed a mini review in my head. Rather than letting it go to waste I am sharing it here for anybody who is thinking of going? CERTIFICATION: PG15 I believe this means the movie was targeted at children under the age of 15 ? and this was confirmed as the movie progressed. PLOT: Yes, it had one ? one of the four that Hollywood uses for making movies. This was a great help as it made guessing what was going to happen next quite easy. ACTING: It also had some acting in it. The characters wearing the rubber masks were obviously limited to occasional eye movements (and also killing people) ? sometimes they looked to the right and sometimes they looked to the left, and sometimes they looked at somebody. The characters not wearing rubber masks, only make-up, also restricted their acting to eye movements left, right, and sometimes they held a gaze 'meaningfully', which they will have learned in acting school. Dialogue was manageable in bursts of up to 7 words at a time, and followed conventional speech patterns ( Down at the end for a statement and up a bit for a question as in GPS systems) Of course they also killed people and jumped around the studio a bit. They had big plastic pop gun things which went bang bang and killed the baddies but didn't seem to work on the goodies. The continuity of Hollywood from 1890s wild west to future centuries is comforting. Also comforting is the fact there seemed to be oxygen absolutely everywhere on every planet and even in open space with no need at all for breathing apparatus. A tip to the director ? seeing some of the actors explode through lack of pressure and die gasping of suffocation would have been satisfying to some audience members. HUMOUR: I believe there was also some of this. It was done in a Scottish accent so it was doubly hilarious. Although the 14 and 15 year olds would have been too sophisticated for it, some of the 9 and 10 year olds might have been amused. It was a hazard only to adults who had recently eaten. SUMMARY: Overall it was an enlightening experience. I gained deep insights into the nature of Time ? no matter how many times you look at your watch the end of the movie won't come any quicker. My companion, who also had never been to the cinema, summed up nicely, and totally innocently, when he said, "I enjoyed the technology. We must go again but next time we'll see a good film."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Trek - Beyond Guardians of the Galaxy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Took me 5 minutes to choose between 6 and 7.First of all: For me, who was very disappointed from the last part, it was a better movie. It also was a better Star Trek.The remaining question was...was it a GOOD Star Trek. Yo...Nes....in a way. The dialogs were a lot better and more fitting to the characters than in than in the last movie and for the first time felt like the where actually the characters and not just look like them. I very much assume that that this is thanks to Simon Peggs rewrites.So a lot I do think that a lot of credit that makes the film better than the previous movies goes to him, especially when it came to characters and dialogs.The characters: Kirk: Sorry Pine still doesn't fit the role. And that within the first 6 minutes of the movies he goes from being SOOO borrredd by everything to wanting to get rid of the Enterprise THIS IS KIRK.....who doesn't care enough about the Enterprise to stick around for the first 5 year voyage. And then only does because he assumes that it is more interesting than a space station? Spock: Quinto is a good Spock and a god actor. But he is at his best as far away from Uhura as possible. At this point we have had them fight about their relationship in 3/3 movies. I like his interaction with McCoy and heck even Kirk.McCoy: Urban is fantastic. He and Spock are the ones resembling their alter ego the most. He is just great and really one of the reason to make the movie watchable.Scotty: I really like Simon Pegg and like I said. I think his writing saves most of the movie. He is great characters but he is very different than the old Scotty. Now decide for yourself if that is a good or a bad thing.Uhura: The Girlfriend. I still think that the strong female character of my childhood is reduced pretty much to that. Yes she has some action scenes. But way too many that just have her and Spock argue. Just like him her characters gains a lot if she is on her own or with another Crewmember.Sulu: I still don't get the complains about his sexuality. It you are not bothered by it is a sweet short scene that could have been longer. I think his family could have gotten a bit more screen time. And for those Bigots bothered by it.....it's so short that you probably wouldn't have spotted it .Checkov: It sad that it's Yelchin's last appearance because he made pretty good with the Plot that he was given and had a lot Screen time that I had thought.The Story: I did have a Guardian of the Galaxy flashback a few times....which was good since it did save the movies from being as bad as the last. It also wasn't a remake which is a BIG plus for me. But it still didn't feel like the Star Trek of my youth.The Soundtrack.............no comment.The worst scenes: Scotty making almost the same jump as Brian in the last Fast and the Furious. And Kirk and the bike. Yes it was a nice action scene....but so little like Star Trek. Also Kirk not being the smartest person when it comes to planning but most of the time just being lucky.AND Kirk wanting to get rid of the Enterprise.All in all it was a good Science Fiction movie and finally a new Star Trek Remake movie that wasn't completely terrible.I would have given 7 to the SciFi movie...but the fact that it was supposed to be Star Trek made me choose the 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a Trekkie but a I loved Star Trek 1 and 2. Beyond is a nice and funny movie but not as good as the previous ones. In my opinion it has three problems 1. No time Action, action and more action... there just few quite scenes in the movie and less emotional parts. The movie doesn't take the time to explain something or to have breather. That's a pity. Spock and Kirk have an emotional crises but it's hard to understand them because you don't get the time for it.2. Villain Ridiculous villain. The motivation of the villain is really absurd. With some flashbacks and explanation he could have been great, but as mentioned before, the movie doesn't take time for emotional or explication stuff. It's hard to understand why the villain got evil and why he is doing this.3. Plot holes There are a lot of plot holes. Indeed, 1 and 2 had some too, but they were not so obvious.Conclusion: Beyond is neither a bad nor a really good movie. Switch off you brain, eat popcorn and have fun with it. It isn't really a Star Trek movie, but you can enjoy it of you like action movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely not Star Trek</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first, I want to point out that I'm not a nostalgic, original-series-only fan. I'd call myself a casual but very keen fan of Star Trek, of what Star Trek really is or rather was.So that being said I have to be honest and say that I'm disappointed with Star Trek Beyond more or less. I'm not an enemy of the reboots in general and the first one called "Star Trek" from 2009 is one of my all-time favorite movies. I'm aware of the fact that a modern Star Trek in cinema-format has to change things to be successful and popular but in Star Trek Beyond I nearly had the feeling that it is just a generic Si-fi Blockbuster. When it comes to acting and action there are some great scenes but that doesn't compensate the kinda bad story and plot.This is just my opinion and I don't force anyone to dislike this movie. Maybe it's easier to like this film and the direction these reboots are going when you never saw other Star Trek stuff before. :/ I still have some hope for the new Star Trek TV-show to come up next year though.And most important: RIP Anton Yelchin aka Pavel Chekov</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another day in the Fleet?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm in no way a "Trekkie" (though I've recently gotten into watching repeats of Star Trek: Voyager on TV), I found the 2009 Star Trek reboot to be rather overrated (though I liked it slightly more upon rewatch) and, unlike most, I really enjoyed Into Darkness/found it to be the superior film of the two. No doubt I'll probably hold the "unpopular" opinion once again with this film, as I found Star Trek Beyond to be sadly lacking the 'oomph' of the previous film. J. J. Abrams may have his detractors, but at least I could follow the action in his movies. Justin Lin seems to favour chaotic camera movement and things being too dark to see. Yet despite the frenetic nature of his directing, it's probably not a good sign that I found myself yawning during the start of the movie. Nor did things get off to a promising start with Kirk confronting ridiculous CGI aliens that were obviously played for laughs, but failed in supplying any. I thought STID had a much more energetic and enthralling opening. Even in its 'slower' moments, I found that movie was much more engaging than this one which only really starts moving when the Enterprise is attacked (and even THEN, not quite enough to hold my interest). The "damn snow globe in space" is visually interesting, at least.Positives of the film? The cast make the movie watchable. In the plus column: Chris Pine playing the least jerky version of his Kirk so far and Zachary Quinto's Spock. Sadly, their friendship isn't focused upon as much as the last film, though what scenes they do share are decent. Meanwhile, Karl Urban's Bones gets more focus, and I think most will agree that's an asset to this film. He shares scenes with both Kirk and Spock, and their dynamics provide a lot of what's enjoyable in the movie. Tied with Bones for "MVP" of the film is Sofia Boutella's character, Jaylah. She certainly stood out to me the most in the film's first trailers, and despite being newly introduced, she pretty much steals the whole movie. Not only is she physically striking (Boutella rocks the black-and-white body paint/markings like nobody's business), but she's also a fierce lethal warrior woman who provides some of the film's best action as well as comedic moments. Before rolling your eyes at this description, just trust that she kicks arse, but actually looks *believable* doing so (unlike certain other crew members).Jaylah's first paired with Simon Pegg's Scotty, who she calls "Montgomery Scotty", then later teams up with "James T" (as she calls Kirk) and the rest of the crew. While some of the film's humour falls flat, her names for some crew members and not quite getting certain references are an example of the few genuinely amusing running gags throughout the movie that actually *work* (along with her liking "the beats and shouting" of Public Enemy/the "loud and distracting" Beastie Boys music). This is the first movie I've seen Boutella in, but already she's made a lasting impression on me. I enjoyed her fun banter with Scotty and her dynamics with the rest of the crew. She not only gives us what these movies have sadly been lacking thus far (a believable action heroine), but is also important to the story. She's crafty with traps/snares and holographic projections of herself, her character is given depth and a backstory that ensures you're invested in her survival. I'm pleased there are hints that she may well return (hopefully the promise of joining the "family" won't turn out as hollow as it was for poor Alice Eve's absent Carol Marcus, who doesn't even get a mention).The crew gets split up when the Enterprise, which just can't seem to catch a break, is destroyed (as it seems destined to be in every movie) and crash-lands on a planet thanks to Idris Elba's villain, Krall. While I'm sure many will disagree, I actually found Benedict Cumberbatch's villain in STID more captivating. While Krall certainly has an interesting look/voice (although, like with Simon Pegg's Scotty, his voice almost requires subtitles at times, as it's hard to make out what he's saying occasionally) and a somewhat surprising backstory, I can't say I was that invested. Nor was I overly fond of any of the alien characters (save for Jaylah), especially the double-crossing Kalara who kick-started this whole mess, thereby teaching Kirk a lesson in not believing every sad story one hears (at least he catches on eventually). Uhura hasn't much to do, though thankfully her boring relationship with Spock doesn't take up too much screen time, while Sulu and Chekov have their individual moments. Leonard Nimoy's Ambassador Spock plays an important part in the character journey of Quinto's Spock, and both he and Anton Yelchin receive dedications mid-credits. Silly things people were criticizing about the trailers, such as the use of Kirk on a motorbike and yet more Beastie Boys, are actually used surprisingly well in the movie (though some mightn't think so). I was one of the seemingly few who didn't take an instant dislike to the movie's trailers and was willing to wait and see how the film as a whole turned out before judging. Naturally, there will be those who will go into this movie ready to hate it and come out feeling the same way (as well as those who just won't bother to see it, despite criticizing it), then there'll be those not expecting much, who might wind up surprised and find they enjoyed it. Fans might appreciate some of the nods given here to past Trek. I myself had no preconceived notions going in, and whilst there were aspects/moments of the movie I quite enjoyed, on the whole I was somewhat bored...but hey, I think Into Darkness is the best of the three new Trek movies thus far...so what do I know, right? Hopefully, the next one will be better/I'll enjoy it more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler free review: I was lucky to go to the premiere in San Diego at comic con... the night was amazing but it ended with a super fun movie. That's the best word to describe it... fun.The difference with the past 2 Trek movies was that unlike the original films we didn't bond with this cast over 100 or 200 episodes of slower paced TV. These guys were just tossed into it. This movie gives us an idea what a show with them would be like. It's impossible of course to do. But it was such a nice break form the overreaching drama from Into Darkness. This is still serious and has tearful moments and sincere motivations from characters... but it's also fun. Some people forget the original trek as Justin Lin told the crowd at the premiere that the original series was fun. It was funny. It was a pure comedy at times. and he's right. This movie takes all the elements the series was... (serious, funny, action, fantasy) and mixes it into one giant movie. Including the Shatner like fist fight. Loved it.Dialogue from Simon Pegg and Doug Jung was absolutely natural to the characters and everyone had their moments. The scenes of different characters sharing moments with each other was great.New characters Jayla is terrific. Sofia was great in the part. It's sort of a typical Justin Lin movie too as in the set pieces, action scenes fx were simply amazing... breathless... the character moments fantastic, warm, sweet... the story was very good but some holes and confusion at times but it's so worth having that for the pure fun this is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great modernised version of the classic Science Fiction series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Trek Beyond is the third instalment in the rebooted Star Trek film series. While not as enjoyable as the first film, I would say it's definitely as good as the second. Once again, it is a great modernised version of the classic Science Fiction series.After three years of their five year exploration mission, the crew of the USS Enterprise, led by Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine), pull in for resupply at the star base Yorktown. While there, the crew encounter an alien named Kalara, who is the sole survivor of an attack by Krall (Idris Elba), a vicious alien warlord who wiped out her entire team searching for an ancient artefact. Kirk decides to dispatch with his fleet on the Enterprise to face Krall head-on and discover what he intends to with the artefact.Still retaining the charm of the original Star Trek series while also appealing to today's movie-goers, Star Trek Beyond is a solid, respectful entry into the franchise. My favourite parts in particular were the expanded characterisation and dialogue between Spock (Zachary Quinto) and McCoy (Karl Urban). Also, the action scenes were great, thanks in part to director Justin Lin, who directed some of the Fast &amp; Furious films, and the special effects were very well done as well. This film also featured a nice tribute to both Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin, who tragically passed away recently. If you're a Star Trek fan, definitely check this one out.I rate it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The script was just a prop for special effects...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**NO SPOILERS** &amp; in brief:THE GOOD? Acting - as in the previous two films, good, even if sometimes imbalanced and under utilized in areas (but only when compared to the previous films). Bone's interactions and humour are the highlights,especially with Spock. Sofia Boutella as Jaylah excels in all of her scenes.? Special effects - for the most part, very good, though it's occasionally clear that much of the budget was spent on the Enterprise compared to some other elements/scenes.? 2 other points regarding the finale but cannot mention without spoilers.THE BAD? Directing ? Poor framing, shaky cam and lack of coordination diluted every non-FX action sequence. You either feel like a distant observer or a disorientated participant - never the middle ground, never completely immersed as is the skill of a successful director (I literally don't know what happened during one sequence). His Fast &amp; Furious movies should be your warning ? we're not watching car chases here.? Predictable - whilst there was a good twist at the end that I didn't expect, it was lost among the rest of the predictable crap, be it physical actions or the script. The final sequence seemed to follow a step-by-step guide on it!? Script - Nothing game changing or memorable like the destruction of Vulcan. Nothing as intense or as dark as the crushing of an Admirals skull. Just a generic villain with a stereotypical cause, no intelligence. Star Treks foundations are not followed in my opinion - no exploration of space, no moral dilemmas or thought provoking issues - just an above par action film designed to appeal to the masses.? Plot holes ? described in spoilers below.Extra Note? The hyped up 'gay scene' that so many lost their mind over was nothing more than about 6 seconds of run time. Without all of the news articles, many wouldn't have even noticed. OverallIt's not a terrible film and is indeed worth watching in the cinema. But Beyond is a step backwards, and Justin Lin wasn't the right choice. A Star Trek audience deserves an intelligent script, not a headache inducing action film that's full of plot holes and Hollywood stereotypes._________________**SPOILERS** &amp; in-depth:? Acting: As I mentioned, the acting is good for the most part, but slightly out of balance - each character had their individual moments with one another, but this approach eradicated the 'teamwork' feel. Perhaps that was the intention. But the biggest character of the film - the Enterprise - is missing, and so what we spend most of our time watching is a peril absent adventure on a poorly portrayed planet against a generic villain. Star Trek made its name my pushing boundaries, is that beyond the scope now?? Destruction of the Enterprise: The doom of the ship was brilliantly executed here - Kirk's reflection in the escape pod's window as he sees the remainder of his ship go down, the attack of the swarm, the situation of panic, the way the enemy board the ship, the weapons used, etc. ? Music: The Beastie Boys song playing during the Franklins attack is superb! One of the few truly standout scenes. The special effects of the swarm approaching the star base is also a beautifully menacing image.Plot Holes/'questionable';? Defeating the swarm: Bombarding the radio frequency to disrupt communications between each ship is ridiculous. These are spacecraft, designed to operate in space. Planets, comets, stars, giant clouds of gas and dust (such as the nebulae supposedly nearby the planet) give off radio waves - are we to believe that these ships are shielded from all possible frequencies and intensities of radio waves that exist in the universe, other than their own operating frequency used for coordination? Forgetting all of the vague excuses possible for this, what made them all instantly explode?! All they did was collide with each other (which didn't see Bones and Spock instantly blow up after they commandeered one), whilst the beginning of the movie showed some being capable of penetrating the Enterprise hull. A pretty serious and incredibly convenient design flaw if you ask me. Besides, it appeared as though they all had pilots - even if the swarms communication was interrupted, can they not fly individually as when they left the planet, just without synchronicity?? Scottys crash landing: We'll ignore that this cliff scene is a copy and paste from Justin Lin's last Fast &amp; Furious film. But after this, Scotty's escape pod falls down an incredibly large cliff. The time frame presented should not have had him arriving so quickly, that cliff face was thousands of metres high! How did he get down?? PHASE HIM ALREADY!!! Kirk, please. He's holding a deadly bio- weapon. Shoot this fool already! But no, we need more predictable drama. And oh look, FOUR levers you need to pull to save the day. I wonder which number will fail, since we need more predictable drama.? The Franklin: Less than 10% impulse speed should be enough to reach escape velocity. Can it not gather speed within the atmosphere, without a gravity assist? Thrusters are shown to be saving the space craft from the (stereotypical) impact at the bottom of the cliff - if a gravity assist really was needed, why not just go up in the air first, before the 'drop'? Predictable drama? Also, did the bad guy and everyone on the planet not wonder where the Franklin could have disappeared to after it had been 'cloaked' by Jaylah?!? Video: So, Uhura made the connection that the bad guy was the old captain by a split second glimpse of a grainy greenish video screen in passing (and why was it even playing)? The bad guy literally looked nothing like the old captain...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another excellent Star Trek which honors the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR TREK BEYOND was very good. No disappointments whatsoever. They maintained the quality, the thematic content of intelligence vs force which has always been the hallmark of the Star Trek series, and they inserted some great nostalgia and a nice touch with Leonard Nimoy. Overall, high action, good twist on the plot, some laughs and light- heartedness to offset the grimmer aspects. I have to say that Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, who play Kirk and Spock respectively, are excellent players for these parts. They stand on their own, even though they are, in the back of our minds, representing icons of the Star Trek franchise from the original cast of the 1960s. STAR TREK BEYOND presents a glimpse of the future which is coming - it's just a matter of time and technology. Someday, just like landing men on the moon back in the 1930s and 1940s was considered "science fiction", the perspectives depicted in this film will some day become fact and no longer be seen as sci-fi. Definitely a recommended watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Star Trek Beyond" is Everything You Ask for A "Star Trek" Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Enterprise crew is back for more adventure. After a divisive follow-up that is "Into Darkness", I am proud to say that the third installment of the newly-formulated Kelvin timeline (the J. J. Abrams movies) is a worthy addition. Where the next trek goes brings the Enterprise to its knees, as they are attacked by a merciless leader named Krall (a menacing Idris Elba). And landed on a hostile planet, the crew must stop Krall from his evil deeds.If you are a devoted follower to the saga, you may observe the repetitive pattern (wherein Enterprise gets attack by a baddie with resentment to the Federation and must stop his/her huge plans of mass destruction). "Beyond" applies the same pattern but to surprising effect. It can be lauded to Justin Lin's effort to lend his flair for blockbusters ? as seen from his Fast &amp; Furious movies ? and apply them to the Star Trek universe without sacrificing its heart and soul. And that comes from the Enterprise crew on adventure mode, for this new "Star Trek" feels like a full-length TV episode. It proves that Simon Pegg knows Trek flair when he and his co-writer wrote this down.Well, it can be attributed that this is a mandatory tribute for Star Trek's 50th year anniversary, but as a stand-alone feature, it is a whole lot of fun. As the visual spectacle has been consistent, the cast this time has more chemistry and screen time, with Chris Pine as Kirk striking solid, Zachary Quinto as Spock and Karl Urban and Dr. Bones as an effective duo, Anton Yelchin finally having time to shine, and newcomer Sofia Boutella in breakout mode after "Kingsman".Yet, despite the fun, it cannot help but make this a bittersweet entry, as this is where the late great Leonard Nimoy was given a well- deserved salute, and this serves as Yelchin's posthumous performance. Fitting to this celebratory part of the franchise. While Trekkies and non- Trekkies may see this as a loss, it should not stop "Star Trek Beyond" from being an epic adventure that truly respects Gene Roddenberry's creation and gives it a breath of fresh air. This adventure boldly went where no man has gone before (even though it means repeating itself).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few plot holes to consider</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I'm a Trekkie, and I love Star Trek beyond this movie. I'm not going to go deep into all of the plots holes that bothered me. but here are a few.SPOILER ALERT.So people ejected all over the planet, but magically found each other like if they were in the same shopping-mall. Perhaps that planet wasn't that big after all? The key to ending the battle was a simple UHF signal carrying loud music? Come on, an advanced cybernetic technology that brought Enterprise down in a few minutes start blowing up by itself just by exposure to UHF signal? I wish they would have tried a bit harder. I can think many ways how they could have carried out their attack ? perhaps having found some other artifact on the surface of the planet that disrupted the swarm.The end game when three ships, including Krall's ship ? that somehow managed to avoid the deadly effect of the Beastie Boys song ? got into this big station/space city Yorktown. Now with all the technology available to the StarBase itself, couldn't they just teleported Krall outside the station? That old piece of junk U.S.S. Franklin managed to teleport the entire Enterprise crew, but they couldn't teleport Krall ? or at least the artifact ? out into space. So they had to open a huge airlock into space. Mind you a pressure release like that would have caused a significant damage to the structure of the StarBase(Yorktown), accelerating it in the opposite direction and creating a massive inertial force. I just can't buy the inertial dampener theory in that instance. Beside these plot holes there is one more thing that bothered me the most. All of the CG sequences where they had alien solders walking around, the animation was done very poorly. For instance in some scenes, the movement of their feet was out of sync with the movement of the ground ? kind of giving an illusion of Michael Jacksons moon-walking ? that's really embarrassing. Further in some sequences they moved like robots, which they weren't ? at least that wasn't my understanding.But the movie in whole was good. I love the actors and their performances. What can I say, I love Star Trek even if it's bad.I give it a 7 due to the animation issue I mentioned above.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchable, but same old same old ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Add to the list of clichs destroying whichever Enterprise is the latest one. Each death of the ship is more realistic and detailed, and in this newest Enterprise we learn the the ship is made of about 1/2 escape pods.It's stuff like that and transporting people jumping off of flying motorcycles, and the slapstick humor that passes for a plot that forces me to give this movie a 4/10.It was watchable, but where the last movies were bright white on the deck the whole interior of this Enterprise was dark and gloomy.My problem, and it really is my problem because it is plain that someone is liking these new movies, is that I want my science fiction to be science fiction, and Star Trek and Star Wars are both really SF fantasy. There is no real element of science fiction except that these stories take place in space, which, believe it or not, is not really a prerequisite for science fiction.Science fiction should be about challenging the imagination and provoking new ideas, but Star Trek now leaves nothing to the imagination and makes it impossible to think.It is sad. I keep going to see these movies, but the ultimately disappoint me, thought the pace gets faster and faster and the effects do get better. It is just not what I am looking for in a Star Trek movie, nor what I think you should be looking for. I just don't mind me or you looking at a little eye candy now and then since there is such a small amount of real science fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another story, thoughtful like the prequels!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beauty of Star Trek Beyond lies in its pensive narration. It will let you resonate alongside the musings of its characters. For once you will truly fathom the importance of USS Enterprise in the lives of Trekkers. You will get to witness the rudimentary lost Franklin up and running. You will see why a job needs to be done with a proper explanation, with an optimal aftermath. In short, everything is in place.STAR TREK BEYOND PLOT (SPOILERS INCLUSIVE) Movie's plot is like a chain reaction of events that fission into a deadlier game at play. It begins with James T. Kirk's (role reprised by Chris Pine) contemplation.Knee deep in a five year mission, the fleet has been leading a life like commoners, compelling Kirk to go in a profound reflection of elusive things in the unknown.At their liberty stop at Yorktown, Kirk is scrutinizing a promotion. In a weird stagnant like that, enters an escape pod introducing us to Kalara who claims her crew is stranded at a nearby planet. Induced by her misery, the Enterprise goes on a rescue mission only to be attacked by rampaging swarm ships.Swarm ships or Bees in Star Trek Beyond will be remembered for their awesome theatrics. The way they acted in unison to decimate anything that appeared in their way make them look sheer bad-ass. With their intrusion we see the USS Enterprise's annihilation too. That's when Captain James Kirk makes one of the toughest decisions of his life ? to abandon their beloved ship.That's only the beginning. What follows therefrom is a brilliant affair of perversion that finds its way via cruel intentions of Krall played superbly by Idris Elba.Inclusion of Jaylah to the tale was nicely done too. Played by Sofia Boutella the character finds a new meaning, perspective and direction. Montgomery Scotty reprised by Simon Pegg remains the nerdy heart of the Starfleet. His presence in the team is weirdly satisfying.OTHER ASPECTS Screenplay of Star Trek Beyond has been written elegantly. There are moments when you see the crew relaxing for a word, delivering superb lines amidst conversations."You spent all this time trying to be your father, and now you're wondering just what it means to be you." Seeing Anton Yelchin up, alive and breathing on the screen was really lovely too. He seemed so lost in his character, unperturbed, unfazed by the mishap that awaited him in the corner, that you can't help feel sorry. A true talent, lost in life's fickleness!"It's easy to get lost. In the vastness of space, there's only yourself, your ship, your crew." You cannot overlook Justin Lin's brilliant direction as well. The way he scales the camera with every motion is laudable. The way he cuts his frames by merging into a new territory, the way he races and traces down, filling voids (capturing the stunning vista of Yorktown) will leave you appreciating his prowess. Creating Yorktown's colossal beauty was a visual achievement, as Doctor Leonard McCoy puts it:"It looks like a giant snow-globe in space just waiting to break." A PROBABLE DOWNSIDE Star Trek Beyond scores a little low on the theatrics panel. Meaning it didn't have in his villain, flair like that of Khan's. It misses somewhat on bringing the flamboyance of its prequels, but is more or less similar when the build of previous installments is concerned. It appears a tad dull in terms of Editing. But, if you ask me this is how the Editing should really be. A calm dip that lets us hit and cover every thrilling spots one by one.If you really look at it, Star Trek Beyond comes straight from a bag of Starfleet's numerous adventures. So, it is apparent, there are more parts to come. Fasten your belts! Read all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and his crew, including Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto) receive a distress call from an aircraft, saying their ship is under attack from an unknown enemy. Taking the afflicted being on board, the USS Enterprise suffers the same fate when they are attacked by a rebel ship, led by Krall (Idris Elba) and suffer a crash landing. Stranded, and separated as a crew, they must come together again to stop Krall from attacking further Federation ships and enacting his plan to steal various pieces of an artefact he needs to launch a devastating attack.As one of the more popular of the newly resurrected franchises, the Star Trek films have certainly taken their time over the years, with a four year wait between 2009's first new film and Into Darkness, and only a slightly shorter wait between that and this latest of the new entries, with Justin Lin at the helm instead of JJ Abrams. From the outset, Lin seems determined to impose his mark on this new film, opting to save the big, bombastic special effects laden action sequence to just after the beginning instead of first thing, unlike last time, as well as imposing a lighter, less darker tone all round.That aside, it still pretty much follows the formula that's made the last two films what they are, with the same character motivations and characteristics. Fundamentally, there are no surprises, but what matters is that it's all carried off so well. Lead stars Pine, Quinto as well as Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy and Simon Pegg as Scotty have aged together as a group, and have obviously developed a chemistry together over the years that reflects on screen, while new additions to this outing include Sofia Boutella as Jayleh, a female alien warrior Scotty bumps into and Elba as Krall, who manages a similarly commanding presence to Cumberbatch in Into Darkness.All round, this reliably delivers the fans what they'll want, with maybe a few surprises thrown in too. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow surprisingly awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised how awful this movie is.. It could be fun at times.. The opening was absolutely spectacular. But geez did it go south.. I was surprised how poor the dialog was. Some of the acting wasn't good either. I am not sure the casting was as good as it should have been. One of the main characters absolutely failed.. Some of the characters just looked like people wearing a uniform and a mask. Surprising considering how well done some of the space sequences were made. It was a fun(ish) time. I love movies and I extracted enough joy from this one to justify the trip to the theater.. But I won't be buying the bluray for sure..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that I honestly hate Star Trek. I don't like the original series or films all that much (The Motion Picture is horrendous) and Trekkies are the original Whovians in that they drive me nuts. But when a friend of mine sat me down to watch the J.J. Abrams Star Trek of 2009, I fell in love with the film and patiently awaited Star Trek Into Darkness (which I like much better than Wrath of Khan, sorry). Although I was sad to see Abrams go (though I loved The Force Awakens so that was okay), I still eagerly awaited Star Trek Beyond.Star Trek Beyond felt like a modern adaption of an old Star Trek TOS episode, yet at the same time felt new, fresh, and exciting, such as Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy was in 2014. I was very happy with Beyond to the point where I'm not sure which of the New Timeline Trilogy I like the most!Star Trek Beyond explores new worlds, new friends, new foes, old feuds, and fantastic new interpretations of old characters that continue to amaze me. Kirk finding out what it means to be himself instead of his father, Spock wondering what to do without Spock Prime's guidance, etc. Beyond is more personal than Into Darkness was on a level that matches the 2009 reboots intimacy that brought me on board with this franchise in the first place.I may not be a Trekkie, but I am a new timeline Star Trek fan who has been enjoying this new series and who hopes that it will continue to explore new worlds that have never been explored before.P.S. - The score of these films, especially this one, are phenomenal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Trek Beyond terrible yet far from great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest installment in the rebooted Star Trek series delivers what moviegoers have come to expect from the series: fast paced action, riveting special effects, solid comic relief, and some nicely written dialogue and monologues. Yet what prevents it from being good is its clich villain, generic plot, and unexplainable shenanigans (like what happens after they play the song Sabotage) that demotes the film to just another safe money- making formulaic sequel. The franchise's new director Justin Lin delivers the action in this film yet does not match it with a detailed story it deserves. The film focused most of its attention on the action and effects. The story was lacking and felt like the actors did not even want to be there. The villain was just another disposable and clich bad guy who had little development with unoriginal and almost vague motivations. Yet the Star Trek writers can certainly venture into unoriginal territory if people are going to keep paying to see these films no matter how generic they are. If these films really want to be something special they need to do what the closing line always says 'to boldly go where no one has gone before.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining enough. A pass grade. (72.5%%)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen all the movies in this reboot and was thinking of giving this one a miss but there was a promotion going on with a nearby cinema so I thought I'd pay to see this and get to see another movie of my choice for free.The plot revolves around the crew of the Enterprise facing a technologically superior foe and being seemingly defeated. They have to be inventive and unite with allies in order to escape with their lives and to prevent a decisive blow against their Federation. Beforehand Kirk and Spock were at a personal and professional crossroads. You ponder how their decisions will unfold as their current predicament plays out.The script was written in part by Simon Pegg, who plays the Enterprise's engineer, "Scotty". Early on I was wondering how strong the script would be as a result...it didn't seem to be boding well, but after a while it ceased to be an issue for me. My "issues" mostly revolved around the character of "Bones", played by Karl Urban. He seemed to be too "actorly" for me...I don't know if that is the right word for it...a bit wooden or dorky? In other words, he wasn't played naturally...his personality was more marked in an odd way than Zachary Quinto's portrayal of the coldly logical alien "Spock". That is to say that Bones came across as more alien than Spock!There are some funny/amusing moments in this film. Since I saw this in 2D, the shots of gigantic space cities weren't really that visceral. One annoying aspect to this movie is that Pegg's Scotty often says his lines in an unintelligible Scottish accent. If this only happened when he spoke technobabble, it wouldn't have bothered me so much, but there were times I did wonder what Scotty was saying in ordinary conversation.It has to be said that I've already forgotten the previous movies in this reboot (well, the entire franchise, to be honest...of the ones that I've seen), so I had forgotten how Leonard Nimoy's Spock was a part of this universe. No doubt The Doctor would put it down to "wibbly-wobbly, timey wimey" effects. Fans of the original TV series might appreciate such nods to the franchise's past.Of the cast of aliens, Sofia Boutella's "Jaylah" is the most striking, especially as far as her visual aesthetic goes.The end credits say "For Anton". I did come across some information (perhaps in a review of this film), that the man who plays "Chekov", Anton Yelchin, had died after filming. It had been on my mind to find out under what circumstances, as he was young (27 years old). Since then, I did come across the story behind his death, just through random surfing of the web. It looks like he was the victim of a faulty car, the manufacturers of which will no doubt face a class action by everybody who bought the car or were injured by it.It will be interesting how the next film in this franchise will handle the character of "Chekov". That being said, I think I'd be more inclined to see the next movie in this franchise than I was for this one...free ticket or not. Some of the reasons for that include how Spock deals with his "crossroads" situation and the new hardware available to the crew.Since this site doesn't allow for a "Pass" or "Fail" grade, I'll give a score of 72.5+%. It's an entertaining enough movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not spectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Solid in many ways as a fun action oriented Star Trek movie. My biggest problem was with what I perceived to be a lack of credible motivation for the villain. Idris Elba is a presence on screen that typically commands my attention. He oftentimes brings a gravitas to roles that supersede the writing. But here, he struggles through a less than satisfying explanation for why he's doing what he's doing. Nevertheless, this doesn't altogether detract from a fun time.Jaylah, played by Sofia Boutella (from Kingsman: Secret Service), was a welcome addition to the cast, yet peculiar in the sense she serves mainly to explain the rules of the narrative conflict and helps assist our protagonists through their struggle. But she was formidable as a strong female action star and I found her unique look to have a sexiness I didn't expect. Saying that, I was very happy they did not draw an obvious romantic involvement with any of our regular crew members.Finally, I think it was interesting that the script included some real world connections. Nimoy's death was handled poignantly especially given that Yelchin also lost his life prior to this movie's premier. I even thought I noticed a subtle nod to this fact when the crew is toasting each other and those that had been lost, the camera quickly shows Yelchin's character, Chekov lifting his glass. Finally, Sulu's character is given depth when he greets his family on a space station. A real world connection to Takei (the original Sulu)? Perhaps it wasn't necessary to do this, but I value the effort to build character.Overall, the story gave each crew member a vital role to play, satisfying one of the themes--"we are stronger in numbers when we work together". It was fun, fast, and (dare I add) furious in its action. Worthy effort Grade B #recommend</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overproduced, underacted &amp; not thought out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the character of Jayla-and I thought the other characterizations in this film were fine. In this Star Trek film the special effects took precedent over the story-line-at least that is what it felt like to me. The special effects are truly astounding-but the story is not at the same level-being basically a run of the mill- super-bad-guy versus the Federation. Nothing new there. Funny beginning and an ultimately unsatisfying ending which was a surprise given the caliber of the people working on this project. Part of the ending was a genuine 'spit in the face' of the audience-something I think the people working in the film industry cannot really afford to do, because when I saw this film-it was playing to an audience of three-and it was not a special VIP screening-its just that people were not going to see it. Playing to empty cinemas is a sad legacy for the Star Trek franchise-and its a legacy that is starting to be a reality. I think that people want more than ordinary scripts that contain hilarious errors. The error at the end that more or less gonged the entire film was when the new character of Spock looks at photo of Leonard Nimoy as Ambassador Spock while he was serving on board the Enterprise. So he was looking back at a photo of his own life-since he is supposed to be Spock serving on the Enterprise-but Ambassador Spock had died-but that could not be true since he was alive looking at the photo of what would be his own past-which would also be a falsehood since he wasn't Leonard Nimoy. It is ridiculous to expect audiences to deal with such utterly convoluted rubbish. I gave this film a six out of respect for the special effects people who worked on the film-not for the script or the directing, etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stretching the Body Where No One Has Gone Before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a terrible movie, as some have said, but it seems ordinary by today's standards. It is mostly action with little intellect. Why these guys go off on this mission with such recklessness is beyond me. They get themselves in an incredibly untenable situation through their own carelessness. The one thing that so many of these movies never address is the wear and tear on the human body that seems acceptable. People are thrown against walls, drop from great heights, and bounce back without a broken bone or a concussion. These aren't superheroes; they are flesh and blood. The other thing is that the designs of the evil force are never abundantly clear. To create suspense, we need to have a better understanding of the threat. And don't tell me that it was explained. I know it was, but it needs to be reinforced. As things came to a head, I kept thinking back to what exactly the importance of that object was. Many cheap tricks and close calls are gratuitous. I'm a real fan of the whole Trek canon and so this wasn't what I had hoped for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent action flick, but loses sight of what Star Trek should be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I am a Trekkie. I don't speak Klingon, but I have seen all but a few episodes. I was excited to hear that they would continue the alternate reality reboot, but with JJ Abrams directing Star Wars, we would be getting a new director (from Fast and the Furious franchises).The film pairs a director inexperienced with sci-fi with a writer in the same position. The end result is that you sit through two hours of mediocre film that stands as a monument to an idea that had tons of potential and wasted it all, ending as two hours of predictable plot, dialogue, and exchange.The majority of the plot, with one glaring exception, is solid. It fits well into Star Trek tradition.My biggest gripe is that the characters are simply flat. They are so lacking in depth that it's embarrassing. The writers and directors came quite close to creating interesting, engaging, and worthwhile characters, but then failed spectacularly. Jayla and Krall could have had incredible backstories, but end up having such painfully generic tales that I've already forgotten them. Krall could've been as excellent, flushed-out a villain as General Chang, but he got sold short. Jayla could've been a powerful, fun, and capable character we became emotionally invested in, but was simply used as a stereotypical plot device.Overall, the film was not poorly done. It was visually excellent, especially on a big screen, with impressive FX and boatloads of action. However, the writing and directing were sub-par, producing a sloppy and trite film that will leave a bad taste in your mouth. While Star Trek (2009) will stand the test of time as a quality sci- fi film, Star Trek Beyond (2016) will slip through the cracks and quickly end up on the bargain DVD rack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Trek Beyond--It was good, not great...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew this movie would not be the best or better than the last two and I knew that because JJ Abrams did not direct this movie. Neither was he involved in making it at all! So I was prepared for it not being great.I have to admit, I didn't really care that the plot was not that great and I didn't even care that the villain wasn't that great-- although I didn't think he was as bad as some of the other reviewers have stated. What I did not feel in this movie was the CHARM of Star Trek---Star Trek is about its characters and their relationships and this movie was all about fast action, things blowing up, etc. The writing in this movie was just okay. THe problem is that the guy who directed this film is a action movie guy--not a space drama guy. I will buy this movie for my collection, but I really wish JJ Abrams would come back and make a Star Trek movie!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but not very good either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen many Star Trek movies, and I haven't seen the TV shows either. I saw Star Trek Into Darkness (which was good), but this one was disappointing. There were cool action sequences, but the plot developments and the villains weren't very intriguing. I thought the opening maybe 30 minutes were boring and uninteresting, and the best thing about the movie was the triumphant, yet short, ending. The effects were good and the acting was good, but I think the movie moved way too slowly and just wasn't engaging enough for the audience. I liked how they used the music to defeat the villains- that was a great scene- but it was probably one of the only scenes that left me satisfied out of the whole movie. I don't really have much to say about Star Trek Beyond- it wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great 2 hour TV episode</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie in the IMAX 3-D. It would make one of the best 2 hour TV episodes of Star Trek, the original series or the next generation. But it's not a fantastic or mind grabbing movie . There were a couple moments when the dialogue was difficult to discern, but it does move along at an acceptable rate . It just did not provide me with motivation to want to see what was going to happen next in the film. Concerning the 3-D movie effects: the best 3-D to me was during the beginning of the closing credits. If you're on the fence about whether going to the theater to see this or waiting until it comes out on DVD, I would opt for the latter. I am a science-fiction fan but I probably will not be adding this DVD to my collection. I did enjoy a great deal the scenes with Anton Yelchin and the tribute to Leonard Nimoy, a.k.a. Mr. Spock.</fullReview>

They should have gotten the script writers from STNG locutus of borg storyline in on this one because they clearly needed some inspiration.SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT: The best bit in the film is the space station they visit (not much of a spoiler, as they did a whole series about a space station) but i imagine in 3D its quite good .its good in 2D . the scale of it is beyond anything I've seen beforeScotty has more of a significant role in the film which is good for simon pegg ...but the greatest sin of all .. is the tribute to Anton .. its right at the end of the credits ... i was the only one who stayed in the cinema to watch ... they should have done a furious 7 moment ... that was sad</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has the Star Trek spirit, but isn't very memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note: I marked this review as containing spoilers, and just to make sure: If you haven't seen the movie and don't want to read about the "surprising" revelation of the main antagonist's identity, stop reading now. - Well, if you're, like me, a Star Trek fan who cares for the Star Trek spirit and message of the original series, then I think that you'll perceive Star Trek Beyond as an improvement over the first two "parallel timeline" movies. If you're not fundamentally opposed to the whole alternative reality concept of the new Star Trek movies, or to the new actors, then I think you might like this one even if you're not a fan of the two movies directed by J.J. Abrams. The basic message of overcoming conflict and strife, of a peaceful and united society that has means to defend itself, but doesn't need a military as such (Starfleet is, after all, conceived as a civilian organization) comes across very clearly.The main antagonist is representing the "old", pre-Federation way. As it turns out, the alien-looking Krall is actually an embittered old Starfleet captain who was in the military prior to the formation of the Federation, prolonging his life and changing his appearance through technology found on the planet he stranded on. This captain was - and still is, in his new identity as Krall - an avid advocate of a "War is the father of all" philosophy, of progress through strife. Krall - Captain Edison - has never accepted making peace with humanity's former enemies, sees the Federation as an abomination, and also feels abandoned and betrayed, as no Federation help ever arrived at his crash site for a hundred years. So, he's hell-bent on destroying as much of the Federation as he can, with the glorious space city of Yorktown as his first target. Of course the Enterprise crew stops him. It's also not very surprising that the Enterprise, once again, gets destroyed spectacularly. And like in the parallel universe, they get a new Enterprise (NCC-1701-A), of course (though a bit earlier).For fans, there are several nice touches and "quotes" such as the Enterprise passing under a bridge in Yorktown, which is reminding of an iconic scene in Star Trek IV (though there it's the Golden Gate Bridge, and a Klingon Bird of Prey). Yorktown itself is spectacular. A grand, bright space city, the embodiment of Star Trek's utopia. For the few minutes alone where we see this city, the camera flights through its structure, it's worth seeing the movie in 3D. Otherwise, "Star Trek Beyond" doesn't really benefit a lot from the 3D technology. There are a few good space scenes, views of the Enterprise, but there are also quite a lot of close-up action scenes where 3D doesn't work that well, in my opinion.The parallel universe approach is further bolstered and used to pay homage to Leonard Nimoy, the actor who portrayed the original Spock and died in 2015. So, in this movie, young Spock is informed of the death of Ambassador Spock - his parallel self, who entered young Spock's universe as an old man from the parallel universe in the first new movie (good old mind-boggling time-travel SF stuff!). Also the whole original crew is seen on a photo from a box owned by Ambassador Spock. A fitting homage, I think (although it might slightly confuse viewers who haven't seen the previous films), as well as using the original series' famous introduction lines ("Space - the final frontier...") and music in the end credits.Still, summing up I don't give "Star Trek Beyond" a very high rating. Why? It's likable enough. Charming. Well paced, and the actors have settled in, in a good way. But - it's not very memorable. In a way, it reminds me of "Star Trek: Insurrection" which was like a good Next Generation double episode on TV, but not really cinematic. I liked Insurrection - thanks to this movie, I could experience the Next Generation crew one last time in a well-crafted adventure (discounting the abysmal "Star Trek: Nemesis", which is in my opinion an action movie with Star Trek actors, but not really a Star Trek movie). But in cinema, I expect a bit more. Star Trek movies such as "The Voyage Home", "The Undiscovered Country", or "First Contact" have to offer this - fresh ideas, surprising moments. "Star Trek Beyond" has a certain lack of these.</fullReview>

I was hoping for something unique to star trek. In the last half of the movie I got what I had hoped for. I only wish they did not water these Star Trek movies down with recycled action scene choreography and simply add a bit of spice at the end to satisfy the star trek fans and film buffs. If the movie wasn't watered down this way it would have received a score higher than 7 from me. In short, this movie has too many pointless action sequences but the second half of the movie makes it worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Focused more on characters - which is good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been a STAR TREK fan and have been on board with this series reboot from the start. &nbsp;The new cast has really grown on me as their iconic characters and I really wanted to have a good time with these folks once again.STAR TREK BEYOND delivers that good time in a way that was unexpected to me - it focused more on the characters than either of the previous two and the results work very well on the big screen. &nbsp;Sure...it's a summer franchise blockbuster movie, so there are special effects and big battle scenes galore, but it was the unanticipated interaction between the characters that made this film work for me.Without giving anything away, the crew of the Starship Enterprise find themselves stranded and separated (in pairs) on an isolated planet and director Justin Lin and screenwriter Simon Pegg (Scotty) have fun putting unfamiliar pairings together - Kirk/Chekov (Chris Pine and the late Anton Yelchin - you will be missed), Uhuru/Sulu (Zoe Saldana and John Cho)and (most effectively) Spock/Bones (Zachary Quinto and the underrated Karl Urban). &nbsp;It was great to see different dynamics played out in ways that were unexpected.Is there action? &nbsp;Absolutely, turning over the franchise to a director of one of the Fast and Furious films will ensure that the action comes...well...fast and furious. &nbsp;Where the film does fall short for me is in the plot. &nbsp;I couldn't quite grasp the villain's (Idris Elba who was wasted under layers of make-up) motivations nor his "master plan", so I decided to just not worry about it, sit back and enjoy the action and the characters.If you do the same, you'll have a good time.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 'Frontier' pushes back.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Star Trek: Beyond' is the third installment of the rebooted franchise depicting the early years of the 'USS Enterprise' crew. Does it live up to the praise whilst celebrating the legendary series' 50th anniversary?1. Replacing J.J. Abrams, director Justin Lin does a tremendous job handling the weight of this film. Having directed a string of 'Fast &amp; Furious' films prior to this, Lin controls the action very well considering this is his first sci-fi/fantasy film. The most outstanding action set-piece occurs when the entire USS Enterprise is suddenly attacked and destroyed by Krall (Idris Elba) as they respond to a distress call in a distant Nebula. Of course there are other impressive moments of action when Kirk (Chris Pine) and the other survivors attempt to rescue the rest of the captured crew.2. Having been pasted so prominently on most of the posters, Jaylah (Sofia Boutella) is a bit of a wasted character. She appears at least 40mins into the film as a lone native on the planet where the Enterprise crashes and Krall takes his prisoners. Jaylah is an interestingly designed character, but there seemed to be development lacking on her behalf. There may be a possibility she'd appear again in the sequel since (no surprise) she's personally recruited by Cpt. Kirk during the film's conclusion.3. Say what you will about 'Star Trek: Into Darkness', but Benedict Cumberbatch (Kahn) was a villainous force to be reckoned with in that film. Having said that, the antagonist here is the weakest part of the movie. We all know how terrific of an actor Idris Elba is, but he falters as the grudging alien Krall. His intentions and destructive plan is revealed later in the film, but his true identity, that he was once a human in the (now obsolete) military, occurs during the climax. His hatred for the Federation is too clichd, and never is there a mention as to how he transformed into the creature we first see him as.4. On a more refreshing note, the unlikely pairing of Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Bones (Karl Urban) as they navigate the unknown planet, was indeed a nice touch. With Simon Pegg (Scotty) as a co-writer, the humor as well seemed to have been cranked up a notch, but to good effect. Uhura (Zoe Saldana) has lesser screen-time here, but Sulu (John Cho) and Chekov (Anton Yelchin) do have their respective shining moments. The passing of Leonard Nimoy (Spock Prime) was written very well into the story, which leads to a surprising emotional connection.The tone here was all about family, and the lengths you'll go for them. The brotherly bond between Kirk and Spock takes center stage and can't be denied. Overall, 'Star Trek: Beyond' is a decent and fun entry with a dose of 'Sabotage' to it;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only Star Trek in name</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you were wondering when Star Trek was going to be watered down / dumbed down into nothing more than a CGI action fest, then you've arrived at that moment. The movie is all about wild kinetic action interspersed with dull drivel dialog with none of it having any particular deeper meaning or a point. The insipid plot coupled with the hyperactive CGI made for a surprisingly boring movie. There's nothing Star Trek about this movie whatsoever. Just a bunch of action figures moving around quickly. Even if I revealed the plot in full, it wouldn't hurt your movie-going experience in any way because the plot was irrelevant. Let's just say things happen in order to move the CGI forward. It's one big green-screen fest. Next up: Replacing the now equally irrelevant cast with animatronics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Trek Beyond does an excellent job of being forgettable. I myself am not a huge Star Trek fan, therefore I could understand how those who are dedicated to the series may find more to enjoy in this movie than myself. However, from a separate standpoint to said fans, I found this particular Star Trek to be lacking. The plot is thin, the CGI is occasionally poor in quality, the plot-holes are numerous and the villain is sub-par. Chris Pine does another excellent job at portraying the eponymous Captain Kirk, however the rest of the cast failed to give any compelling performances. If you enjoyed the old series and the last two films, go ahead and give this one a watch if you crave a little more. If this is your first time venturing into the world of Star Trek, look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Trek: Beyond Comprehension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a Trek fan for over 25 years. I'm not the kind of hard-core Trekkie who attends conventions in full costume and knows every episode of TOS by heart, but I have seen all of the movies and every episode of every series (even Enterprise, ugh).So with that background out of the way: I really did not enjoy this film. With these reboot films, I've seen increasing emphasis on action at the expense of plot, characters, and interesting science fiction. Most of my favorite original cast movies and episodes were much more about character than action: The Trouble with Tribbles, City on the Edge of Forever, Star Trek IV (The Voyage Home). I understand that the reboot is intended to draw in younger audiences not familiar with the franchise, but that should not require having explosions, battles, and near-death situations in nearly every scene.I was so overwhelmed and bewildered by the action in this film that when the crew called to separate the saucer section, I was confused because I though it had already been cut off (along with most of the rest of the ship) by the swarm. Watching in 3D didn't really enhance the experience either. I also never fully understood the villain's motives or technology. The explanations in the film were unsatisfying and given far too late.As you might guess from my (probably overly generous) 6/10 rating, I didn't completely hate this movie. I appreciated much of the humor, and the glimpse of Sulu's male partner was a highlight (and made me glad I did not read any spoilers). The views of the Yorktown starbase were quite impressive. The acting was mostly good, with the exception of Chris Pine, who had less emotional range than Spock in this film.But I can't see ever willingly watching this film again. And the staying power and multi-generational appeal of Star Trek, now in its 50th year, is in its rewatch value. I'd rather watch "Spock's Brain" twice in a row than see Star Trek:Beyond again, and for those in the know, that's saying something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was sceptical of the Star Trek rebooted movie universe but JJ Abrams somehow succeeded to some extent only to pour some sticky brown stuff all over it with the sequel ST: Into Darkness.The most notable aspects for Star Trek: Beyond to me how the new cast has aged. Simon Pegg looks like he is in his 50s, both Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto look a lot older, even the late Anton Yelchin looked like he had a receding hairline.In some ways a mature Pine as Captain Kirk is a plus, he is less of an overgrown frat kid in this film. The best character is still Karl Urban as Bones McCoy.The plot however in this film performs well as a popcorn film but makes little sense. The crew are several years into a 5 year mission where no one has gone before and end up going to a newly completed space station for example.A bad guy called Krall wants to lure the Enterprise to a nebula as it is carrying an ancient artefact and wants to use it to attack the Federation. However Krall seems to have no problems in attacking the Enterprise and Federation without it.The team perform well together and each contribute nicely to the story but the main action is set on a M class planet, in fact I would not be too far off by saying it is a glorified quarry which makes it kind of cheap looking despite some extensive CGI.However it is a straightforward space action-adventure movie, nothing shouts 'only Star Trek can do this' at you although there is some reflection of Leonard Nimoy's passing and a reference to the original Star Trek crew.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one's for the Trekkies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who have complained about the new Star Trek films not being Star Trek (Even though in my opinion they're considerably superior to the older films), this is the film they wanted. This one is less focused on explosions and feels like a feature-length TV episode. Thankfully the fears created by that awful first trailer which made the film look like a silly Fast and Furious rip-off proved untrue, although it's the weakest of the new Star Trek films. It feels like the smallest of the 3, the villain can't hold a candle to Benedict Cumberbatch (Even if that Khan twist was rather foolish), it's not as heart-pounding as the earlier 2 films and it just doesn't quite have the same punch. Still, the cast, screenwriters and director succeed in bringing a lively, witty and dramatic adventure to the screen and as high- budget blockbusters go, especially in such a terrible summer movie season, this represents a film which successfully caters to a lot of different audiences. The film's mix of action, humour and drama works well, and it mostly manages to give all the crew members something to do. Best of all is Chris Pine's Captain Kirk, who is given further depth and character development, as well as the wonderful banter between Spock and Bones. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond Star Trek</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this 3rd movie with hopes lessons were learned from the step back taken in the previous movie, sadly this wasn't really the case. The potential was there, and the seeds were even planted at the start of the movie for something great, but like Into Darkness they didn't return to those elements, and just pressed on to the drool &amp; seizure inducing CGI action.The title of this review I think is apt as these movies have now went beyond the Star Trek many of us fell in love with. Now we have a fairly generic sci-fi action/adventure movie series with elements of Star Trek tucked in to make it seem a Star Trek movie on an aesthetic and very basic level.The opening 20-30 minutes of the movie was the section I liked most - aside from the very opening sequence which was just too stupid for words! I enjoyed this section so much because we got to spend some time with the characters with their hair down, and get to know them better outside of manically paced action sequences. The vast majority of the technical elements are fantastic, I thought the Starbase you get to see was just amazing, and most of the effects in general, albeit with a lot of camera shake.Most of the crew interactions are well written and acted, the cast as ever were excellent. There were also some very tasteful acknowledgements to the passing of Leonard Nimoy which were handled very well, and without making a big deal of them.As ever though, key details and other elements either don't get acknowledgement again or are just wrong to begin with. There are some of bits information that relate to the previous TV show Enterprise, and while it was faithfully followed visually. The plot elements and continuity to spring from that were either wrong, or didn't make sense relative to what happened in that series. There's also a "nebula" (I use quotes because it seems far more like an asteroid field!) the writers make a whole song and dance about that only the Enterprise has the sensors to safely traverse it, and even then it's quite dangerous. There's a fairly long sequence of the ship travelling through, yet when it's time to go back through for the final act, you don't even see this "nebula" again, and nothing is even mentioned regarding it!We've had 3 "new generation" Star Trek movies, and it is the 3rd straight movie where we've had a villain looking for revenge and/or wants/has a WMD they're wish to unleash on the galaxy. It's just plain boring now, and leads to very weak villains. Krall is a cookie cutter as you can get as far as villains go, and Idris Elba many talents are wasted as a result. There's no moral grey areas, no commentary on the society of today, nothing remotely provoking for the audience to figure out or debate on. Those were the things that made Star Trek great, and they threw in action on occasion to mix things up a bit to help drive on the story, not be the story.Star Trek has indeed went "Beyond". Sadly past what made it great, now it's something less as a result.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3rd Film in the Trilogy, 3rd in the Ranking too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I prepared for Star Trek Beyond by watching the previous two movies back to back the night before at my local cinema. I had forgotten just how enjoyable the first film is; it found a near perfect balance between action, intensity, emotion and humour. While many critics heavily criticised Into Darkness, for me, while it didn't reach the heights of the first film, it still is a thrill ride. For me the main fault isn't any issue with Khan, but rather the whole story of Kirk dying only to be brought back to life very quickly after. Even with the altered time-line, it was unbelievable and incomprehensible to fathom the idea of Kirk not being both alive at the end of the film and to continue as captain of the enterprise, therefore reducing a lot of the emotion I should have felt seeing Kirk in a horrible position.Now on to Beyond:While the first movie had the feel of being a Star Wars film with Star Trek characters, Beyond seemed to move away from that to return to a classic Star Trek style film however this is not to its benefit. Kirk, Spock, Bones, Scotty and Chekov continue to have amusing moments throughout the film however it is only Bones who remains as humorous as the previous films with his fear and regular outbursts of anything and everything. Uhuru and Sulu seemed to have a reduced roll in this movie given they were part of the captives who had to wait through much of the movie to be freed by Spock and Bones.The addition of Jaylah portrayed by Sofia Boutella was the best part of the film. She was a very likable character who could easily defend herself, became an immediate ally of the Enterprise crew and was able to provide a ship for them all to escape in. As to the character of Krall, portrayed by Idris Elba; As an Alien, he appeared as a menacing and ruthless killing machine that could provide a real challenge to Kirk and co. Krall fails to be a memorable villain (in a good sense) when he gradually returns to his human form and his inner Idris comes to life. Even in recent films like Bastilles Day, Idris as himself lacks the aura and intensity needed to create real tension.My biggest criticism of the movie is Justin Lin's directing of fight scenes and the lighting on the attack on the Enterprise scene. In both cases, I found it really difficult to see what was happening and at the same time you are being blasted in both ears with noise thus preventing any aid to clarify what was occurring on screen.While it probably seems like I didn't like the film very much, the truth is quite the opposite. It is just that everything the film gets right, with exception to Jaylah, had already been done in the previous two films. I did think that it wouldn't take a lot work to improve the chances of a fourth movie bettering this one but with the sad passing of Antin Yelchin, a Chekov- less Star Trek is something I'm not keen to see.Final thoughts: this movie is certainly worth a viewing but there is no need to see it in 3D and do not base expect it to reach the height of the trailers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are just enough great visual effects to make this predictable but well done film worth watching in the theater.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Trek BeyondThe latest Star Trek has all the elements we have become familiar with. There is an angry humanoid who wants to destroy humans and had has had some success with this goal before Kirk and friends step in. And let's not forget that there will be a last minute technological solution that will not be explained. And yet again, the plot doesn't hold up to scrutiny. There is the destruction of the Enterprise, once again, something that was a surprise in "Star Trek III: the search for Spock, but is now just a part of the Star Trek universe like warp drive and transporters. After seeing the ship destroyed five times in film and on television, this plot element has become pass. There are the dozens of ensigns dying, but surprisingly, none of the main characters die. Of course, Kirk saves the day. Did you expect anything else? Much like the Bond franchise, the Star Trek universe has become predictable. The difference here is that this film, unlike the mediocre last Daniel Craig Bond film, Spectre, is visually appealing. Outer space and the ship look great. The most amazing set of visuals is in the Starbase Yorktown. It is a huge city in space inside a globe with twists and turns with no clear up or down. However, it all works and is stunning. So even though the action that takes place in the station is predictable, it looks amazing. Chris Pine and Zachery Quinto appear bored as Kirk and Spock, and Karl Urban and Zoe Saldana as Bones and Uhuru don't do much better. Simon Pegg as Scotty is the only regular crew member to seem engaged in the action, and he beams some fun into the action. Perhaps this is because Pegg is one of the writers of the film.The alien-ally they meet, Jaylah, does the best she can with little direction or script help. She comes close to becoming a mascot for the crew, but has enough of her own agency and action chops to make it work. It's no wonder she is fun to watch; she is played by Sofia Boutella, the ass-kicking villain from 'Kingsmen.' Sulu and Chekov have roles that are too small to rank.Idris Elba plays Krall, a vengeful character we are all to familiar with. (To see how good Elba can be, watch the excellent BBC drama, 'Luther.' ) Elba does not get enough screen time or very good dialogue. And no matter how good he is, we've seen it before. You know the adage that good acting brings up the performances of other members of the cast. In this case, especially during the climax, Pine brings down Elba's performance. There is little build up to the tension, not enough in the script to keep us engaged in Krall's struggles and in the end, we are trapped in the gravity of the visual effects. This is too bad, because what traditionally separated Star Trek from other space films is that the series is ultimately about humanity. Some of the humanity is lost in this film. The cheerleading tone saluting the Federation's empire and expansion is grotesque. Those are issues that Krall was fighting against, struggling with, what created him, and it's given too little attention. Everything in the film is subservient to the action and visuals. Good thing those visuals are so spectacular, or the film would have flopped.The music is forgettable, and in this way, not too bad. The choice of songs for the film's ending was predictable, but fun. And that's the point, fun. The way the alien ships fly about was also visually appealing, in other words, yee haw! Rating: Matine. There are just enough great visual effects on the station and the ships and manipulation of gravity and perspective to make this predictable but well done film worth watching in the theater.A warning: even on a wide screen, surround sound system at home, this film isn't worth viewing. Unless you see it on a big screen, I recommend watching The Wrath of Khan or Borg episodes from The Next Generation. It will be more entertaining. Peace, Tex Shelters</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost great, but never reaches it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of the classic show or the movies. All I know about the show and the movies is what I've learned from Nostalgia Critic videos. However, I've seen new installments and the Khan story remake was enjoyable for me. Star Trek Beyond was not a great movie, but it wasn't bad either. It's sort of OK. So OK, I didn't feel too invested, but this might just be my own perception of it. The story was 100% predictable right after all characters were introduced (sadly, it really has no surprises for you), and rushed at times (the movie was also quite short IMO). Acting was OK, yet, I wish Jaylah, my favorite character so far, would've gotten more attention and significance. I didn't enjoy the direction so much, since most of the action scenes in the first half of the movie were either shot incredibly quick and close-up or were really dark. I could barely understand what was going on in some of these. Also, there's not that much 3D in this movie, you can put off your glasses and still watch the movie as normal. There were also a string of rotating shots that actually made my head spin. Some of the dialogue was good, humour was good and bright most of the time, they even make fun of the classic techno-babble from the show. CGI was OK, but sort of uninspired, not that much detail or style. What was sad about the movie, is that I never felt any real danger surrounding the characters, nothing in this movie actually felt like an impossible thing being achieved (just like in ID:Resurgence :( ). Yet I loved how there were some scenes that tied the movie with the classic show and the original cast. I would've been pleasantly surprised if I were a hardcore fan. If the movie would've been a little longer, had a little more character development (cause the chemistry between them was there), and the action was shot in a watchable way, I think this would've been a great piece of sci-fi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A homage to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched it last night. It's not as I've expected but in a good way. I mean, the 2 prequels are action movies with sci-fi background. This one is a sci-fi movie with good portion of action - just like the original series. So yes, I didn't get the mind blowing, edgy, over the top actions performed by a super crew, but I got that 'deja vu' feeling since the characters are down to earth, their relationships are believable, their approach for the solution are 'old schools'(ie motor cycle, holographic shield, radio frequency etc) which Shatner's Kirk or Stewart's Picard may pull off in that situation. Strange that, while Justin Lin has turned the Fast n Furious franchise into somewhat a international spy action movie, he brings the Star Trek franchise back to the original.However, it feels like there is a big part of the story missing. No explanation while these enemy become alien and how Krall can change his looks in the final chapter. The alien's motive is not convincing enough. Krall seems to be more sad and frustrated than angry and revengeful. The Jaylah vs Manas fight choreography is just so-so. Both actors has showed good fight resume in their previous film, so I was expecting more spectacular fight between these two. So 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Space, the final frontier. This is a voyage of the Starship Enterprice as it and its crew explore a strange new world, and discover new life and civilisation. The Pine and Quinto star trek squad are back, but this time they find themselves with a new enemy and a new director, the latter being Justin Lin, director of Fast and Furious 3 through to 6. With Abrams out the captains chair it's time for Lin to boldly go where no one has gone before? Justin Lin brings the ferocious action and fast pace (at times) one would expect of the man. Lin is also great at creating a Star Trek film that feels and is new but also feels like the original show and films. Lin does a good job on this film. It seems JJ knows his strengths (begginings) and weaknesses (endings).The ensemble cast slip back into their characters seamlessly. Chris Pine is fine, Zarchary Quinto is still great as Spock and Simon Pegg is Scottish again as Montgomery Scotty. What I especially liked about this film was giving Karl Urban's Bones a more active role in this film as well as pairing him up with and eventually bonding with everyone's favourite Vulcan. Karl Urban has proved over these three films to be a brilliant Bones and I enjoyed the performance as well as how the character was utilised in this film.My only issue with this film was the poor or lack of explanation surrounding the films villain. I felt that Idris Elba wasn't utilised well at all and could have been a great villain, but instead falls into the forgettable villain category alongside the underling villains in Marvel films such as Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor 2. I have many unanswered questions about this character that I will now list so SPOILER ALERT again; Why does Krall look like the alien if he's human? What happened to Krall on that planet? Why did Krall gradually look more and more human? Was it because killing or draining peoples life does that to him? And finally my biggest question... How the hell did Uhura recognise Krall in the video when a) Krall never looks like a human let alone like Idris Elba, b) you never do see his face in the video as the camera moves away? I think this is just a bullsh*t moment that just moves the plot along and is meant to reveal the identity of our villain, but come on... You can do better than that surely?Overall, Star Trek Beyond is a fun ride that completely wastes the opportunity to have a good villain. Often it's said a good villain is all you need for a blockbuster, and in this case its sadly the only thing missing. This feature also has the sad task of bidding farewell to two actors of the Star Trek series, Anton Yelchin and Leonard Nimoy. May they be missed. Live Long and Prosper Mr Nimoy. For Anton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Meh. Unbelievable special effects. Freakin profligate amounts of custom props, sets, costumes, and make-up. Mind-blowing CGI.Unfortunately, the story itself is just kinda meh. Everything about this movie felt phoned-in compared to the sheer visual spectacle, which I know required a damned army of craftsmen and untold millions to pull off. But still, if that's the only reason to see a movie, then it's more like a monster truck rally. Excitement is the only thing it has going for it.Y'know, it's a kinda pedestrian, it starts with the Enterprise -- headed by a too-young Captain Kirk who just lacks the charisma to chew scenery the way he should -- being suckered into an ambush by some new Bad Guy who kidnaps most of the crew, and leaves the rest stranded on a nearby planet.With the aid of a Mary Sue warriorette, the captain and a few others manage to fight back. They find out the Big Bad is, weird facial features notwithstanding, a former Federation officer who was embittered after being betrayed, and seeks revenge with the help of this ancient relic which apparently can be turned into a hydrogen bomb or something. Yawn.The chemistry between all the actors felt phony and uninspired. There didn't seem to be any over-arching theme or allegory to make the whole thing interesting to me, except for the paper-thin concept of forgiveness vs. revenge.That's what made the earlier Star Trek so interesting, IMHO. The spaceships and aliens were just gaudy stage-dressing around themes like the existence of God, megalomania, mortality, etc. It was like a subtle and nerdy meditation. These new movies throw all that out the window in favor of explosions and over-the-top CGI.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Enterprise's been destroyed, nearly the whole crew has been captured by a powerful enemy, and their only hope rests with their captain, James T. Kirk.So what else is new?For Trek fans that have been with the franchise, and those who joined in with the creation of the Abramsverse in 2009, will find many aspects of this film echo with those that have come before.The destruction of the Enterprise, for instance, Search for Spock, anyone?But there's plenty of new stuff that will make this film its own among the pantheon of Trek films. For one, director Justin Lin, new to Trek but big on Fast and Furious, ramps up the action but thankfully doesn't go full Fast as feared.Also, as seen in the trailer, there is a new ship involved, the USS Franklin, tying this film into the less-than-well-received series Star Trek: Enterprise, which was set before the timeline was changed in Star Trek (2009).Finally, in a change from the past couple of films, a finer focus is put no characters that didn't often interact in the past, such as Kirk and Chekov (played by Anton Yelchin, whose tragic passing weeks before the premiere is recognized alongside Leonard Nimoy, who died in 2015).All told, this is an enjoyable science fiction film that anyone will enjoy, but for those versed in the Trek lore, you'll enjoy it even more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR TREK BEYOND boldly goes where we've been before, but that is not a bad thing in this third installment of JJ Abrams's reboot of the franchise; first time director Justin Lin gives what is essentially a big screen episode of the TV series. The crew of the Enterprise ventures into an unknown and uncharted area of deep space runs into big trouble and then has to improvise their way out of it or the Federation and the rest of the civilized galaxy faces imminent doom. This sounds like very familiar territory to anyone just casually acquainted with the Star Trek, much less hard core Trekkers, but BEYOND is all about the execution, and in that, it might even surpass it immediate processors.What is most enjoyable about this reboot is how well the new cast embodies the best traits of the original crew, fleshing out their quirks and mannerisms, and most of all, getting the chemistry between them right, along with a sense of humor that gives us knowing winks at some the old series clichs-right off the bat, Chris Pine's Kirk gets his shirt ripped in an alien encounter that goes bad, and back on board the ship, we are shown a closet in his quarters filled with identical replacements. At the beginning of the story, Kirk is shown contemplating leaving the Enterprise, having grown weary of the long voyages into space, and taking a desk job, while Spock is shown to be having doubts about his own future as well. We know that when the plot hits the fan, they will come to their senses and realize they are right where they need to be. At one point in the movie, the principles are marooned on a hostile planet after the bad guys have taken out the Enterprise (again) and separated from one another in small groups; this lets us see them at their best who they really are as Kirk refuses to accept defeat and finds a way to prevail, while Scotty, ever the engineer, gets the tech running again so an escape will be possible, as Uhura and Sulu are forced to stall the villain and a wounded Spock and McCoy, bicker and banter, reminding us that these two opposites are really brothers just the same.The visuals are truly stunning; the destruction and crashing of the Enterprise is one of the best special effects sequences in any Star Trek movie so far, the kind of awesome spectacle that we go to the movies to see or to pay extra and buy the Blu Ray. Also noteworthy is the massive space station we see in the opening and closing scenes; it makes me think that being a contractor for the Federation is one sweet gig. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, and John Cho are as comfortable in their parts as a hand in a glove, but how sad is it that this is Anton Yelchin's last appearance as Chekov after his untimely death. Yelchin's energy lights up every scene he's in, as he did in every role he ever played. There is also an acknowledgment of the passing of Leonard Nimoy and his great contributions to the series. Idris Elba's Krall is like so many of Star Trek's villains who motivation is not so much malevolance as having lost his way; Sofia Boutila registers strongly as Jayla, a resourceful refugee who comes to the aid of the Enterprise's crew. And Greg Grunberg and Simon Pegg are in that rare group of actors who can say they've been in both a Star Trek and a Star Wars film.STAR TREK BEYOND's screenplay, by Pegg and Doug Jung, is loyal in every way to the vision of Gene Roddenberry, a man whose diversified and unified world had never been more real. I think he would be most proud of this movie and what his original begat. The best moment in BEYOND for me is when we learn what constitutes "classical" music in the future.A fourth installment in the Star Trek franchise has already been green lighted, one that see the return of Chris Hemsworth's George Kirk, but personally, I would like to see a return of The Gorn, those lizard headed aliens from the first series were always a favorite of mine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I knew, going in...(I've been a) Fan of the original series, and the original team's movies, along with the JJA Reboot, and the Cumberbatch sequel, though the latter didn't do well. JJA's only producing this 3rd outing, which brings Elba to the fore, joining the pantheon of Trek villains, in an year where he has played iconic characters like 'Shere Khan', and also had the latest season of 'Luther'. Justin Lin, of the superb 'Better luck tomorrow', and few energetic mainstream F&amp;fs (beginning curiously with the weakest entry in the series, 'Ff: Tokyo Drift'), directs this time. Trailer 3, for 'Star Trek (rebooted) 3/Beyond': https://youtu.be/Ep3A-yJ3P3YWatched it twice. Both 3D viewings, with better company the 2nd time around. Was surrounded by fans (few) and non-fans (majority) alike, in the cinemas I chose to watch this in. First of all, the good stuff.The visual effects, a seamless merging of both practical and computer-generated, have to be the best effects ever committed to celluloid for a long time now. JJA left this flick to work on Episode 7? I find that strange. I also think he;s a Trekkie, not a Warrie. Anyways. The effects. They're good-great. The production design, in most of its running-time, calls to mind the fantastic work done in Neill Blomkamp's underrated 'Elysium'. Not a bad thing to be reminded of, by any means. Other than the generic visuals of call backs to Emmerich disaster movies with the innocent populace just gaping, and then running. The acting: Karl Urban. Idris Elba. Chris Pine. Simon Pegg. Anton Yelchin. Zo Saldana. Zachary Quinto (sorry - Nimoy IS Spock, now more so since he's gone 4ever, and Quinto will always be Skylar to me). Shohreh Aghdashloo. Sofia Boutella (the delicious 'Gazelle' from 'Kingsman: The Secret Service', but with her teeth and claws off in this one). Karl Urban has made the 2-note (amazingly strong notes) DeForest Kelly tropes of exasperation and affectionate-frustration his own, and owns every scene he's in, no matter who he's playing off (to be fair, mostly Quinto's Spock). Elba, in spite of being under layers of make-up (which keeps evolving/d-evolving), shows us why's he's the man, which makes the disappointing denouement on his villainous character a tad sad towards the end, considering how much more power that punch could have had. Saldana, to be fair, has more to do in this instalment compared to the ones she played Uhura in earlier, but its still too little/too late, imho. The stakes are high, as they always are, but I do wish she had had more to do. She's a great actress, and this genre is playing to her strengths, so its always disappointing to note wasted opportunities like the one I felt the makers did in casting her for this role, in the arc she got for this episode. Chris Pine, maturing ever so slowly as an actor, has had an interesting year. In the little-seen summer blockbuster, 'The Finest hours', he had a lot to do, and shouldered that responsibility ably, supported by fine actors like Casey Affleck, but here, he has his work cut out by the writing team, who've given him a host of clich- ridden lines, and situations to go through with a straight face, and he acquits himself admirably. Speaking of which, Elba's lines as well sounded (sometimes) laughably bad. How they found a way to shoehorn the Beastie Boys' number, 'Sabotage' into the flick, though corny, still felt like a neat trick. The power of (Classical!) music, indeed!Speaking of which, the score by Michael Giacchino is fantastic indeed, though not all-the-way. I'm not sure if this is being criticized or lauded, but 1 of the cool things about this was the aspect that each and every set-piece felt epic, and (unfortunately) it also seemed like a best-of gag- reel of epic set-pieces, sequenced 1 after the other, stitched together yes, but that's it. What's mostly a strength for this flick also turns out to be its weakness, imho. Not organic. Just like a Fast &amp; Furious movie, and though Lin directed the best one of them all (F5), even that was plagued by the cast going thru the motions from 1 set-piece to the other, but in that movie, one expected it. In this, once again, imho, it does the cast, the plot, the conceit and the fans a tremendous disservice, though, to be fair, the lion's share of the blame should also be laid at the door of the writers, including Pegg, who gives himself more screen time, and, the girl (damsel in distress, maybe not too much) - though I do not have a complaint with that. But the writer of such works as 'Paul', 'The World's End', 'Hot Fuzz' and 'Shaun of the dead' - maybe, just maybe, could have done better......The sense of scale always seems to be missing from most of these reboots, especially from the perspective of the number of staff that reside in, and work within the confines of the Starship 'Enterprise'. This, to me, was even more glaringly brought to the fore at the end of one of the faux-climactic battles, when one of those ships comes to a rest (esp. after). Imho, Ridley Scott and Neill Blomkamp seemed to be handling these aspects better in their respective (iconic) works. Quite a few sequences that require a substantial suspension-of-disbelief, imho. Now, for the kicker - we all know that Khan is around. So...where is he?Nevertheless, great mainstream popcorn-munching entertainment at the cinema. Hope I get to view it sometime on an IMAX screen, even if that happens to be on L(I)e(MAX)3D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good addition to the franchise but nothing new</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cast of the Star Trek reboot franchise return to the big screen halfway through their five-year-mission to explore strange new worlds. Strange is the theme of the day as the Enterprise and her crew find themselves powerless against an enemy with a radically different form of technology.Star Trek: Beyond takes its place midway between two Star Wars releases, providing us with some much needed summer sci-fi. The movie is lighter in tone than its predecessor, the gritty Into Darkness, and provides a very different pace. Co-written by Simon 'Scotty' Pegg, we see the Enterprise pushing at the boundaries of known space only for that boundary to push back as Idris Elba's Krall says.Beyond opens with a crazy, action-packed first half an hour as the Enterprise is assaulted by a strange new enemy. The trailers have already given away the main story point of this scene but I will leave it unsaid for those who haven't seen the spoilers. The embattled crew must fight for survival while they realise the scale of the forces against them.Chris Pine leads the cast with his usual charismatic portrayal of Kirk and is well supported by Zachary Quinto and Karl Urban as Spock and McCoy respectively. This triad forms the cornerstone of the movie and well it should as it carries on the stories of this era's crew. The rest of the cast aren't particularly well-used with Sulu (John Cho) and Chekov (Anton Yelchin) taking a secondary role in this movie. Sofia Boutella as the feisty Jaylah is better used and provides a lot of momentum to the story.Beyond moves along at a rapid pace, barely taking time to rest and for the whole, is an enjoyable addition to the Trek legacy. That's not to say that it's without its flaws and some elements could be dispensed with to tighten up the story. A nebulous superweapon that is completely unnecessary and fails to generate even a modicum of threat could easily have been ditched, for instance.The main themes of Beyond are unity, friendship and family; the core themes that have served Trek well over the years and they shine through the largely unoriginal story. There are some sad undertones to the movie too with the deaths of Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin. Spock Prime is given a touching send-off and a small but well- executed tribute to the original cast will bring a nostalgic smile to many a fan. It's sad to know that Yelchin won't return as Chekov and Quinto has hinted that he may not return as Spock. It remains to be seen if these parts will be recast in future movies.Star Trek: Beyond doesn't offer anything particularly new but it's still a fun and enjoyable story. There're some great action scenes and most importantly, some great character scenes. The themes of self- doubt and burdens of duty add a sombre undertone to the movie but it keeps the Trek franchise in good shape for the future. Definitely one to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK if you're dying to see a sci-fi, big-screen movie this summer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw Beyond. Compared to "Into Darkness (STID)," it was boring for similar reasons to the most recent Star Wars - The Force Awakens. Not enough suspense. Not any compelling character or personal story lines - save the nod to Spock Prime - and even that wasn't fleshed out much. OK. So the writers of STID were inaccurate with a few things...and that clearly influenced a few bits of dialogue in Beyond. Still, I'd rather that writers and directors focus on creating a strong character or personal story, and telling a good suspenseful, bit of mystery, drama- filled story around that. I highly doubt that Beyond will get equal ratings compared to the other two most recent Star Treks. Despite all that, in an otherwise slow action movie summer, it's worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three years into its mission into deep space, the USS Enterprise is about to dock the most advanced space station ever built. Whilst on the station, an unidentified ship arrives, boarding an alien who came to ask for help as her crew and ship were lost on a planet inside an unexplored nebula. James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) accepts the rescue mission, yet once the Enterprise enters the nebula and communications are cut off, things aren't the way they thought they would.The biggest take away I had from Star Trek Beyond is simple: Justin Lin is one of the most respect worthy directors around right now. He started his career making really low budget stuff, he then slowly moved to the Fast and Furious franchise where he started really low and got better and better with every single film. Now, he makes a Star Trek movie and manages to make it enjoyable even to someone like me who never had anything to do with Star Trek and who disliked both the J.J. Abrams efforts. Star Trek Beyond isn't just the best entry in the new series, it also is one the best films of the summer, full of heart, joy, adventure and intelligent storytelling.The thing I kept thinking whilst watching the film was how well it was written. Pegg and Jung craft a fantastic screenplay that made me realize the exact reason why I disliked Abrams' films. Everything is properly set up, what needs to be explained is explained, what needs to be withheld is withheld until the right moment and there aren't on the nose mysteries or storytelling black holes that were a pain to endure in the last two. Every character is given a clear arch, every problem that arises has a solution that is organic and coherent to the world and the characters which makes for a film that is fluent and beautifully paced.Just as worthy of note is how brilliantly Lin uses visuals. From the very small character moments, the world building touches to the overwhelming action set pieces, they all matter in the same way and it makes for an audience experience where you feel like you are being treated as an equal and that was exactly what I felt missing from past entries. Lin has experience with action and it all shows here where he crafts sequences that are so organic to the story and the characters they don't even feel like action. They flow so beautifully and thrillingly and are complexly put together with lots of inter-cutting that never looses the audience and instead enhances the experience, culminating in a final set-piece that is original and riveting in the same way.The actors of the main crew also have to be commended, especially for their chemistry and the comradery they manage to get through. You believe these people have been together through thick and thin in all these years and the internal dynamics between them are the reason everything around them works. Karl Urban as Bones is pitch perfect in timing ans his banter with Chris Pine is tight and not the usual generic crap we are served. Pine also gives his best effort yet as this great protagonist and finally manages to convey true conflict in his character. Yet, the highlight of the film for me was Sofia Boutella who is now two for two after her brilliant turn in Kingsman. She gives a stand out characterizations, one of those that always stick out on the screen and she was my favorite character and element in the film.Unfortunately the movie does have a couple of problems that stop it from making its themes and narrative heft emerge as much as they should. Firstly, the villain, played by Idris Elba, isn't as half as intimidating as he should be and proves to be a missed opportunity, failing to create any kind of consistent atmosphere or danger. It is not Elba's fault by any means, it is just a character that did not stick as much as he should have. Finally, there are many world building issues around the film that are never matter of first importance, but throughout it they create many inconsistencies that keep coming and after a numerous times became really distracting.In the end Lin has crafted a remarkable blockbuster picture, a seamless amalgamation of great action and effects with dynamic character work and fascinating sense of adventure, a great heart and message of tolerance and diversity that even the people like me who are the furtherest away from Stark Trek lore can enjoy thoroughly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm in a final frontier compared to most avowed Star Trek fans, so I appreciate I can be a bit harsh on the franchise films when they come out. Not so with Beyond.Co-written by co-star Simon Pegg who plays the frequently exasperated engineer Scottie, the writing might fail in terms of drama, but it has the sound of geek academia ringing throughout its awesome set-pieces and technical mumbo-jumbo.For anyone who was worried that the last film Into the Darkness wobbled when it should have warp-speeded, Beyond picks up the flack to deliver a thrill a nano-second crowd- pleaser. I'm happy to report the feeling of a positive outcome was generated by viewing this latest cinematographic production. Oh dear, I'm beginning to sound like Spock (Zachary Quinto) - beam me up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exploring New Frontiers Like We've Always Done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fifty years ago, through their home televisions, the world was introduced to a new way to explore new frontiers. Extraterrestrial worlds could be explored and made peace with from the comfort of the living room, later spawning a long series of theatrical releases that still won't quit. So now, Fast &amp; Furious director Justin Lin takes the responsibility of creating the first Star Trek feature shot entirely on digital cameras, in an effort to balance out the uniqueness of the franchise along with Paramount's populist style of entertainment. The anticipation may sound hopeful, but Star Trek Beyond fails to stand out as its own entity, instead becoming exactly what Star Trek into Darkness turned into, minus the unnecessary underwear shot of Alice Eve.I was never a fan of Star Trek; the original series always came off as boring to me, and the movies have been just plain predictable and unexciting. So how did this film appeal to me as an outsider of the franchise?Right from the first scene I knew I was in for something I was not going to like; basically Kirk gives a message of goodwill to a council of aliens, offering them a symbol of peace. I felt some disaster coming when I saw the embarrassingly bad composition of the CGI aliens, made all the more painful to watch during their attack on Kirk in response to his offer. Kirk then explains in voice-over about how he can't feel at home midway through this five-year mission, an important character trait that has little resolution by the film's end. The USS Enterprise then arrives on this mystical high-tech planet coated in glass, where Spock hears some untimely news about his peoples' ambassador. An unidentified vessel soon arrives, where an alien mistress calls to them for help. At this point, I've seen this whole routine happen before in better movies.As the USS Enterprise flies toward the alien's rescue mission, a swarm of enemy ships attacks. Now, this part here could have blown my mind with its spectacle, except it didn't for some reason. The ships hijack the Enterprise, and their leader marches onto the ship in precisely the same fashion as Darth Vader in the beginning of A New Hope. He takes the crew members captive, and the Enterprise breaks apart, crashing onto the destination planet with a devastating catastrophic burn. Nope, still don't care.I think that the excitement could have been better if the screenwriters took more care to add tension and conflict within the scenes that exist only to explain important plot details. But the actors weren't doing much to flavor up the dialog either. Zachary Quinto as Spock was the only actor I enjoyed, as his straight emotional expression actually made his lines of comic relief all the more effective. Now don't get me wrong, I see potential in the story, but the drama should have been more intensified to heighten the action.The characters also had plenty of potential to generate much more staying power than the end result. Clear backstories are given to each of them, but the countless subplots add to the confusion of remembering all the details. It's the same problem Independence Day: Resurgence had, except with a more committed cast. While I'm not against the idea of multiple subplots, it still takes a lot more effort from the writers to achieve this complex format. Of all the old and new characters that Star Trek Beyond crams together, the only character that I wanted to learn more about was the white alien girl Jaylah (Sofia Boutella), who I honestly would have wanted to see as the main character of this feature.Now look, I certainly did not enjoy this film as you probably did, but I would not say that it was a total loss. While I would complain that there's too much CGI, cheap-looking makeup effects, and a lack of exploration of new worlds, there's still plenty of neat sound effects and enormous size to add enough fun for your Trekkie senses. Again, it's the type of movie you have to have the proper taste for, but if it aligns with your taste, and you're willing to shut off your disbelief enough for the reasons I stated above, then you shall live long and prosper with this exhilarating journey.</fullReview>

Still cannot get my head round Fratboy Kirk, em-Spock and Simon Peggs much lauded but I am afraid for me crappy performance as Scotty. If you can get past the Vulcans letting an vastly over-emotional Spock represent their race at Starfleet and Kirks continual promotions despite continual cockups then maybe. Bones is the best thing in it and you can see DeForrest Kelley in there. It is still a bit wham bam crash bang wallop for me and loses a lot of the original series. Not quite the JJ Abrams plot holes the size of small galaxies in here which helps a bit. Reminds me of the TV series Gotham i.e rename it, rename the characters and maybe the reboot natural lazy writing will disappear .. so call it Star Battles and have capt Kerr, Mr Svarc etc and it could have been a CGI/SFX extravaganza to please the fans who dote on that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Trek Beyond, tasty like a dependable instant boxed cake mix. Just more sprinkles on top. Found the missing ingredient.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Trek Beyond (STB) (2016) was a respectable reuse of a successful formula that has served several past Star Trek films (and other Sci-Fi films). Propping up a simplistic plot by the overuse of eye candy (CFX,CGI), lots of nonstop action adventure, interesting banter between the main command crew, and toss in a mean nasty villain all to justify turning out another money making movie. Technically there seemed to be nothing wrong with STB and it was enjoyable being new Trek but it does contain a lot of empty calories. At the end of the movie some people near me said he felt he had just been on a long roller coaster ride. Another guy said to him but this was ST and it should be analyzed (jokingly?). The other guy said back no it doesn't. I just felt like I had sat through an upgraded two hour average ST episode that was not anything special to commit to memory. Bad guy who shows up with big pointy stick dies at the end.**Spoiler Alert**A more Trekish story plot I would have enjoyed. The one thing I would have changed was the villain. Instead of making the villain a nasty mean immortal soul sucking ex-soldier seeking revenge for being put out to pasture by the Federation. I would have made him (and his crew) immortal and "enlightened" from being exposed to ancient technology discarded when their culture evolved "beyond". Instead of wanting to destroy the Federation the "villain" would bring the next best thing since sliced bread to the Federation thus advancing mankind to new heights without all that boring time consuming discovery process (shades of Borg and Q). The problem would begin when Bones and Spock point out the "evolved" humans have become static and over the hundred so years and have not done anything useful (still stuck on the planet, no rebuilding, no clean up or dusting, no children, and no emotions) but only fixate on bringing their future to the universe because they are so "with it". Kirk's suggestion to wait and study their "gift" to the universe is considered as fear of change by Neanderthals and the evolved humans start to force their objectives on the Federation which causes the conflicts. At the end the Federation mostly wins and the remaining evolved humans are taken away by the original ancient beings to be cured or cared for until the universe is ready for them. As a parting gift the planet is terraformed (made safe for kiddies) for the Federation and so can continue to explore the universe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond welcome to the series. A great threequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been a 'Trekkie' and have never actually seen any of the TV series or the original motion pictures, but as a sci-fi fanatic (though as one I probably really should've seen those by now, I know) I remember watching the 2009 reboot around its release with a few friends and loving every minute; the plot, the characters, the special effects... I'm not sure if I blinked once for those 2 hours. J.J Abrams' take on Gene Roddenberry's creation immediately made me a great fan of his work, leading me to see 2011's 'Super 8', his 2013 Star Trek sequel 'Into Darkness', and work my way through 121 episodes of 'Lost' for the first time. When I discovered Abrams wasn't directing 'Beyond' (no doubt due to his full focus on manning last years highly anticipated return to the Star Wars saga, and I'm sure we all understand how confusing it could've become working on a Star Wars and a Star Trek film at the same time) and noticed Justin Lin had taken his place, who I was already familiar with having watched him bring The Fast and the Furious series from two low budget street race flicks into a seemingly endless action-fueled blockbuster franchise that I can't decipher how I enjoy so much. I walked an hour to my nearest cinema to catch the midnight premiere in 3D (and later walked that same hour back and my feet are still feeling it) but ultimately, thankfully, and not expecting otherwise anyway, I was not disappointed by what awaited, and, arriving home after 3am, felt it was worth the exercise. I won't even hesitate before recommending seeing this film in 3D, because it offered plenty of scenes that worked beautifully in all their visual depth, including action sequences and extraordinary landscape shots that both had me grinning and wowing like I'd never seen a 3D movie before. The cinematography was amazing, though it was easy enough for me to tell Lin was applying his own techniques of filming here (which I respect, as some sequels I've seen have had directors clearly following by example of whoever directed their predecessor and not always producing a great result) and that Abrams was absent from the director's chair for this movie, losing his signature 'quick zoom' shots I'd noticed and found an effective touch in his two Star Trek films and in 'The Force Awakens', along with his incredible and admirable research of the original show and films prior to rebooting them. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and company deliver great performances as ever, and Idris Elba gives us an interestingly different role beneath some great prosthetic make up as main villain 'Krall', who, though thrilling in his own right, wasn't as chilling a villain to me as Benedict Cumberbatch's 'Khan' in the previous film. 'Beyond' I feel has the biggest emotional factor yet in the franchise, with less gags in place than the other two films, which, given in mind the loss this year of two great actors from the series, is understandably so, particularly in this being Anton Yelchin's final outing as Chekov, who, J.J. Abrams announced, out of respect isn't going to be recast for future installments. The pacing was fine for me throughout, and I was satisfied with everything that was fit into its two hour running time. On the whole I don't think 'Beyond' tops its predecessors but it was great fun to watch and filled with brilliantly executed action sequences and visuals. This is certainly a good and welcome addition to the franchise, and Justin Lin did a great job handling this sequel in Abrams' place, making this highly likely his best film to date. And it proves a touching tribute to the late Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin. I'm looking forward to the confirmed fourth movie already, though it definitely won't be the same without them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will admit I was a Trekker before it was cool. I watched TOS and fell in love with the show. Space exploration, a divergent crew and aliens! The fact that there was no war or famine; everyone got along without issues was just the gravy. If it weren't for TOS and Gene Roddenberry Sci Fi would not be where it is today. That being said I must admit to being a bit reluctant for a reboot. I have seen all things Trek, every movie and every series and am still in LOVE with the Trek universe. I love JJ Abrams but wasn't sure he could take on my sacred Trek. I was pleasantly surprised with the first movie?.the cast was awesome, the second movie was OK but hated that it was a retelling but, this third installment has restored my faith.I am probably one of the very few people on the planet not to have seen any Fast and Furious movies so I had no problem with the directing choice. The fact that Simon Pegg co-wrote the screen play had me intrigued to say the least. The return of all of the cast was a great relief and Idris Elba is one of my favorite actors so I was set for a ride. And what a ride it is! The special effects are pretty mind blowing and the action fast and furious! Forgive the pun?? What was even better was the character interaction. There is action yes but, there is humor too. The Spock/McCoy dynamic is at its best so far in this film. Karl Urban and Zachary Quito OWN their roles in a way that hearkens back to the witty banter of TOS. Of course the rest of the cast is on point also and I have NO problem with a gay Sulu?..sorry George Takei. Chris Pine is the ultimate action hero in this one and his Kirk just gets better with time. Anton Yelchin is so very good as Chekov?..I was looking forward to more story lines for him. He will be greatly missed. I applaud the decision not to recast that role in the next feature. Zoe Saldana's Uhura is a bad ass and the addition of Jayhla played by the fabulous Sofia Boutella gives us some major kick ass girl power.I don't want to give away any spoilers?..go see this one! You will be pleasantly surprised?.I was!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're looking for an action movie from beginning to end, then this is your movie, I'd even give it an 8 as a generic action movie, however.I'm pretty sure Roddenberry's idea of making star trek movies was to have some action, some special effects, but it was mostly about dialogue involving moral and current affair issues. This movie has action and special effects in spades, but very little meaningful dialogue.Now the part that really irks me is Space Station Yorktown. Navel stations, and as far as I can remember, star trek space stations are NOT named after battles, they're usually named after locations. This is my prime example of bad writing in this movie. Simon, you're a great Scotty, but a horrible writer. You should take the naming of this station to heart. Remember, the British lost the battle of Yorktown, and after the battle left our shores forever. This is your Yorktown, and you should give up writing star trek scripts forever ......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, the cinematography was about what you would expect for a science fiction movie, the plot was weak (and not very well executed).The rest was really ....... just not great. Characters (except for Bones) were flat, even for a Star Wars movie, how the bad guys became the bad guys, what motivated them to follow the head bad guy just never was really explained. No spoiler here, but just no explanation of how crew members could within seconds figure out and use to perfection technology that was 100 years out of date before they were born is a gimmick that runs through more than one Star Wars film, and it was old the first time it was tried. Almost every thing in the movie was predictable, in the same way you could figure out the plot of (pick any) Roy Rogers movie.Spock was very out of character for a Vulcan, with no explanation of why before or after, for a good part of the film, and it just goes on. Cannot believe I wasted an evening and paid full admission for this. At best its a wait for it to come on TV, record it and wait for a rainy day film.</fullReview>

It's just Star Trek Beyond main strong point is the comedy and the action There are moments of when the characters show great deal of emotion which is the other highlight of the movie.Nevertheless Star Trek Beyond is just going to be one of those movies you're going to love or you're going to hate that's your choice. There was some things that really disappointed me in the movie it's just felt like someone was laying down on the job with the writing department or perhaps they are just trying to copy all the movies from the best.When you watch the movie you'll see what I exactly mean.Now the cast from the last two movies return for the third movie in the reboot series Chris Pine as Captain James T. Kirk Zachary Quinto as Commander Spock Karl Urban as Doctor 'Bones' McCoy Zoe Saldana as Lieutenant Uhura Simon Pegg as Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott Anton Yelchin as Chekov Idris Elba plays Krall the film's main antagonist now I was quite surprise him cast in the movie but I was more or less mix with his performance because I had hoped he would have gave a menace performance where you fear him each time he was on screen and he did do just that it was hard to understand a lot of what he was sayingSofia Boutella plays a brand new character named Jaylah and I have to say she was one of the few saving graces of this movie because Jaylah is a very clever character and one that we could have use more of plus Sofia's performance goes to show she really embrace the character like she put her heart and soul into it and she was likable from the moment we meet her so that's one thing I do enjoy.The music captures the mood of the movie as all Star Trek Movies do good or bad it always feels like they tell a story with the score to help matches the scene.I just hated some of the ideas they had in the movie which really didn't show what you do in a Star Trek movie it just really hurts the serious factor of the movie and hurts characters more or lessThere is a tribute to Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin during the credits of the movie which no one in the theater made a sound out of respect to the two actors.Star Trek Beyond could have been so much more had it not been for the errors they made to the series but still if you're a fan you might enjoy it Just wish they had left some things well enough alone.I give Star Trek Beyond an 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In hindsight, perhaps it would have been better to not have the "thank you for coming to the movie" message from the cast right before this stinker. Wish I could have my money back; at least I didn't pay for 3D!So much wrong even to a non-scientist who just wants his sci-fi science to make sense and be consistent.Does every Star Trek movie have to end with the same one on one clash sequence merely swapping out who's battling from the crew this time around? All this fuss about the crew sticking together and twigs in a bundle and, yet, when it comes to saving the world let two men duke it out.As for the "breakthrough" gay scene, writers bailed and, while showing obvious intimate scenes of hetro couples, wimped out for a scene that could have easily been a brother/male relative and his child meeting a male crew member at a spaceport gateway. Perhaps that was why the campaign to explain the 5 second scene to us ahead of time during PR run up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fun romp but ludicrous story line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget it's Star Trek and it's an enjoyable action film as long as you switch your analytical brain to off. The action is fast paced and the effects are good with a touch of Inception, a Death Star and Fast and Furious thrown in. Huge numbers of the crew die in what can only be described in horrific ways either having the Enterprise torn to bits or cast into space sans space suit but at least there's a toast to the departed and not the usual jokes as if nothing happened poignant considering the death of Anton Yeltchin.However, if you happen to even think about it at all then the whole thing is just ludicrous from beginning to end. We have a vast outpost out in the furthest reaches of known space yet it has millions of inhabitants doing what??? why build such a huge edifice THERE? OK, this station needs resupply but being that size it'll need a constant fleet of the equivalent of white van man and not one battle cruiser half way through its five year mission. We have the scene of Sulu meeting up with his family but not to labour the point, this station is out in the middle of nowhere. How would Sulu get the opportunity, if ever, to see his family again. Having his family there was a very poor plot device just to get him to meet said family. Okay, next we have a liveable planet in a nearby nebula. Since the station was built, didn't anyone at anytime think to explore the nebula. Isn't that what the Federation is all about, to explore strange new worlds to boldly go etc etc. Moving on to Krall. How did he not know about his old ship, the Franklin cloaked or not, it was HIS ship. and a motorbike! seriously? A 150 year old bike and Kirk gets it going, Leave something lying around for a year or so without maintenance and that thing will seize up, it's tyres will have rotted away but Kirk has it purring away as if it came straight off the factory floor. and please tell me why Krall needed that device when his drones did such a perfect job ripping up the Enterprise and was in the process of doing the same to the Yorktown. (shouldn't the name Yorktown have been given to a sister ship of the Enterprise and not a static space station?)</fullReview>

I really do not understand how can you spend a huge budget on a movie with this scenario.This movie can't even by included in the regular Star Trek series. Gone is the deepness that was characteristic to the Star Trek movies. It is the first Star Trek movie that disappointed me.If you are wondering if you should see this movie or not, I would say: go see it.

		<fullReview>Much better than I expected. The first two of these new movies were excessively action packed. This one, while still heavy on the action was more balanced. I actually thought that the story was linear and internally consistent. The two major action sequences were separated by some actual story and character development. And some good one liners. The battle scenes were reasonably conceivable without the major tactical flaws seen in so many of these films. The movie attempts to present a message of hope, both for people living and working together, and for the movie franchise. Overall the film was quite enjoyable and I look forward to seeing it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretty average I have to say. The tired old 'save the Earth from aliens' theme. I have to say that Star Trek films always fall on their face even though they can be quite entertaining because they are invariably fail to distill the essence of what Trek should be. Read the Wikipedia page about Star Trek and watch the Voyager TV series to get a feel for what I mean.The enduring popularity of Trek is due to the underlying mythology which binds fans together by virtue of their shared love of stories involving exploration, discovery, adventure and friendship that promote an egalitarian and peace loving society where technology and diversity are valued rather than feared and citizens work together for the greater good. Thus Star Trek offers a hopeful vision of the future and a template for our lives and our society that we can aspire to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's wrong with modern action movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shuddery-camera fight scenes. That's what's wrong with modern action movies. Peter Jackson pioneered it, as far as I can tell. Apparently the director either doesn't know what he wants, or doesn't care. So he does the shuddery camera fight scene, with poor lighting, maybe flashes of light, so the poor audience doesn't know what's going on. And I guess there are people who go to movies for Boom, Smack, Pow for whom this is wonderful.But I nearly walked out on "Civil War". I knew there was a fight, but the shuddery camera and lighting made it impossible for me to tell what was going on.When one of the main characters is in an extended fight with one of the main villains, would you like to know which villain? I would.The first big action scene, on the Enterprise, I can't tell you what happened. A lot of people got hurt, a lot of people got killed. After a while I realized it wasn't any of the main characters. (Apparently Jim Kirk is the only one allowed to have bruises and cuts on his face, by the way).Movies are about storytelling. I actually appreciate dazzling special effects. But when the special effects don't advance the story, when they actually stop the flow of the story, that is bad, bad, BAD storytelling.For me, if you would show the principals starting to fight, then cut to them binding their wounds and mourning their dead, I would be fine.I was 10 when "Star Trek" started. I saw the premiere. I love "Star Trek". I am also very well educated and relatively intelligent. When I have trouble following a story (with all appropriate humility) that story has not been told well.There are moments of wonder and brilliance here. I think there probably was a very good story there. But it's hard to tell.George Lucas somehow never quite figured out that the reason we kept coming back to see the original "Star Wars" movies over and over is that we loved Luke and Han and Leia and Ben. The people who are bringing us the new "Star Trek" movies need to learn we love Jim and Spock and McCoy and Uhura and Scott and Sulu and (God rest his soul) Chekhov. Don't begin a movie with Kirk and Spock undergoing such existential angst that they are planning the leave the Enterprise, and then don't touch it again. We love whiz-bang effects, but we love those people.Go see the movie. And may you find the fights less frustrating than I did.</fullReview>

If they're still trying to compete with Star Wars (still competing after three plus decades) then the latest Star Wars wins by a long,long way. We had our hopes up with Simon Pegg sharing the writing, however, the trailers say it all- fast and furious. Then again Pegg's own films tend to be the same format so perhaps we were overly optimistic. Beyond, beyond what? They barely go beyond anything! Beyond a decent plot?-yes.. Beyond a plot that's the same as the last film- no... Beyond going boldly? Beyond a film of intrigue, substance, ideas? Beyond fast and furious?er..no. On the positive side the cast are great, the chemistry is good, and the opening half hour looks promising but then fight, shoot, boom, escape, fight, shoot, boom, escape, slight pause for some character interaction, fight, shoot, boom, escape, shoot him now, NOW oh come on shoot him arghhh oh.. fight, shoot, boom, escape, fall asleep.

		<shortDescription>Steering the franchise in the right direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The recent reboot of the Star Trek films have not let us down till now. This doesn't either. With JJ Abrams shifting to directing the other space saga, Fast and Furious guy Justin Lin wears the directorial cap for this one and has done a great job indeed. He has picked up where JJ has left off and it is good to see that there hasn't been much of a difference in the style.Star Trek beyond focuses on yet another mission by the USS enterprise crew. Take it this way: when they are bored, they like to put themselves in danger:) Unfortunately this time, Captain Kirk has to lose his beloved ship in a rescue mission and also risk the capture of his crew. Captain Kirk and his fellow near and dear ones get separated and the rest of the film is about how they make their way out of danger and prevent the villain Krall from destroying.. well you get it. The plot is pretty straightforward unlike its previous movie. Visuals and humour are well handled as usual. There is one epic scene nearing climax which makes makes this movie go from good to 'damn good'. It was very saddening to know about the untimely death of Anton Yelchin just prior to the movie release, and he has a pretty good screen time in this film as well. Audience will experience mixed emotions seeing him as Chekov for one last time. Also, the makers have handled Leonard Nemoy's tribute very intelligently. Although Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto lead the way, it is Karl Urban who steals the show with his sarcastic humour and grunts. Sofia Boutella as Jayla is impressive and Idris Elba cakewalks through the role of the antagonist, Krall. I was surprised to see Simon Pegg is also a writer for this film!Although Start Trek Beyond doesn't take you much 'beyond' it takes you to enough distance to give you a good cinematic experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Then.Star Trek (2009) was good; it was long and winding but it was good. It employed an oft used plot device, time travel - and it worked. I believed in the characters and bought into the JJ universe. Then there was Into Darkness, it would have been good if I had never seen anything prior to the 2009 reboot? I can quote lines from Wrath of Khan, it was a defining time (I digress). So even with the re-purposing of a great story I thought Into Darkness was "ok." At least I could understand the character's motivations.Now. I have been looking forward to Beyond since it was first announced. I knew from the trailers that the Enterprise would (likely) be destroyed yet again (building starships must be easy and cheap). It started well and had a number of terrific scenes where characters exposed sincere emotions (even Spock). The problem is that I had trouble with the villain's motivation, I wanted to have a better picture of why all these things were happening. The fact that there were seemingly tens or hundreds of thousands of baddies in their nasty little ships attacking the Federation just reinforced the need to know why the Enterprise, her crew, and so many other peaceful beings were in such peril.What I got was a vague alien race reminiscent of many other Sci Fi epics and a very weak subplot about an earlier captain and crew. Maybe when I watch it again on Blu-Ray I might feel differently. Perhaps the disc release will contain cut scenes that make movie more engaging. I clearly remember TOS episodes that were so good even though they had such mediocre special effects. What I wanted was something that kept the Trek Universe alive and going, what I got was a Fast and Furious Trek that raced around blowing up everything in its way. What happened to the characters, the drama, and a decent plot?Finally, a *spoiler* of sorts. When Spock opens the package with the photo of other Spock's captain and crew it was from Wrath of Khan. It was a great time but why not hearken back to the classic? Show an image of the original cast from 1966? It is, after all, Star Trek's 50th anniversary, right?</fullReview>

As for the story well the film drives like a Ferrari on steroids everything is rushed and flushed, zoom zoom zoom. No time for any character development or the building of any kind of suspense. I'm sure this film cost a fortune to bring to the screen yet it looks and feels cheap, not that looking cheap did the original television series any harm. Oh, how i wish producers would develop a story, relax and build from the ground up.Here in Star Trek beyond, nostalgia is a quick after thought yet in these few fleeting moments i found myself yearning for the first era of Star Trek cinema films which had decent and interesting stories to tell. That this film is just so average is a pity because the cast is really rather good and with the right kind of story i'm sure they could really deliver a Star Trek film to remember.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of the Star Trek reboot films I had high hopes for Beyond. But it certainly doesn't live up to the standards of the previous two films.After a very slow start, the film develops into an almost non-stop action film. The problem is that the terrible camera-work renders most of the action scenes unwatchable. The jerky camera just left me with a headache while its almost impossible to tell what is going on at times.The plot is lazy and rehashes much of Into Darkness. The villain Krall, is very similar to Khan in his actions and motivations, while the climactic scene is almost an exact copy of that in Into Darkness.There are some nice moments, Sulu meeting his husband, tributes to George Kirk and Leonard Nimoy. And Jaylah is an interesting new character, hopefully she is kept on for the next film. Although I would also hope that Scotty manages to stop calling her 'lassie'. Its sexist and got very tiresome.Overall, the film feels lazy. Not enough thought or care went into the film, it feels like too many people were on auto-pilot in making it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An exciting, special effects laden, couple of hours. It starts with frenetic action and you wonder what has happened to the characters but then, the scene set, Simon Pegg and Doug Jung's script pauses for belated breath and allows us to enjoy something of the spark that first endeared us to the original TV series. Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Bones (Karl Urban), bickering their way through adversity, and Kirk (Chris Pine), were always the very heart of the original Star Trek, and they are given time to interact and charm the audience in a way that's possibly been missing for over 40 years. Pegg (Scotty) has written himself something more interesting too, as he encounters a new and interesting alien character, Jaylah (Sofia Boutella).Idris Elba plays the one dimensional baddie, Krall, with some verve but his character isn't explored or explained sufficiently and may prove forgettable. This is a negative compared to the previous instalment, where the bad guy almost stole the movie.Once the characters have been allowed to bicker a little, it's back to frenetic CGI action. It's fast and furious, if a little confusing. As to exactly what is happening and why is never entirely clear, but we know who the good guys are and can cheer them on, unashamedly.Perhaps the weakest film in the current reboot, this gains from rediscovered characters, but the confusing action and one dimensional bad guy serve to undermine what might otherwise have been an excellent entry in the franchise. Worth a watch though, just don't expect to follow exactly what is happening!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HUGE improvement over the first two reboot films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wouldn't quite say Beyond brings Trek back to its cerebral roots, but it's a genuinely good movie -- certainly by far the best the reboot crew have gotten. Part of this is that it at least has a non- broken plot and spares us the anti-science nonsense of the first two reboots movies. And part of it is that while the story is still a fairly unoriginal beat-the-bad-guy-before-he-uses-the-death-ray outing, it at least feels like this wasn't made by people who don't like Trek. You shouldn't have to praise a movie for just paying attention to the basics, but it's a welcome change for a movie in this reboot to have some substance -- however minimal -- under the shellack. The rollicking action is still there, but it's controlled rather than frenetic, and serves the story rather that trying to obscure the lack of one. The humour is still there, but it's not silly or slapstick. The references are still there, but they're graceful and genuinely witty, not ham-handed. The villain is still there, but he has a coherent motive and pattern of action (however simple and bare-bones it may be). Our heroes have to use their minds as much as their fists and phasers to solve problems and ultimately save the day. And guest star Jaylah truly shone, a strong, capable and yet vulnerable character who I'd love to see more of.The characters finally *feel* like they'd belong on the same bridge with their original counterparts: Kirk gets to be truly convincing as a Captain for the first time, Quinto and Urban's takes on their characters feel fully matured (and by God do we get some great Spock &amp; Bones moments out of them), Uhura gets to step out of the role of Spock's Girlfriend for most of the film, Pegg's Scotty feels like a character all his own and not just Pegg doing a bit. And Yelchin's Chekov is finally fully-formed and convincing as his own guy and not just a collection of tics and an accent... which makes the actor's premature demise suck all the more.For once I actually had as much fun watching a Trek reboot movie as people were telling me I was supposed to be having. So much of this adventure just *felt* like Trek, albeit from the more action- oriented end of the spectrum: the Yorktown base is a great example of this, an unabashed celebration of the old show's aesthetic and ethics updated with state-of-the-art effects on a massive scale. I even liked the (rather cheeseball) use of the Power of Rock to defeat the baddies in the end, because it was cleverly tied into a classic Trek-style outsmarting-the-enemy-computer moment that would have felt right at home on the old shows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Trek is Back...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a lifelong fan of this franchise I'm delighted to say that Star Trek is finally back. After the disappointment of "Into Darkness" I was very doubtful as to whether or not this third installment would deliver the goods. Although the film does have its flaws, they are on the whole incidental to what is I believe a generally good story. The film is split into three distinct acts. The first two acts were by far my favorites of the three harking back to the original series in terms of the overall light hear-ted tone, comedic moments and sense of wonder. The scenes of the Enterprise arriving at Starbase Yorktown are truly jaw dropping. It's wonderful to finally see some originality coming from the writers in terms of a vision of the future. In truth, since Star Trek began 50 years ago all we have ever seen is a 1960's vision of what the 23rd century might look like. Yorktown for me is the first time Star Trek's vision of humanity's future has really been updated for a 21st century audience. The whole look of the Enterprise is much cleaner than the previous two and more in keeping with Star Trek. Thankfully the beer factory engine room was not revisited and the sets maintain a consistency throughout the ship that we haven't seen before in the Kelvin time line. We also get to see the crew living together and the Enterprise as their home. This makes us actually care about the characters and the ship itself. By the time the ship was flying through the nebula I was already feeling sorry that this would be her final mission and that I had somehow sorely misjudged her. After the Enterprise is destroyed and spectacularly crashes onto the surface of the planet, the film moves into the second act. This part of the film is great as we finally get to see some character development and all the principal cast have a role to play in getting out of their situation. The crew are left stranded on a hostile alien world and have to work together to escape. This is pure Star Trek and was a joy to watch. Idris Elba plays the rather menacing looking "Krall". He is a human who has crashed on a planet and discovered alien technology to prolong his life by draining the life force out of others. This to me was a great story idea and added an element of real horror seeing all those people shriveled up after they had been drained. It kind of reminded me of Borg assimilation in Star Trek First Contact, especially in that he took on the appearance of his victims. Very cool idea! The whole premise behind the attack on the Enterprise was perfectly clear, he needs people to keep himself going. Unfortunately what was not clear was why he would want to commit mass genocide but I will come to that later. Chris Pine finally comes into his own in this film and his Kirk begins to resemble the Kirk that we know from before. The scene where he deceives one of Krall's agents into disclosing her true intentions is a good example of Kirk actually using his intelligence to resolve a situation. He is showing he has the experience and intelligence to be the Captain of the Enterprise. I felt for the first time he looked like he was actually in charge. As fort he rest of the cast, all gave solid performances. This brings us to the final act and in my view the worst part of the film for a number of reasons. Krall, not content with his life prolonging blood sucking activities on his planet, decides for no apparent reason to go out and murder a few million people. This whole part of the story made no sense to me at all. Also, the manner in which the Enterprise crew destroy the Swarm of ships was quite simply ridiculous. Playing "Beastie Boys" on the VHF does not cause a fleet of ships to just explode. That whole scene was something straight out of "Guardians of the galaxy" and it just didn't fit for me. I did enjoy the crash landing sequence of the Franklin on the Yorktown and the final fight sequences between Kirk and Krall but the whole reason for them all being there at all just left me cold. There are plenty of Easter eggs in the movie that kept me laughing to myself when other less geeky viewers were left oblivious. Good examples were "the green hand in space" reference (which also made a visual appearance in the end credits), as well as musical nods in the score to the original series and some of the movies. (TOS fight music during Kirk's fight scenes and TOS "comedy moment" music when Kirk and Chekov are caught in Jayla's trap. Also TMP VGER music during the first scenes on the planet showing Krall's base.)There is a touching scene at the end paying tribute to Leonard Nimoy and the original cast which I have to say worked very nicely. It was very subtle and quite touching to me as a person who grew up with those original actors. There was also an equally subtle tribute to the late Anton Yelchin when Kirk calls for toast to absent friends before the camera centers on Chekov. Beautifully done indeed and well done. There were just enough great things in this film to allow me to overlook some of the more silly story elements. It's well known that this script was done in a hurry and it kind of shows. If they had had more time I think this could have been an all time great. In any case, Trek is back on top after 50 years and here's hoping it will continue long into the future. Live long and prosper!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another reviewer said that if you liked the first 2 movies, then you'd like this one. Couldn't be further from the truth. I've loved nearly everything Start Trek for 40 years including the first 2 films in this reboot. Beyond doesn't deliver as expected. The first reboot introduces us to Enterprise and her crew via an altered time line, establishing the means to change everything we know about Star Trek. Into Darkness takes full advantage of this new found freedom through an imaginative, well thought out twist on the story of Khan Noonien Singh. Both films have very good plots, scripts, pacing, acting and effects.Star Trek Beyond has an ultra thin plot, a so-so script, mostly good acting, bad pacing and CGI work that is not on the same level as that of previous two films. Beyond is not a total loss. Sofia Buotella is wonderful as Jaylah and since she was not wearing a red shirt, there's reason to hope that she might appear in a future installment. There are also a few good visual and humorous moments. Should have been many more of them.IMO Star Trek Beyond is not worth the price of 3D or IMAX. I just saw it in Real 3D version and I'd like 1/3 of my $ back, please.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Trek was great but not amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hoping to build from where it left off from Star Trek Into Darkness with returning cast Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoey Zaldana and Simon Pegg. New director Justin Lin is the new captain of the ship taking over the ranks from JJ Abrams and is looking to make his mark. The crew of the Starship Enterprise is set on a rescue mission into the uncharted nebula, thus the "Beyond" in its titleI review all this on my YouTube channel, please feel free to check out my 2min Star Trek Beyond review here: http://bit.ly/29RrTblThe performances from the cast is what you'd expect from such a wide range of talent. Chris Pine is a very strong lead and carries the movie well as Captain Kirk of the Starship Enterprise.With a solid foundation, what could go wrong? Well, it felt kinda flat and just OK. Which isn't to say it's bad but it's not what you'd expect from a big budget movie carrying the Star Trek name. It felt like a classic blockbuster in that it was fun, has great humour and action but nothing too extravagant or ground breaking this time around. The sheer scale of some of the landscapes really show off nicely how vast and infinite the Star Trek universe really is, which was great.Everyone worked well together and you really feel like each character had something different to bring to the table. This made for an intriguing dynamic to watch between the interactions within the team and how they work their way around the obstacles they come to face. The supporting cast was great namely in the form of Sofia Boutella playing JaylahAlthough, I wasn't too sure about the villain. I get what they were trying to do with his character, but I don't think they pulled it off. Without giving too much away, it's just a classic reason why the villain becomes who he is. They try to flip the script by giving you that reason at the end rather than at the beginning but like I said, didn't quite execute it as well as I thought they could. Zachary Quinto was great as Spock again as you'd expect. His subtle comedic tone was pleasant to watch during his exchanges with the crew Mainly with Karl Urban's character Doctor McCoy Anyway, the action sequences were well done and it did a good job in mixing CGI with practical effects. Also, the practical costumes were great, Jaylah was on point. :) Star Trek Beyond was dedicated in the memory of Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin who have both sadly passed away, may you both rest in peace. Star Trek Beyond gets a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all so critical of the movie, how would know what Gene would approve of, &amp; those Who require Sci-fi to be Sci-fi...... Get over it, movies are made to entertain, if you don't care for all the action &amp; destruction, go watch the "Note Book", get in touch with yourself, watch reruns...... You can live in the past. What did you expect, Justin Lin directed it. Love the new cast for this franchise, sorry about Anton, hope they cast a good one. With the exception of Ulhura, all replacement cast do a very good job of replicating the original members, I have to be fair, original Ulhura did not really interact with crew as much as the current character, glad she has more of a role now. I'm already looking forward to the new installment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun watch, but missing the true thrills of Abrams' Star Trek</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been really loving the rebooted Star Trek series. 2009's Star Trek is one of my favourite sci-fi movies of all time, and Into Darkness is a very solid sequel. However, I'm disappointed to say that Star Trek Beyond doesn't quite live up to its two predecessors. Whilst there's still some good popcorn fun to be had, along with a brilliant range of top-quality performances, Beyond feels too generic and messy to be a truly exhilarating and enthralling watch.The film's not bad, it's just missing out on so much that made the first in particular so good. Above all, it seems like Beyond is really going for style over substance. The first movie was an incredible display in mixing fascinating character insight with blockbuster thrills, whilst Into Darkness kept that going with some brilliantly tense and emotional sequences centring around the leads and villains.In Beyond, the good vibes between all of the crew members aboard the Enterprise mean it's a somewhat stale affair. Given that everyone on board is getting on famously with one another, there's nothing particularly personal at stake, leaving only the generic 'fate of the universe' as the threat that the Enterprise has to face.The film starts off on an okay footing, but it was immediately clear to me that there was going to be more focus on big action than great character focus. In the end, what disappointed me most about Beyond was the fact it failed to rectify a very thin opening act as the film went on, and I never felt any truly convincing motives for any of the characters, which was a real shame to see.Another issue that I have with the film comes from its visuals. Despite being a masterpiece of CGI, just like the previous two have been, Justin Lin's directing style just doesn't suit the Star Trek series. Whilst J.J. Abrams gave the action scenes an exhilarating appearance, Lin's tendency to overuse shaky cam amidst a sea of CGI made every action scene feel messy and misguided, and definitely not exciting or entertaining enough to make up for the losses in character depth.From the above criticisms, it would seem that I didn't like Star Trek Beyond at all, but that's not true. For one, it is still an entertaining watch, and the bulk of the film, which is set on an alien planet in which the crew spend a lot of time exploring (in a very similar fashion to the original TV show), is a lot of fun. The introduction of Jaylah, a badass alien warrior, gave that part of the film a good burst of energy, and it really helped me to have a lot of fun despite the disappointingly predictable and generic plot.What's more is that the performances are once again excellent. Chris Pine continues to shine as Captain Kirk, and the supporting cast are all just as impressive and entertaining as the past two movies. I did feel that Beyond lacked the comic relief that Star Trek in particular was so good at, but the range of performances was good enough for me to see past that.Overall, I was disappointed to see that Star Trek Beyond fell foul to a more generic, blockbuster vibe. Losing the personal drama of the first two, and suffering in its action scenes as a result, it's rarely an exciting watch. However, its sense of discovery in its main act, along with a heap of great performances, make it a solid and fun watch in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoroughly uninspiring...spoiler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a trek fan and a sci fi fan. It seems that movies nowadays are dumbed down and action replaces an intelligent script anymore. I had high hopes that this movie would be smart and funny. Instead, the crew doesn't get much of a script at all, and the final insult, they end up fighting one bad guy, just like in the last couple of movies. That is getting old. The story, not that interesting and having plot holes. The 5 year mission should be exciting, instead the writers chose to show us that the crew were suffering fatigue. I suppose this was to build us up for the big event which should have been very exciting and entertaining for the audience. But instead, we suffer because we lose one of the main characters. The ship. WTF writers?? the ship is an integral part of the joy of Star Trek. I feel this was a big mistake. The jokes are old, and not really funny... except for a joke by Kirk, near the end of the movie. Of course we expect Bones to be grumpy and predictable but how about the more serious part of Bones personality? like in the original series! or are we only going to get foreseeable jokes and quips anymore? The acting was good, as always. I feel Pine does an excellent Kirk and the others are great at their characters too. Though, the timing seemed off between many of the characters near the beginning of the movie. Anyone else feel this?Overall, the movie is acceptable but really not up to snuff,as my father would say. 5 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It really was incredibly average</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that I was disappointed with the film. Many of the reviews had been positive but I had doubts after the previous two Star Treks. However, I thought with Justin Lin at the helm it might have a bit more 'pop' to carry me through the film. Whilst it was marginally better than the previous two, it really wasn't all that.It just felt so formulaic. They had already showed the Enterprise getting taken out again in the trailer, meaning that when it happened in the film it had no resonance or shock factor. Just another box to tick on the 'ABC of creating generic sci-fi films'.The whole film, to me, just felt meh. The action felt like a console game cinematic for all the weight behind it. Plenty of flashing and banging but not really anything that you cared about.The writing was poor and didn't pull you into the characters. They had their telegraphed motivations and thoughts and it all felt very flat and generic. The motivation for the bad guy was also quite weak though if I'm honest a really clever reasoning wouldn't have saved it.These films have the budget and the technology but they just don't seem to know what to do with it. Spend all the money you want on a building toppling over or a ship getting destroyed but if you haven't spent the time in the script establishing the thing you are destroying or the motivation behind the action, it's just pointless empty noise that might look 'cool' but is ultimately hollow.It's just another example I'm afraid of studio execs throwing money and CGI at the wall and hoping that it sticks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I viewed "Star Trek Beyond" on a standard screen, not 3D or IMAX. I had heard that some scenes were rather dark. And that's true, but I had no trouble discerning what was happening and darkness was appropriate to those particular scenes."Star Trek Beyond" is a visual feast, a combination of superb creativity and technical achievement. The scenes of the space station alone are amazing. The musical score and the special effects are great, allowing the viewer to remain in the scenes emotionally. Landscapes and spacescapes are impressive.The acting is good, but we already know these stars and no one is pressed for an Oscar-worthy performance, because even in scenes of suspense or danger, the tone remains somewhat light due to the unphaseable attitudes of Capt. Kirk, Bones, and others.The confrontation with a mysterious and powerful adversary makes for a great adventure, filled with scenes of attack and parry.Sofia Boutella, who pays the alien named Jaylah, deserves special mention. Her characterization is beautiful, mysterious, and powerful. In a subtle way, she gives her scenes emotional impact that make the viewer connect with her longing for escape from a prison planet.This is a worthy entry in the Star Trek canon, providing echoes of Star Trek's fifty year history and cutting edge digital wizardry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good action film, but unbalanced and lacking something</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(contains spoilers!)Well I watched the movie yesterday after looking forward to it for quite a while. It was a pretty good action film, in that there was, well, lots of action, at least in the first third and final third. But it was sort of a movie more along the lines of something like Transformers, in that there is quite a lot of CGI stuff which is cool but on the whole it has two side effects 1) it's kind of shallow and leaves you feeling empty and lacking in depth, and b) the high-intensity of the visuals kind of makes the minuscule lives of the characters seem much less interesting. I mean, it's kind of like having this big huge massive distraction which is on a scale far bigger and more impressive that it kind of makes you feel like the characters are just sort of in the background, dragged along for the ride, as though they are just secondary to the main star of the movie - i.e. the cgi, the huge far-too-advanced for this point in the timeline space station, the massive 'wave' of enemies and so on, which overshadow the human parts.Both Kirk and Spock were a let down. Kirk was moping around at the start and unsure of his future, and not really the dynamic hero of the film. In fact, you could barely say that he 'saved the show' at all, even though he was involved in the 'final scene' near the end. His duty of unlocking some locks or whatever seemed minuscule and just not on a big enough scale to present him as a strong hero or leader. He really didn't have a lot of energy in this movie and came across as bored and boring. Also Spock spent half the moving being injured and moping around instead of being extremely intelligent and even getting into fights and stuff like we saw in prior films. His blathering over the 'maybe relationship' with Uhura took up too much time and focus. And that Uhura was turned into some kind of almost lead character with all kinds of seemingly new energy and skills just didn't seem to fit right. It's almost like the whole film was a sabotage (befitting the music used in the movie - Beastie Boys) of the 'core' of the characters, with Spock being mostly ineffective/disabled and Kirk not really doing a whole lot other than shooting some lasers, it just felt like the main components of a good Star Trek film were demoted and replaced with focus on a whole bunch of other stuff.Then there's the enemy. OK... human-like enemy with some weird revenge plot, is hardly original or satisfying. His plan was too plain, like, just to get back at Star Fleet with a big giant attack. Like, is that the best they could come up with? He was unconvincing, the sub-plot of him sucking life out of other people was vague and not really clearly portrayed as the main reason for capturing people onto his planet, plus he didn't seem the slightest bit phased when his entire fleet of ships were blown up by radio signals near the end. Like, not even a shot of him having any kind of reaction. It just made it unconvincing that it meant anything other than another excuse for some huge CGI. Yes the swam is sort of cool and maybe different, but OK... on the planet you see maybe a few hundred ships, they launch and it looks like a light swam of maybe a few thousand, they get into space and emerge as this really think dense mass of them which start to sprawl out in different 'arms' (ala matrix), and then somehow this transforms into a giant tsunami-like 'wave' or 'wall' of them which looks like millions of ships, and then this whole thing turns into like a tidal wave complete with the wave crashing down and a funnel through the middle - rather too much of an ocean analogy... its as if the swarm just gets bigger and bigger every time you see it and I just don't buy it. And then the entire thing gets blown up rather too easily and quickly, without a since flinch from the main bad guy who basically turns his back on the whole thing and carries on alone with no reaction.I also came away feeling a real lack of inspiration, reflecting back on previous and even older Trek movies. Like, where was there any moment on par with Spock being in the radiation chamber and basically committing suicide to save Kirk and the gang in a previous movie, an extremely poignant scene. Or where was anything on part with truly exploratory themes like the 'genesis' probe, terraforming planets and bringing Spock back to life? Where was interesting time travel plot of Nemesis (if I recall) where they're hunting down a 'future Spock' and so on? Where was the intense sense of otherworldly encounters as seen in Voyager with v-ger and the strange representative gal that comes aboard, to later go inside this massive ship to find the voyager probe? Or who about the time travel to save the 'whales' from extinction? There was nothing in this move anywhere near on part with these kind of really far out plots which made those past movies truly awe inspiring and interesting. It was just another episode of .. oh.. some guy with a grudge decides to wage war and tries to kill off a bunch of people on some space station. .. yawn. yawn. Yawn again. It was altogether just far too easy, far too shallow, far too obvious and far too amateur to match up to past offerings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Trek film in 20 years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Trek: Beyond is not a perfect movie, but it's the best Trek film in 20 years. Yes, better than either of the previous reboots/alternate universe films, and better than anything else that's appeared since 1996's superb Star Trek: First Contact. It isn't by any means as good as the high points of the series (in my opinion, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, and the aforementioned Star Trek: First Contact), but it is up their in the category of 'solid' Trek films. It also shows that the JJ-verse is giving us high quality odd numbered films, rather than the even numbered film theory of old.So why is Beyond worth an 8/10? Quite simply, the writers (Pegg, Jung) understand what makes Trek work. The rapport between the characters here is absolutely spot on. Bones and Spock in particular have a fantastic on screen chemistry, and it just feels like the characters are finding themselves as much as slipping into the roles we're so familiar with from their 1966 TV counterparts. It feels like Star Trek again, and the big silly stunts and hand to hand fights feel like what the original show would have allowed for with a bigger budget and modern technology. It played out like a direct adaptation of a TOS episode, and while some may complain about that 'episodic' feel, it was exactly what was needed to course correct the series.It's not all perfect. The villain has a solid motive and an intriguing backstory, but there just isn't enough explanation. It feels like an extended cut could flesh out Krall so much more, and I'd be scoring this a 9/10 instead of 8. Blowing up the enterprise again is also an interesting choice, but it works for this particular story. Despite these flaws, you have to give it credit for treading new ground and not just rehashing old stories poorly (Into Darkness).Being the 50th anniversary film, there are also some excellent tributes to the late Leonard Nimoy, an NX class ship akin to the Enterprise TV Show starship and numerous other references dotted throughout. It was just enough to let me know the filmmakers cared, and not enough to be classed as re-treading or rehashing. It was just right.If you're a fan of blockbuster action, this is a solid, recommended summer flick. If you're an old school Trek fan and you're totally against everything in the JJ-verse, I'd still recommend giving this a try. It's the purest Star Trek experience we've had for quite some time, and it may be the best we get for quite some time to come.</fullReview>

To J J Abrams?am such a big fan?thanks for your excellence in science fiction. I hope you mentor others that down-the-road will keep this venue going. I am sure Leonard Nimoy and his family greatly appreciate the tribute to him and the tribute in the ending credits to Yeltchin/Chekov as well. Two comments in the film I thought were outstanding to bring out about in general: ?. One spoken by Spock/Zachary Quinto?"we should find hope in the impossible". This is what can make a country greater. The other by Lt Uhura/Zoe Saldana?."there is strength in unity". Unity is something that does not come easy when adversaries or groups fight among each other. I enjoyed the plot, as well as all the special effects. Thanks for giving women a couple key roles. May we learn that our humanity is what makes us great, no matter what our ethnic background?. together we are stronger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>better than Into Darkness! A refreshing new direction for the series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some complain that the new Trek films are just blockbuster action movies, that they lack the wonder and sense of exploration of Gene Roddenberry's vision.Star Trek Beyond is still a blockbuster action movie. However, it's a refreshingly new and self-contained story that avoids the pitfalls of it's predecessor. For the most part Justin Lin and Simon Pegg steer clear of the annoying things from Into Darkness: the silly plot turns, the cheap drama and bickering between Spock and Uhura, and the annoyingly shallow and unimaginative fan service tributes.The best part of this film is the renewed emphasis on the relationships between Spock, Kirk, and McCoy. The interplay between these characters is entertaining and feels natural. There's less melodrama in this movie. And why should there be? Star Trek has been never been the soap opera that Star Wars is.The rest of the movie is pretty solid. The action and music has always been great. The bio weapon employed by the enemy is inventive and terrifying. Each character in this ensemble cast has ample screen time, however none of it feels forced or unnecessary. It's a well-directed fun and streamlined movie.I think one of the best decisions made with this movie was to write a new original story. After Into Darkness I was worried about the direction this franchise would take. Would they make a sequel, or would they continue to rehash old story lines and characters in a bid to milk our wallets dry with fan service mediocrity? It was a great move to bring in new blood (writer + director), and hopefully the next films will explore newer ideas and boldly go where no one has gone before!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a fan of J.J. Abrams; I hated the end of LOST and was very disappointed by Star Wars The Force Awakens; but I have to give that his reboot of Start Trek was exactly what the start wanted. The old familiar feeling with ore advanced action, environment and FX. This time is not Abrams on the director chair but Justin Lin who after directing 4 Fast and Furious movies; knows a thing or two about action and also about people chemistry. This new movie plays largely with the classic disputes between Mr. Spock and Dr. McCoy; who remember the original Star Trek; those were the funniest and smart moments; both were usually right; but never agreed; it was to the viewer to take a stand. After a funny and classic bit were diplomacy goes horrible wrong; Star Trek is send to respond a distress call beyond the legendary NEBULA; the place considered the end of the universe in the series and some of the original movies. Do not expect too much on that; there is a standard trap and rescue that pretty much resembles the classic episodes, new found friends and unknown enemies and a certain surprise to the end. This one is not INTO DARKNESS; in terms of story but mixes the old universe with new modern issues; like declaring one of the main characters as gay (nothing sexual at all) and filling the movie with lots of humor; a welcome contribution from co-writer Simon Pegg who keeps the many funny bits for his character but share a lot with the others. This is not the best perhaps STAR TREK movies; some FX are too dark and overwhelming while others like the final fight in non-gravity are outstanding and the script could have been more complex; but is the funniest and non stop entertaining In brief; far better and entertaining than the last Star Wars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Trek Packs Fast And Furious Thrills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, prior to the release of J.J. Abrams' sci-fi epic that rebooted the franchise, my knowledge on the 'Star Trek' universe was limited to say the least, whilst I had watched the television series as a child, my commitments were elsewhere, so please take note that my review won't go into the focus of similarities between the show, older movies and the reboots, rather just focusing on the movie itself.J.J. Abrams unfortunately stepped down for this instalment due to his commitment with the 'Star Wars' saga at this moment in time, leaving the question of who would direct the new 'Star Trek' sequel? Well, when word came about that the job would go to Justin Lin, famous for his 'Fast &amp; Furious' involvement, the audience were rather unsure on what to expect, maybe just a montage of scantly-clad women, fast supercar-inspired spaceships and banging house music... well gladly that wasn't the route he went down. Whilst 'Star Trek Beyond' does have the continuous action element of the 'Fast &amp; Furious' franchise that the two predecessor's had little of, it seemed to work well - if you can get past the shaky camera-work that is.The action sequences are thrilling, the visual effects are generally stunning (with the odd exception in rare instances), the plot has delved into the backstories of characters (even featuring a cameo appearance from a group of familiar faces) allowing for the modern audience of the franchise to better understand the characters, and the new villain (played well by Idris Elba) is a cold-hearted and relentless character. All-in-all, despite Abrams' departure from the film, Lin has created a rather well-executed space adventure.Sure, perhaps the Beastie Boys conquering the finale was a little too far-fetched, but it was nonetheless a fun-filled, action-packed, adrenaline-pumping space adventure flick packed with humour and thrills. Whilst it lacks in comparison to the two first films, it's still a strong film nonetheless and I would happily recommend for fans of the first two to go see it whilst it's in the cinemas. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Star Trek reboot series just keeps on trekking at warp speed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Continuing on the reboot series, Star Trek: Beyond is about the crew of the USS Enterprise as they embark on a rescue mission but soon turns into a test of survival, unity and teamwork. With J.J. Abrams too busy with the Star Wars franchise, Justin Lin (director of several Fast and Furious films) takes the helm and delivers a rather exciting and visually impressive feature. The action was enthralling, the universe was imaginative and oddly enough there was plenty of character development. All the main cast members return and still remain great, especially Karl Urban and the late Anton Yelchin in which both finally got more screen time. Simon Pegg also returns and decided to write the screenplay which many will notice as there is definitely more humour involved, but it's natural wit and not at all forced. The villain of the film, Krall (played by the ever popular Idris Elba), was good if slightly under developed. The visual effects is the main star of the blockbuster and my goodness they look super detailed and still remain consistent even in intense busy action scenes. A couple of moments where Lin decides to use the dreaded 'shaky cam' which can make action sequences difficult to watch, and he also likes to rotate the camera...a lot, it can be quite disorientating at times. Overall, another great entry in what most might consider the best reboot series ever made with intense action, splendid visuals and substantially more character development.- Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Summer Blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The crew of the USS Enterprise are back to celebrate Star Trek's 50th Anniversary with a new movie in the alternate timeline started with 2009's Star Trek. Cutting to the chase, Star Trek Beyond is a very fun movie entirely worthy of the Star Trek name. While Beyond is not quite as strong as it's two predecessors (a controversial opinion, seeing as how Into Darkness is hated by most serious Trekkers), I did like Beyond an awful lot, and felt it was a perfect continuation of the story J.J. Abrams started back in 2009.At the start of Star Trek Beyond, the Enterprise crew is midway through their five year mission, and such a long stretch in space has worn down the crew, in particular Captain Kirk, played yet again by the exceptional Chris Pine. Of course this movie doesn't wallow in soul searching for two whole hours. These characters search their souls as they embark on a propulsive adventure in uncharted space, getting separated on an unknown planet by an alien warlord named Krall, with the crew of the Enterprise having to find each other and reunite in order to stop the threat that Krall poses to the Federation.This time about, because J.J. Abrams had to direct a little movie called Star Wars: The Force Awakens, he serves merely as a producer, and Fast &amp; Furious director, Justin Lin, takes over as director. As well, the screen writing duo of Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman are no longer with the franchise, with the same going for producer and Into Darkness screenwriter, Damon Lindelof. The new writing team of Simon Pegg (who once again portrays Scotty) and Doug Jung, prove that they know these characters inside and out. In a great many ways, the Enterprise crew is more faithful and lively here in terms of dialogue and characterization than they've been in any of the alternate timeline movies thus far, with Karl Urban's Bones getting the vast majority of the movie's best lines. Plus, Pegg and Jung deserve huge props for creating the new character Jaylah, a resourceful, tough as nails alien portrayed by a butt-kicking Sofia Boutella. Add on top of that Lin's action movie pedigree (especially in a scene where a swarm of bee-like spaceships bore into the Enterprise to tear it apart), and you get a very solid Summer blockbuster that is fun and action packed, but seems to be missing the special ingredient that made this movie's two predecessors so special to me.Honestly, I can't quite put my finger on why I feel this is the weakest of the three Trek movies in the alternate timeline. The energy is there, the cast continues to surpass the cast of the original series in my opinion, and there are plenty of fun moments to be had. So why do I feel this way? For me, I think it's two reasons. One, I think Idris Elba's bad guy, Krall, never gets enough explanation to how his strange powers work and how he amassed this large army to make him as strong of a villain as he could have been. And two, the movie simply lacks as many awesome, fist pumping, spine tingling moments as the two directed by Abrams. Part of this goes back to a slight disappointment I have in Michael Giacchino's musical score. I love Giacchino, and his themes for Star Trek are some of my favorites he's ever written, so for me to not feel like he utilized his themes as well as he had on the two previous movies, makes me sad. Of course, this is really me being a nitpicky fanboy, because as far as this movie being just a fun standalone adventure movie, there hasn't been any other blockbuster this Summer quite as strong as this one.Star Trek Beyond simply made me smile for the vast majority of its two hour runtime. When watching this movie, you get to spend two hours with characters you love, all getting along and working together towards a common goal. This is a rare feat in most of these team movies nowadays, as is evidenced by Captain America: Civil War and Batman v Superman. For some odd reason, most movie makers think we want to see our heroes arguing and fighting one another, but Beyond makes a strong case for unity above all else. None of the conflict in Star Trek Beyond comes from the relationships between the characters, and that is just a refreshing change of pace in this day-and-age where so many people the world over can't seem to ever agree on anything. While this is an action adventure movie, the future of Star Trek feels even more like a utopia than it usually does in this one, and I for one would love to live in the world of Star Trek. Honestly, I believe that's the true hallmark of great sci-fi or fantasy. Is it a world so fantastic I'd want to live in it? In this case, the answer is a resounding yes, especially as long as Kirk and the Enterprise crew are around to save the day.I give Star Trek Beyond an 8 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe third times really are the charm.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For one thing, there's Chris Pine as Capt. James T. Kirk. He's far less of an incorrigible smart-a** in this film than he was in the first two flicks. A little more disciplined. In fact, his Jim Kirk sounds even more world-wearier than Shatner's from STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN! And, in the real world, such emotional burn-out can be all-too plausibly devastating for people so chronologically young. Then, there's Zachary Quinto as Mr. Spock.His reaction over the death of the "other" Mr. Spock (the venerable Vulcan ambassador from an alternate "future") is one that's mentally echoed by all true fans of the original STAR TREK franchise over the past fifty years. In fact, as the ambassador, himself, might put it:"It is probably the one emotional reaction in the universe that is paradoxically quite logical."But, of course, it was Anton Yelchin's final performance, as young Mr. Chekov that drew the attention of everyone in the movie theater I went to see this at. Maybe it's just me. Yet, he seemed to be the one cast member, among these relatively still new-comers, to have settled into his decidedly classic role the most comfortably. Even more so than Quinto's Spock and the new Dr. McCoy, put together. And they had some of the wittiest dialogue in the film!The only reason I don't give this film a perfect ten, however, is that little bit of calendrical miscalculation during the recording of Jim's log entry at the beginning. Just multiply 365 times 3 if you want to catch my drift.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the Right Track, but Still Light Years to Go</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Ebert once said that the two items he expects the most from "Star Trek" are ideas and character development. I concur wholeheartedly. "Beyond" delivers enough of the latter item to elevate it well above the level of its two cinematic predecessors.Why use the word "elevate?" Well, I personally condemned the first two "AbramsVerse" films as un-Trek-like, addle-brained "Star Wars" rip-offs. But after having viewed "Beyond" earlier tonight, I can see that first-time Trek scribes Simon Pegg and Doug Jung have injected much more zing and humanity into the iconic characters we've grown to love over the past 50 years -- more zing and humanity than the first two films put together, I'd say.Amid "Beyond's" backdrop of phaser shoot-'em-ups, kickboxing-the- alien-bad-guy fights, starship holocausts and even motorcycle stunts (yes, MOTORCYCLE STUNTS in a Star Trek movie), we are treated to the more Earthly pleasures of the Kirk-Spock relationship. And McCoy's acerbic needling of Spock. And Kirk reflecting on how he lost his dad years ago. And Spock's reaction to the (off-screen) death of Spock Prime (Leonard Nimoy) is quite touching, as played by Zachary Quinto.All the actors in this Trek fold, in fact, seem to have grown in their roles this time around. The chemistry between them flows freely and is even ticklish at times. The Pegg/Jung script certainly has a better handle on characterization that the Orci team did.Unfortunately, the film does not succeed on every level (for me). Once again, the overall plot borders on comic book-level dramatics, with an over-wallop of Star Wars-type explosions. And in the middle of all? A flat-footed. boring villain who is bent on getting an artifact in Kirk's possession so he can use it to kill many innocent Federation citizens. Why? Well ... because.The talented Idris Elba is stuck with the neanderthal-like role of Krall, a ruthless "alien" who craftily lures Kirk &amp; Co. through a nebula into his home space. Once there, the Enterprise grapples with an immense army of "bees", which are thousands of one-man ships that end up pulverizing the Enterprise and capturing its crew, except for a few who end up on the planet below in escape pods (Kirk &amp; Chekov, Spock &amp; McCoy ... and Scotty).With the Enterprise literally being destroyed in the first 20 minutes, the movie then becomes a series of chases and fight scenes on Krall's planet, but those are still interspersed with some effective character moments involving Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Chekov and Scotty.So, anytime we see Krall or his storm troopers (my borrowed Dark Side word for his mindless henchmen) on screen, menacing or killing a poor hapless crewman or trying to do wrong, wrong, wrong things to Kirk and his mates, the movie becomes a generic actioner off the assembly line.By contrast, anytime we see Spock and McCoy trading barbs -- even bonding together when Spock thinks he might be dying -- the movie comes crackling to life. When we see Scotty forming a friendship with Jaylah, a native warrior-type girl on the planet, the film shows us how a Trek character can be a fun and entertaining counter-point to a simple-minded alien.That is why I found the opening minutes of the movie to be the most satisfying: Kirk is reciting his Captain's Log and during his voice-over, we see glimpses of these characters and the rest of the crew as the Captain describes how each of them is handling life in space. Soon after, we see Kirk and McCoy toasting a drink of whiskey (taken from Chekov's locker) celebrating James T.'s birthday.For me, it's a shame that Pegg and Jung (and director Justin Lin) didn't try to capitalize on more of the easy charm and heartwarming qualities that these characters can offer us. Instead, this film subjects us to more of the same sort of stuntmen-laden, CGI-drowned action that plagued the first two films ... that is NOT what Star Trek is all about.Ebert nailed it: Trek -- good Trek -- is ideas and character development. Obviously, these days, box office cash no longer comes from ideas, for sure. But character development? Absolutely. And this movie made more than a few baby steps in that very direction.Now if the next film can take giant strides in that same direction, we might have a pretty durn good Trek film -- for a change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Star Trek Beyond" is like walking around in a comfortable pair of old shoes, but a lot more fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At least once in your life, you've probably had a pair of shoes that you really loved and had for? a long time. They still looked cool and felt good and you didn't want to give them up even though they were getting pretty old. I mean, why get rid of them? They were comfortable? in more ways than one. Sure, you had to change out the laces more than once and maybe learned to live with a hole here or a scratch there, but they were YOUR shoes ? your FAVORITE shoes ? and you still enjoyed having them around.For many Movie Fans, the "Star Trek" franchise is a lot like that "favorite old pair of shoes". Just in time for the 50th anniversary of the original series' TV premiere, comes "Star Trek Beyond" (PG-13, 2:00), the 13th of the "Star Trek" films and the third one in the rebooted series which started in 2009. This one features a cast with which we've become comfortable (as they've obviously become very comfortable with each other) and keeps that "favorite old pair of shoes" marching forward by drawing on the sole (soul) of the original series' "five year mission, to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before." (Even though it's now "where no one has gone before" ? a slight change in wording for inclusiveness, but just as familiar, and just as comfortable.) "Star Trek Beyond" picks up in the third year of that five year mission begun at the end of 2013's "Star Trek Into Darkness". Just over half-way through their journey, the crew seems restless ? especially Capt. James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) who is seeking a promotion within Starfleet. Kirk's first officer, Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto), gets some news which also makes him reconsider his proper role in the universe ? and his relationship with their ship's Communications Officer, Lieutenant Nyota Uhura (Zoe Saldana). Chief Medical Officer, Lieutenant Commander Leonard "Bones" McCoy (Karl Urban) ends up providing comfort to Kirk and, ironically also to Spock, as Bones' favorite human and not-so-favorite Vulcan go soul-searching (not, I repeat, NOT a shoe reference). Of course, Chief Engineer, Lieutenant Commander Montgomery "Scotty" Scott (Simon Pegg) is along for his technical expertise ? and a generous dose of comic relief. Last, but certainly not least, back on the bridge of the Enterprise are Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu (John Cho) and Ensign Pavel Chekov (the late Anton Yelchin who died a month before the film's release).During a stop at a mammoth Federation outpost called Yorktown (looking like the futuristic set of 2015's "Tomorrowland" on steroids), the Enterprise gets sent on a mission to rescue the crew of a vessel that was supposedly disabled on the other side of a massive nebula. Kalara (Lydia Wilson), the alien who claims to be the only member of her ship's crew able to escape the crippled vessel and go for help, leads Kirk and company into a trap. A devastating attack on the Enterprise ends with the ship's officers and most of its crew stranded on the surface of a Class M planet, with some of them separated from each other. Scotty soon finds himself working with an alien scavenger named Jaylah (Sofia Boutella), who offers her help in locating his shipmates in exchange for his help in fixing the disabled ship in which she has been living. Meanwhile, Spock and Bones are stuck in the middle of nowhere (with Spock badly injured), while Kirk and Chekov are out and about looking for the rest of their shipmates, who are being held by a reptilian-like human (or is he a human-like reptile?) named Krall (Idris Elba) and his soldiers.Krall is after something Kirk has in his possession ? the missing component of a terrible biological weapon which Kirk thought was just an ancient artifact that he had been transporting as a peace offering from one alien civilization to another. With that setup, all that our favorite Starfleet troopers have to do is figure out who to trust and stay alive long enough to find each other on a previously unknown planet, keep Krall from assembling his weapon and get off that planet and back to the security of the Federation of Planets. Simple, right? Simple as breaking in a new pair of shoes! As our heroes try to do all of this, they come up with some typically creative solutions to seemingly impossible problems, there's a very good twist, and Movie Fans get to go for another walk in one of our favorite pair of shoes."Star Trek Beyond" is everything you'd want from a Star Trek film? more or less. The plot is fairly well-constructed, but keeps the main cast in separate locations for too much of the story. The script, by Pegg and Doug Jung (who also appears briefly on screen) overdoes the humor just a little, but it also features some nicely quotable lines. The direction by Justin Lin (he of the "Fast and Furious" franchise) gives us a nice balance of frenetic action and that good, old-fashioned bold, selfless Star Trek spirit. It would've been nearly impossible to top the last two Star Trek films and this one doesn't quite get there, but it comes close. It is worth putting on your favorite comfortable pair of shoes to go out and see it. "A-"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This went where the others haven't gone before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From its beginning "Star Trek Beyond" shows us how good movies are made. In a genre that has been largely ignored by people who evaluate movies and decide what is an example of great cinema, this one propels itself to the top of the heap, science fiction or otherwise. "Beyond" has learned from the previous entries. It doesn't have a boring moment, and it is built on a solid and entertaining script. The film explores important themes and originates from the one line that we have associated with "Star Trek" for 50 years now... to go where no man has gone before.The crew of the enterprise finds itself exploring a call for help near one of the latest Federation outposts, a dazzling city in the sky which is going to set the bar high for this type of film. The first 20 minutes of the movie are beautifully shot, with a combination of CGI and art decoration that shows movies can still inspire wonder and awe. I didn't think it was possible to show the Enterprise in new perspectives, but all of its glory is just a prelude for the second act, where its destruction is shown in a grand and detailed scale. When Kirk's team encounters the new enemy, we are treated to a mind blowing display of artistry. It is inspired by other films, but the execution this time is truly masterful. The damage unleashed upon the Enterprise is savage and painful to watch.Once the crew is split and stranded in different parts of a pretty hostile but breathtaking environment, we get to follow three teams of crew members trying to survive and defeat this apparently invincible villain. We get to see "Scotty" meet an amazon type warrior who has somehow managed to escape from the planet's prison. Her ingenuity and fighting skills become crucial in future events in the movie. With the help of Scotty and the place she calls her "house", we know there might be a chance for all involved.Kirk and Chekov have their own problems to deal with, and they are a special target for Krall since they have managed to hide a particular important artifact. Their adventures are the start of an amazing display of stunt work and spellbinding editing that will keep the audience on their toes. Some people might think the physicality of the movie overtakes what have become trademarks with the series: their sense of clever humour and their visionary approach to technology and science. We don't go deep into new scientific explorations, but it goes into the use of resources both old and new. Here teamwork becomes key to what might be their eventual success.The third team is the cleverest pairing of Bones and Spock, a dynamic that has worked since the series first entered public consciousness. The chemistry between the two actors is excellent, and the lines are effectively used, giving the audience some of the best movie moments. There's plenty of positive and exciting energy going here, as Spock becomes pretty vulnerable and gets a chance to explore his human side.Eventually, most of the enterprise team gets to fight together, and the action moves on the big climatic scenes. These are very good and compliment the rest of the film. I hardly believe anyone will complain about the film being long, and there is an emotional response to the references made to Nimoy, both in and after the film, and the sense of loss with the fact that Chekov will be greatly missed.This film is one of the most exciting and pleasant surprises of the year, a sequel that actually works and honors the sources and films that have come before, that has grown both in its visuals, its effects, and its heart keeps beating as strongly now as it did when it first burst into our galaxy. Here is the swan that came from that ugly duckling that was that preview, one that scared me into thinking imagination had surrendered to mindless entertainment. "Beyond" proves that cinema can still produce a sense of wonder in all of us, and it gives us faith that it is practically impossible to change the theater experience. For a while, I kept thinking of those big visual spectacles that Hollywood has given us such as "Lawrence of Arabia", "Star Wars" and "Mad Max", making think that there is still hope to go where no man has gone before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost no story, lots of action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked the 2 first "new" installments of the franchise, so I was eager to watch the newest one. In short, this is just an excuse for an Enterprise adventure. However, only disappointment came after doing so. Here's why:1) There is almost no story. A weak attempt to bring to the surface Kirk and Spock's self- doubt is barely used for the story, so in the end, it is all about just throwing a "bad guy" into the plot what holds the whole thing together, which is not enough. 2) The trigger for the Enterprise to enter a new adventure is just pointless: "So... Kirk, there's this woman who says that there is a stranded ship in a nebula close by, which is completely unexplored. Let's just trust her and get our ship into the nebula, because... why not?".3) The new character Jaylah is just random, it reminds me of new Star Wars characters, which are solely intended to add some "stuff" to the movie. She looks like a great fantastic alien character. Then, she encounters Scotty and with no prior contact, she decides to help the good guys. Hired on the spot. I mean... it's just too much for someone who has been living in a hostile planet for a while. But let it be for the sake of adventure.4) Some explanations are plain stupid. Jaylah is convinced to help them in a rescue mission just by being told: "hey, be brave". She was reluctant because "everybody who gets there, dies", and after being encouraged to be brave, she is up for the mission. Uh?Also, the bad guy, Krall, became "evil" out of boredom. And turns out that he managed to build a legion of powerful battleships that can tear the Enterprise apart with little effort. Still, he needed an ancient weapon to destroy the near Federation base... Bottom Line: I don't want to be too critic, it's only a random Enterprise adventure, just for the sake of it. Lots of CGI action, way too much in my opinion (and I DO like action).A few things were good to watch: the Bones &amp; Spock duo, the tribute to the old crew when Spock holds a picture of them, some jokes here and there. Entertaining, I guess. How could it have been better? Easy: work on the storyline. Add depth to the characters and situations. Dig deeper into Kirk's self-doubt, so you can get the feeling on how the captain was made. I think that real trekkies loved sci-fi situations that defy our mundane reality: time travelling, parallel worlds, etc.I'm surprised that so many people reviewed this so positively. Yes this could be entertainment, but it is also mindless video game like story with no depth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too little science, too much fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it's a generational thing. A young man I know loves this movie, but I found it to be only so- so. First of all, this is truly the first time I've ever watched a Star Trek movie when I found myself saying, "Huh"? What that means is that the screenplay writers didn't fill in all of the existing "holes" within this story. Let me give you an example. In one scene Kirk is creating a diversion so that his crew members can escape to safety. Although we know he's using some sort of holographic thingy to create false images of himself so that it appears there are many versions of Kirk on a bike instead of just his one physical form, how, in such a short amount of time does he manage to do this? Earlier in the movie, we've been shown how these holographic devices were used to camouflage a grounded space ship, but how would it be possible to use these same devices to create the illusion that there are many versions of the same man racing around on a motorcycle when there is really only one man? Those of us who are long-time sci-fi fans like to have a little more science in our sci-fi stories (or at least something that resembles science). But, the way they did this scene, the "science" of Kirk's holographic trickery was, to my mind, such an incredible impossibility that it would have been more believable if he'd suddenly come across Harry Potter's wand on a nearby rock and conveniently cast a spell for multiplying one's self. If you're going to introduce magic into a sci-fi story, great, but don't call it sci-fi. Call it fantasy. And call me a party-pooper, but--good gravy--how can anyone accept that a large space ship (the "Franklin") that crash-landed a hundred years before in an area covered with rocky cliffs can actually be made to fly off the planet with a little engineering "magic" by Scotty and his new exceptionally smart white-haired, striped-face female friend? Did Scotty also find Harry Potter's wand lying around somewhere? Folks, come on. With a little bit of tweaking to the screenplay, that part of the story could have been a bit less fantasy and more science-y. For instance, there could have been a small shuttle on the Franklin in a shuttle-bay area that was not severely damaged. And maybe Scotty and his white-haired, striped-faced "lassy" could have done some real engineering work to get the shuttle back up to snuff. Yes, I know, they would have had to return, eventually, to the planet to rescue the rest of the crew since a small shuttle wouldn't have been large enough to hold everyone, but it's not like the rest of the crew are key characters in this story--you only need enough room for the key characters to fly off the planet in order to save the day. And, yes, I also know that a small shuttle isn't as powerful as a larger ship, but, yet again, Scotty could have shown us an example of his extraordinary engineering skills (with the help of his new exceptionally smart friend, of course--the white-haired, striped-faced "lassy"). It really doesn't take much creativity to make a scene less fantasy and more science-y, even if the science is all wrong. It is always possible to create an illusion of science in just about any situation in a sci-fi story. When one resorts to magical fantasy, that is, in my opinion, sloppy writing. One last example of sloppy writing: When Mr. Evil gets sucked into outer space with his newly obtained Weapon of Mass Destruction (due purely to the stupidity of the Federation who decided to trust a total stranger, a non-English speaking female creature with a very weird looking head), why did they not retrieve this weapon and neutralize it? Is it because the writers are hoping to resurrect this weapon in another movie? As far as we know, in this particular fictional Star Trek universe, this incredibly destructive weapon is still traveling through space on a trajectory that's heading towards--gasp!--Earth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, saw this last evening and left the theater very disappointed.Hollywood becomes Bollywood. More, more, more. That is what Hollywood stands for these last 10 to 15 years.More explosions, more action, more CGI . Bigger is better is what they think. Refrase : bigger is more money in the pocket. What is it with Hollywood bosses that they fail time and time again in making a decent SF movie.Ask 1000 ST-fans what the best ST movie is and the outcome will be ST-II. And why ? Because there is tension. Tension, loss, great story. And this is missing completely in this latest movie. The longer it runs the more ridiculous it gets with action to the point it makes almost Superman look like Cartman. Please take a look at some episodes from Star Trek Enterprise. There are episodes with more tension then this movie. Take f.i. Anomaly or Harbringer in season 3. Now that is what I call top quality stuff.It seems to be normal these days that episodes being of any kind of genre are better than movies. The movie itself : the motorcycle scene: ridiculous and trying to be hip, other side of the Galaxy listening to the Beasty Boys - deeeuhhh . Falling into a trap so easy ? no check of information or probe ? Start up very easy of a junk starship ? The filming of most action scenes are handled badly- one can't cope all what is going' on or even detect who is who or where. If Leonard could see this- he might think " I could have done this better ". Oh what : we have to cope with it that Hollywood has become in fact Hollow-wood and will stay as such as long suckers like us remain stupid in going to stupid movies.Now let's wait for the next Disney SW with again some death-star.</fullReview>

Regrettably, there is too much C G I , which makes Beyond more like a video game than a movie. In a formulated matter, Beyond's story-line becomes another Bond like save the end of the world ending. The redundant unity message where everyone works together to solve a problem is stale. A plot twist would have spiced up the same old unity message.

		<shortDescription>Grand destruction of The Enterprise sequence and enough Trek derring-do will keep aficionados entertained</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Trek Beyond is the third installment in the reboot series featuring younger actors playing the same parts from the original TV series. Significantly, Justin Lin, an "action" director noted for his direction of Fast and Furious 3-6, has taken the helm with a script by Simon Pegg (who plays a terrific "Scotty") and Doug Jung.Lin starts us off with a refreshing, comic teaser of sorts?Kirk's gift to a group of dorky, mole-like aliens is met with derision and paranoia, leading Scotty to beam the fledgling ambassador back to the Enterprise before being mauled by these extraterrestrial miscreants. Kirk's log voice-over notes that there's a feeling of ennui sweeping the Enterprise, after three years of non-eventful scientific exploration. The big ship docks at the giant new Yorktown space station, reminiscent of Starfleet Academy based in a future San Francisco, but on a much grander scale. Before the inciting incident leads us to some very fine machinations at the beginning of the second act, we're brought up to date on what's been happening with the crew. Kirk puts in for a promotion to Vice Admiral, Spock's relationship with Uhura is on the outs and it's inferred that Sulu is gay (George Takei, the original Sulu from the 60s TV series, did not exactly appreciate the nod to his real-life persona). The Enterprise's long dull sojourn is interrupted when an alien sends a distress call, claiming that her ship is stranded on a planet inside a nebula. The rescue mission turns into an ambush, when Kirk and crew are attacked by the disaffected Krall (Idris Elba, unrecognizable in a lizard-like suit). Krall slings thousands of mini-ships that resemble a swarm of insects that shred the Enterprise into pieces. It's the best part of the film and Justin Lin shows off his chops as action-director extraordinaire. Kirk and a few of the principals flee in escape pods and the rest of the surviving crew members are taken hostage by Krall and his evil minions.The rest of the second act takes place on the planet where Krall is based. Krall can enhance his power to the umpteenth degree by getting a hold of an "Abronath," the relic which was part of Kirk's failed diplomatic mission at the beginning of the film. Pegg and Jung's script gives each of the principals something to do, conveniently pairing them off as both hostages and rescuers. While Sulu and Uhura and other crew members are taken hostage by Krall, the rest of the crew members must find a way to rescue them. Kirk and Chekov locate the wrecked saucer section of the Enterprise, only to discover that the alien, Kalara, that led them into the ambush in the first place, was working at Krall's behest. Despite claiming that she had no choice, since Krall was also holding her crew hostage, she ends up getting being crushed to death after Kirk activates the remaining functional boosters of the saucer, lurching it forward, in an attempt to escape Krall's men.Meanwhile the other pairings seek to re-unite with Kirk but must deal with a set of obstacles. In the case of McCoy and Spock, it's the latter's serious body wound that's slowing them down. And then Scotty must deal with Jaylah, a scavenger who sports some serious martial arts chops. To Scotty's delight, her makeshift home is the USS Franklin, an Enterprise vessel that disappeared 100 years earlier. Of course, he's able to fix it and when all the pairings re-unite, they're off to rescue the rest of the crew.Meanwhile, the dark moment of the second Act transpires when Krall threatens to kill Sulu and one of the crew members gives up the Abronath. This is the key piece to a super weapon that is able to disintegrate humans en masse.Unfortunately, the "rescue" plan pales in comparison to the earlier destruction of the Enterprise. Kirk, channeling his inner Steve McQueen, uses an old motorcycle found on the USS Franklin, and creates a diversion by riding into Krall's lair, accompanied by holographic projections of the vehicle. The Franklin is then able to get close enough to beam the hostages aboard including Sulu and Uhuru.Things get even more hokey when the crew figures out how to destroy Krall's swarm. Just like the Borg, the hive-like collective from the "Next Generation" series, the Swarm of ships is interconnected. All it takes is to play The Beastie Boys over an old VHF transmission channel after Spock and McCoy are beamed into one of the mini-vessels, and the big bad swarm is neutralized. Shouldn't have they thought of that earlier?Soon the good guys learn that Krall is actually the former commander of the USS Franklin after examining the ship's log. He's survived for so long after finding an alien process of prolonging life on the home planet. Krall's gripe is that the Federation was too wimpy for him. He's a stand-in for a right winger gone rogue (an Oliver North type morphing into Reinhard Heydrich) and despised the idea of his bosses making peace with their dreaded enemies, the Romulans. What's more, he blamed the Federation for failing to rescue him and his crew after they got stranded on the planet that became his home base.Armed with his super weapon, Krall intends on using it on the Yorktown. Krall is finally able to assume human form after sucking in the energy from the Enterprise crew. I won't detail the climax except to say it involves a physical confrontation between Krall and Kirk, and guess who wins? Star Trek Beyond never rises to the level of a great picture in the series, The Wrath of Khan, but it does feature that fantastic destruction of the Enterprise sequence. All too often, there are too many convoluted explanations for successful plot outcomes but the basic Star Trek derring-do is extant enough to keep aficionados sufficiently entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Trek Beyond feels a little like an obligatory third installment of the rebooted franchise. Luckily, unlike many of these installments, it isn't terrible - in fact it's quite enjoyable. The villain is definitely forgettable (Idris Elba feels a little wasted) and the story-line certainly isn't as engaging as the other two reboots but it is good. In the way that this film feels more reminiscent of the original Star Trek it also loses some of the nuances of the new movies. While the first film revolved around Kirk's journey into Starfleet and the second involved his growth as a Captain, this film falls somewhat flat when it comes to character development. Having said that, the film is fun and I would say worth watching. It's lighthearted and easy to watch with some great dialogue, a few laughs and some brilliant action sequences. Also, many characters who felt a little left out of the last film were given great scenes - Bones and Spock is an especially fun duo to watch.Despite the films problems it's clear to see that this film is meant to be fun and lighthearted. While you won't leave the cinema absolutely blown away, you will feel entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trekkies will love it. Respect for Leonard Nimoy in the film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This might be one of those films that is better in 3D. Many of the action scenes have very fast camera movement and at time like the camera is shaking. I am sure that it is more to enhance the 3D moments. I am not a 3D fan so I saw it in normal mode. The audio is fine, and there are occasional jokes and humor. There are more than a few moments of respect for the original Spock during the film. There is even a moment where they show a photo found taken of the original (famous) crew of the Enterprise. This is one I will own eventually so I can re-watch it and rewind it as needed. I own all the the Trek films so I will own this one too. This bring one a new villain that we all learn to hate. Interesting where we learn where the villain came from though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great and redeeming 3rd part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Admittedly, when I read that Justin Lin was the director, I expected it to be Fast and Furious set in space. Actually, it was quite the opposite and was a more coherent plot than Into Darkness.The character development was great, with each character having clearly grown from the last movie and showing self-awareness and humility, Pine's Kirk being a shining example of this. In general, the film showed awareness of the impact of the large-scale destruction, as opposed to the previous offerings which did seem to skirt over them a little.The pacing was excellent, the concepts were fantastic and the special effects were amazing - the attack on the Enterprise was very immersive and I especially enjoyed the closing shot of the new Enterprise being built in faux-time lapse. That was a clever and unique idea that hasn't been used in any film I've seen before.The sets felt very tangible and you definitely got a feel for the scale of the locations.Unfortunately I didn't feel that Krall's motivation was especially clear. Whilst Elba played a very formidable villain, it seemed like things had escalated too quickly with him, and that Yorktown was only built there a plot feature and not some well-established environment like many of the planets featured in the previous films.Moreover, I was left scratching my head as to why Krall would go from having a cockney accent as a human to having an African accent when he became more alien? As always, it's amazing the things that Kirk and the main crew can survive that would otherwise vapourise the redshirts or any other mere mortal, including (but not limited to) sliding off a near-vertical Enterprise onto solid rock from a height of at least 200 feet and not sustaining any injury; managing to hang onto the interior of a space ship whilst the seemingly physically stronger villains are sucked into the vacuum of space; surviving impalement on a rusty piece of space metal (that miraculously missed a vital organ by mere centimetres) from a foreign planet and being able to hike around a mountainous terrain with only a red hot spike to cauterise the wound; and of course surviving various explosions, being thrown or falling into/onto solid metal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3rd act spoils a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Star Trek 3' is the first of the three 'Star Trek' reboots that is not directed by JJ Abrams. This film is helmed by Justin Lin who previously directed many of the 'Fast &amp; Furious' films (of which I have not seen). After seeing this film I can honestly say that I am glad we got a fresh perspective for this third installment. My main issues with the previous two mainly had to do with some of the action execution and, most importantly, the complete reliance on conveniences. Especially 'Into Darkness' which I have taken to calling "Lucky Break, The Movie". I am happy to say that 'Beyond' has the restraint to hold these conveniences to a bare minimum. Most of it plays out with actions moving the plot forward. It made the experience feel much more genuine than having to say, "Wow, that's was incredibly lucky" over and over again. I was glad to be surprised with where the plot went from time to time. The combination of a new writer and director really helped sell this movie more than it probably should have. While I had doubts initially, I think Justin Lins direction was actually better than Abrams in many ways.The biggest being in the action scenes. Of which, there are many. This film moves at an incredibly brisk pace having action scene after action scene until it ended. And Lin handled them very well. The camera was rarely ever hand held. Which meant that each action scene that took place was easy to follow and utilized pretty good stunt work. Rather than endlessly shaking or employing an abundance of cuts. Just like the other two movies, the effects were also superb. Watching the Enterprise being torn to shreds was legitimately thrilling. Having a movie like this, where we know that the main characters are very likely to survive, the wide scale destruction actually gave these scenes some tension. The downside is that the villain at the center of it all was very two dimensional. For ninety percent of the run time you neither understand his motives nor feel threatened by him. It isn't until the last twenty or so minutes that we can feel anything for him. And even when we do, the last act that follows us learning this information completely derails the film.Not only do we not understand our villain but his plan is so convoluted and strange that it's nearly impossible to understand. His "weapon" is needlessly difficult to understand and it's in this act that we get some real conveniences and plot devices. The entire last thirty minutes made me go, "HUH? WHAT?" more than either or the previous two films. And to be honest, it basically ruined the whole movie for me.Yet, something that was strange was the vastly different tones between this film and the last two. Not only is this one much darker but it takes characters in new directions that sometimes don't make a lot of sense. Take our beloved captain Kirk for example. Who in the previous films was constantly on the hunt for women and wise cracking along the way. Neither of these things make an appearance in this film. Which made Kirk feel like an entire different person to the one we know and love.While the new hands certainly made a clear difference, I can't say that this was any better or worse than the others. It fixes many of the issues the others had but simultaneously created new, even more obvious mistakes. It's a fun movie set at a brisk pace with the cast and sound track remaining great, but I could hardly call the film as a whole great, or even good. It's over long, has a less than compelling villain, and has a third act that neither makes sense nor offers anything that isn't completely predictable. While I think I enjoy this one more than the other two, I can't say that it's much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Trek Beyond - Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Trek Beyond may not be the best space voyage for many, but it's a great summer film if you're only looking for a fun silly time at the movies.The energy, the character's and the bold scope are the things that makes Beyond watchable. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and the rest of the cast are all fantastic in the roles. And this actually feels like an actual Star Trek movie and not a full on remake like "Into Darkness" was. All thanks to Justin Lin.If only the editing and the villain was improved then this would have gotten a stronger rating. I didn't think the villain was terrible or anything like that, but it was a waste of Idris Elba. I mean, yeah his motivations are relieved at the climax of what he's trying to do and it kinda makes sense. The villain himself wasn't that interesting to me.Overall rating: Star Trek Beyond is right up there with "X-Men: Apocalypse" as the most fun I had at the cinema. While I liked the first movie a lot more, I still think this a solid third entry to this new franchise.Rest in piece Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin. Live long and prosper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nothing exemplary, just another addition to the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start with this, "I'm a big fan of space movies, Star Trek(the original part-1) is one of my favorites".The story just starts with Captain Kirk leading his own USS enterprise; when he decides to address a distress call in one of the nebulae. He jumpstarts on a rescue mission. Well, that right there isn't a strong storyline for such a renowned star trek series, while it could have, if the story had developed with some interesting complexities.The CGI effects in my opinion just fall short of making viewers experience the grandeur of the USS enterprise or dread the haunting desolation of the deep space nebulae system, through which uss maneuvers.The characters are under-developed in terms of lasting thought that they leave on viewers. When I watched "Star Trek (I)", the dialogues kept ringing in me for few days. the dialogues simply jiggled the bones, i.e when Cpt. Pike says "your father was captain of a Starship for 12 minutes. He saved 800 lives, including your mother's and yours. I dare you to do better." It is these small things that I believe makes a movie great and worth watching. In fact, I'd rather say, since, the original part-I, none of the sequel installments have done justice to the name, "Star Trek".The storyline is just plain vapid, i.e. "enemy attacks, ward/fight them off" in short. You think I'm being critical here ?, compare it to the layers of time-travel, Romulans destroying planets of the federation (Vulcan), Spock and Spock encounters, from bar-fight to USS enterprise training sessions of Kirk,.. the amazing list simply goes on in part-I.Although it might be a disappointment for hard-core fans, it's anyday an entertaining watch.</fullReview>

The third and latest however was much improved.Action from start to finish, pretty much, despite some pretty averagely done fight scenes, it was very enjoyable. Probably because they didn't throw in some stupid blow-the-science- of-star-trek kinda things (like teleporting half way across the galaxy onto a warp speed star ship in the first, or the ability to bring anyone back from the dead in the second).I say enjoyable in a mindless kind of way, the story has holes of course, but hey its Start Trek.I was aghast however, half way through the movie, someone behind me turned to their friend and said "i much prefer star trek to star wars" !!! i mean....seriously ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>J.J. Abrams now making both Franchises look the Same.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose you can't blame Abrams when he said he wanted Star Trek to feel like Star Wars (fun action). He succeeded so well that he was hired to do the Star Wars reboot. But now both franchises under his guidance are starting to look and feel the same. Same story structure where characters pair up and head off on their own simultaneous adventures, with their story arcs bringing them together for the big showdown. Same action beats, same character interactions, and more obviously, same emphasis on the expanded universe - new worlds with new alien races. We have a tribal heroine that can resemble the heroine in Avatar (gee gawd that movie is SEVEN years old), but feels like the Rey character awakening in SWTFA. It may come as part of his resume for Justin Lin to up the action quotient (lots of running and karate style fighting). But talk about expanded worlds. A Deep Space Nine-style utopian city in space is exhilarating to explore. The intersecting skylines echo scenes from "Inception". It is called the Yorktown, but it is large floating city with a central gravity source, and avenues spiraling around it. It rivals the spinning hotel in "2001" in it's beauty and intricacy (although much of the actual CGI is dodgy, I didn't care). I really enjoyed the extended sequences involving this new city (that is not San Francisco or London or New York or Washington or Paris or we've run out of big cities to destroy). But it made me wonder how the movie "Tomorrowland" had only a scant glimpse of a similar utopian city, but still cost a whopping 190 million to make. Here Star Trek 13 cost 185 million and gives a larger universe as the backdrop for this fast paced actioner. Abrams can be credited for getting the Star Wars formula correct. I think his reboot, using the very first Star Wars as the template, successfully breathed life back into that franchise. Likewise with Star Trek. For instance, clocking this thing in at 120 minutes was not just how long the length of the film happened to be, it was a predetermined requirement. Remember that exhaustion you felt when watching "Batman V Superman" when a brand new villain appeared near the end of the film, causing the film to drag on and on? Here, crisp pacing keeps things exciting, with the roller coaster ride coming to end without overstaying it's welcome. I like how the focus is less on Kirk and Spock and more on the ancillary characters. Bones, for instance, has a meatier role this time. Scotty (Simon Pegg - who had a hand in writing the screenplay) finally has a chance to utter the famous "I'm giving her all she's got" in his heroic exploits. When I was a kid, I would envision large scale action scenes, influenced by the Irwin Allen disaster movies of the 70s. J.J. Abrams certainly must have those ideas (think of the extended mega train crash sequence in "Super 8"), and crashes the Enterprise, similar to the big finale in "Star Trek: Generations". But in this film that is only the first act. Like playing with large toys, later scenes involving large ships that smash into mountains and buildings and perform crazy feats, makes the actions scenes feel like they were designed by an 8 year old. I played with my toys like that when I was 8, so I think it makes this movie all the more fun. And no more scenes shot in beer factories! I got to say that as much as the filmmakers convinced themselves that making believe that a beer brewery could ever resemble the inside of a space ship from hundreds of years in the future, they were deluded by the commercial tie-ins. No, the beer vats always looked like beer vats and never anything else. Although the action scenes were written with 8 year olds in mind, the movie opens with a examination of our characters as they are normally, instead of always in crisis mode. Spock learns and mourns the death of his future self, a scene I think could have tried better to show how that could mess with your mind. The dour mood of the beginning of the movie, made so even more by the dour music, gives our characters a chance to reflect as we join them. We find out that they are already 2 and half years into their 5 year journey. I was a little surprised about that leap forward in time, as that meant that their journey into the unknown was already halfway done and left less opportunities for further adventure in their 5 year exploration. Also there are larger doses of humour, something that helped both franchises recently, and part of what made BVSDOJ and it's absence of humour such a downer. So now to talk about the big climax. It is ridiculous. It takes artistic license to dumb down the big technological solution to vanquish the enemy. Without providing spoilers. I thought it was as silly as "Mars Attacks". Yet, "Mars Attacks" was an intentionally goofy movie. It also was a bomb and not considered one of Tim Burton's better films. So I would recommend this 13th outing in the Star Trek franchise, especially to any Star Wars junkies. There was an interesting moment at the end in remembrance of both Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin, where the screen stayed blacked while a piece of music played (in lieu of a moment of silence).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond the Other Two - Maybe?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Trek Beyond is a decent movie. It is not a great movie and not the type of movie that a Star Trek fan would anxiously be awaiting to add to their collection.Simon Pegg had written a decent script. A script that did the "right" thing and brought McCoy back to the forefront. The past two movies ignored McCoy and by slighting McCoy the previous films could not capture the heart and soul of the original characters. Karl Urban is perfect as McCoy and he captures the essence of DeForest Kelley. Urban brings back the soul of Leonard McCoy from the original series. Pegg had written the McCoy character very well.Chris Pine is better as Kirk in this movie and (I disliked him in the first two) I actually liked his portrayal of James T. Kirk in this movie. I enjoyed his banter with McCoy and Spock and felt that there was a spark that reminded me of the original trio. I hope that this spark continues in future episodes.Spock still is terrible. It is not the performance - it is the script. Spock is supposed to be the logical, and scientific, adviser to Kirk while McCoy is the human, emotional, and virtuous adviser. From the first film (with this crew) they missed big time on Spock and it continues to this film. The love interest with Uhura takes away from the essence and wonder of Mr. Spock - in the past when his human half emerged it was something to celebrate - now it is just there.Bringing Uhura to the starring role, over McCoy, was a big mistake. It was a political move, rather than having a more interesting character. In the original films Uhura had a thing for Scotty and I feel that the original relationship (Uhura and Scotty) would have been more interesting and allowed for Spock to fit the role that his character was meant to fill.Pegg does a nice job as Scotty and provides a humorous side to the series that we had seen in a couple of the movies. In this film, Scotty has a well fleshed out character with very interesting moments and dialogue.Sulu and Chekov are background characters in this film. There just isn't screen time for everyone.The negatives are: the enemy (Krall) is just not that menacing. No one has been able to match the power of Khan (either version) in the Star Trek galaxy. Krall is more of an annoyance than an enemy that would strike terror into the hearts of the Federation. The "unveiling" of who Krall really is lacked any type of punch and was disappointing.The super negative is the directing. It is all over the place and shoddy. A Star Trek movie deserves more than a third rate Fast and Furious director who has no clue how to stage a scene or how to keep scene congruent. Scenes jump all over the place and in some places feel incoherent. There are way too many dark (hardly any lighting) scenes where it is hard to see the characters or the sets. Justin Lin was a poor choice for director and I believe with a better director combined with Pegg's script would have created one of the better Star Trek movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action, cool sci-fi, great acting, average story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Trek Beyond is an entertaining extension to the two movies that shows us some of the same character chemistry and action as in the previous two, but fails to provide the kind of original development of story and style that we saw in Into Darkness. In terms of the basic movie experience you get, little new is introduced, with the exception of more action on the ground than in space. Rather, the character chemistry is recycled along with the humor (Spock and Bones scenes). It's still fun to see the same guys in new situations as the acting is great and dialogue does not especially disappoint. However, what made the previous two movies so much better was that all of this took place in a coherent storyline accompanied by determined and vicious villains. In Beyond , the motives of the villain seem unclear even by the end of the movie and his presentation, despite attempts to make him look intelligent, lacks the kind of originality as in the case of Khan and instead, his entire character looks rather clich. And despite seeing the good characters, their personal stories are not really developed in any significant manner and by the end of the movie, all of them seem quite in the same spot as they were in the beginning of the movie, or even in the end of the first movie. To sum up, Beyond feels like a necessary sequel that was made just so we could see more of the old characters in action, but as a stand alone movie, it lacks the originality to make it memorable. Conclusion: entertaining, but forgettable.</fullReview>

It actually had the Star Wars elements in it, plus the old actors coming back was really nice and all in all I enjoyed it more than this so called "Star Trek".I'm not saying it was a bad movie but it was a bad "Star Trek" movie.

		<fullReview>Star Trek in any incarnation confounds me; I cannot understand the appeal without getting depressed about the low level of cinematic and narrative challenge some audiences require. But these days I am interested in smoke, water and the special effects that have devolved from them. We find them in a great many special effects movies these days. Here we have two instances that I've considered in some depth.The first is something described as a swarm of thousands of spacecraft. They are supposed to share some sort of 'collective intelligence' guided by our super villain. Let's skip over the corny idea that this intelligence is shared over frequency that can be disrupted by broadcasting old rock. What interests me is the visual conventions chosen.This isn't a swarm in the usual sense of the word; it is a directed formation of medium sized craft. I'm not sure why they need pilots unless there is a fighting mode that is not centrally computed that we did not see. Nor is it clear why the bad guy barks orders as if it matters that they hear. And why build this armada if there are no ships that ever come, and the super weapon is supposed to be superior?Skip over all that as well. What they chose was to use a basic spring model where each ship is connected to its neighbors by an invisible elastic band with delayed force and a minimum distance. This is often used to crudely and cheaply emulate bird flocks.Then they simply designated certain ships as agents to pull their comrades, allowing for a tentacle-like menacing and cutting effect. The editing was good, so you got some rush of motion just from the shifting camera, but the effect was profoundly simple. in sophistication, it matched the rubber masks typical of the franchise.The second effect was of the first few seconds of a presumed biological weapon powerful enough to eradicate planets. We didn't see much here but the effect was the typical animated smoke, nothing at all like what we've seen, for example in Prometheus or the fireflies in Guardians. It couldn't have been for lack of money, talent or excellent examples, and that is the depressing thing.</fullReview>

You get Star Trek Beyond...The unveiling of the villain, the over the top comical action scenes... Fighting the villain by dropping the bass to your all time favorite pop song...Scooby Scooby doo! Maybe there was a little Gilligan's Island thrown in there too. Where as the movie is fun in it's own way.. It's not really as promised Star Trek returning to it's ethos...For stupid people who watched the original for explosions and never appreciated the subtext and deeper meaning of the OS... a few photographs of the original cast members and references to the Prime universe were thrown in...But that hardly captures the essence of what Star Trek was, simply by being reminded of it on occasion... It's just a nod.Chris gave a decent Kirk performance, and the rest of the cast still gave their forced, over the top impersonations of their Prime characters...Granted the films were never that deep or complex... this film works even further backwards in that respect. Waste of my time, hollow experience, shallow... clich characters, clich character arcs.... nothing at all original, nothing inspiring or truly thought provoking... nothing really all that relevant.If you're looking for narrative depth, character development of more than the shallowest and most predictable kind, or any type of thought provoking references to our modern times... this isn't the movie for you.A mostly bland, generic experience... with the Star Trek name. The only thing it did new was make a Scooby Doo Star Trek hybrid.I'm not going to rate it a 1 out of 10 because it's not a horrible movie, but as a Star Trek movie I'm going to just give it a 5...I can't hate it that much, after all we are getting a TV series set in the prime universe... At least dumb trek doesn't have to redefine what Star Trek is anymore, at least hopefully...The movies weren't ever that smart, thought provoking but Dumb Trek is going no where and adding nothing to the franchise... This movie was about on part with X Men 3 to me... not terrible but it makes some horrific decisions and it's something you can't forget but you know you don't really need to watch more than once. You can see how others enjoyed it, but you're pretty sure that it's not really worth watching again yourself and probably never will.The films message about unity, it's nods to the original, and its own merits are all that warrants a 5 our of 10...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a big Star Trek fan, I haven't seen the original movies or the series and it hasn't been a big part of my life. I just really like the first two J.J. Abrams reboot movies so I was excited to see this one.I didn't give it a 6 or a 6.5 but a 7 because it doesn't have dumb or boring scenes that I don't care about. But all in all the film is nothing special, it's decent, it's OK and it has problems.Most of the special effects are really good but there was a few times where the CGI looked bad. There's a lot of action scenes where the camera is moving too fast and it's messy so you can't really see what's going on. And there are some scenes where the dialogue and the comedy just don't work. The performances were very good, Idris Elba as the villain is OK but you have to wait until the end to really figure out his characters motivation. What bothered me is that some of the characters were really unused while some of them got way too much screen time. The movie also rehashes elements from the previous films.In the end I was expecting something more, it just turns out like any other film. It's also very predictable. Even though it is fun and entertaining to watch so I do recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost in Space (But Solid Footing on the Ground)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(RATING: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;? out of 5)THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: This latest version is literally more focused when on the ground than in the air. GRADE: B- SYNOPSIS: When a distress signal from a remote planet is received by a space station only the USS Enterprise can answer it. Trouble, of course, ensues..JIM'S REVIEW: Let me begin my review with a confession: I have never been a Trekkie. As a teenager, I never quite understood the cult following that grew into a nationwide phenomena. The T.V. show had laughable effects, its plots strained credibility, and the acting was merely adequate, except for Leonard Nimoy as the beloved Commander Spock. The positive sci-fi message for me had an opposite effect on me. &#xfffc;The film franchise has been a mixed blessing for me. Although vastly improved in its special effects department, and its casting upgraded, the big screen versions provided fine entertainment values with the popcorn as further enticement. The late two outings, under director J.J. Abrams, were the series' most highly successful ventures...well-made sci-fi yarns rather than yawns. (In fact, the 2013 film, Star Trek: Into Darkness, was terrific entertainment and made my Top Ten list for that year.)Star Trek Beyond begins with our captain, James T. Kirk, filled with self-doubt and aimless, lost in his own thoughts and contemplating if he wants to continue his space duties. That is, until he is given a rescue mission which interrupts his unwarranted sulking. So it's off he goes, past the second star to the right, with his faithful crew who are also going through their own personal dilemmas.&#xfffc;This year's final entry, (who am I kidding?), under its capable but less imaginative director Justin Lin (of Fast and the Furious fame), brings his trademark fast and furious style to these proceedings, with a full adrenaline rush than almost ruins the film whenever the action set pieces come into play. Most sequences are dark, murky, and choppy, with the majority of the action obscured by frenzied editing and jumpy in-your-face photography by Stephen F. Windon. The film seems caught in its own warp speed, unable to settle down to tell its tale. When an action film cannot show the action, something is off. (Director Lin is far more successful in the film's quieter moments.)&#xfffc;Fortunately, the film does have its assets: The CGI and set production design is consistently strong. Its upside-down city (of Louisville? What a lame name!) is fun to observe, although it owes a lot to Christopher Nolan's visionary film, Inception. The acting is fine and its cast highly likable. The literate script by Simon Pegg (Scotty in the film) and Doug Jung, involving the personal relationships of the USS Enterprise crew, is far more interesting and complete than all the crash and burning mayhem surrounding them. The humor and gentle remarks are particularly refreshing and add volumes to the characters.Chris Pine and Zachary Quito reprise their parts and continue to bring nuanced layers to their roles. Karl Urban is a standout as Bones, and Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, John Cho,and the late Anton Yelchin give strong support. Sofia Boutella plays a new character, Jaylah, and makes her a memorable addition to the series. However, Idris Elba as the villainous Krall is a second-rate baddie than never achieve true menace status. He's mean but meaningless as well.&#xfffc;Star Trek Beyond, the third of its newest entry and Chapter 13 in the entire film series, is not bankrupt of clever ideas but the movie plays it too safe. It doesn't boldly go where no film has gone before. It still entertains, but it is more of the same, with less of the style and charm that has gone before it. Like its brooding lead character, Star Trek Beyond gets lost in space a bit before reaching a satisfying conclusion.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Few expectations bring a lot of surprises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My deepest apologies for the lack of grammar and prompting structure.Sci Fi and Fantasy are my favorite genres, movies/TV- shows/books/communities. I stopped watching trailers and reading previews many years ago because they tended to spoil the good parts and cinemas tended to repeat them a lot before the movie started, the positive is that I have little to no expectations which makes my movie experience really good/bad/average depending on the quality of the movie.I judge the films based on the following areas, Q: Is the story good? Does it fit in the genre, is it connected to the previous movies/TV-shows? A: There are one major story regarding junior James T. Kirk, a side story that wraps it up SPOILER! Frankling, and two minor stories regarding Spook and Jaylah. Overall I think they are good, adds several elements that feeds a wide spectrum.Q: How did the actors/actresses preformed? Do I connect with them? A: There are plenty of brilliant people in this movie both minor and major characters but they did there part all from humor, compassion, nostalgia and some excitement.Q: What feelings do the music give me and is it supposed to be this feeling in scenario x? A: As stated by other reviews, the music was used correctly and I think my senses reacted as it was suppose to do.Q: Do the time fly by or did it feel like I have been here for hours? A: For me, those two hours felt like a normal 30-45 min episode so good job on that part.So what do the movie lack? Well it felt like each species encountered had more or less no background story, Simon Pegg proved once again the difference between actors and play-actors. The movie have plenty of human reactions walking on a thin line to cross over to drama. Sofia Boutella character Jaylah was mysterious for 3-6 min in the movie and suddenly "it" was once of us, more character development please. All of Krall's followers were they human or mixed species?I believe 8 out of 10 is a fair score for this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars never really did much for me. I was always a much bigger Star Trek fan so I was anticipating this much more than The Force Awakens . This the first of the rebooted films that isn't directed by J.J Abrahams so it was always going to be interesting to see if Justin Lin could follow in J.J's footsteps. The film was definitely enjoyable . It was absolutely jam packed full of action , so much so that it felt a little too frenetic at times. It's also quite dark . Literally . Many of the scenes do not feel lit enough so it was hard to see what was actually happening. I loved the continuing character build up , especially with Bones and Spock . It's amazing how these actors feel like a seamless continuation of the original cast. The story isn't without gaping plot holes but that doesn't take away from what is two hours of pure Starfleet adrenalin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drop Back Into Exploration, but Not As Exciting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Space, the final frontier, a line that continues to repeat over the years in one of the most popular science fiction movies to grace entertainment. Less than a decade ago, J.J. Abrams decided to reset the series and open up a new universe in the Star Trek universe that led to a lot of controversy. This weekend the third installment of this series has warped into our theaters this weekend and I assembled a crew to journey into the unknown and report our findings, (aka a review). So bold up, get set, and read up on my review of Star Trek Beyond. The GOOD? A true Star Trek adventure ? Beautiful special effects ? Comedy that kills ? Great actingAs mentioned by a few fans, Beyond drops back from the federation centered tales and returns back to exploring the unknown. Beyond drops back into the exploration of nebulae, running from CGI crafted natives, and facing technological warfare that always seems to be deadly to extras. As Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and his crew are dropped into the seemingly abandoned world, you get pulled into the nostalgic voyages made famous all those years. While some of the wild live and environmental hazards are a bit lacking, this adventure focuses on what the crew must do to complete their mission with the most members possible. Just like the Star Trek episodes of yore. How this adventure is brought to life is of course due to the special effects department. Once again Abrams use of special effects is top of the line, blending live special effects with the computer generated magic. Al of the space stations, starships, and stunt work are incredibly animated, flowing into sequences that are somewhat exciting and worthy of the silver screen. The alien world as well holds the same magic, and feels like a Star Trek landscape, albeit a little more simplified and unimaginative than some of the other places we have visited. Regardless the special effects will certainly be the wow factor to the audience members and will help break up some of the mundane parts of the movie. My friends and I agreed though that the most entertaining feature was the comedy in this movie. Kirk gets a few laughs in here, but Pine's character takes a more serious role in this installment, but his well timed snipes got a chuckle from the audience. Scotty the ever angry/irritated engineer still brings the laughs with his irate venting rants and Simon Pegg's delivery to maximize the enjoyment factor. But it is the dynamic duo of Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Bones (Karl Urban) that really had me in stitches. Spock's neutral stating of the obvious and his failures in love provide enough ammunition for the good doctor to bash with it. The constant bickering between the two continues to evolve which leads to great character development and dialogue that continues to remain funny throughout the two hours. But as I mentioned, none of this would have been possible without the insane acting abilities and fantastic deliveries of our acting cast. The BAD ? The lack of danger/challenge ? An almost pointless plot deviceIt was somewhat hard to find faults in this movie for me, but one thing was the lack of challenge our heroes faced in this movie. Think about the Star Trek saga, our crew gets pulled into some crazy situation and it takes every ounce of energy to penetrate, attack, or defend their target. In this movie, both enemy and hero had too easy a time accomplishing their goals. Our crew snuck into places without much resistance, and even when their presence was known the confrontation was a little too one sided and quite poorly executed. Therefore the movie was a little on the boring side for me at times, or at least dull to say the least. It was missing the adrenaline rush and suspense of the second movie, which must have been traded in order to achieve the adventure part of the movie. Even newcomer Jaylah was a bit lackluster, with her combat stances and speeches more impressive than the skills she displayed. And despite the visual effects, the blaster fire was colorful, but seemingly pointless in the ship-to-ship battles. Oh well, number four may be able to correct this?if there is a number four. In terms of the plot, the movie is pretty sound and focuses a lot on character development than anything else. Don't get me wrong?this is a good thing, but I was still hoping to have a bit more in terms of action/suspense balance to keep me engaged in the tale. Krall's (Idris Elba) goal in this movie was almost pointless, his path to revenge centering on a trinket that almost pointless in the grand scheme of things. There was little strategy, and again struggle, to implementing this device and as such I found the central plot of this movie a tad daunting. The VERDICTNevertheless despite these weaknesses, Beyond's delivery is solid. The visual effects craft a wonderful world for our crew to explore and the cast certainly looks the part on all fronts. The biggest strength is certainly the actors bringing characters that we love to an even deeper self, and the comedic punch many provide gives you the laughs. However, I don't think this one reached the level that Into the Darkness did, especially in terms of excitement and suspense. This reviewer though has to recommend a visit to the theater for this one though, and was the best of the three I saw. My scores:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a bit of Star Trek spirit again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With rather low expectations after the last two movies, I went into the theater and was actually pleasantly surprised. The exchange of script writer and director really was to the movie's benefit. You can tell that Simon Pegg, who wrote the script, is a fan of the old Trek and tries his best to bring back at least a bit of what made the old series and some of the old movies great.There is still lots of fancy Abrams-style action (which can be enjoyable), but this time it is balanced out by quiet and slower moments for each character to be explored, for team working, for thinking and solving problems with one's wits and not (just) with a phaser. The climax of the movie is an example of this.Also the Kirk-Bones-Spock triangle from the original series is put more in focus again, after Bones being put aside in the last movies in favor of Uhura. She on the other hand feels a little more redundant this time, but every crew member gets their moment of course. The villain isn't explored in too much detail though and the final revelation is not totally satisfying. Sofia Boutella's bad-ass character is a refreshing addition to the cast, she and Pegg bring a lot of humor into the movie. There are again a lot of references to the other series and movies (a ship from the "Star Trek: Enterprise" era; a planet that hints a bit at the TOS paper rock sets; the Enterprise in "Search for Spock" and "Generations") and this time they don't just feel like fan service, but do actually make sense in the plot. It is also nice how Leonard Nimoy's real life passing is mirrored in the movie.Some call this an expensive TOS TV-episode and they are partially right. But that is actually a good thing, because Star Trek was always best on the small screen, when it tried to tell stories about exploration, science, working together across boundaries and settling things diplomatically if possible. But even though "Beyond" does a better job than its two predecessors, it is still a long way to how Star Trek was in the old series. But let's also remember that most of the old movies where more action orientated and/or featured a villain instead of a scientific or cultural problem like in the TV shows. Overall, if you had your problems with the new movies as I did (though I could still mostly enjoy them as popcorn movies), give this one a chance.Score as a Star Trek story: 6/10Score as an (action/popcorn) movie: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain's log Star date 2207.2016, today I was the proud viewer of the latest Star Trek film: Star Trek Beyond, which was a most enjoyable, fun and exciting time, with no disappointments.The Enterprise led by James Kirk (Chris Pine) with the help of his devoted crew continue their on going five year mission in space, but are inconveniently sent on rescue mission that will lead them into a massive game of survival on a mysterious planet. And if it couldn't get any worse, members of the Enterprise are being hunted and imprisoned by the villainous Krall (Idris Elba).The rebooted Star Trek film series has returned with new Captain on the bridge while Abrams sorts out Star Wars. Justin Lin carries on Abrams' series with another action fused space thriller. With the same cast returning, we still feel the fun Star Trek that Abrams has created but with something new as well.The film absolutely delivers what it promises: great action sequences, stunning visuals and shots, and as always each cast member nailing their performance, and a good narrative. What is added is more depth into the characters and the relationship between characters especially Spock and McCoy, but also insight into a more sophisticated Jim Kirk than previously seen, and also a kick ass white warrior played by Sofia Boutella (who was previously seen in Kingsmen with metal prosthetic legs), so this woman knows how to fight. Also as previously noted we have much more humorous and sweet banter between McCoy and Spock which is a nod to the Original Series.There are also more touching moments, as the film works around the death of Leonard Nimoy, and adds a very nice message in the credits 'For Anton'.There is really nothing I didn't like about this film, it is great cinema entertainment and a fun science fiction adventure. This does not make it perfect but a good enjoyable time which I found was better than I was expecting. Star Trek Beyond is a solid great action film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This kind of movie making will make us all Trekkies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes a reboot (JJ Abram's 2009 Star Trek) can save an aging movie franchise. Fresh vibrant actors, fast-paced story-telling and a wealth of "old- school" mannerisms and one-liners seem to be a winning combo. Well, that and big budgets of course.This is a fun movie. It's starts a little slow ... but then kicks into high gear and stays in "action-adventure" mode till the end. This is also a very visual movie (3D IMAX is a great way to see). We see creative uses of holograph technology in several scenes -- and we get to see beautiful visuals of a massive space station / planet ... kind of like the opposite of Star Wars' Death Star ... and it is a fun sight. Who wouldn't want to go there? Who wouldn't want part of their peace, harmony and explore-the-universe ideal?Well - if you're guessing the bad guys ... yup. They don't want that kind of thing and they seem potent. There are some questionable battle solutions that seem more like wizardry than solving a puzzle (typical of the TV series) ... but because the rest of the movie is a fun ride, I'll let it slide.If the producers keep making movies like this... they'll eventually make us all trekkies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall i really enjoyed it. As per previous comments the CGI part was garbage it's like they ran out of time. And lots of Plot holes. But that's usual nothing major you can't get over. I love the musical choice throughout it really showed the true colors of star trek and coming back to an oldie feel. They did an amazing tribute to Spock it was very touching. The rest had pretty much a TV show from the 70 feel, the humour was the same, music as previously mentioned and the costumes were great. Actors played well too. One thing i'd like to add, i didn't understand what the main protagonist was saying, i think it was due to his costume so that was a little bit of a bummer for me. But if you are into the whole space thing obviously a good and safe choice. Would definitely recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally something watchable...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The revived Star Trek franchise was not lucky so far. First, the action-packed eleventh installment, but without any sense. Then, the remake of Wrath of Khan, which also left a lot to desire. Finally, we have the third episode from the new series and it is undoubtedly the best one. Of course, all required elements are still here. Instead of the philosophical questions and clever plot, we have the fast pacing adventure movie with clearly drawn lines between good and evil. Right now the crew of Enterprise seems to be a good team, able to solve any problem. Here and there are some more serious questions asked, like pacifism against the miliratism (exploited earlier in the Wing Commander IV game, for instance), or the need to unify with your enemies for the good of all species (very up to date in the modern world, isn't it?). This is, however, overshadowed by the well defined plot presenting the struggle of the Federation finest crew against another villain (this time, much better developed than in previous movies).The cast is good, that is if you already accepted the new crew of Enterprise. All new characters are interesting and do not disappoint. Surprisingly, the bad guys are quite effective in what they do and their motivations are convincing. The chemistry between the main Enterprise crew members exists, spiced by the appropriate sense of humour. The special effect again are top-notch, flawlessly combining the action scenes with the outer space sequences. All is balanced, so the suspension of disbelief is possible this time. The techno-babble is present, but not very annoying (just like in the Star Trek: Enterprise series), therefore it serves its purpose of mysteriously explaining some crucial twists in the plot. Music is also passable, maybe not as good as in the new Star Wars, but Michael Giacchino efficiently used the well-known Star Trek tunes and transformed them into something new. We have then everything that is required: grand space battles, close combat, chases and proper moral choices. True fans of the series will not be disappointed - homage to the already existing world was paid a couple of times as well. J.J. Abrams had a difficult task to bring the Star Trek to the broader audience and, despite failing in most aspects of previous movies, he was able to do so. Justin Lin stood before the easier challenge, as he just had to do a good action movie in space. Indeed he succeeded, bringing us the summer blockbuster free from the utter nonsense, delivering enough action and consistent future world to please both die-hard Star Trek fans and ordinary people wanting just to spend pleasantly two hours in the cinema. Sure, this is not the intellectual feast, but it wasn't meant to be. Let's hope the next episode will keep at least this level of quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the record, I'm not a Trekkie, but I think the reboot movies are decent! I really liked the 2009 film, and I thought Into Darkness was a better movie than most people seem to! Thankfully, Star Trek Beyond seems to have followed the trend without Abrams in command of the ship!So let's start there - the new director, Justin Lin, has done a pretty solid job of capturing the magic of the Star Trek universe, while keeping it modern and nodding to the originals - big congrats for all that! There are some spectacular action sequences (in particular the Enterprise crash scene near the start), and some well delivered humour (courtesy of Mr Pegg's script input). The CGI is, for the most part, outstanding too - although I must admit at some points when the camera is swirling around, there's just so much animation it's actually quite hard to comprehend and process.The real essence of the movie though is the chemistry. For their third outing, the new cast seem to have actual bonds and friendships with each other. This is largely due to the actors being perfect for their parts, but the banter is well written and directed too - especially the Bones/Spock scenes. Boutella's Jaylah is also a terrific addition to a terrific cast! That said, I've never quite been convinced of Pegg's accent...BUT, for all its fun and nostalgia, it has its flaws. Firstly, Elba's villain Krall, despite being pretty fearsome is a little underwhelming once the motivation is explained. The big reveal actually loosens the tension before the climax, which is a shame! Also the movie feels quite derivative - "borrowing" certain shots and elements from other movies like The Force Awakens, Galaxy Quest, Interstellar, Guardians Of The Galaxy, Futurama, Fast and Furious (obviously), and of course previous Star Trek movies. This isn't a huge problem, but it does make you feel like you've seen it all before.All in all, it's an enjoyable ride in a comfy vehicle - taking characters we know and love and sending us off on a fun adventure with them. Unfortunately it never quite became more than just "the next Star Trek movie".4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfectly Fine Addition To The Star Trek Universe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filled with numerous references to the original Star Trek series, packing sufficient dose of action- laden moments, and making brilliant use of its blockbuster ingredients, the third instalment in the rebooted Star Trek series is no memorable entry but it does enough to qualify as one of the most enjoyable, amusing &amp; satisfactory blockbusters to surface on the big screen, this year.The story of Star Trek Beyond finds Captain James T. Kirk &amp; his crew aboard the USS Enterprise in the middle of its 5-year mission as they continue to explore the uncharted realms of space. Things are set in motion when they encounter a new ruthless enemy who destroys their ship, strands them on a remote planet with no means of communication, and is in possession of an ancient bioweapon.Directed by Justin Lin, Star Trek Beyond is the first in the rebooted series to be not helmed by J.J. Abrams but his absence isn't strongly felt as Lin brings all his experience from The Fast &amp; the Furious franchise to give this sequel a full-throttled push that keeps the plot running at swift pace &amp; is consistent in its delivery of action segments. The story follows a darker route yet for the most part, it is a risk-free journey.Lin's kinetic direction makes sure that boredom never sets in, its sense of adventure is never lost, and there's a welcome attempt to balance its different genre elements, at which it succeeds. The set pieces are grand &amp; eye-popping, the dynamic camera-work &amp; vivid use of colour palette gives its images a vibrant look n feel, Editing is finely carried out, while Michael Giacchino's lively score infuses a flavour of its own.Coming to the performances, Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, Anton Yelchin, John Cho &amp; Zoe Saldana exhibit better comfort in their reprising roles and chip in with fine inputs. The new additions include Idris Elba &amp; Sofia Boutella, with former managing to give an intimidating vibe to his character on few occasions while the latter is an absolute show-stealer. Urban, Yelchin, Cho &amp; Pegg get a major upgrade in their screen time and all of them utilise it brilliantly.On an overall scale, Star Trek Beyond is guilty of travelling a predictable road without risking much but the positives clearly outweighs the negatives here as this second sequel is darker, bigger &amp; surprisingly more engaging than its predecessors and has plenty in store for both Trekkies as well as casual filmgoers. It doesn't add much to the revitalised series but it doesn't take away anything either and keeps alive the momentum that was generated by the last two entries. A well-rounded blockbuster, this sci-fi adventure is a perfectly fine addition to the ever-expanding universe of Star Trek.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mediocre summer blockbuster which is fun to watch, but ultimately pretty forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Star Trek Beyond' marks the third installment in the Star Trek franchise ever since it's 2009 reboot. This time the directing was done by Justin Lin who has an excellent crew of actors at his disposal. Once again Chris Pine stars as the captain of the USS Enterprise better known as James T. Kirk, alongside him are Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Zoe Saldana, John Cho, Anton Yelchin and Simon Pegg who co-wrote the story. What the director and the actors do really well is create a whole lot of chemistry between the main characters. The fact that the main crew has been living with each other for the last three years is really noticeable as it is quite clear that friendships have started to form. Often times characters will make jokes with one another and these jokes never really seem forced in any way. Though there were a few moments where the acting seemed a little bit off overall the ensemble cast did an amazing job. What is not all that great however is the writing. Most of the times a characters story-arc is a thin as possible. Often times such an arc is set up with only one line of dialogue and after maybe mentioning it once or twice get resolved again with also only a single line of dialogue. The dialogue itself is also not that great, often times it did not make any sense at all. Sometimes when, though unimportant, members of the crew die the main characters do not seem to care at all and would rather make a joke instead of addressing it. The same goes for when certain events happen that directly impact the main characters, then again the movie would rather throw in a joke rather than having the characters ask the appropriate questions. Spread out throughout the movie is a lot of expositional dialogue and some major plot holes. The main villain Krall is as clich as can be and when his motives are finally explained the character becomes downright laughable. What sets the movie apart from other blockbuster movies this year however is the amazing CGI and effects. Over the course of the movie it works really well and there really are only a few moments where it looks quite ugly. Together with the great soundtrack, beautiful costumes, awesome set design and amazing sound effects Justin Lin has created a very appealing movie both visually and audibly. Sometimes though it seemed Lin wanted to exploit this a little bit too much which resulted in some set up shots too use way to much screen time. In the end 'Star Trek Beyond' is a pretty mediocre summer blockbuster which is fun to watch, but ultimately pretty forgettable.My rating: 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The special effects were nice. But the plot was very thin, and I blame Simon Pegg who also wrote "Hot Fuzz", "The World's End" and "Shaun of the Dead".Those movies are completely different from Star Trek, which I've been watching for decades. Simon messed it up, and he should have used a consultant to fix the problems in the story-line, such as why the device was bad, and what the technical aspects of the ship Enterprise are. It showed the lack of attention to detail which was the hallmark of Star Trek. It's like reading a comic written for a "younger" (i.e.: pre-high school) audience.If I saw it on TV, I would've probably been disappointed. As it was, I saw it in a theater in 3D with great comfortable, lounger chairs. But that didn't make the movie better -- it sort of meant that they paid money for special effects instead of getting competent script writers. Sad, really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily the weakest of the new trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really loved the first two movies of the franchise reboot, so I was really excited to see STB but I left the theatre pretty disappointed. Things I had problems with: a lot of the actors seemed as if they were playing Star Trek caricatures as supposed to actual people (Spock, Scotty, Bones, and Chekov for example) which made it hard for me to follow them throughout the story. There are HUGE plot holes in the movie that are really glaring, and every other scene was a dramatic conversation between two characters where one of them learned an incredibly important life lesson and says some clich and quotable line over the not so subtle score (ie "fear of dying is what keeps us alive). It didn't really seem like there were any sincere consequences or obstacles that the characters had to overcome, when only one named character was actually killed throughout all of the catastrophes in this movie, and when so often a character will say that something is impossible, and within five minutes they'll figure out a way around it (with really clichd "I got it!" moments). Perhaps the biggest problem with the movie is a line that Kirk actually says in the very beginning of the film: this all feels very episodic. This could've been condensed to a TV show episode, and it would've worked because there weren't any stakes, nothing drastic had occurred that changed the characters, and you aren't left with any sort of impression as you leave the film. Overall, this is about as average as any other action blockbuster and I can't find anything really exemplary to remark about this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Star Trek, there should be a great story, exploration into deep space, introduction to new concepts.... But a what a disappointment. This could and should be a great film, but how they could make this so bad, I can't understand. Well it not totally bad. There are some great visual effects, we got our beloved characters and of-course the Enterprise. But the writing is so bad that we end up with no story. I could have written this in a day. ( I hope that they didn't pay for this script). So we end up with 2 hours of shooting and fighting, which I could have gotten going to a DC or a Marvel movie (but still get a much better story)I was just left numb and disappointed, just wondering if the next Star Trek film will be any better (I can only wish..) Was going to rate it 6... but then thought again about the script.. 5----spoiler-----.... the writer then uses the ending from "Mars Attacks!" ...are you kidding me !!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The weakest of the trilogy by far, with a poor script, juvenile direction, jumpy editing, and sub-par soundtrack.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Trek Beyond finally proves that Justin Lin should stick to his already very limited repertoire. The man simply cannot direct a scene, let alone an entire film. He takes a modest script and turns it into an incoherent mess. Jump cuts and shaky cam galore that ruin an already basic film. JJ Abrams is a master next to this man, one that recreated Star Trek and gave great opening sequences to his two films, Lin goes for something embarrassingly juvenile and then runs with it.The cast were in general great, though Idris Elba was wasted in a bit part that seemed secondary to the story. Kirk played second fiddle in the final act, making you wonder if he was still in the same film.The score was weak, relying upon the themes of the first film with little more to add, and that is a vast of the vast talent that is Michael Giacchino.In summary, the weakest of the trilogy by far, with a poor script, juvenile direction, jumpy editing, and sub-par soundtrack. It's only saving grace is that is was better than Independence Day: Resurgence.5/10 if I'm being nice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fast &amp; Furious director Justin Lin takes over from J.J. Abrams who's currently committed to Star Wars, this being the first Trekkie film to be in total digital. Lin does good keeping the feel of the previous two and having a great balance of characters and action but that might have something to do with the additional writing from Simon Pegg himself. The full cast returns with an almost blow out from Karl Urban until Lin had words convincing him to continue and gladly so as the banter between Spock and Bones is brilliant. In fact there's plenty of side-looks and funny comradely between the crew including John Cho's Sulu and the late Anton Yelchin's Chekov. There's a subtle hint at Sulu's sexuality paying reference to the real George Takei, which he doesn't actually approve of. I have to mention Deep Roy, the lovable small actor who's graced our screens with The NeverEnding Story and Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, who plays Scotty's wee alien assistant Keensar; not that he gets to say anything apart from the odd sneeze. The forever busy Idris Elba takes the role of villain, Krall and he pretty much what you might expect from an alien bad guy and it's probably Kingsmen femme fatale, Sofia Boutella who steals the show. Her character actually being based on Jennifer Lawrence's Ree from her 2010 film Winter's Bone which eventually evolved Boutella's name to be Jaylah the phonetic slang abbreviation for Ms. Lawrence. She suits the character well and brings something fresh to the franchise whereas Krall is just a typical moody alien enemy, but Elba does him proudly. It's not a totally original story, messy in parts and predictable. Sometimes incoherent and dark in places making it difficult to follow but I have always found digital poor at capturing action and night shots on camera. However, it works and manages to entertain very well with a silly yet superb use of Beastie Boys 'Sabotage'. It's clichd but forgivable as it's actually enjoyable and moves at warp speed to cover all the plot holes, "ahh, that's a bit clichd, oh, wait a minute something is happening." There is some mystery, or something not made clear, maybe just lacking detail that gets overlooked. I'm glad they kept Michael Giacchino's score which works so well and is recognisable as a theme especially the dramatic destructive scenes where it helps captures the emotional impact of what's happening. Rihanna's 'Sledgehammer' is a superb song and makes on 2016 end credit track playlist. It's a great addition to the trilogy and to the franchise, paying good homage to Gene Roddenberry's creations marking the 50th anniversary, just check out the special edition poster below based on the first motion picture in '79. I want to see more of this crew and where they go. It's better than Into Darkness but still not as good as the primer but this has a better balance, characters, drama and action, it's a very slick sci-fi movie that I'll probably watch again before it comes off the big screen. RIP Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin, Godspeed.

		<shortDescription>The trouble with Trekkies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>is that they want nostalgia and something new? That is a hard thing to do on a franchise as well know as Trek. Lin and Pegg have done it. In a summer full of films that reach for the deep space of its audiences memories (Girlbusters/Id4.2/Finding Nemo's friend) it's refreshing to see a film balances that; and has a new feel at the same time. Bringing an action director on board and teaming him with a fanboy writer is a one- two-punch that works.Star Trek has always had two types of films: the action heavy type or the more cerebral type. I can live with not having both in the same film each time. So if you're looking for a summer film to bring back some of those past emotions with a new twist you could do far worse that taking a Trek this team and its new direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as blockbuster franchises go, the current Star Trek series has been undergoing a distinctly palpable identity crisis. Should it wholly embrace its blockbuster marketing, aiming for go-for- broke action to attract the popcorn audience in droves? Or should it aspire to reach loftier ideals of character development, intellectualizing about existence as the crew gets caught up in seemingly intractable story lines (and timelines)? The good news is that Star Trek Beyond successfully manages to do both, incorporating terrific sound design and seamless visuals in a plot that respects its sci-fi pedigree. It harks back to Gene Roddenberry's idealistic principles of unity, diversity, and inclusion, while at the same time throwing a winking nod towards the growing cinematic predilection for fun and silliness. In this regards, Star Trey Beyond owes a huge debt of gratitude to the hugely successful Guardians of the Galaxy, which reinvigorated audience interest in space odysseys that are, well, fun. And fun this certainly is. For two hours well-spent, don't miss Star Trek Beyond on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exhilarating action can't hide that this is a step down in the series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set three years after the events of Into Darkness, this third entry into the revamped Star Trek cinematic universe takes the USS Enterprise crew even deeper into space where their exploratory mission, not unexpectedly, takes a turn for the worse. Presented more like a stand-alone voyage as opposed to a direct sequel, the wholesale change made amongst the crew ? the director, writers and cinematographer from the first two instalments are all replaced ? is sorely felt in both tone and execution. There's no sense that any of these characters have changed since we last trekked into the vast unknown with them, despite it being set a few years later, and this film cares little about building on the major relationships already established. So instead of a continuation of the Kirk-Spock, Spock-Uhura, Kirk-Bones story lines that have been steadily growing, our beloved protagonists are plopped into an escape mission that feels rather inconsequential to the overall franchise. New hero Jayla (the magnetic Sofia Boutella) is a shot of adrenaline when she arrives part way through, but the big bad Krall (Idris Elba under heavy prosthetics) is rather underwhelming. Karl Urban's Bones shines brightest from the returning cast with a plethora of hilarious one-liners. Replacing J.J. Abrams in the head job, director Justin Lin (no slouch in the action department with Fast and Furious 4, 5, 6 under his belt) concocts some striking sequences, albeit rarely breaking from the sci-fi blockbuster mould. A first-act aerial ambush on the Enterprise offers some brutal and breathtaking moments, whilst a daring prison-escape set piece is rousing and a grand last-act onslaught (ingeniously incorporating Beastie Boys hit "Sabotage") gets the heart pounding. Boldly going where many Star Trek outings have gone before, Beyond is a massive step down from its modern predecessors and a missed opportunity for further growth of these famous characters. Thankfully the intergalactic skirmishes are exhilarating enough to justify a big-screen viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Trek Beyond Conceit?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Star Trek Beyond I can truly say that this movie was way over-hyped. Definitely not one of the top five in the franchise.Maybe it was the 3D version that I saw; but for most of the movie I was straining to see what was happening on the screen. When I could make out what was going on it was much too busy--sort of like the bad Transformer movies.The story wasn't bad; but it seemed to me that they tried too hard to make sure each character had ample screen time. Less would have been more in this case.I also don't say this too often; but if the movie was 1/2 hour or 45 minutes longer they could have added more meat to the story. I guess Idris Elba did as much as he could with the Krall character; but his villain seemed like a bad James Bond villain--you know the kind that explains everything to Bond instead of just killing him.The best part of the movie is when the aliens are destroying the enterprise; but the aliens were so effective and destructive that none of the crew should have survived the attack.Karl Urban and Zachary Quinto do a nice job playing Bones and Spock; but in this rendition it seemed to me like they were doing bad imitations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before going into this movie my expectations were very low, after watching the first trailer I thought it was going to be a disaster. During the movie I really enjoyed Karl Urban's performance as Dr. McCoy. He brought lots of laughter to the theater. Also Zachary Quinto as Spock was phenomenal as usual. But what made me really enjoy the movie was that it took place on one planet and they were trying to escape. This kept me on the edge of my seat waiting to see if anybody wasn't going to make it. (Spoiler warning) fortunately no one died in the movie from Kirks crew. All in all this movie was very enjoyable and was better than I thought it would be.</fullReview>

Yes, this new film is Star Trekkier than the last two films, but it also feels smaller -4th Star Trek film in a row with a villain who wants revenge against the Federation for muddled, somewhat incomprehensible reasons -Idris Elba's villain character isn't fleshed out enough -McGuffin -Action scenes are muddled and difficult to follow. They are shot with a lot of hand-held, shaky camera-work, dimly lit, and quickly edited. -Lacks Gene Roddenberry's vision of Star Trek, i.e. No more philosophical or political or scientific than the last two films. -The early scene where the enterprise is destroyed goes on for far, far too long.Well, that's what I thought, anyways. See it, it's good enough that your time will not go wasted. Or, don't see it, it's mediocre enough to pass on. 2.5 (out of 4)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third installment in the new Star Trek franchise brings back the crew of the Enterprise with a new mission towards another unknown nebula. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg and Anton Yelchin reprise their respective roles. Where Into Darkness brought a more dark tone in comparison to the first movie, this one brings back the fun, action- packed tone of the first movie. The crew is given the task of rescuing the crew of an unknown person/alien/species. During that rescue they are swarmed by the enemy led by the new villain, Krall, performed by Idris Elba(surprisssseee!!!) and the Enterprise is torn into pieces , yes AGAIN. I loved the surprise reveal of Idris Elba because I was completely unaware of the casting. Krall seeks to take back an artifact aboard the Enterprise and use it to take revenge on the Federation. Justin Lin has already proved that he is a great action director with his Fast and Furious film and he proves it again. The set pieces are huge and when the explosions begin, no matter how much you want to critically analyze it you cannot deny having fun. Here comes the catch. Even though the Star Trek franchise doesn't have any element of magic, the characters have a sense of vulnerability and that kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what will happen next. As the set pieces and the action sequences are quite destructive in nature you do feel that THAT should have turned them to pulp BUT leave all practicality behind and you will have a hell lot of fun. We are introduced to Jaylah, performed by Sofia Boutella who allies with Kirk to help them rescue his crew and also exact revenge on Kraal in the process.Coming to the performances, the most standout performance was Jaylah. She kicks ass like a boss and it is fun to watch. Her fight with Manas played by Joe Taslim(Raid, FF6) is awesome. Even through the heavy makeup the emotional loss her character has suffered is visible. The most amazing thing about these Star Trek movies is that they heavily rely on the interpersonal relationships of the lead characters. Kirk and Spock, Spock and Bones, Spock and Uhura, Chekov and Sulu, Sulu and Kirk, Kirk and Scott, these relationships are the foundation of the movie. I felt like I know them from a long time and they have known each other for a long time. Even though it has been 3 movies, the time that has passed in the continuity of the movie is long, so the maturity of the characters is very necessary. It shouldn't feel like that after 3 movies they are getting to know each other again and again. Everyone knows everyone's characteristics and they know it so well that they know what any of them are going to do next. Elba's Krall is poorly written. He plays the clichd villain who won't win and it is extremely predictable once you know what his plan is and by now you know that the Federation cannot be severely harmed. I hope they do some serious damage in the next installment. Leonard Nemoy has a nice sending off. Yelchin as Chekov will be severely missed and as Abrams has announced that Chekov won't be re- cast, Jayla seems to be the worthy successor to occupy the seat beside Sulu and take the Enterprise to uncharted territories. FINAL VERDICT: It is a very entertaining movie and will help keep the franchise alive. My rating for the movie is a solid 7/10. Keep in mind that this is ultimately a Hollywood movie instead of trying to make it more practical. Admit it that we do need to have some fun and yes, this is fun and a nice franchise for the new generation to follow</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I love Star Trek. Watched 'em all, and I worked at Paramount Pictures in the Gene Roddenberry Bldg, and got to work with ST:TNG a few times. And I really love the Pine/Quinto/Urban (Cho/Soldana/Pegg..) &amp; company's version, even though I think JJ Abrahms is all too often a derivative writer who re-writes (plagiarizes) too many prior films, yet directs very well. So I'm a fan. And right near the beginning, either the continuity dept./ the writer (Simon Pegg/D Jung/ etc.), or whomever buggered it for me when they showed Ambassador Spocks' birth/death date as "Stardate 2230.02 - 2263.04" (or something close to that), which means the older Spock was only 33 when he died. This obviously doesn't take into account his years from the future (And tells us how old Spock Jr. is at present). Seems to me in the future, they'd be smarter than that - perhaps by adding the time travel/ alternate time line date in the middle.I liked the humor in it, especially the horse excrement! and the tech was really good, along with set design, costumes, Acting (with this cast, Always excellent!). My criticisms duplicate what others have said, about the motivation of Idris Elba's character, for example. They should have gone WAY further with political relevance, like the way Gene &amp; D.C. Fontana used to with TOS TV show, for example, the failing global economy; the bastardization of religion to cause terror (which has been rampant in recent years), or many other grand themes (yeah, I should have been a screenwriter..). The acting was excellent as always, and I saw a few new things now done before. However good the action was, there was too much of it. And the series has ALWAYS been about the characters and ideology. Let that mantra reign!! So even with my less-than-STELLAR critique, go see it. It's entertaining, and I guarantee it's worth watching. I'll see it again I'm sure!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bona fide Star Trek episode</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the two inaugural films of the now-called "Kelvin timeline" brought the stale "Star Trek" franchise back to life with a vengeance, this third episode slowly but surely sets the course towards calmer, safer waters.The subtitle "Beyond" is somewhat misleading because it promises some epic journey into unknown, something seen in "The Motion Picture", where the characters really had no idea what they were getting into and where some ambitious issues are raised. Here it's kind of like what the TV series used to be: The Enterprise floats around the space as it's its own playground and the crew gets into danger, alright, but you just know they will be fine by the end.The plot outline doesn't much differ from J.J.Abrams' entries, as it's basically another story of Federation cleaning up its own mess. The stakes are unbelievably high, again, in form of a villain bent on a wholesale destruction and the nearly indestructible super-weapon as a means to do it. However, the antagonist is disposed of in an almost cheesy, cowboy fashion by Capt.Kirk &amp; Co. just the way typical villains-of-the-week were, in the old series. So I guess the "Star Trek" spirit is really back, for better or worse. Many of those who were unhappy with the "new" Star Trek will be much happier now, but I preferred the gloomy and costly resolutions of the first two films.The cast is now completely at ease with their roles, each one making their respective characters their own. Only Karl Urban as Bones seems to still be trying, unwisely, to emulate hammy mannerisms of his predecessor, DeForest Kelley. The director, Justin Lin, nearly matches his style to that of J.J.Abrams. He somewhat lacks elegance in camera angles and editing, but the pacing is adequate and set-pieces are really effective. Visuals are, in general, stunning and are probably the richest and the most detailed in the whole series.When it comes to verdict on "Beyond", it's a mixed bag for me. I admire the ambition and the impetus of the "new" Star Trek as much as I resent the cheese and safety of the "old" one. Some sort of convergence between the two seems to be in the making in the future and I'm afraid to glance "beyond" that point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a fan of ridiculous CGI action, with everything blowing up and just the right moment to not kill whomever is being featured, then this movie will be just your thing.If you want a weak story line, held together with some nice dialog between the characters, you'll find some moments here. Then, there are plot holes big enough to drive a star ship through. Of course, with CGI, you can drive a star ship through just about any tiny opening in a mountain range or a space station and, even though you are going at enormous speed, you won't dent or damage the ship any more than she can take, and a lil' more.It runs long and needs much more explanation of the threat other than having us just see it appear and then a solution is just a moment away. There are some nice homages to The Original Series but also one that does not make any sense at all if this is supposed to be the Young Crew.So, no: If I'm paying $12, I expect to see good acting by humans, delivering lines that are well written. I don't need to see two hours of computer generated images by what must have been an army of CGI geeks. I'm a guy, but I do not need to see everything blow up just like I don't need to see tanks land in 1942 Los Angeles or sharks attack the Fonz.</fullReview>

Simon Pegg, who flat-out lied when he assured us that "Beyond" would be a return to the ethos of the original series, should be barred from writing any more Star Trek scripts because, well, "Beyond" isn't even remotely close to Star Trek. It's a sub-mediocre, generic sci-fi action flick that happens to have characters named Kirk, Spock, McCoy, etc. Mindless action, CGI and noise are NOT what made Star Trek great. And guess what? Star Trek fans know it, and as a result this galactic turkey is bombing at the box office. Next time, keep Pegg away from the word processor, and bring in a director with more than negative-IQ action flicks on his resume. What a waste of my time and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are moments of original Star Trek in this movie when the main characters are in play, but those moments are buried under an avalanche of special effects, needless subplot, and "screen time" for supporting actors.The screenplay is unusually heavily charted by demographics even by today's Hollywood standards, and the philosophy is the pure Gene Rodenberry utopianism that has almost killed the franchise several times. There's also a healthy dose of Hollywood's hypocritical relationship with violence, i.e, railing against it while entertaining you with it. Then there are the numerous maudlin moments as the movie tries to poke at your emotions.But the real issue is that the movie seems to be modeled after an adventure park ride rather than anything approaching cinematically relevant. One scene tries to be more fantastical than the next, with the end result being that it's all unbelievable, clichd, and becomes boring in short order.What could have been the saving grace is the acting. It's very good. Spot on mostly. And the casting was brilliant. But they can only do so much given so much time devoted to the ceaseless action sequences and often overblown writing. (There are a few humorous and nicely understated interactions) If ever there was a franchise that needed to heed the "less is more" mantra, it's this one.If you're looking to kill two hours in a cool place watching attention deficit theater, it could be worse. Personally I'm sorry I devoted the time and money to it. I watched to the end only because I was with someone else and got up to take a breather several times. I won't pay again for this franchise until they make a real movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By comparison the 2009 reboot is a classic. So much more thought went into Abrams' effort. Also, whoever wrote that 'Beyond' is like TOS hasn't seen TOS. The positive reviews MUST be bought and paid for. The good: Sofia Boutella, the guest actress, was one of the few good things about this movie consistently and, even better, it appears they are setting her up to become a member of the crew, which would be great as she has more attitude and life in her than most of the other actors. Another good thing: the opening few minutes, which were funny and well done; and the final scene, Kirk's birthday party, where the characters finally showed their personality and had some dialogue beyond yelling for help or saying 'hang on!' or 'over there! behind you!' OK, I don't know if they said those things in the movie exactly but almost the entire film used only short choppy action scene dialogue about where to go and what to do next in order to escape trouble or get the bad guy. But in the last scene the actors showed a lot more color and personality, finally, for a few minutes before the credits. The bad: the plot. In the next few sentences I reveal minor plot basics, probably no more than professional reviews. A bad guy once again wants to destroy the Federation for vague reasons he cannot quite articulate - something about having been a soldier and now feeling useless because there is peace in the galaxy (it's news to me that there's peace in the Star Trek universe but whatever), and also feeling abandoned when he was left behind by people in Star Fleet a hundred years earlier (he's discovered the secret to some sort of life extension, you see, which was vaguely explained in five seconds). He has also changed his form completely, which is also unexplained but I suspect he did it by putting on an alien costume left over from the show Star Trek Enterprise, and he is going to take out as much of Starfleet as he can with a super weapon he can now use thanks to the fact that he has found some alien artifact he needs to make it work. You can't really give a spoiler because there's nothing to spoil. What I just told you is about the level of detail the movie gives. He sets this stone artifact in place like Indiana Jones, but instead of opening a door to treasure it powers up a weapon. No explanation as to why this weapon exists or its origins is even attempted. It's just some bs they threw together so they could trigger nonstop action which continues uninterrupted for almost the entire movie. Without room to breathe the movie just goes from one set piece to another, using closeups almost exclusively, so that often you don't know exactly where people are; and when they show one person running then cut to another, you don't know where those two are in relation to each other and if one is chasing the other and if so, which one; and when people are running through exploding ships I sometimes had no idea what was going on the visuals were such a busy mess. Whoever is in charge of maintaining the clarity of what is happening physically on screen utterly failed with this movie. Perhaps most importantly, the way they finally defeated the bad guys made no sense at all. I would tell you so you can understand how ridiculous it was, but I don't want to spoil it. Though it's crap so I'm not sure that you'd care anyway. Zachary Quinto gained a little weight in the face so he no longer has the angular Spock look. He looks puffy like the face of Darth Vader when Luke finally removed the mask (OK that's an exaggeration but he was puffy). Chris Pine starts off a little heavy in the face but quickly loses it. He apparently lost several pounds during filming. I'm sorry but I paid $12 to see Bruce Springsteen perform for 3 and half hours in 1978, an incredible classic performance. So if I'm going to pay over twice that much merely to see a 2 hour movie (3D iMax), then the script better be great, the visuals better be great, the acting better be great, and the actors better be fit and trim and look their best. If the actors can't get in shape for all the millions they are paid, then they have an entitlement problem. Zachary wasn't ready to shoot. Chris wasn't but he fixed it fast during filming. Zoe Saldana, who I love and think is beautiful, looks so severe throughout almost the entire movie (until the Kirk birthday scene when finally she looks like herself again) that she was unpleasant to watch. Mostly she just stared at things severely. They gave her little to do. Maybe she was still channeling Nina Simone and hadn't broken out of that character fully. The best of the regular cast this time around was Bones, who was great. Though there vulgar dialogue that was a bit jarring to hear in Star Trek, jokes about horse sh!t. Like a Farley brothers movie briefly invading a couple of times. It was weird. Overall, a paint-by-numbers action movie, vague and poorly shot or maybe just poorly edited action. Not much spirit of Star Trek to be found.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Critics too good for Star Treks. A little bit illiterate woks from Lin.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star trek is one of the most successful franchise that Hollywood has. The storyline concept of old-classic Star Trek was so imaginary, creative, and adventurous. It was one of dare competitor to George Lucas's Star Wars franchise. It has its own universe, concept, characters, and visual effects. For old generations, watching Star Trek at the first time was like witnessing a whole new universe, it was zeal and a huge leap to Sci-fi moving picture at that time.Now here they come the new franchise of star trek. This whole new franchise is one of many remade movies appeared in our generation. It seems remaking old classics is a trend nowadays, giving freshly altered visual effects into shape while not much changing the flow. This new franchise has an ambition to erupt young and giving evanescence to old. With an incredible formation of actors and actresses with extol producer J.J. Abrams and Racing specialist Justin Lin, still it can't bring amazing impact or adventurous feelings at all.Lin's work with shaky cam and average fast-paced editing seem not giving audience to absorb what this movie want and fail to catch the beauty of images. Star Trek is about visualization, to express the beauty of unknown world and universe, if director using fast-pace and short-take shots, so vision of film has opposite effect to technical aspect. Another thing which unmatched is the script, STB has complex and bulk script. It just made the movie losing interest to audience in some duration. I know Lin's attention to focus on cumbersome dialogue is to increase appear duration to his characters, so they develop as the duration goes on. Spock is smart typical, scotty is funny, kirk is charismatic, etc, we know that from their dialogue structure right. Its just not necessary to add some physics dialogue to this light adventurous film, it just made audience sleepy. I don't want to comment on the visual effect even it seems cheap if compared to any other potent film such as Avatar or The Avengers, i don't want to because visual effect is only a small piece of aspect which makes movie great. The conclusion is, this franchise has no unique characteristics because it changes director for every new film. Maybe Hollywood's intention was to too increase versatility of it's directors. The art direction also seems illiterate to me, you need a vibrant colors and long spectrum of image temperature to increase the thrill, cinematic aspect, and characteristics of universe in Star Trek. One thing that i like most from Lin in STB is one of his shot technique. He shot a character from a side-angle of a character's face, then he pan and doly the camera simultaneously until the angle smaller to a character's face and he get one image about a character's expression while giving solid impact to a character's influence to the scene. I think that is one of a shot technique to increase a character's development with elegant technique. One other positive thing is the character development from movie to movie of this franchise also subtle. For examples are title of Mr. Sensitive guy to kirk, Spock's paternal past, Vodka Lover to Yelchin, a new character named Jayla, those were things which made a sequel good.Well I'm not recommend older generation to watch this new star trek, because this new franchise losing some aspects which the old franchise has, but for young generation, i think this franchise will introduce you about a huge imaginary world of star trek. Prepare to travel to the unknown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A positive step forward and a new direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the previous two Star Trek films have had their moments, I have been a bit underwhelmed with them, overall. I really need to tip my cap to Doug Jung and Simon Pegg for steering things into a new direction.The gripes about "Trek" have been that old Trek is too many discussions and new Trek is too much action ... these gripes aren't without merit at times, but this time I think they found a happy medium by doing something that has not really happened in the first two films, and was a trademark of the best parts of the original series - focusing on character interaction. Without going into too much, the middle part of the film sees the crew split up into groups where they are forced to interact, and the overall effect is good. In between the more philosophical opening and closing are some excellent action scenes. It is really a strong example of a well planned out, well rounded film for this genre. While revealed a bit of a ham-handed manner, there is even a really nice plot twist in the plot that gives a nice (albeit, not too subtle) message about the need to change if we want to see a better society.The visuals are excellent, with particular praise for the Yorktown station which looks like something M.C. Escher would have come up with after several nights of hard drinking. It might be the single best visual in any "Trek" film or TV episode.This easily ranks as the best "Trek" film since "First Contact" ... but in certain ways, it might even be the best since "Wrath of Khan" for getting back to exploring the characters we have come to love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak villain makes the film weak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Trek Beyond has been released in India one week ahead of its release in the US and Europe, so I'm going to do all my friends there a big favor by reviewing.The biggest problem with this movie is that the villain is just not villainous enough. Even though he's Idris Alba, an actor of some note, he doesn't come across as a strong villain and it's not certain what he wants. Compare him to Benedict Cumberbatch in Star Trek Into The Darkness and you'll get what I mean. Chris Pine is aging at an alarming pace and I wonder how long he can keep it up. Karl Urban doesn't really deserve the screen time he gets in this movie. I enjoyed the movie more towards the end, once they've left the planet they're stuck in for a major part of the movie in and are airborne in space. The 3D effects are quite good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uncertain what was Beyond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As one who loved the first two reboots under JJ Abrams, I was looking forward to Beyond in the hopes it would feature more discovery in uncharted space under the new director, but alas, it was more of the same as the first two films, only not as good. The dialogue was a step down, and as a whole, I was definitely disappointed.It's still Kirk, Spock, Bones, et alia and any Trek fan should see it, but I'm hoping for a more cerebral part IV, assuming there is one, and less frenetic filler. It's hard to elaborate more without SPOILERS, but I had to moan when there's a random motorcycle on the deck of a star ship, which is then incorporated into a rescue mission. It's about the pinnacle of contrivance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Trek Beyond... Entertaining? At times. Intelligent? Meh. A great continuation of the franchise? Not at all! Let me give a small glimpse from a "casual Trek Fan".I had my doubts when Justin Lin was announced as the director. Of course the first trailer did little to instill any confidence. Even when Simon Pegg asked us to have faith, I was nervous. Well it all came to fruition. I'd go as far as saying that most Fast and Furious films had more depth then this movie. The first two Trek movies did (I think) a great job of taking seasoned and non- seasoned audience into the NEW Trek universe. Clever nods to previous films and cast all throughout. Emotion and drama matched well with action and wit. Star Trek Beyond fell flat in almost all categories. The conflicts and adversity in this film fell pretty flat, not to mention the acting was lacking authenticity and depth. There were so many opportunities for this movie to take the audience even further into the lives of the Enterprise crew. Instead opted to tease the audience with the hopes of a story with depth only to have most conflicts, including the villain, to be flushed out in the last fifteen minutes of the film. I am all for taking this film in a more original direction after going down "Khan avenue" in Into Darkness. But unlike the first two films, this movie flat out insulted the audience by having the entire conflict, history and resolution of the villain explained in period of 15-20 minutes. There was no depth to the villain and honestly I was disappointed that there wasn't a better "explanation" for why he wanted to destroy the Federation. Unlike the other two movies I felt that this was a disgraceful change of direction for the franchise. I didn't feel any emotion when it came to Krall and his struggles. It was like a point and shoot villain.Next are the plot holes. The first two films (in my opinion) did a great job giving audiences a full and non-rushed explanation of the events that were happening. In Beyond there is a "energy" that helps Krall not age. There is a "secret weapon" that was laughed off in the beginning of the film, that then isn't fully flushed out, other than to show that it biologically breaks down organic material. Where did it come from? How was it used prior? Instead we get a "cop-out" line that the ancestors one used it in battle.. Great. Thanks. Totally makes sense. There were so many pieces of the puzzle that just went unused or unsolved. Pacing. Cool action sequences that lasted fairly long. Pretty much the best part of this movie. However as I've eluded to before, the story is RUSHED. It lacked direction. It tried to be emotional at points, but then just washed over the story transitioning into some action sequence. Again without trying to be too bias, the first two films had great balance while this felt like a Tokyo Drift through deep space. I can go on and on. Was the movie horrible? No, it had moments of fun. But will this film do much to get audiences hyped for the next movie? I'm scared it wont. The first two movies left me giddy at the roll of credits in anticipation for the next installment. This movie just left me in laughter. I haven't done much research but I hope that A) Justin Lin DOES NOT direct the next chapter and B) the writers take a long look in the mirror and admit to themselves with was a bad direction for the franchise to go. Until then, boldly go where no IMDb'er has gone before... That was dumb. Peace out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What was the original Star Trek about? The reason why it gained such a huge following is because of its unique mixture of philosophy and character development. It showed us a possible future of a post-racist/misogynistic/classist society. It showed us the potential of the human race. These are the qualities that resounded with people and why Star Trek didn't become just another forgotten show from the 1960s. And lets not forget the wonderful on camera chemistry of the original crew and TNG.SPOILER ALERT:Unfortunately, all the things that made Star Trek great are severely lacking in the reboot franchise, and despite Simon Pegg's obvious love for the show, Beyond misses the mark. Star Trek isn't about unrealistic space explosions, motorcycles, and 90's rap music.A few things wrong with this movie:-actors apparently having a contest to see who can spit out his/her lines the fastest. I didn't realize acting was just a contest to see who can speak the fastest! Who cares if the audience can follow what you're saying?-People surviving space collisions that would liquefy a person's internal organs in real life, and surviving without a scratch!-A villain with no clear motivation. He's against the unity of the Federation, and yet he controls a hive consisting of millions of aliens... which could not exist without unity and cooperation amongst them. Does he not see the irony? Why is he against the Federation's unity but not the unity within his own army?-The Federation sending Kirk out immediately to aid an unknown alien race on the word of one person who may or may not be lying. Like, really, they couldn't at least send a probe first to check out her story? They would jeopardize the Enterprise's entire crew and possibly the Federation and blindly follow the word of an alien they know nothing about? (Spoiler alert: she was lying)-All the key plot points being condensed down to 60 second sound bites. We wouldn't want to take away precious screen time from all the explosions, now would we?etc...Chris Pine's version of Kirk is adequate, but Zachary Quinto's Spock misses the mark. Nimoy's Spock was a nuanced character with depth and interesting character development. In contrast, Quinto's Spock comes across at times as someone with Asperger's. In a life or death situation, apparently Spock can't tell that brevity in his diction is of importance. So many things seem to just fly right over his head. Spock isn't supposed to come across as a naive guy with Asperger's. Thats just not the character.I appreciate that ST: Beyond tried to pay tribute to the original series, but it fails to re-capture the magic of the original or even TNG. Instead we're left with a series of space explosions and CGI fight scenes shot with extremely shaky camera work and a movie that couldn't exist without our collective nostalgia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Feeling All Too Familiar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Trek Beyond contained all the elements of the previous Star Trek Films, and nothing more. As much as I enjoyed the first two installments, I was unable to find the same joy in this rehash, and poorly drawn out, version of Star Trek into Darkness. Without giving too much away, and following a very predictable plot, the main antagonist Krall is hell bent on saving humanity from themselves using the simple and well thought out plan of destroying humanity( I never quite understand this logic ). With little to no motivation or back story that would surmount the type of anger Krall would need to end all life, he spends the majority of his existence searching for an ancient biological weapon capable of ending civilizations across the galaxy. Krall ambushes Quirk and Co in the films opening and the crew is separated, the majority of which have been captured by Krall on his planet, and the few remaining characters to progress the story are left to locate their mates and set them free. The bulk of the film will be spent on this sole task until finally reaching the climatic and eye popping finale.Putting the plot aside, if you go into the theater solely to feed your appetite for exciting explosions and great visuals, you will find enjoyment from this film. If what you need is a thought provoking story that feels fresh and original, perhaps pass this one up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Trek is Now an Action Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Trek Beyond (Spoiler Alert) Drake Preatorius, writer for IDiSF.comI waited in anticipation for this film. I was the first person in the theater on Friday morning. As a fanfiction writer, I was looking to see how closely the plots of my Krall stories measured up to actual plot of the film. I was surprised by the outcome. Mine are much better. J.J. Abrams, creator of Fringe, director of Star Trek Beyond and Star Wars decided to step aside for this film. Instead, they selected Justin Lin as the director. As you all probably know, Lin has directed the Fast and Furious franchise for several years. Therein lies the first problem with this film. It is no longer a science fiction franchise. It is now an action film franchise, replete with motorcycle chases, fighting scenes and a constant barrage of phaser fire. Without revealing the plot, which was threadbare, it would be ufficient to say it was like eating a bowl of stone soup. Kirk is bored with his role of captain and after only three years as a captain, with no Starfleet degree, he applies for a job as a vice-admiral. He seemed to feel that the captain's job was unchallenging, yet throughout the film he constantly announces that he would be nothing without Spock. This leads us to the next shortcoming of the film, the triad. Star Trek fanboys whined like babies who had been pulled from their momma's teets when Uhura replaced McCoy as one of the lead characters in the first two films. The Star Trek powers finally relented and attempted to recreate the "bromance" between these fellas, but they failed. The truth is, the triad cannot be recreated on film. The relationship between Kirk, Bones and Spock developed over three seasons as the actors worked closely together. The relationships between these three characters in the film seemed inauthentic. Kirk is in love with Kirk, which is not too far from case in the television version and although there is banter between Spock and McCoy throughout the film, the chemistry that existed in the television show just doesn't exist between Karl Urban and Zachary Quinto. This leads us to the third misfire in the film. It is a rehash of the Star Trek 2009. We get to see the same stunts, over again and this time there are no surprises here, once again we see falling ships rising, Kirk floating in space, fancy transporter tricks and most disappointing, the amber effect from the Abram's TV series Fringe. I found myself falling asleep halfway through the film. What they did right was add a bit more content about the female characters. Uhura and Jayla kick butt and take names. There is also a low level female villain and the last minute addition of Shohreh Aghdashloo as Commodore Paris which contributes little to the plot. It comes across as tokenism. One is left wondering if she was related to Lieutenant Tom Paris and his father Admiral Paris from the Voyager show, or if Pegg just couldn't think of any other names. I hear that there is another Star Trek in the works. The best thing Paramount can do is wrench this franchise from the hands of J.J. Abrams and Roberto Orci and hire some DS9 and Voyager writers. They, at least, are familiar with the Star Trek canon. The other thing they can do to save the franchise is to stop courting the video game crowd, who prefer Star Wars anyway, and put the science fiction back into the Star trek franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awful script, endless Trekkie jargon, heavy and lathered prosthetic makeup, a waste of a great actor like Idris Elba, and a visually stultifying experience. There really isn't anything good to say about this movie. It has none of the things which most of us like about Star Trek, the likability and camaraderie of the original crew, a genuine sense of wonder at what space travel might have to offer, which I think Gene Roddenberry was sincere about.The visuals are awful, it feels like a set piece, there's CGI every two minutes, the action sequences are completely disjointed and hard to follow, and there are ZERO characters in the movie, including the major three. No lines, no dialogues, no evolution, no conversations, no insights. Just an endless video game barrage of mediocre action and CGI spectacle.I found myself telling myself time and time again, this can't be real. This can't really be what 150 million dollars buys you. Chris Pine looking alcoholic and hung over, Zachary Quinto betraying every bit of dignity and beauty that made us love Spock, Karl Urban turning smirking into an offensive part of every single scene.Personally, I think Justin Lin wanted to explode the Star Trek canon and treat the audience to a personal viewing of his defecatory direction. I think this is a director who's too caught up in shallow references and wholesale murder, because of mediocrity or arrogance or both, to actually tell a story and take a risk treating the audience to new ideas and feelings. What a pity. Don't watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be a fan of Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek, you are going to appreciate social implications and importance of individual character development as well. With the development of high tech gadgetry, people in that world seemed to be very conscious of the possible negative affect of overwhelming underdeveloped or complacent societies, as was seen in the beginning of Star Trek: Into Darkness. I grew up watching the original series. And I have grown up watching TV series and movies develop on Roddenberry's concept. I loved his concept.Star Trek: Beyond has finally taken me to the end of the universe. I cannot see myself trifling with the idea that there is any hope to improve on Star Trek's future. I was OK with ST:2009 and ST:ItD but ST:B left me shaking my head in disappointment and hopelessness. I imagine that a lot of people who liked this movie would probably also make an effort to see Fast and Furious. So be it, I am not one of those people.I cannot blame Justin Lin for my feelings. He is obviously talented. I do, however, blame the entire movie industry. It seems to me that movie trailers are now more important to develop than the movie is. I would have thought that most studios would want their fans leaving the theater with love for the movie as a whole but instead, we now see people talking about "parts" of the movie they liked best. This, of course, does not apply solely to ST:B.While I am not from an underdeveloped world, I feel so many movies like ST:B are senselessly overwhelming people like myself with overwhelming destruction, overwhelming drunken-state and stupid jokes from characters one might think were in a dire situation, overwhelming luck with heavy equipment operation and overwhelming assault on reason.Beam me up Gene, I am overwhelmed and tired of this crap.</fullReview>

Good script by Simon Pegg, paying homage to the original series and a good set of one liners, mostly delivered by Simon Pegg / Scotty. The problem is that reliance on special effects and a continuous roller coaster making some sections difficult makes it a reasonable film, rather than the previous outing with Benedict Cumberbatch as the baddie. If you are a fan of the original (5) series there are many serious plot holes including a complete disbelief of some of the technology &amp; sets. Please keep Vulcans as the unemotional beings, rather than ones with a crush on.... I saw it immediately after Big Friendly Giant, again reliant on CGI but with an excellent script, great characterisation and special effects that made it a delight to watch, not a roller coaster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was a rather mediocre production all around. Too much emphasis on visuals and less focus on plot &amp; character development.All the actors did a wonderful job. I especially enjoyed a more grown up Jim Kirk and I'm a big fan of Idris Elba, even though you don't get to see him much without his make-up &amp; costume. Speaking of which: Kudos for the make-up; there are some really fabulous creations in this movie. Yorktown was visually stunning as well.Now to the not so good: Destroying the ship at the beginning of the movie felt like sucking the air right out of it. The story line was somewhat flat and lacked build-up, even logic. The directing was poor with regard to a lot of the special effect scenes. Fast &amp; Furious came to mind. Fast, shaky and dark action shots fail to engage the viewer's eye long enough to make out and enjoy what you're seeing. Some of the scenes on the planet felt a bit like the old studio shot scenes with fake scenery... like Scotty picking up a clearly fake rock. I also noticed some inconsistencies throughout the story, incl. their outfits - how do they suddenly wear different items of clothing, while stranded on a planet?This may have been my local AMC theater but the sound was off a bit, too. Dialogue was in some parts not loud and clear enough to properly hear what they were saying.I'm predicting that die-hard Trekkies will be disappointed in this installment, maybe more so than I was.It's entertaining but a bit too shallow for my taste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is was a rather average middle of the road movie, definitely the worst of the 3 new rebooted movies. If you are a fan you will probably enjoy it. As someone who was introduced to StarTrek with the reboot I found the first two movies very enjoyable.Unfortunately this one has too many "make no sense" plot points:1. The climax with the music is stupid. What was that the frequency 45.1 Mhz? That's not audible.2. They jammed the ships' communication and they just blew up, so dumb. Also everyone but the villain and Scotty? Convenient is convenient.3. Spaceships are not Yo Yo's they don't take off down to go into space.4. Hundred year old spaceship was remarkably preserved. Including the leather on the furniture on board. 5. Scotty makes 100 year old ship operational in hours, but can't plug in a damn audio cable correctly. Also Scotty makes 100 year old ship operational in hours!6. Villain watches too much V for Vendetta and thinks torture sets you free and makes you stronger.7. Vital space station system doesn't have an emergency shut down or any backup systems. Nor is it equipped to filter out dangerous substances out of itself. Obviously security is also not necessary.8. Spaceships that are hard enough to penetrate the enterprise outer haul in space then burn upon reentering the atmosphere behind that same enterprise that stays intact. While the ships are more aerodynamic and aren't doing an emergency landing unlike the enterprise.9. Villain threatens the lives of millions yet space station has no police forces to dispatch.I could go on, but that would mean wasting my time talking about a movie I didn't like very much.The movie isn't terrible, but it's just blah. It was such a blah that me and my friends skipped our traditional discussion of the movie on the way home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action, explosions and special effects....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether you like the newest Star Trek movie will really depend a lot on what you like in a movie. If you love near-constant action, tons of amazing special effects and explosions, then there is more than enough to delight you. On the other hand, if you want a film that is more plot-driven and a multidimensional villain whose actions make any sense, then you are also in for a big letdown.The plot is very, very simple. Enterprise is sent on a rescue mission that turns out to be a trap. A baddie and his minions attack and blow up a lot of stuff. Most of the crew is taken prisoner or killed and it's up to the rest of the crew to figure out a way to rescue them and save the quadrant. There really isn't much more to it than this.Apart from the breathtaking special effects, the film is nice because like all the newer Trek films, it doesn't all rest on the big three--Kirk, Spock and McCoy. There is a nice ensemble feel to it and everyone contributes about equally. Additionally, the crew's new friend, Jaylah (Sofia Boutella), is an excellent character-- strikingly beautiful and amazingly tough as well as likable. I anticipate you'll be seeing more of her in upcoming installments of the franchise.As far as the bad about the film goes, the baddie is played by the excellent actor, Idris Elba. However, he's hidden under such thick prosthetics through most of the film that he seem wasted at times. Additionally, his actions and motivations just seemed confusing and muddled. Also confusing was the big confrontation scene at the end where he and Kirk square off. Now considering if Elba's character wins, he might be able to kill millions...or more. So what does Kirk do? Instead of instantly killing the guy once he's gotten the upper hand, they stop and chat a bit! What?! Kirk's spent the entire film trying to defeat the guy and the villain is nearly invincible and hell-bent on genocide...you talk and give him a chance to escape?! It just came off as anticlimactic and a bit silly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Produce by JJ Abrams, but not JJ's version of Star Trek, due to a new director at the helm, which I find fascinating as I know, Justin Lin from his run as director of the blockbuster half of The Fast and The Furious Franchise This movie is not the action adventure we saw in the first two segments of the Star Trek reboot or what we see in the Fast and Furious epic. It's episodic the same way Into Darkness was to 2009's Star Trek, but Star Trek Beyond acts so much more like an episode of Star Trek rather than a movie, which I love, because I like Star Trek as a TV series more than I like it as a motion picture.It's not the solar glossy flares that Abrams did (and totally brought life to the dead franchise, so this is not me putting down what the Episode seven director did at all). It's a quiet and slow moving pace that builds on the depth of the characters we know and love and the sophistication of the story, that is more what we expect from Star Trek, but at the same time keeping with the fact that this has to appeal to a contemporary audience. The movie takes place three years into the five year mission (Or when the original series ended). Not the same man who beat the Kobayashi Maru, Kirk realizes his career in StarFleet was more him trying to be like his father than being his own man. They honor the death of Leonard Nimoy with a story in which Spock Prime's death makes Spock contemplate his importance among the Vulcans who are still an endangered species. These guys need a boost in moral.In comes Krall, who sucker punches the Enterprise, forcing them to crash land on a hostile planet so he can get his hands on a weapon he wishes to use to end the Federation. Kirk needs to find his crew and get them off the planet in order to stop this lizard-like dictator's plan The first five to ten minutes of the movie were visually amazing. Wait till you see the space station York Town, it's fantastic. The movie attempts to be big like Abrams, episode Seven, and they did it. The backdrop of the planet was quite nice too, but the Enterprise itself not impressive. It felt too cartoonish (And they seem to always change the look of warp speed in every movie, which I really don't like) Based on the End Credits this seems like the smallest cast of the rebooted movies. It's so sad that Anton Yelchin past away, and even sadder after seeing this movie. Chekov was a big part of Star Trek Beyond, far bigger than he was in the other two movies. I'm glad they made the time to dedicate the movie to him (As well as being in memory of Leonard Nimoy).Not surprising, Simon Pegg got to show off that Mr. Scott was more than just an Engineer (That's what happens when you co-write the film). Not that his role in the other two films were not big and important, but Scotty gets to get out of the engine room and more into the field of action.New Character, Jaylah was a cool addiction to the Star Trek franchise. She became this quick and perfectly done homage to what the whole purpose of Star Trek is about. We meet a new alien and it's all about getting over the culture clash and working together. This happens a few times in the movie, some positive, some not.Idris Elba is a a perfect Star Trek villain. He does this thing were his grasp of the English language is minimal keeping his bad guy speeches to the point. He's proof that it takes a great actor to do the work behind all the make up. Is he better than Khan? Is he better than Cumberbatch's Kahn? Time can only answer this question as it's a close call. Plus Star Trek Beyond gives an impressive effort to be diverse. Not just white guys in alien make up to prove how diverse the Galaxy is, but more different colored faces in the mix to prove how diverse Earth is. In Into Darkness, they showed how natural interracial couples are in the utopian future, and in Beyond they showed us that Same sex marriages exist without making it a big deal (Although the person they pick to show this is a big deal (but no real surprise to any Trekker).Michael Giacchino still makes the awesome soundtrack for the franchise. I love what he does with it and I'm glad he's still doing it cause I do love how it adds to making it feel more like an episode, plus this guy's a boss film composer. It's a fun movie that I want to see over and over again. Abrams got Star Trek back in the game and Star Trek beyond has us playing for keeps. The new pace did take some getting use to, and I spotted some small trivial things that raised my eyebrow (What appears like Dr. McCoy's so-so knowledge of the Vulcan body), but overall, it's more like Star Trek, It uses it's budget to make space bigger and the Galaxy more impressive to watch than making a high octane action movie. It has a top notch villain, and it honors Gene Roddenberry's vision of a world united with a little more vast diversity of cast that mirrors what's happening in the world today.http://cinemagardens.com/?p=71</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Fun Trek Film Since Voyage Home</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing about Beyond is the fact that it fixes to some degree, the two things I had a problem with in the first 2 rebooted films; lack of any good female characters and an absence of the fun tone that made older films so great. While there's still some minor gripes here and there that I had, Beyond is the most fun you'll have with Trek since 1986.It took 4 years for us to get 'Into Darkness' since the reboot in 2009 and it took another 3 years for Beyond to come out on the amply timed 50th anniversary of the series' inception. Even so, the wait was definitely worth it. Not only is Beyond the most fun Trek film in decades, it balances its ensemble cast perhaps better than any previous entry. The fun tone can be attributed to Justin Lin's time spent making the Fast and Furious films but I was surprised at just how well he takes each cast member's strengths and makes one cohesive story.Of course, complementing the cast with a talent like Idris Elba as the lead villain (Krall), doesn't hurt. Khan made his stamp in 2013, but I was open to a different type of villain for this go around, especially because the film takes place entirely in outer space. This opened the door for more aliens, space battles, and plenty of set pieces and well-handled green screen effects. One of those aliens, Jaylah, played by Sofia Boutella, was particularly good.If you think about it, the Star Trek universe has been in need of a strong female character for years. Yes, Uhura is solid, but it seems like that's been it, at least in the reboots. Boutella not only throws some punches in the battlefield, but she holds her own up against Kirk and Scotty, whom she shares the most screen time with. She's definitely someone who I hope to see in future installments.The film starts off with a rapid pace and an epic boarding scene with Krall's crew, but it takes a bit for the pacing to pick up once again. After the Enterprise is taken down, the crew gets separated and I think that's where the story starts to suffer. The cast is so good when they're together, so I didn't find the middle act to be all that compelling.I was glad to see the subtle tributes to Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin, who both passed away since the last Trek entry, amongst balancing this huge spectacle. But yet, still, the best part about this film is how much fun it is from beginning to end. The humor is amped up even though the stakes are the same. Trek is at an all- time high right now. Beyond will be one of the best theater experiences you'll have this summer and such a pleasant surprise for just how weak 2016 has been.+Way more fun than previous entries+Jaylah+Great use of ensemble+Entirely in space-Middle act is sluggish8.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring story, uncharismatic characters and messy shakycam action scenes make this hard to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't watched any of the original series or its follow up of Star Trek. I always found em extremely boring and the lack of major plot lines that continued thruout the series made em totally unwatchable for me. Because of this the first two new Star Trek movies were extremely positive experiences. All my friends complain that they weren't "Star Trek" cos they were too action oriented... If this was the case then this might be a movie that interests fans of the franchise but average scifi loving movie goer is left totally cold. The characters just aren't interesting, they don't have anything that drags the watcher in and the plot in general is way too common and full of plot holes. However what makes the movie total PAIN to watch is the MTV editing where shot rarely lasts more than second and camera IS SHAKY AS H**L!!! Also 3D effects are totally lost since movie is so dark that 3D makes it look blurry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tedious Trek</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Major Spoilers AheadWhile I enjoyed the two recent additions to the series, Star Trek Beyond falls flat. It's definitely a sleek flick and the lack of Abrams-esque lens flares is refreshing, this film just tries too hard and misses some opportunities, save for a few Spock and Bones encounters. I did like the fact that the film presents some questions, particularly in the form of Kirk's character, regarding the mental rigors of space travel.My biggest two complaints revolves around the villain, Krall played by the normally excellent Idris Elba, and his plot. First off, Idris Elba is a much better actor than to be stuck playing a villain that increasingly morphs into none other than a bumbling, incomprehensible version of Khan. As for Krall's plot and speaking of Khan, seeking restitution for his wronged crew...sounds too familiar to me. The swarming ships, or whatever they were, also seem expendable by how easy it was to "sabotage" them.My final complain involves the development of Sofia Boutella's Jaylah character, who does not serve much of a purpose throughout the film.For better modern interpretations of this genre, check out Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Guardians of the Galaxy, both which do a better job putting a new spin on old subjects.2 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another TV episode</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't a movie to be watched at cinemas, its just another TV episode of Star Trek. As for the science there is lots of mambo jumbo and as for social issues the movie promotes gay rights for adoption. There is nothing new in the Star Trek bubble, similar to Star Wars. There was nothing impressive about this episode, you could get 90% of the movie just by watching the trailer. I was expecting more than just the personal and space exploration doubts, i was expecting to see who the confederation became to be a confederation and how earth became a leading party. I Star Trek isn't just action action boom boom it more than that but we never get to see that part because it is boring and no boom boom. Lets hope in the next episode there will be less boom boom and more of politics and exploration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit disappointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first movie of the "trilogy" is by far the best one... the second one was a bit worse... and this last one is slightly a disappointment...There are just too many plot-holes and logical fallacies. It is way too predictable, without any turn of events whatsoever - this is just a standard script movie. It has very good special effects, but still it doesn't change the fact that the writing is taken from a B class movie.Spoiler alert! in the order of annoyingness...1. Really?! blasting bad songs on VHF waves on 50 MHz into space causes ships to explode... gimme a break please... yeah the visual effects of the exploding ships looks cool, but it's one of the stupidest things I have ever heard... 2. On the station they still can't use teleporters to catch the bad guy? only Kirk is the only one on the whole goddamn station who goes after him? no more flying "cars"? 3. Uhura looks at a video for a fraction of a second and instantly recognizes the bad guy? * well that's convenient 4. Really teleporting anyone is impossible from point A, because of interference, but if they move ~100 meters in plain sight to point B, suddenly you can teleport 20 guys at once? and then you teleport 2 people instead of one while they are falling mid air... because they were holding hands... that's cute :) 5. On the space station, they say that the Enterprise is the most advanced ship with the most advanced sensors, and it should be the one to go into the nebula. It gets destroyed, but at the end-movie they have the technology to build it from scratch on the same space station... meh maybe I over-think things...Standard script: Bad guy wants to blow up something, good guy gets his ass kicked then miraculously manages to go after the bad guy and win... nothing like the unexpected destruction of a whole planet in the first movie... But in the end, you should go see the movie... if they lose too much money, maybe they won't make a next one, and I really like Star Trek :P (plus, Sofia Boutella seems to really act well)Please make a proper script for the next one... Thank you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the Star Trek reboot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film. It was everything a Star Trek film should be. It was funny, it was fast, it was thrilling, and it had a great message. In the first film I complained that the new crew was too animated. Kirk and company were like bunch of wild kids who had no idea what they were doing commanding a star ship. I complained that they made Spock too human in the sequel. In this movie, the crew finally found their stride. I finally felt like I was watching the crew that I knew...a well-oiled machine who had their priorities straight. True, this film was a bit formulaic. True the movie included story elements already explored in previous films. Still, it was a ride that I would take again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like this movie. it has potentials.If I was 13 years old, I would have given it 8 However I only gave it a 5 because I am an old trek fan Because there are already so many negative reviews out there I will try to make a positive one: It is one of those movies, which you can go watch with your children. Simon Pegg co-write this one, most of his movie often uses a strange way to smuggle one genre into another (I read it on review about Simon's movie)This trek can be seen as a kid&amp;family movie in a trek format (SpyKids?) A perfect movie for old trek fan with young offspring. I didn't notice any intimacy scenes.(of I felt asleep, disclaimer) The story is quite simple, so most likely children wont bother you much or get bored. They may even like it so much that they become (jj)trek fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>meh - story weak with large plot holes, actors should get writers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't want to put spoilers in this (and haven't). But basically he saves the day after actually being so stupid in the first place. Really, Kirk should have seen this coming and should have gone to Star Fleet jail for his negligence and poor decision making in the first half of the film.Much of the bits that tie the plot together are tied together in a stupid (science fiction can fix it) solution. Plot holes so large you could fly the Enterprise through it. Even the 'solution' to the problem at the end was cheesy and made no sense scientifically or practically.I always like science fiction to ask important questions or make us think in different ways or reflect relevant problems and use the science fiction as an arena to explore this in an interesting way (I, Robot; Blade Runner; Star Trek generations/voyage home etc). This film was none of this. It was a trite story that didn't quite make logical sense and had no real moral context or value. Some obligatory references to the old Star Trek. Some superficial reflection on his life that was contrived and never really resolved meaningfully. This film was made for around 12 year old age range.They didn't really have any character development, certainly didn't make the most of Zoe Saldanha, and I expect she was paid handsomely in a role she would have shined in if she had a half decent script.Despite this, I like the actors and the action was nicely done. I had more emotional response during the trailer than during the film, but I wasn't necessarily bored. Just wish, given the money spent, they would get a decent story and decent writers. Guardians of the Galaxy (closest type of thing I can compare it to) will be a franchise that will take over from Star Trek given this poor outing, and it is a shame, because the actors are all pretty good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . is about to begin in Philadelphia, USA, some folks may see STAR TREK: BEYOND as grossly out-of-step with Hollywood's general @Oscarsopeopleofcolor Liberal Bias. Just think about it. Chris Pine as Captain James T. Kirk appears to be a White guy playing what's essentially the role of an Intergallactic Cop. His job is to Protect &amp; Serve the Universe, as he sees fit. The Starship Enterprise is simply his glorified cop car. Early in BEYOND James stumbles across what turns out to be an 150-year-old Black dude, Balthazar Edison, a.k.a. "Krall." For the rest of this flick, James plays the Popo, out to thwart Mr. Edison at every turn. It's as if Krall is selling singles on the street, and James is trying to put him in a choke hold as Krall keeps gasping "I can't breathe!" James clearly has never heard the phrase "Hands up, don't shoot!" since he beats on the unarmed Sesquicenturion mercilessly for what seems to be the final half hour of BEYOND. James makes the Dallas PD look like Mollycoddlers, as he finally neutralizes Mr. Edison with a fate worse than the Bad Robot which blew up Micah Xavier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"We will find hope in the impossible." Spock (Zachary Quinto) Decades after the TV show, Star Trek is doing the impossible: surviving very well, thank you. Spock's words, too, reflect the youthful spirit of the spaceship Enterprise's mission to seek out newer worlds, etc., with the lan characteristic of the journey and its Captain, James T. Kirk (Chris Pine).By now even the least-enthusiastic Star-Trek fan knows how the story will be told and who the players will be: Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Chekov, et al. Who they don't know is the usual villain like Ricardo Montalban's Khan, so the reliably entertaining Star Trek Beyond introduces us to Idris Alba's Krell, a former soldier turned assassin, not just your garden variety killer but a maniac who has the means to destroy all beings in the universe.That setup is nectar to Captain Kirk and his faithful science companion, Commander Spock. You know how it will turn out, right down to the epic fight between the two alpha males. In fact, this installment feels like a TV episode with the usual stranding on an obscure planet and fight with a deranged dictator.Of more interest is the growing emotionalism of Spock (he's dating Lieutenant Uhura, played by Zoe Saldana). Star Trek has always been superior to Star Wars in the character development department, notwithstanding the brilliant portrayal of Han Solo by way of Indiana Jones. Spock's affection for Uhura is both an interesting addition to Spock's character arc but off-putting as I find it compromising the stalwart, focused science officer of the past.However, that's the charm of the Star Trek canon, enough consistency peppered with change to keep it comforting and exciting. Not to forget a heavy dose of wisecracking humor, more here than in any other iteration. The fellowship the sense of joy offers is amusing and bound to tie me in closer to the franchise than ever before.As too frequently happens in these cosmic adventures, the denouement has a battle over an obliterating weapon. The death-star-like weapon Krell threatens to use is not so great; his bee-like warriors, however, are. They swarm and they destroy, bringing up summers of my fiercely swatting bugs and mosquitoes. Like the Enterprise staff, I usually find the antidote, in my case the zapping lantern.Star Trek Beyond has the usual gorgeous music and fascinating characters; what it doesn't have is enough difference from itself to warrant a claim for genius. That's reserved for the villains and the Captain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly about Terrorism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Star Trek Beyond" is standard-issue Star Trek. There are lots of costumes that aren't all that convincing. There is lots of danger that an evil genius might destroy the universe. There is lots of chasing and gizmo-tinkering that saves the universe at the last minute. It's all completely implausible and runs on arbitrary rules, but that's nothing new for sci/fi or fantasy movies. The special effects of outer space and human habitation of it are higher quality than in the old TV show, of course. Starbase Yorktown is a series of rods radiating out from the center of a transparent sphere. Humans inhabit these rods, all of which appear to have their own gravity. There is no garbage in the streets and everyone is young, beautiful, and healthy, which is kind of creepy if you think about it too long. The main characters perform their old tricks: Kirk is recklessly heroic, Spock is logical, Bones is crabby, Scottie messes with dilithium crystals, Sulu pilots the ship and is shown reuniting with his newly-minted male partner and daughter, and Chekov gets to joke about how a Russian invented something, a Cold-War-era joke that younger people won't understand at all, but that will give Baby Boomer Trekkies a chuckle. Of all the traditional cast members, Chekov is given the least to do. This is rather sad since Anton Yelchin, the actor who plays Chekov, died in a freak accident in June, 2016. There is also Jaylah, a space girl who looks a bit like Darth Maul. In TOS, Kirk was the most heroic. Not so here; everyone shines equally. Every participant wins a trophy. This insistence on making every character as heroic as Kirk lessens the differences between the characters and makes the interplay between the ensemble less fun. The plot involves an evil genius who wants to destroy the universe, and the Enterprise crew stopping him. Star Trek plots are always examined for possible societal significance. This plot may be a reference to The West v. Terrorism. In the beginning of "Star Trek Beyond" Kirk narrates a world-weary monologue. Life is too placid, too predictable. He needs a new challenge. This may be the scriptwriters, including Simon Pegg, who plays Scottie, voicing the post-WWII-era West becoming too comfortable. The villain of the piece, Krall, wants to re-introduce pointless violence and hate into an all-too-comfortable universe. Or maybe not. This is Star Trek; feel free to come up with your own interpretation. The one character change in this reboot that saddens me most is Uhura. I loved Nichelle Nichols' Uhura. I loved her because she was an accurate depiction of a woman in a man's world. I also loved it that she was black. My family were immigrants and her minority status was an inspiration to me. She was a communications officer, the kind of job a woman would typically have. She was in the background, as women often are in men's stories. She was someone I could embrace, relate to, and be inspired by. In the reboot, Uhura is not really African American. Zoe Saldana is a light-skinned Hispanic. Uhura's difference has been toned down. And Uhura has become a leader, an action hero, as karate-happy as Captain Kirk. Conversely, she spends a good amount of her time playing a stereotypical role assigned to ethnic women. She is the hot, exotic temptress who will lure cold Spock into a love relationship. The original Uhura's sexiness was never exploited in this way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad writing unfit for a serious movie, but good for Youtube</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The writing in movies these days seems to be getting more dark, emo, evil, and depressing. For this movie, Star Trek: Beyond, Captain Kirk says some things that the original Captain Kirk would never have said, things which are depressing and hopeless in nature. The original Kirk would have had a more positive and optimistic outlook on life instead of the dark emo outlook of this Kirk which sets the whole mood of the film from the start. The story line and script were lacking in depth, it was good for an amateur attempt you might find on Youtube but, for a serious movie that cost millions? No. The special effects were okay, it seems to be the same thing in all modern movies. All action, all special effects, darker scripts without any real thought in the writing, no real "Star trek" feeling to this either, darker personalities. Characters are becoming something they originally were not, losing their values and losing their identity. It reminds me of the fact that you can go into a video game store and find first person shooters, war games shelf to shelf. All of these movies are turning into the same thing, action and graphics without any real writing, no creativity and no loyalty to the original.</fullReview>

This movie was just bad. And all that nonsense about a 10 second piece with Sulu being gay? That was just wrong. I don't get why George hated it. All you saw was Sulu with his child and his partner. It was just another add/change to the series. The editors cut this movie way too close. There were four of them and they couldn't do a better job? I dislike the word reboot.

		<shortDescription>So much wrong with this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Towards the beginning of the movie, a woman flying an unidentified ship lands in Yorktown, our protagonists' space station. She tells them the location she has flown in from and asks for help, saying that her crew is stranded on another planet. The location of the planet has not been explored by the USS Enterprise, and they know nothing about it.Having virtually no hesitations and asking no questions whatsoever, the USS Enterprise decides to venture into this unknown location almost unarmed to save the woman's crew. The laughable explanation they give is something along the lines of "there's nothing out there that we can't handle!" Approaching the planet, they see a large, dark ship that immediately starts trying to jam their signals (or so they think). When Kirk asks the woman for an explanation, she remains silent. Okay, clearly this woman was hiding something, and nothing good is coming out of this - - time to warp out... right? Nope! "Fire at will!" shouts Kirk, and they fire their tiny arsenal of weak weapons that they equipped for the mission, which of course does nothing to the dark ship. As the USS Enterprise becomes largely decimated, Kirk decides now is the time to warp out. "It's jammed!" comes the response. Oh the tension!These guys are some of the stupidest supposed "geniuses" I have ever seen in a film. You can't have a good movie when its foundation is so absurd. The dialog is also awful, with the scriptwriters deciding that every character needs to spit out corny one-liners all the time in an attempt to be funny or insightful. Though, the vast majority of the time what they say is just shallow, clich, and annoying. And as for character development -- well, there is none. It's just a predictably linear, forgettable film that takes the typical brainless popcorn formula and slaps "Star Trek" onto it to garner more money. A true insult to the viewers' intelligence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond continues the new trilogy's downward trend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a series that was rebooted in such promising fashion with the J.J Abrams directed 2009 film, the freshly polished Star Trek franchise is slowly dying a sad death on the back of Abram's lacking 2013 sequel Into Darkness and thanks to Justin Lin's newest addition simply titled Beyond, this wannabe Star Wars competitor needs a mighty warp speed boost with the already announced 4th film to stay relevant and appealing to audiences who won't likely be remembering this latest addition in the months, yet alone years to come.Despite quite positive reviews, responsive audience reactions and far from terrible opening weekend box office figures, I found Beyond to be a thoroughly so-so experience that has neither any of the first films character strengths, humour, emotion or action memorability that made the 2009 film such a popcorn munching joy.It's hard to know who's exactly at fault for such a bland overall production but the majority of Beyond's weaknesses stem from Sean Pegg and Doug Jung's script, which seems to have suffered from Pegg's recent flow of average works and director Lin, whose found great successes with blockbusters from the Fast and the Furious franchise as well as a couple of rip roaring Community and True Detective episodes but can't infuse Beyond with the spectacle it needed to go toe to toe with modern day audience expectations and with a lacking finale (complete with awkwardly included classical music) the whole narrative of Beyond feels undercooked with an equally bored looking cast.With all the films majors players back once more, Beyond sees the continuation of the staleness that started to develop in Into Darkness from the cast and where key cast members like Chris Pine, Zoe Zaldana and Zachary Quinto all succeeded initially, it's not hard to see that they seem tired of their roles now with only Karl Urban's Bones improving from the 2009 original. In regards to the films newest additions, Sofia Boutella as the determined Jaylah does well with limited opportunities while Idris Elba's Krall performance deserved more airtime with a character that feels far more interesting on paper than what we actually get here and when his plan feels as half-baked as it does, there's never any real sense of what could be lost or gained in the fight between good and evil.Forgoing what makes the series so appealing in theory, whether it be the varied characters, exploration of space (most of the Beyond's runtime takes place on a dodgy looking set) or stunning spectacles, Star Trek: Beyond is a largely unmemorable experience that feels like another step backwards for a series that should now be hitting its peak. Should Star Trek's next adventure be as mediocre as this series entry, it's likely audiences will not be along for the ride for much longer, killing a franchise that should be living long and prosperously for many moons to come.2 "lassies" out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'STAR TREK BEYOND': Four Stars (Out of Five)The 13th 'STAR TREK' movie (and the 3rd installment in the reboot series). This one has the Enterprise crew stranded on an uncharted planet; after their ship is nearly destroyed by an unknown alien race. J.J. Abrams (the director of the previous two films) returned this time just as a producer (so he could focus his time on 'STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS'), and Justin Linn (of 'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS' fame) helmed the movie. Simon Pegg (who also plays Scotty, once again) co-wrote the screenplay, along with Doug Jung. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Zoe Saldana, John Cho and Anton Yelchin (in one of his last film roles) also reprised their parts (from the previous two movies). Idris Elba and Sofia Boutella joined the cast. It's received some of the best reviews, of any film in the franchise, but it's not performing as well at the Box Office, as the last two installments. I enjoyed it, but I also found it to be disappointing. While attempting to help another space crew, the Enterprise is attacked by unknown aliens. They're lead by a warlord named Krall (Elba). Krall is looking for an alien artifact, on board the Enterprise, that's the missing piece of an ancient weapon. He captures a lot of the crew, but Kirk (Pine), and a few others, escape to a nearby planet. There Krall, and his followers, continue to hunt them.The movie is action packed, and the visual effects are impressive. Even with all of the spectacular action scenes though, I still found the film to be a bit boring. I wasn't involved in the story, or any of the characters' drama. It definitely feels like a film where the story serves the action, rather than vice versa. Still, the movie is somewhat entertaining, and it's pretty funny as well (in places).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/176638264</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Enjoyable Sci-Fi Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Trek certainly has come a long way since the 90s with the plethora of series, but then again it probably did need a bit of a break before hitting the big screens again. For those who have been watching the 'reboot' (for want of a better word since it actually came about because of some time traveling anomaly) you are probably aware that they are recast the Star Trek crew though we still have the characters from the original series. However, due to advances in film technology it is much more spectacular than even the series that arose during the 90s. The main characters have also been changed somewhat, particularly Captain Kirk, who is a lot more brash, and rebellious, than the original character. Still, it is Star Trek, and I have to admit that I was never a huge fan of the show in the first place.Anyway, Kirk is on the third year of a five year mission doing what they do best ? exploring. Mind you, he seems to be going through some form of existentialist crisis, particular since the whole idea of exploring is no longer all that fascinating, especially since when everything you discover happens to be the same, so even if you are traveling in places where nobody has ever traveled before, if you aren't actually discovering anything, then are you actually exploring, or are you simply just making marks on a map.Kirk was attempting (rather unsuccessfully) to broker a peace treaty with some rather unusual aliens, and in his possession was an ancient weapon. Mind you, this weapon, as far as anybody was concerned, simply wasn't operating, so they catalogue it, and store it away for future reference. So, they arrive at this pretty impressive star base on the edge of Federation space for a bit of RnR. However an unidentified craft appears and inside is a refugee asking for help to rescue her crew who have crash landed on a planet in the middle of a nearby Nebula. However, when they arrive they discover that they are ambushed by a swarm of ships that are lying in wait.It is a pretty enjoyable film, and it certainly isn't anywhere as wishy-washy as the original series ? there seems to be a lot more guts to it. Mind you, having Simon Pegg involved in the production does mean that it also tends to be somewhat funnier than the previous incarnations were, particularly the opening scene (which is all I'll say, however is typical of what one would expect from British comedy). As for the film, it is your typical science-fiction film, enjoyable if you like the genre, moreso if you are a fan of the Star Trek franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another big budget CGI fest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK I'll just preface this by saying I enjoyed the previous two films a lot, and I do like a bit of well done CGI, despite how it may seem from what I've said below. Sadly this film does not meet the standards set before, and although no aspect of it is terrible, almost every aspect is mediocre or worse. For example the plot is rushed and childish, completely filled with plot holes and clishs. Also the action is so frequent and filled with special effects, that it becomes very boring very quickly. Another thing to note is the massive overuse of CGI, to a point where it's just distracting. Sure, there fun moments, but in the end it's just another blockbuster CGI fest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and thrilling, with the same great characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the 2009 Star Trek. I thought Into Darkness was also pretty good, but it also lacked something the original had and it also was bogged down too much by some unoriginality. Then when I saw the trailer for this (and knew that it was under a different director), my expectations were pretty low. Somehow it started gaining positive reviews and thought that maybe dismissing it beforehand was a mistake. It was. It was a lot of fun, and it's always great seeing these characters interact and engage in adventures together, but I do think that the film could have used a little bit more spark. Like the second, it's suffering from hitting many points that don't add anything new to the series. That sounds like a bad thing, and in a way it's not good, but at the same time the formula they have going on here works very well. Definitely something to seek out among many middling, weak summer films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Against all odds, I kind of liked it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I hate the Abramsverse with all my heart. He took a cerebral, philosophical series and turned into an action franchise. Moreover, ST Beyond is just another take of Into Darkness (without Cumberbatch). Yet I liked it. I was entertained by it.That doesn't mean that I didn't feel that it was less Star Trek than it should have been, but I certainly disagree with people that said that they had the script and they just plastered it over Star Trek. It was the exact same recipe: frustrated angry villain hating the Federation, Enterprise saucer plowing through the earth, jumping around, explosions, heroic sacrifices. Yet it was better held together than Into Darkness.I was kept at the edge of the seat. That is good for a movie, but not a very Star Trek thing. The occasional lapses in logic or explosions of good luck also didn't help it. Yet this is what the audience wants, apparently, even if the cinema hall was almost empty and look here: only 60 reviews. Let us remember that the trend started with a rehash of a very beloved Star Trek film. It was so successful because it was emotional and edge of the seat.Bottom line: J.J. Abrams rebooted Star Trek by erasing Jean Luc Picard and Benjamin Sisko from existence. For him, the only Star Trek captains worth keeping was cowboy James T. Kirk and some memories of Archer, whatever he was. For better or for worse, or until Panasonic sells the rights to Marvel or whatever, we are stuck with this. Given the circumstances, this was a better movie than I had anticipated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me this is the most disappointment instalment of the current Star Trek franchise. The cast and story lines from the previous films have been interesting. Star Trek beyond starts out quite promisingly, but ultimately fails to deliver.The start of the movie finds Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) midway through their tour of duty contemplating the future. This could have been an interesting plot to follow, but unfortunately this is never really explored as the action sequences take over.As is common in many current movies the action sequences are so frenetic it's very hard to work out what is going on. The only real way of telling who's winning the fights is to use the usual rule of thumb. If it's half way through the movie the good guys are probably getting a kicking, but if it's getting close to the end they're going to be fighting back. The action was not engaging and this took up the huge portion of the movie. If you are an adrenaline junkie you'll probably love it, but if you like to engage with the characters then it will probably leave you as cold as it did me.This is very disappointing because overall the cast are good. Let's hope the next Star Trek instalment focuses more on the plot and less on the action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch Star Trek Beyond for its visual appeal, technological brilliance displayed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Trek Beyond, a film by Justin Lin, is the thirteenth film in the Star Trek Film series. This journey of very famous Star Trek film series began in 1966 as a weekly television series. The first film of this franchise was in 1979 (Star Trek: The Motion Picture). Thirteen films have been categorized into 3 phases: 'The Original Series films' having six films, 'The Next Generation films' having four films and 'Reboot Series' having 3 films, including the latest one 'Star Trek Beyond'. Star Trek Franchise also has games, novels, toys, comics, magazines etc. This series is also cited as inspiration for many technological inventions including the cell phones and computers. Their films, technologies were almost always ahead of time. The franchise has chosen to celebrate 50th anniversary with 'Star Trek Beyond'. This is also dedicated to two departed souls of the Star Trek Family ? Leonard Nimov (original Spock) and Anton Yelchin. This one is full of action, rather breathless action. Star Trek has tried to promote the film in India in unique ways. Mumbai skyline has a poster of a giant Starship Enterprise. Promoters also decided to do a 'Spaceship Activation' in a Mumbai suburban mall with a huge remote-controlled 'spaceship'. The film begins with Captain Kirk's efforts to trying to bring peace between the Federation and extra-terrestrial planet. Initial frames also show the bond between Spock and Kirk. Whereabouts of a ship and the instructions of rescuing the same make Captain Kirk and crew of the enterprise travel to the alien planet for one of the most dangerous mission. Rest of the story revolves around, what all challenges they face during their journey. The major challenge comes in the form of antagonist Krall, whose real identity is revealed towards the end of the film. Even the reasons / logic of Krall to destroy the Enterprise are shown in the last frames.Although action dominates in the film, it has its own moments of romance, humour etc.'Star Trek Beyond' turns out to be brilliant with its visual appeal, technological brilliance displayed and also the message conveyed to have a vision of humanity that is undivided due to caste, creed, sexuality. Watch the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Horrible Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The worst ever in the new series from J.J.Abrams. The plot was so cheesy and not original. All most everything was so far fetched (even for Sci-Fi). A lot of "suspending your disbelief" to watch this movie. "Aww come on!" will be your most recited internal thinking-to-yourself phrase. I was very disappointed, no way will I purchase this one when it comes out on DVD. Good special effects, but don't all modern sci-fi movies have that? It would be nice if they spent more time on making the plot and logistics believable. I hope that J.J. learns from this horrible plot and give their fans more for their money. You'd think with all the money available, the writers could come up with better story lines. At least make it plausible (even in sci-fi terms). The first two movies JJ made had that, this one did not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mostly this movie left me confused and a little bit angry. Not hugely angry, just the sort that makes you want to slam a door but by the time you get around to it you've gotten over it and just close the door.I'm going to start by acknowledging that they fixed the annoying things from the last movie. They made actual use of the characters beyond Kirk and Spock and great to see Karl Urban's fantastic Bones getting more of an opportunity. Zoe Saldana's Uhura returned to having a personality. Scotty and his little mate (whose name I cannot remember) became less like an awkward stand-up duo. We even had a fun new character in the form of Jaylah.So, having made use of great characters being well acted, it all turned to custard. SPOILERS AHOY Can anyone explain what Krall's motivation was? Why did he need the Abrimoth (or is that a cleaning product? Now you too can have a shiny bathroom thanks to the superior cleaning ability of Trek's new Abrimoth!). Did nobody bother looking at the nebula next to the giant, impractical space station? The whole radio frequency thing (lazy!)! Actually, I'll nip that rant in the bud and summarise the negative aspects of this movie as 'plotholes and highly illogical, Captain'.Just on a technical note, the swoopy camera action left me feeling extremely nauseous (especially after consuming eight cubic metres of popcorn) and frankly it was hard to tell what was going on - bring back the lens flare, all is forgiven...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Exactly ten movies after they last lost him?The Search for Spock? continues! Kinda. (Paramount, permission granted to use that as your BluRay box pull- quote.)Okay, fine, that's just one teeny bit of probably sixteen story lines, but thought it fit nicely with the episode numbers 3 and 13.But, it does bring up a good point. I think this movie is one to see at least a few times to absorb everything thrown at us here. So many details, subplots, new relationships, sexual orientations, plot points? all meshed together and most barely pan out. Sure, there's always the main plot line: while Kirk is already bored with being a captain with not as much action as he thought there would be and Spock still thinking about events two movies prior, yet another villain is bent on bringing down the Federation. That's the real two- cent breakdown of the film, but, of course, it wouldn't be two hours based on that. Especially not for a Star Trek chapter.The bulk of the movie happens after the Enterprise is lured into an uncharted area where they (because, movie) conveniently can't communicate with Starfleet and the crew gets stranded on a planet, separated (see? they were looking for Spock for a bit) and they must band back together to save mankind?yet again.I'm sounding like I'm dumping on the movie, and in fact, I enjoyed it. The first two acts were mostly 'eh' with the exception of one fantastic space battle scene and some genuine comedy, but it was the third act that really shined. Loved the finale and seeing everyone work together as a team. As a family.I will have to see it again, probably at home, to, again, take it all in. I think it will be more enjoyable then. Plus, the movie is rather dark?ly lit, so a lot of it was hard to see for a good portion.It's certainly not a bad film, does feel like a bigger budgeted, extended TV episode and it has enough for any Trekkie to enjoy. Plus, I did like the side actors, the cameos, the homages and revolution of one main character's love interest, though if you weren't paying attention (OR SOMEONE DIDN'T SPOIL IT FOR YOU BEFORE THE MOVIE CAME OUT, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE,) it might have been missed. Sadly, I would've liked to see more on that and not have it just in the background.At any rate, it's worth it to see. Not my favorite Star Trek, but it's way hard to top The Undiscovered Country, First Contact, the 2009 reboot, The Wrath of Khan, The Voyage Home and Into Darkness.***Final thoughts: Oh, and please tell me Jim takes out Federation insurance on the damage he causes, inadvertently or not, to either the countless number of Enterprise ships or his crews. Or was he dropped by now? Yeah, he had to have been dropped by all Federation insurance companies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>York Town</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I dedicated my summary line to this "station" created in space because it is without equals the most exquisite set piece in space Sci-fi movies to-date. To those of us who had their initiation to space sci-fi in "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968), it was quite a thrilling experience to see an environment where gravity is created, where "up" is simply the opposite direction of what your feet are standing on. Four and a half decades later, while fundamentals remain the same, we marvel at "Elysium" (2013). While gravity is still generated by a revolving wheel as in the spaceship of "2001", the "wheel" is now an entire city complete with lakes and forests in addition to exquisitely landscaped dwellings as well as business high-rises. But then, York Town completely dwarfs Elysium. The complex structure is nothing less than mind-boggling. You have to see it to appreciate it.All this is in no way intended to undermine the crew that, after two instalments of the Star Trek reboot, needs no introduction. No apologies therefore for completely omitting the names of this excellent second generation cast at this point. I shall mention here two newcomers. The villain, who invariably gets vanquished at the end and therefore appears in only one instalment, is played by Idris Elba, known for his top-notch portrayal of Nelson Mandela. He is however probably better known as the guardian of the portal that joins the nine worlds. Possibly to stay is a friendly alien who ends up being invited to join the Enterprise crew, Jaylah (sounds a bit funny, like "jailor", when spoken), played by Sofia Boutella, lovely 34-year old Algerian-born actress Sofia Boutella. In colour-skin-neutral makeup, she can be mistaken for Hilary Swank. "Possibly" I said because Alice Eve who looked promising in the last instalment isn't around this time.The plot line, as in trillions of action movies of all genre, involves a coveted object. Referred to as "the artifact" in this movie, this is a disc-shaped devise that can kill en masse. That is all we need to know. In order to get it, Krall the villain kidnaps shiploads of crews from various space vehicles.With Star Trek movies, I find that the journey is often more enjoyable than the final destination. While there are mandatory plot twists and "revelations", the plot line here is sweetly simple, linear, for one things. Thirty minutes into the movie, we see Enterprise crashing, completely demolished. The cast is split into various pairings. Bones struggles along with a pretty badly hurt Spork after patching him up the best he can. Uhura and Zulu are the two that find themselves in Krall's concentration camp. Captain Kirk and Chekov survive some double-crossing. The light moments come from Scotty's encounter with Jaylah who initially addresses him with a formal "Montgomery Scott". "Scotty" he suggests, in response to which she calls him "Montgomery Scotty". Meeting Captain Kirk later, she calls him "Jamesty". Eventually everybody get back together for the grand finale, as expected.Some critics criticize (surprise!) this movie for not giving the characters enough depth. I am not sure how high is depth of characters in the priority list of a general Star Trek fan. I would suggest that "Star Trek Beyond" delivers. This is what a Star Trek fan would like to see in future instalments of the Star Trek legacy, now rebooted, with an excellent cast/crew comprising Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, John Cho and Anton Yelchin who, sadly, died last month from accidental cause. This movie was initially dedicated to the memory of Leonard Nimoy, the original Spock, as shown in the closing credit. To that is now added "for Anton".</fullReview>

But the worst thing was the lack of concepts and ideals which inspired for years the "trekkies". if Spook and Kirk could have seen this film they would have said what they said in Star Trek IV: " -This is an extremely primitive and paranoid culture .... - Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with, shall we say, more colorful metaphors, "double dumb-ass on you" and so forth." - Oh, you mean the profanity? - Yes. - Well that's simply the way they talk here.

		<fullReview>I love star trek but what Abrams has done now is just horrible. Yes the cast is good, the script... not so much. The fans are getting sick and tired of the "Explosions" and CGI (which is about 75% of the movie) and come to think of it, the latest star trek has way too many similarities with star wars. Thus the title: lots of Flash but no substance.I will not run through everything that is wrong with the movie because it will make this review so long nobody will read it anyway.All in all just another hyped up movie ( like the latest star wars movie TFA) with parallels with the first movie of 2009. If you like star trek i advise you to wait until the film comes out on bluray or is available on hulu, vudu, Netflix or any other streaming service. It is not worth the theater ticket. Conclusion: 5/10 an average movie that flirts with clichs, bad script and even worse CGI" explosions" ( but they that is Abrams for you)</fullReview>

He destroys the Enterprise, but Kirk and company eventually show up to save the day at the very last moment. The End.The bad guy ends up being some ex-military guy from before the Federation. Apparently, he's been stranded on some planet for so long and/or longs for the "good old days" of wartime so much that he wants to bust up the Federation so that the military days will return. As plot-twists go, it's pretty weak.The old, worn-out "hive mind" concept allows Kirk, etc. to bust up the bad guy's fleet, and Kirk manages to get rid of the super-weapon at the very last moment.There's no meaningful story, other than an under-explored back-story that the entire incident manages to convince both Kirk and Spock to stay on the Enterprise (the Enterprise "A", now).The Spock/McCoy relationship gets the most attention, while the Spock/Kirk and Spock/Uhura relationships get almost none at all.I don't blame the actors. They all did just fine. They just didn't have a decent story to work with.I continue to feel that Karl Urban as McCoy is doing the best job. He's really "owning" the character, but putting his own spin on it as well. I was happy to see Urban get some decent screen time in this film.I wouldn't even buy the DVD for this one.

		<shortDescription>Star Trek finds its way back to celebrating diversity and integrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The USS Enterprise continues its exploration of space, the final frontier, in Star Trek: Beyond, the third film in Star Trek's newly named Kelvin Timeline which rebooted the popular franchise in 2009. Taking a change of course for the series, previous director J.J. Abrams stays on as producer while giving the helm to new director Justin Lin, probably best known for his work on the Fast &amp; the Furious films. Lin's style here is immediately noticeable, with that almost too quick pacing that was inherit to his previous work keeping the film progressing and interest high as scenes bombard with spectacularity. While the film rarely slows down to allow quieter, more dramatic moments to fully play out and become too significant, Star Trek's main themes of compassion, diversity and unification are back in full force, and it is just wonderful.Simon Pegg, who stars in the film as Scotty, also takes over writing chores with Doug Jung, and their love for Star Trek is more than apparent, giving it a stronger likeness to the original series than the previous two films. Although some smaller plot elements and details fall between the cracks, it never upsets the cohesive feeling of joy, humanity, morality and hope that the movie instills, even in general midst of trying times. And it's all done in style, with unbelievably gorgeous set productions, intricate creature make-up effects, wonderful special effects and an overall vibrant visual flair, without too many lens flares on the ship.A captain is only as good as his crew, and this ensemble is just that: a great crew. It is lovely that science fiction is what seems to be paving the way for more inclusion amongst lead roles in Hollywood and, although Star Trek has been groundbreaking with its diversity before, it is quite thick and palpable here. These characters showcase different races, sexes, sexualities, even species. Newcomer Jaylah is fantastic, able to break the mold and give strength and softness, power and vulnerability all simultaneously without having to succumb to just being a side character or love interest. In fact, the lack of a serious love story in a major American motion picture is a wonderful relief in itself, letting the characters grow organically as individuals. Yet, they are each also multifaceted, not defined by just being a woman, or just being gay or just being black, but rather they are each a whole developed person that just happens to have all these wonderful traits. And while the story allows for each of them to show what they're worth and their own individual importance, the true grit of the movie is how important they are to each other and how each one makes the crew stronger, especially in times of devastation.This is about camaraderie and overcoming. This is what can happen when a true group, family, or crew is formed, allowing them all to bring their strengths to work together as a whole for the greater good, all while keeping their integrity, moral compass and prime directive not only in tact, but front and center. It's a bittersweet family with the recent real life death of actor Anton Yelchin who plays Chekov, but what an astounding lasting legacy and final film to be associated with. With Beyond, Star Trek finds its way back to those important ideals that originally set the franchise apart from other outer space adventures, a great gift to its fans on the 50th anniversary of the original series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been a Star Trek fan from the very beginning. This is not what i consider Star Trek. This is a loud, action oriented dumpster fire. Star Trek has been characterized over the years by the interactions between the characters. The action was only there for support of the story. This is certainly not the case in Star Trek Beyond. I do like the actors that have been cast in the main character roles, BUT the characters really have nothing to do with the story. You could insert about any group of characters from many other movies and get the same results. I went hoping to see a continuation of Gene Roddenberry's vision of interaction between life forms from all over the universe but was sorely disappointed. I can't recommend spending two hours of your life watching this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh where do I begin? First, the movie feels like its about 4 hours long. It goes on and on and on. It is basically one endless, mindless battle scene. Absolutely no character development at all. No deep meaning about anything, a bare bones plot that has been done a million times before on every syfy series ever made. One implausible situation after another. The guy who plays Bones is HORRIBLE! Where did they find this guy? working at the Kraft Services table? I mean I've seen some bad acting but this guy just might beat Pauly Shore in July Duty. Idris Alba is completely wasted in a two minute cameo and the cast seems to just be calling it in on this one. This is the point in a franchise when things either get better or jump the shark into Joannie Loves Chachi territory, this piece of junk not only jumped the shark, it landed in a pit of honey badgers and is a chewed up, torn up mess. Do not waste your money on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I could, I'd give this a nice big goose egg, but unfortunately, I can't.I had the misfortune of watching this pile of vomit yesterday, and lemme tell ya, it's so bad, you can't even laugh while watching it. You find yourself sitting in disbelief that a movie based on an epic oldschool television series could be so horrible. The dialogue alone was enough to make me want to kill myself, but it was so much worse than that.Don't get me wrong, I'm not just a lame fan boy who is all upset because Sulu doesn't have his hetero flair anymore. And I'm also not a boring troll who will sit and trash any movie he can for fun. I happen to love the whole Star Trek saga, and I have since I was little, but I'm also a realist and know that things need to be changed for them to sell out.This movie, however, is a piece of crap on so many levels.For example, I'm also a big fan of Harry Potter books. I hate the 'Prisoner of Azkaban' due to so many liberties being taken with the film. However, after re-watching it, I still have to respect that it is a good, well-made film. 'Star Trek Beyond' is just straight-up terrible in every possible sense of the word.Now, some of the fight scenes are decent, most of them are not (a lot of unnecessary slow-motion). That scarcely makes up for the wooden, horrible acting on display. Zachary Quinto is probably the most un-emotional actor I've ever seen. I've never met a more unlikeable hero; in fact, I hated him. Anyone who knows Spock from the television series.. Could you imagine hating Spock? Kirk himself was scarcely in the movie, and he did nothing. Scotty also has a random magical sidekick who never speaks and does all of his bidding. So, the only thing this movie really stirs up is apathy, as I couldn't even force myself to care about any of the characters.All in all, if you are the type of person who likes to watch bad movies for their comedic value, this one is priceless. From a slow motion crying scene to the most predictably bad cheesy dialogue ever, this one has it all. To be fair, Yelton is pretty entertaining as Checkov. Oh, and there is no shortage of cleavage shots, for you guys out there.1/10 on a film scale 9.5/10 on an unintentional comedy scale</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a disappointing addition to what has been a very solid franchise so far. The crew of the Enterprise blunders into trouble because apparently none of them have any common sense. The trouble is resolved in a way that is more comical than legitimate, and it really doesn't work.I take a bit of an issue with plots like this because we know that there's no stakes. A Star Trek film needs a specific cast to appease people, thus, we cannot truly feel scared for these characters. I know we need conflict to create drama, but I just feel like it could have been done a different way.This film opens with a five-minute long voice-over by Kirk. I know that we need to learn about what has happened to the crew of the Enterprise since the last film, but we could have done it in a way that isn't such a massive chunk of exposition. This glacial pace and exposition- heavy dialogue doesn't let up until the second act turning point, but by then, it's too late to drag this film back from the breach. Although the third act is a semblance of a saving grace, it's just not enough to help this film maintain audience interest.There's some neat spaceship stuff that would be worth seeing on the big screen, but in all, this film is a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Beyond Reproach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thus far critics have been lauding Star Trek Beyond as the film that finally brings the Star Trek (1966-1969) ethos into the rebooted series. Like it or not the J.J. Abrams films are now considered mere auditions to The Force Awakens (2015). Indeed, even a glancing look will reveal shades of Star Wars (1977) in everything from the rumble atop the drill in the first film to Khan's monologue-ing in the second. Personally, I'm of the opinion that while Star Trek (2009) is an absolute treasure, Star Trek Into Darkness (2013) felt like the seventh season of a dying TV show.I am however not of the opinion that Star Trek Beyond is a homecoming but more like a best case scenario negotiating the original show's heavy political and philosophical themes with the reboots sleek aesthetic. That best case scenario is even more impressive when you consider director Justin Lin's resume includes the Fast and Furious (2001-2015) let's say "renaissance".Star Trek Beyond begins with Captain Kirk (Pine) contemplating a quarter-life crisis of sorts. He's about to celebrate a birthday marking him one year older than his father ever was. He's considering hanging up his captain's hat and taking an admiral-ship with Star Fleet. His plans are put on hold when the Enterprise is tasked with a search and rescue mission in a unexplored part of a far-away nebula. Once there the Enterprise is ambushed by a mysterious foe named Krall (Elba) who wants a seemingly useless trinket aboard the ship. The Enterprise is overrun, the crew impressed and the bridge's officers are marooned on separate parts of a desolate planet.Captain Kirk's moments of characterization are mirrored almost perfectly by Officer Spock's character arc which has him contemplating resigning from Star Fleet to aid Vulcan diaspora. While not as laced with Kentucky whiskey as Kirk's thread, Spock's stakes are much higher for himself and his people, therefore we immediately gravitate towards him just like audiences did back in the 60s. That's one thing this film got right, it wisely focused emotional heft on the franchise's mascot.Another thing the film got right is it divided it's focus on some choice side characters, the most prominent of which is fellow marooned starfarer Jaylah (Boutella). Trapped on Krall's inhospitable planet since childhood, Jaylah's resourcefulness and stubborn individualism channels the young Jennifer Lawrence in Winter's Bone (2010). The moment she saves the shipwrecked Scotty (Pegg) from fellow scavengers, she immediately becomes the power source this film orbits and it's all the better for it.The theme of the day in Star Trek Beyond is unity. The unity of the Enterprise's crew is tested against the power of Krall and his army of drones who seems to know all about the Federation of Planets. Krall goes through great pains dismantling the morale of the imprisoned crew and Lieutenant Uhura in particular. "Unity is not your strength. It is a weakness," says Krall in a quick deconstruction of his plans. Yet his machinations for Star Fleet are conspicuously left out until a third act reveal that is reminiscent of Shinzon's character arc in Star Trek: Nemesis (2002). Not only that, he's a surprisingly layered foil to the equally embittered Jaylah who's been alone for so long she has no concept of unity.In it's entirety, this film is not Beyond certain genre limitations. While scribes Simon Pegg and Doug Jung channel the original germ in the screenplay, the film still feels like it's in the wrong tempo leaving too little in the film's quieter moments while racing towards the next action set-piece. Visually the film sneaks in a few literate allusions (not to mention references to other parts of the Star Trek universe) yet Lin's showy camera-work proves distracting, especially when he hammers home the "what's up is down" motif.Beyond may not be the "return" of Star Trek's brand of unapologetic, cerebral sci-fi. That torch has been passed to Doctor Who (2005- Present) quite a while ago. Judged purely by the movies, Star Trek Beyond is somewhere between The Voyage Home (1986) and First Contact (1996). As a contemporary action film/sci-fi space adventure it's arguably among the best you'll see this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Trek Beyond (Interesting)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that whilst not a "trekkie" I really enjoyed the first rebooted Star Trek film and was interested in going to watch this new one. What I hadn't reckoned on though was the change in writers, who's poor quality shows instantly, poor interaction, forced humour, awful pacing and general lack of plot (but full of holes)It's not a terrible movie so I'll start with good, the opening battle (aka the trailer) is very watchable and the dissection of the enterprise is very impressive. There is a very heartwarming tribute to Leonard Nimoy early on and, unless it is just a huge coincidence also one to Anton Yelchin during the "absent friends" toast at the end. These were nice touches in the movie.Unfortunately as with most reviews it's much easier to pick out the bad points so here goes. Whilst most of the main crew get plenty of screen time you never really bond with any of them, character subplots are raised then ignored - Kirk wishing to leave the Enterprise, Spock also wanting to leave to "repopulate his planet" and also his split with Uhura (Are they back together at the end?). New addition Jaylah tells how her father was killed by "Manas" whilst she escaped yet I'm pretty sure he wasn't even on screen before then so you have no idea who he is, and when the customary revenge fight happens it's awful - and she doesn't even get revenge as they just transport out of there and leave him!?Scotty has also become one of the most annoying characters in the franchise now, clearly Simon Pegg has given himself more lines and tried to make himself a better character, but should spend less time spouting nonsensical science jargon and more time practice his Scottish accent - which isn't just saying "Lassie" in every line - They generally just aren't that interesting in this film.Bones is probably the best character in the film as well as Chekov, which makes his passing even more tragic. There's no sense of dread in the film as the crew never seem in danger at any point, every obstacle they encounter is instantly overcome by fixing this and rerouting that?! It really doesn't in- still any sort of fear that some of the crew might not make it, though I suppose they ruined that in the last film by killing off Kirk and bringing him back to life in the next scene..!The biggest problem though is the awful "villain". His story arc is that he wants this all powerful weapon that is never explained aside from some "Ancients used it a while ago", to get revenge on the federation as when he was promoted from a soldier to a captain after his company got taken over by Starfleet, he gets disillusioned with it and ends up stranded on a planet and is "abandoned" by the federation.Several issues with this stand out - He has the most amazingly effective fleet of ships you've seen on the screen (Despite the awfully ridiculous method in which they manage to destroy the entire fleet of them...!) and nearly succeeds in destroying the federation without even using the weapon, so at no point do you think he really needs the weapon in order to win. I don't even understand how it works - he plugs it in to a door at first, then later just turns it on?! Second of all he says he was abandoned by the fleet when he crashed on this planet, yet Sulu and Uhura find he has access to all the current federation database files and has also "rerouted" the distress signal that should alert star fleet, so it makes no sense that he wants to destroy the federation because they abandoned him when it appears that he had the tools/opportunity to get in touch with them anyway??There are other little things that gripe me -Why did the secret to prolonging life that Krall found turn him in to a weird looking monster?-If Krall was previously a decorated star fleet officer, why did no one know what had happened to his ship when Scotty explains to Kirk about the Franklin? Would it not be on record that the ship was lost with the crew in this area?-Whilst he may no longer need it, why would Krall never think to go look for his ship after he had crashed landed? Kaylah makes a point of cloaking it but surely he would know whereabouts he crashed?-How come Scotty can only beam Bones and Spock one at a time "To be safe" but can suddenly fix the transporter to beam 20 people at a time 10 minutes later?-Why did the plan to disrupt the swarm by interfering with the radio frequency suddenly change to "This will cause ships to just explode" instead?-If this was indeed the plan and I missed that point then what was the point of Bones/Spock stealing ship in order to "confuse the swarm" if the ships were just going blow up anyway when the frequency changed?-In fact hang on - why didn't their ship blow up too!?-If they knew where Krall was going when he gets in to the space port why didn't a crew of security guards go with Kirk instead of leaving him on his own?The more you think of this story and plot it appears to have more holes than a sieve!!If you're a die hard fan then you will probably like this but if you're a casual fan like me you probably won't think it's any good, in my opinion it's easily the weakest of the franchise and overall I just generally found it boring!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood ate Star Trek and pooped out this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Be forewarned that I grew up with Star Trek and so my opinion is a little biased.The Star Trek world used to differ from the Star Wars world significantly, but they're slowly merging under the mismanagement of Hollywood's big earners. It's a sorry situation which leaves very few (any?) sci-fi franchises worth following these days. The Star Trek movie before this one rated a 7, for me, and left me with hope that perhaps the team would pull up their socks and do better, but instead they did the opposite.With such a large budget they could easily hire a few physicist consultants to at least get some of the science into the realm of the believable. Are they going to introduce a version of "The Force" in the next movie? Is that where we're going?The sound effects were overdone. Way, way overdone. I know, the sound effects guy has to play his part, but I think it's time we admit that not everything makes a sound when the camera passes by it.The music could have been brought down a few notches. Not in volume but in frequency. It takes away from the movie when there is continuous music. The costumes were... wow. Did anyone even try to use their imagination with these? Really? Hundreds of years from now and everyone dresses like the early 21st century when they're not in uniform? Do we still dress like people from medieval England today? Just make up something!The antagonist? How clich. How very clich. How disgustingly, insultingly clich. Have we run out of ideas already? No. The people who wrote this movie had no ideas, so they remembered ideas other people had.The special effects were good. Really quite good. But they can't replace a story. They can't make up for an overzealous sound team.Thanks, Hollywood, you just convinced me that I'm going to watch more foreign films from now on. And when I want some English sci-fi, I'm just going to have to read a book.I just arrived home from the theatre and I'm still fuming, so maybe I'll feel differently tomorrow and change my review... probably not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now I Know How Voldemort Felt When A Horcrux Was Destroyed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part of my childhood died watching this movie.Star Trek Beyond is directed by Justin Lin, of Fast and Furious pedigree, and it shows. The movie feels like 2 parts F&amp;F #47, 2 parts Guardians of the Galaxy, and not quite one part Star Trek: The Original Series (ToS), just to be sure these is no mistake about whose memory is being desecrated.What was good? There were some moments where the Kirk/Spock/Bones chemistry didn't feel forced. Karl Urban is good. Anton Yelchin is very good as Chekov, which only adds to the sadness at his untimely passing. Zoe Saldana is Zoe Saldana, which is never a bad thing...aaad... I had some good father/son bonding time....that pretty much covers it.Bad? Well, just about every single scene with technology just treats it as if it were magic. Given how much technical sophistication is involved in the filming, it somehow manages to feel less realistic than the cheesy sets of ToS. There is never an impression that this is a working universe. Part of this is due to the use of CGI instead of scale models. The excessive CGI triggers your brain's BS detector. The physics of the CGI scenes all looks fake, which pulls you out of the moment. And this complaint doesn't even get into how little actual _thought_ went into the science. Essentially every scene with tech is cringe-inducing. Think "red matter" on steroids. Next movie, just give all of the engineers magic wands and stop even pretending to have any Sci in your Fi.We live in the age of Rey. Every important female character must be a self-taught ninja master/Nobel laureate/engineering whiz/heart-of-a-lion combo. Because grrlll power and Reasons. also, Shut Up! At least Zoe Saldana's Uhuru seems to have earned her competence. Sophia Boutella's Jaylah, just like Star Wars' Rey, is exactly the kind of omni-competent, attractive female character that lazy writers seem drawn to these days. I guess she helps achieve gender and alien balance for the inevitable sequel, so...yay? But, now that I think about it, is Jaylah even an alien? This is a pet peeve with the new series, but lordy, don't we have enough bipedal, slight variations on the humans-with-prosthetics alien races in this universe? ToS, probably for budgetary reasons as much as anything, treated its alien species with enough restraint that most had some kind of back story. The current Star Fleet is just the Star Wars Cantina with better music (more on the music later). At a certain point, the director has to tell the costume designer and make-up artist "enough". (Also, maybe spend a little more time on Zach Quinto's hair? There was a girl with a working prehensile ridge on the back of her head who looked more realistic than Spock's haircut.) The villain...I can't even...There is just too much. For simplicity, let's just say that it is _almost_ worth watching this just to see how nonsensical a villain's motivation and back story can be. This is like teaching tape for bad writing.Finally, and (MINOR SPOILER for a plot point that you will see unfolding when it occurs. The characters will build up to it in a way that will generate dread. "No" you will say. "That's not where they are going! It can't be!?! No!". ) But it is. I swear to God I am not s_itting you about this.Rock and Roll Saves the Day.I know you don't believe me. I saw the movie, and I barely believe me. But it is true. It was like the first Independence Day, where they uploaded a "virus" into an alien ship and shut down an entire alien fleet.Only worse.Anyway. This was not an entirely unentertaining movie. It just wasn't Star Trek. The spirit of optimistic exploration, adventure and wonder has been replaced with frenetic action, loud noise, and CGI. If that's your thing, you will like this. I'd argue that there was space in the world for a different type of sci fi: thoughtful, at times whimsical, and still great fun. In fact, there _still is_ that space, it just is no longer filled by the Star Trek franchise.If the closing credits had said "Dancing on the Grave of Gene Roddenberry", I would just have nodded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed bag, ultimately a miss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Star Trek was rebooted by JJ Abrams, he made some subtle but important changes that differentiated the new and old Star Trek. This latest movie was made by an old school trekkie fan.Abrams took the jargon out of the series and added a lot more heart. Justin Lin has added the jargon in spades and taken out the heart. There are many techno-babble lines like "the flux capacitor isolator stabiliser inverted during a catastrophic recalibration". Yeah, whatever. It was especially tiring and left me feeling babble fatigued. Grrr!The acting was stiff, except Chris Pine (James Kirk) who carried the emotional weight of this movie. Zoe Saldana actually acted quite well. She had one mildly aggressive moment, which wasn't particularly over the top. It was such a refreshing change that it shocked me.Zac Quinto and Karl Urban, both solid actors, were flat and not on their game. Zac was OK, but Karl totally missed the mark with lines that were more like a worn tyre than being fresh and snappy.Irdis Elba was your typical one-dimensional, purposeless villain. Irdis was unusually bad because of his lack of spirit.However, the worst actor goes to Jaylah. She was your typical hyper aggressive ninja-warrior, scientist, super marksman who could out- fight anyone - but couldn't hold an accent. Some of the scenes (eg. where Scotty lamely picks up a rock, in effect, being Jaylah's wingman, were just pathetic). Do feminists have such a low self- esteem that we need these ridiculous, over the top characters like Jaylah? They're an insult to capable women, and I'm married to a very capable one - it's just insulting.It's not often I bite my fist to dull the pain watching a movie, but this was the first movie this year that was that painful (and that's no exaggeration - I had teeth marks in my knuckles for a day). I couldn't wait for the movie to end. I didn't care about the characters (except James Kirk). The story was not bad, but, the acting was particularly painful. The special effects were excellent as was the cinematography.If you like the old StarTrek, you'll probably like this movie. If you prefer the newer, more heart-felt Star Trek movies, you most probably won't like it.This is the first movie i've given 2/10 in a long time. Other than this exception, it's mostly been a great year for movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Not Star Trek.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This new franchise relies heavily upon special effects and not upon developing a good story. The premise of the movie is pretty preposterous (which I will not delve into in this review). I think that when you start to no longer recognize much of a difference between 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek' (in that the latter increasingly is looking more like another splashy effects space adventure, with little or no intelligence required or the raison d'etre behind it all, which was Gene Roddenberry's vision) it is time to pack up and go home. Gene Roddenberry created 'Star Trek' because he felt that the complex plight, tragedy, and beauty of humanity could be expressed in a thoughtful rendering through a space adventure. But it was not the special effects, explosions, etc. that drove his vision. It was the intellectual exposition of topics relevant to the human experience. The adventure may have played out in a cosmological forum we cannot identify with (at least yet?), but we could identify with the human stories, with the intellectual pursuit of exploration of 'new worlds and new civilizations'. If Gene were alive today, he would be shocked to see that the vision he created is now summer movie garbage. And this is what this movie is. If you do not believe me, watch any of the original series or Star Trek: the Next Generation. I have nothing to learn from this slop that is fodder for the dumb, which is aimed at the wit-dulled common denominator that is increasingly the movie-going audience of today (which expects explosions every couple minutes, lest it gets bored and no longer pays any attention). If you want explosions and special effects, this film has it. But if you want Star Trek, THE Star Trek genre that we all used to love from days of old, I have no idea what this is. It might as well be 'Space Explosions 3000'.</fullReview>

And, perhaps not. Actually, not. More likely you will hate the one who "stole" solution from a good movie and "gotten" it in his feeble and pathetic made desperate clip. It's not only stolen ideas.

In the movie "The Day the Earth Stood Still" (2008) and we have swarms, even the way the flight is completely identical ... but ... do not we do now in the details ... There's more, these "borrowed" things, although in my opinion still above what the movie was made hastily, as there is no rhythm, no story, the actors as if they were mannequins in shop windows, plastic, lifeless and impeccably dressed ... this movie is not good, period. They are not Star Trek from that time when Kirk's communicator took us into a state of rapture and thinking about the future and what it brings to us and someone has to lead to the discovery of today's cell phones. This movie we might return to the banana tree.</fullReview>

I am getting more and more disappointed with this genre, there doesn't seem to be any creativity in the stories. The action scenes were so protracted, I was bored.

(Yes I know there's villains in all Star Trek movies but not like this) There is way to much flashy violence, minimal plot, and scenes that just don't fit. They need to get back to Gene Roddenberry's original views and thoughts on the Trek series. The acting was excellent but it was by far the worst Star Trek movie I have ever seen. If they called it "Missing in Space" it would be a way better movie because you would not be expecting Star Trek themes. Very disappointed. I hope that the next movie comes back to what Star Trek should be about. I don't mind violence don't get me wrong just want a decent plot to go with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The action of the movie in its own terms makes no sense, An alien attack staved off by rap music? I don't think so. I could go on and on.The positive message of the movie is under cut by the opening 20 minutes. In the opening 20 minutes James Kirk is portrayed as thoroughly bored by opening up new worlds and going where no man has gone before which is the very basis of Gene Rodenberry's Star Trek. The super villain, Krall, whose goal is to destroy the galaxy, which is the usual goal of galactic super villains, wants endless strife and holds life is only worth living when there is endless strife. By the end of the movie James Kirk is enlivened as Kirk has been placed in situations where there is endless strife for the highest stakes which backs up the 'philosophy of life', of Krall. James Kirk sees the galaxy is full of endless strife and is buoyed, Even in a charitable mood there is no message here and the action is senseless. What is here is countless Star Trek moments stuck together around yet another Apocalyptic theme with the Enterprise destroyed yet another time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's get one thing clear: I'm a Trekie. I understand also, that a movie has somehow to appeal to a great amount of people in order to be financially interesting. Star Trek Beyond does it's job well. You don't have to use your brain. Indeed it's better to leave it at home when you go see that movie. But first things first, what was good about it: 1. Warp-Travelling: This movies shows takes, where the ship is seen really "bending space", which is the way warp-drives actually work. 2. The Space Station Yorktown: OMG! It's just so beautiful! A realistic view of what a space station could look like, considering the known technology of the star trek universe. BUT Star Trek Beyond has SO MANY PLOT HOLES and uses so many stereotypes, that it became impossible for me to give it a good rating.The bad guy: The troubled terrorist - for most of the movie it's not clear why he pursuits his goals. When it is explained, it does not make any sense. He possessesa great amount of advanced tech, which he could have used to get somehow happy. Instead he somehow need the space station in order to attack the rest of the federation. The "Better Ship": In a talk with an admiral, Kirk is informed that there is a better ship in the fleet as the Enterprise, but it's not finished. A good hint, that later on something bad will happen with the Enterprise, but they already organized replacement. When the replacement is really needed at the end of the movie, they just "build another ship". BUT EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE EARLY ENTERPRISE. No upgrades needed. The attack to Yorktown: Why they just don't send one ship to break throw the lines, use the bio-weapon and take the station over? Instead they send a overwelming power to the station. A overwelming power prone to loud music... OMG! What were they thinking, when they came out with this? The Gravity chaos on the station is just annoying. The Bio-Weapon behaves differently as firstly introduced. So many questions... It's no star trek any more. It's just another space movie, which does not care about accuracy. JJ Abrams just destroyed star trek.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stark Trek "Too": too much, too little, too bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The word "too" best describes my feelings about this movie. Too much CGI, too much exaggerated hand-to-hand combat, too many chase scenes where I couldn't tell who was chasing whom, or how, or why, or which spacecraft each character was in. The plot was too weak, the characters were too chatty and introspective with deadly dangers around, and too many characters from far-off worlds spoke halting (and sometimes weirdly not-halting) English.Furthermore, the writers went too far in trying to wring humor out of references to characters' behavior or dialogue in the original series. One example: isn't it funny to get the dry-and-serious Spock to say a bad word? That scene was a little nauseating, and not one-tenth as funny as when he said "damn" in The Voyage Home.The young actors have too little gravitas compared to the original portrayers of those roles. McCoy's acting in particular is painfully amateurish (I don't know whether to attribute that to the actor or the direction).I could have given this film less than 4 stars, but hey - even though it was confusing and shoddy, it wasn't very boring, and it's always nice to see the Star Trek crew. However, I certainly won't be watching it again, and you won't miss much if you skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So tired of this reboot. I wanted so badly for Beyond to redeem itself from Into Darkness but no chance of that. As a Sci-Fi/Star Trek fan, I am finding this reboot series of movies so unworthy of the vision Roddenberry intended. No offense to the actors at all, its really the character development vision and lack of imagination in the story telling. During this movie, the guy next to me feel asleep and I can understand why. It wasn't fun, it wasn't funny, it was boring. What happened? I can only hope that CBS will have something more intelligent, exciting and imaginative with their new ST series. Beyond is a paint by numbers movie. The only thing I liked was the space station environment of Yorktown. Can Hollywood please make good science fiction movies for adults PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A surprise attack in outer space forces the Enterprise to crash-land on a mysterious world.The assault comes from Krall, a lizard-like dictator who derives his energy by sucking the life out of his victims.Krall needs an ancient and valuable artefact that's aboard the badly damaged star-ship.Left stranded in a rugged wilderness, Kirk, Spock, and the rest of the crew must now battle a deadly alien race while trying to find a way off their hostile planet.....I get what Pegg was trying to do when writing this Star Trek film, he was trying to emulate the feel of the TOS, but keeping in mind the freshness of the reboot by keeping the humour as light as can be.Well I saw Galaxy Quest too, and this is pretty much what the film feels like throughout, a familiar yet bland experience that has two very good set pieces, but little else in the vein of entertainment.It's the very opening scene that will sell you on how you are going to react to the film, but this opening scene to me made Kirk look like an absolute moron, and for me, it stayed with him for the whole film, despite him trying his best Willis smirk every time a plan comes together.Urban is easily the best thing in the film, and his scenes with Spock are the most touching thing in the film. If the narrative was focused more on these two, the film wouldn't have felt so 'sarcastic'.Pegg is watchable, but by the twentieth time he's called Jaylah 'Lassie' you just want to throttle him.Elba is wonderful as the antagonist, but I feel that there is some missing footage from somewhere, because Uhuru spots him so easily in found footage, and his character could have been fleshed out more, rather than having him turn into Basil Exposition toward the end.But the biggest problem with the film, what really took me out of the action is when they jump the shark with the inexplicably silly way of fighting the villains. instead of being exciting and fist pumpingly tense, it's toe curlingly awful, and ruins the film.And a word of advice, don't see it in 3D, it adds nothing to the film apart from making the film almost too dark to see.So aside from a couple of decent set pieces, it's a bloated, almost self-deprecating parody of what was a great reboot.It's almost as bad as The Final Frontier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Easily the best of the reboots, and amazingly (as a hardcore Trekkie I didn't imagine myself saying this) one of my favorite Trek films overall. Lin somehow manages to blend elements of all 5 TV series into a modern sci-fi action film. It did not feel like the first two JJ films in any way. It felt natural, like you tuned into a modern technology based TOS episode peppered with the best elements of Gene's post TOS series' ideals. While the overall plot may seem like a simple tried and true movie formula, it's the nuances and character interactions that make this film seem more like the old Trek despite, strangely, there being more action than the other 2 reboots.This latest Trek installment should please Trekkies like myself, and fans of the modern JJ verse time-line alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bad Star Trek episode with lots of special effects.A lot of reviewers have mentioned how this movie has moved the new Star Trek away from sci fi and more into fantasy. I have to agree.The third movie in the new series has to be the worst. The beginning is slow, the story is strange and the script is quite bad. I was shocked to see that Simon Pegg, one of the few actors who looks and sounds nothing like Scotty from the old series, is actually credited with co-writing the script! Are you kidding me?The slow paced beginning starts with a lot of cgi aliens who although tiny, have large, razor like teeth. A number of these jump on Kirk, ripping his shirt, but not giving Kirk so much as a scratch, thus making it very hard for us to buy in that they were real or even a threat. This is the kind of movie it is. The Enterprise can be easily torn up, but again, non of the core players, apart from Spock, receive a scratch.The day after the movie, my partner and I tried to work out what the motive was for the bad guy, how he had survived so long, and why he wanted to attack the space station. It's a few days later, and we still have no idea.It appears that the series sequel number can be doubled and then subtracted from 10 to give you the rating on IMDb. Such a shame.</fullReview>

So why oh why make a film where these characters hardly get a chance to show what they can do between blowing and being blown up, again? This script misses all that makes a StarTrek film a StarTrek film and turns in a sad rerun of X other high budget blow'em up films with frightening little originality. Wrong director, wrong scriptwriters. The special effect guys can stay, but that is about it. Oh, the actors of course, but let them do their stuff on some halfway decent material next time please.

		<fullReview>There are those movies where you know you can just sit back and absorb anything they trow at you. You know you'll get a lot of fast action scenes, maybe some humor, a near-zero story line and even less logic. The Independence Day sequel is such a movie, and - apparently - Star Wars Beyond is too. It shouldn't be, but it is.The latest Star Wars sequel takes you from one illogical scene to the next, without any explanation or any attempt to let the viewer settle into it. The whole movie is a continuous repetition of trowing in some sci-fi tech babble and use that to initiate an action scene. As seems to be the formula with most action-based blockbusters these days, they make sure the pace is high enough so you don't have time to think about what's actually going on, and how little sense it all makes.Apparently writing a decent storyline is to much of an effort, especially when you can just fill in the blanks with some supposedly explanatory rambling, an attempt at humor or just don't bother at all. And why should you? Your movie is remake 2 or 3 or sequel 4 or 5. It's a guaranteed hit at the box office.Where are the days where creating a successful sequel was an actual challenge...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Trek Beyond.......Beyond What Exactly??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I have been a huge Star Trek fan my entire life, I have to say this film was less than thrilling and suspenseful. I was quite bored throughout. The horrible CGI in the opening scene was so ridiculous it felt as though I was watching a B movie on the Sci Fi channel. One of the things people have loved about Star Trek for decades, is that everything they talked about was achievable through peace, cooperation and unity, ultimately leaving the galaxy a slightly safer and more reasonable place. However, this nonsense that J.J. Abrams/Paramount has been spitting out since 2009 is nothing short of a Kill Bill movie. These remakes are nowhere near anything Gene Roddenberry had in mind when he created Star Trek 50yrs ago. The whole point of the show was for peace and harmony. Yes there was fighting and destruction in all the Star Trek series' but nothing compared to the disgusting, senseless and never ending portrayal of violence in these. I doubt Gene would approve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Star Trek V bad - but bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Always been a fan of the Star Trek series' and movies so I was looking forward to the Reboots - the first one I loved although making original Spock watch Vulcan destroyed was horrible, the 2nd was good although reworking the Khan story seemed odd after going through so much trouble to change the timeline in the first film - I was hoping the third would match them However, Star Terk Beyond just fell flat for me.The Main problem was that nothing about the premise of the film made very much sense so the film never grabbed me from the beginning - basically a swarm of space locusts downs and destroys the Enterprise - again - and the villain, who I never understood the motivations of, takes most of the crew prisoners, while the main guys try to rescue them - The swarm of locusts gets destroyed ultimately by loud blaring rock music -which is comedy right out of Mars Attacks, also the bad guy for some reason morphs into a guy who looks like Lou Gossett in Enemy Mine, which just made the final battle confusing.As usual with action movies nowadays they also overdo it with the CGI to the extent it was hard to follow what was happening at times and it detracted from the story and characters - Star Trek has wonderful characters but none really got to shine in this film - there was little depth and very little humor. In addition after all the publicity about the subtle scene that was to reveal Sulu is gay, it ended up being so subtle that I never ever actually saw it, just the picture of his daughter with was a nice throwback to Generations - I read that the scene happened on the space station - but the crew was supposed to have traveled 3 years into deep space - so how could've Sulu's partner and daughter have gotten there? I did like the nod to Leonard Nimoy's death by having Spock deal with Ambassador Spock's death, a mind bending experience for him - and I like the dedication to Anton Yelchin, who died so tragically in June - but other than that this was a disappointing largely forgettable entry in the Star Trek franchise that had me checking my watch by the time it was over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leans too far to broad commercial appeal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is my review of Star Trek Beyond (includes some spoilers). The Trek films have always been a balance between loyalty to Trekkies and sufficient commercial appeal to attract a broader audience. Insurrection is the most true Trek of all the films but did not have much appeal beyond Trekkies. The ones that managed that balance the best were Wrath of Khan, Generations, and the 2009 Star Trek. First Contact is one that leans more to the commercial appeal. The Final Frontier managed to appeal to neither. Star Trek Beyond makes a genuine effort to strike a balance but does not succeed. The plot is solid Trek and there are many great moments between the characters. However, Director Justin Lin fails to capture the essence of Trek with his story-telling. The over the top fist- fights, excessive explosions, and overall extremism are a sellout. Furthermore, I believe the franchise is at its best when it functions within its own standards of plausibility. This movie does not do that. Unexplained streams of gravity are used to create a ridiculous fight scene. The best example is a ludicrous moment involving Kirk, Jayla, a motorcycle, and the transporter. Worst of all is a fatal flaw in the presentation of the characters. A central theme of the film is how the interconnectedness of the crew is its greatest strength. However, hundreds of crew members are killed while the surviving characters show barely any sense of loss. In fact, the film closes with a joyous birthday party rather than the memorial it screams out for. If you cherish the Trek universe, this is a wreck. If you like exciting eye-candy sci-fi, this will satisfy your sweet tooth.</fullReview>

In a morbidly (and depressing) way I wonder why there's an engaging fascination with how so little can be done with so much. What a waste! It's like the creative team (it was a "team" wasn't it? - they should be severely chastised!) sitting around the corporate conference table all had their imaginations and good sense scrambled during transport because it's clear it was lost along the way. If you edit out fluff, empty visuals, overwrought and repetitive (snore) action and inaction (as opposed to non-action), the end result would be worthy of about two minutes of film, the amount of a generous preview.

The movie just went on without really anything really outstanding/never seen before scenes, that audience could expect from a movie like this.

		<fullReview>Fan or no fan, this was a brutal movie. It was so bad that my buddy and I were laughing almost the entire time. Some was because of some great comedic work by Urban or the Beastie Boys soundtrack. The rest was because the film was so ridiculous. And I actually really enjoyed the first 2 reboots1-The plot was almost near incomprehensible. Alien girl says her crew is stranded on a planet due to their ship being unable to navigate the nebula. No background checks or even the slightest hint of suspicion or anything like that, just, get the enterprise crew back on the ship and lets travel through a dangerous and uncharted area of space on blind faith to save a presumed crashed crew. Um OK. It turns out to be a trick. SHOCKING!!!! The writers even have Checkov ask Kirk when he suspected she might be bad!! Are you kidding me???? How about the second she showed up in the film? That's the catalyst for getting the story going. And who the hell was this girl?2-1st most ridiculous scene in the movie: Suddenly, without any sort of set- up, we see a big green glob shot onto what appears to be a lock. Turns out it's Scotty's little buddy's booger and SOMEHOW it allows them to open the door. Oh BTW, we're in the prisoners cell3-2nd most ridiculous scene: Spock is fighting a bad guy when out of nowhere, said bad guy is hit with a big rock. Turns out it's Uhura saving the day. Problem was she was a prisoner of the main bad guy Krall LITERALLY in the scene preceding this one (and no she didn't escape!!!!!)4- This movie did not need to be 3-D. In addition to that, it was not filmed properly for 3D or most probably, was filmed in 2D and transferred to 3D in post. Either way, it was an epic fail as the camera movements were a blurry distracting disaster5- The actual directing and cinematography was weak. Throughout a good chunk of the movie, I remember thinking "Where the hell is everyone in relation to each other???!!!" Constant close ups during fight scenes and explosions, poorly lit scenes and sets. Very disappointing for a big budget film.6- The editing was like watching a music video. Plus one of the funniest moments comes during a fight scene between the cool white and black chick and Krall's right hand man. In the midst of the fight, they cut to this static, Close up shot of this dude's head as if he was about to break the fourth wall and address the audience. It holds there and then cuts back to a wide and we're back in the action. It was hilarious!7- Simon Pegg always saves the day (surprise, he's a screenwriter on the film)8-]Krall using 2 humans suspended from the ceiling to electrocute himself. Still not sure what the purpose was9-When Krall questions Sulu about the location of the the special piece he needs to power a weapon of mass destruction, the girl who has been charged with keeping it hidden so millions won't die, hands it over without batting an eye after Sulu gets choked for approx 2 seconds. It's like here are the nuclear codes... So what's everybody doing tonight?10- Did anyone else notice the multiple Star Wars references?Honestly, what happened to story and realism? Yes it's science fiction but realism pertains to the world you have created within the story. I have zero problem getting caught up in fantasy or science fiction (actually a huge fan) so long as they adhere to a certain realism within that world. Huge failure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All "beats and shouting" is how one character describes the classical twentieth century strains of The Beastie Boys, and it could just as well describe Justin "Fast &amp; Furious" Lin's entry into the Star Trek cinematic canon, its thirteenth instalment.Three years into their five-year mission and life aboard the Enterprise is getting pretty boring. (I know, right? Our hearts bleed for these brave handsome space explorers.) They park up at a moon-sized starbase called Yorktown, where they are visited by an alien refugee who says her people have been attacked.The Enterprise investigates, traversing a nebula before finding a hostile swarm of ships. (Incidentally, the pacing by this point is typical of the film as a whole: insufficient build-up to an overlong action payoff.) The Enterprise is overwhelmed, and boarded by the swarm's commander, Krall (Idris Elba). Krall wants an alien artefact in Kirk's (Chris Pine) possession.As a result of the battle the Enterprise crew crash land on a local planet. Separated, some are captured by Krall and his drones. Kirk's scattered team, with the help of clichd huntress Jaylah (genuinely named after J-Law, and played by Sofia Boutella), must find a way to rescue their friends and escape the planet before Krall and co destroy Yorktown.An opening gag, a comical encounter involving a bestial alien race, sets the cartoon tone for the movie. The set even resembles the Klingon courtroom from The Undiscovered Country ? and it was the first of many times that I felt the series' heritage was being referenced in a faintly mocking way. When every line involving that rich pseudo-science jargon is being flipped into a joke it comes across as dumbing down to the point of contempt.I feel this point is important enough to labour, particularly as some of the marketing has harkened back to the likes of The Motion Picture ? a thoughtful work of philosophical sci-fi to which this bears no resemblance. Being stupid isn't in itself a problem, but when a film continually references its forebears, both on screen and off, one cannot but feel that history is being exploited.When nu-Spock is coming to terms with his mortality and his fearful exclamations are laughed off by his supposed friends Bones and Kirk (who, in a diluted allusion to Wrath of Khan's birthday scene, had themselves earlier discussed mortality), you question whether these characters ? the very soul of Trek ? are being taken seriously.Being co-written by Simon Pegg, it should come as no surprise that the bro-banter is in full force; and, in Beyond's defence, it sometimes works in the quieter moments. When the crew is paired off we do get some interesting matchings: Kirk and Checkov (the late Anton Yelchin); Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Bones (Karl Urban); Scotty (Pegg) and Jaylah. The strongest scenes are the simple ones where they're exploring this strange new world and mutually building their characters.However. Maybe it's a reference to the original third film's subtitle, but poor Spock is missing for large parts; and when he is on screen his moodiness comes across less like a character's grief and more like an actor's embarrassment. You can almost see his despair at the direction the series is taking: A franchise hungrier than ever to knock the techno-babble on the head and move on to the next starship-flipping setpiece.(Just wait until you get to the part with the musical weapon. It will determine if you're on board with this mission or it'll be your escape pod moment. I found it risible: not smart-silly, just shark-jumping.)Another Star Trek movie, another frustrated madman having a tantrum. But unlike Nero or Kahn, Krall's motivations are vague and implausible, and Idris Elba's performance is unconvincing. It's not helped by his character's obsession with the ancient artefact he covets: a MacGuffin so mysterious that it cannot be adequately explained through exposition, and which produces a lame CG effect like something out of The Mummy.Lin mimics JJ Abrams' kinetic style but it's all bluster and no rhythm or rhyme. His clunky direction and the chaotic editing (four editors, seemingly at odds with each other) undermine any sense of local geography or the relationship between subjects. This particularly comes to the fore in the final act, where any narrative ingenuity gives way to video game plotting (complete with tool tips and checkpoints) ? a succession of confusing complications in lieu of real narrative complexity ? and Lin is not up to the task of keeping us informed of the rules and the stakes.Beyond lacks the vitality and novelty of Star Trek '09 and has none of the thrilling personal conflicts or emotional sensitivity of Into Darkness. And more than those films, which were already more flash than flesh, it lacks depth. This is the cinema of spectacle, not ideas. Once, this film series could do both. But Beyond doesn't go beyond passable. And for a crew of this calibre, that's not good enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>O dear o dear. I was worried when I saw the original trailer with it's lazily recycled Beastie Boys song from the first movie. And even more worried when I discovered that Mr Fast and the Furious was directing. To my surprise the initial critical reviews were positive. I've loved Star Trek since watching The Next Generation as a child. I really enjoyed the last two of the reboot. Unfortunately I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone and certainly not to Star Trek fans. What a dull mess of a film. I really didn't care about anything or anyone in it. All of the characters seems muted and downtrodden. There is no sense of excitement. The plot line is very flimsy; just an excuse to blow things up. Why are the bad guys so against the federation? Their motivation is sorely lacking. Some of the design of the space station is interesting but somehow bland at the same time. Sort of fits in well with the rest of the film! The spaceship battles are OK. A lot of the action sequences are horribly dark and choppy. There's a real sense of slow ploddingness to the film and I couldn't quite put my finger on why. I've come to the conclusion that it was the pacing, the dialogue, the story. It was all just so so dull. There is nothing interesting, original or inventive in this film. And that for a science fiction film almost defeats the purpose. Very very disappointing.</fullReview>

The overall story has been told a million times before - good guy gets lost and nobody find him so he turns his back on them and becomes evil. The way they defeated the enemy with music was stupid. The song was good, but the idea was dumb. They should have left it as a frequency that interrupted them - music isn't a frequency - you can play music on different frequencies. Fast and Furious director/producer should not work on a Star Trek movie. Unfortunately Idris Elba couldn't save it. My wife and I fell asleep through part of it.

		<shortDescription>Not a good story at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying I think the 2009 reboot was excellent and rates in my top ten sci-fi films of all time. The emotion created in those first few minutes blew me away and I cared for the newborn Kirk right from the off. I didn't care about anybody in this film at all! The writing was so weak that I could not contain myself in the cinema and a massive groan was heard by all. From this point on the following isn't going to make much sense. Major film arc : A weapon we don't ever get to know anything about and is not needed by the bad guy but he wants it to kill his neighbors anyway !Motivation for bad guy being bad: pee-ed off because he crashed his ship over a hundred years ago and is annoyed because nobody found him on a planet nobody else has ever been to inside this really dangerous nebula. Bad guy finds a way to live a really long time but he looks like an alien and seems to have forgotten how to talk. Bad guy resents a really massive space station right on his doorstep that he must have watched being built! Bad man has this massive fleet of ships and drones yet could not get home on his own and sat there watching a space station being built! Bad man forgot where he crashed a galaxy class ship that took Scottie about 10 minutes to fix and save the day.Oh, I cannot be bothered to write anymore, you could not make this rubbish up with an infinite number on Monkeys! I just don't care enough.Dear Mr Peg,Please leave Hollywood now and never return, you did have talent back in the Spaced days but now you are just annoying. I don't mind you being is so many films but do you have to start writing for them? Is it not enough to force yourself into anything starting with the word 'Star' or has CGI that you now you have to ruin (I mean write) them!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painful to watch, disappointing, sad - a disgrace to the Star Trek spirit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tempering with the original Star Trek spirit is risky. And this time producer and director failed completely: an action packed, very noisy, simple story - the more spaceship debris flies around, the more painful the experience for both seasoned and new Trekkies. The characters are well played, the cast is immaculate - it is just the story that has little, if anything, to do with the sophistication of Roddenberry's saga. We learned nothing - as if space had nothing left to offer but violence. The Star Trek audience should not be underestimated - let alone betrayed, by what seems like a full-on attempt to entertain a "broader than Star Trek" audience with an overdose of hostility in outer space. This one-off failure will not deter me from looking forward to the next Star Trek film, in the very hope that this is just that: a one-off disgrace to the Star Trek we all love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not Star Trek anymore, this is Star Wars rubbish. This is general mainstream rubbish meant for mindless idiots who like just action. This had shallow story line, no depth, no character development, shallow characters,and it was contrived crap. the two previous movies were OK but this one has moved away from what Star Trek means and is. The director who did this movie should never do a Star Trek movie again....NEVER! This movie had nothing to do with the Star Trek concept and values, how could this director get it so wrong??? This movie is targeted and 12 and 13 year old, so if you're an adult seeking to see a good mentally stimulating movie with original concepts, do not see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How is it possible to write a script so devoid of emotion, character and plot?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I mean the characters were defined already, nothing really needed to be done, just extend the plot line to some other world adventure and you'd have a film.This film has no real characters you can connect with, it's just full of cheap jokes and unlikely sequences of events. There is no chance of suspending your disbelief in this film when the script is this sloppy. For example in one scene Spok is quickly distracted away from having a near fatal wound cauterised by cracking a quick joke.This film will actually leave you more emotionless than Spok, except they even messed his character up! How can you fail to write for someone emotionless and logical?The only redeeming feature in this film is the special effects, which is what you should expect when watching one of the star trek series of films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The latest film from the Star Trek series is probably the weakest, and it definitely shows the traces of being a TV show. Poor locations on sound stages, hackneyed dialogue that is all too familiar, and mediocre camera work all conspire to make you wish you could use the fast forward button. Combine that with incomprehensible mumbled talk that makes you wish you could go backward to see what the heck they said. Very disappointing.Perhaps the worst feature in a film that has very few redeeming qualities at all, is the villain, who is among the weakest villains in cinematic history, despite having the very capable actor underneath all the reptilian makeup.You don't need to see this on the big screen. In fact, you don't have to see this at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know how people say 'this movie was soooooo... i had to register just to comment on it'? Well, i'm one of those people who immediately after that think 'i'm too lazy - i'll never do that'.Where even to begin??? (Some spoiler alert) From the main villain who is a bad version of Khan, to the crashing scene of the Enterprise - everything in this film is a bad rehash of what happened in the previous movies. Just with a lot more awfulness. Most of the lines fall flat(with a few exceptions not even worth a mention) in spite of the same quality acting. After all - the actors are not the ones to blame for the stupidity of the script. JJ Abrams just got tired - again - and it shows.And if you are not convinced yet let me ask you something. What are the most basic things fans expect from a sci-fi movie??? Tech and special effects, obviously. Well this movie has two scenes where they show some tech and only one memorable explosions. It wouldn't be so bad if the script wasn't held together by spit and duct tape. But it is.For all the ST fans - not worth the ticket. Just wait until the DVD/bluray is in the bargain bin. If it wasn't for the acting i would have given it a zer0. And for those who think it was good - YOU HAVE NO TASTE!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a 14 year old adolescent and like the Fast and Furious series, you will probably love this movie. If you expect a movie to have more story than action, you will be disappointed. My wife and I really enjoyed the first two reboots that JJ Abrams did, so much so that we watched them the two days previous to seeing this new installment. Although there was some enjoyable moments, the bulk of the movie was endless, stupid action. Not surprisingly, since I later found out that the director, Justin Lin, had directed several F &amp; F movies, which are known for beating you into submission with mindless, continuous action and little to no story. If you liked those movies, buy all means go see this one, but if you enjoy the story telling part of Star Trek, take a pass on this one. JJ, please come back!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Trek Beyond Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's start from the top.At the very beginning we get some meaningless thoughts from Kirk talking about why is he flying the enterprise, what am I doing with my life? And meaningless shot throughout it. Then we have Spock getting sad. Then we have Kirk talking to some woman about how he wants to leave and she's like "hey man you can leave if you want to but who gonna take your place?" dun dun dunn and Kirk's like "Spock." So now we have Spock talking to someone about how he wants to go home and stuff and leave the enterprise. Like who cares about who's gonna fly the enterprise, just get someone! I dunno then we have some alien woman who gets captured asking for help and they jump on that mission without question. Without question! Like the place that she was talking about was clearly super dangerous and clearly designed to be a trap. Omg we need to talk about this one part in the movie.OK so the main bad guy has an army of ships that's basically a bunch of nano bots that can destroy anything that he wants. And they are like a swarm. Like it's actually making me mad thinking about it. OK so his army is attacking earth and somehow it doesn't like sound or something and someone hacks into it and plays sabotage from the beastie boys. Sabotage from the beastie boys...So they play the song and some earth globe thing amplifies the sound and destroys the swarm just like that and that's it. Like it's not funny. How could you play a song like that in a current scifi film. Like it was clearly planned to go in sync with what was happening on scene. I don't know what to say.Honestly the movie seemed to be made by guys in suits. You know what I'm talking about. It's the third movie and they know that they have to stop making star trek movies so why not have fun? This movie is horrible. And the thing is, the main stream audience just eats it up because of small things in the movie. Like for example Sulu and him being gay. Like there's nothing wrong with that but I don't think we ever even got to see him have an on screen kiss with his partner. Oh and those camera angles of shots in this movie. Holy s*%t! I have never wanted to close my eyes so much and just listen.Anyways, the movie is colourful, sets are cool, gold painted rocks and stuff, story is bad, music is bad for the most part. Overall bad forgettable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damaging to the franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasted two hours of my life watching this film. The plot does not have either intrigue or coherency, there are no new ideas whatsoever - technological, social or psychological, and the characters are shallow and inconsistent.I watched the the film in IMAX 3D and after about 20 minutes found myself looking for various details in filming, animation, and FX, listening to the details in the soundtrack, and thinking about advances in the technology rather than being involved in the content: the story and the art of cinematography were simply not there.I am a big fan of the Star Trek franchise - I grew up with the TV series and the films. I think that through its history Star Trek was a great reflection of social processes and also anticipated quite a few technological advances and their impact on the society. I was happy when the latest installment of the franchise was brought to the screens.I think that the first two films of the latest Star Trek incarnation (2009 and 2013) were quite good in continuing the tradition. This last installment, Star Trek Beyond, falls completely flat seriously testing loyalty of fans like me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Justin Lin directed 3 of the Fast &amp; Furious movies and Simon Pegg has starred in and written some funny stuff, but their collaboration on this movie has produced an incomprehensible and lousy result! Maybe J.J. Abrahams should get out of the producer's chair and get back to directing? All the elements were here for a great movie EXCEPT any kind of glue to tie it all together. Often it was not interconnected making it hard to impossible to follow what was happening. Bet I could have made a better movie for a quarter of the cost. It is BEYOND my comprehension how this made it to the big screen in this condition. Loved Abrahams's Star Trek and Into Darkness but this one was awful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I feel so sorry for watching it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Say goodbye to intelligent sci-fi stories because it is (also) not one of them. It was a waste of time for me watching this though I loved the previous two installments (esp. the 2009 version). I feel so disappointed and angry at the same time. The whole movie gives me the impression that they targeted the mass who wants action and booms in all possible ways. The wonderfully cast crew can't help it they were just doing fine as always (though seemed somewhat bored) but their characters were ruined in many ways Or it's better to say they had not much to do as for development: a very big waste of talented people being exchanged for crazy CGI and all kinds of explosions... Why exactly? To show this plot less nonsense? I think most of the people who love ST didn't want to see this happen with the whole franchise.Story: Meaningless, pointless, unintelligent, very badly written, fairly ridiculous at some points or just simply full of violence. Why can't people understand that this genre is not about killing, destroying, revenge or chasing bad guys?Most of the things were so flawed in the plot that I suggest no one should find answers... but it's even better if you don't think at all... I had a feeling the day after watching it that people should not bother with making a parody of this installment because this was a parody itself. Unfortunately. And the title can be "How to kill sci- fi and turn it into a silly mass-product?" Dialogues/Humour: I think the actors could have been mute because their words had no real function in the story. What was meant to be funny exactly? Those lame and childish lines given to the characters? They were boringly ridiculous and not funny : there's a difference. I can hardly forget the moment (thinking that this whole movie could not be worse...then came this) when they used rock music for hijacking those bee-things and those silly smiles on the faces of the characters...They totally down-graded the whole crew into like teenagers!... :(Star wars 7 was also ruined for me and now I can see that other Sci- fi is to be put on that same path...Sad. I'm sorry for wanting to see intelligent stories on screen and not dumb action movies clothed in Sci-Fi robes. As for the other reviews here I don't think I'm alone with it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel terrible for giving this film a 3 star, I'm usually not the one to ever give bad reviews because I know the amount of hard work the cast would put into films. The graphics and the animation was pretty good I just say. I was never into sci-fi movies, I saw it because I read good reviews on it. If your not the type of person that watches these kinds of movies and don't know the story behind every series, I would not recommend this. But if your the kind of person that read comic books and watched every series and was always into movies of this kind, then be the jar of my cup of tea and watch it. Just felt like it was too much of a fantasy film rather then common sense. I also didn't like the actors that they choosed, the story line was off and the plot had me confused the whole hour and a half into the movie. It's a 2 hour movie, it's very difficult for the audience to keep interest when it comes to movies this long. Therefore, 1 hour and 30 minutes into dozing off, I was walking out the theatre.</fullReview>

There is very little back story regarding the theme of the movieJust mostly a lot of special effects and action.

		<fullReview>I fought my brain for hours after finishing Star Trek Beyond to find a single good thing about it. The only thing I could find is this line, half way through the movie: "You put a tracking device on your girlfriend?" I'm not over reacting. I'm not even mad. But it is that terrible.The clich-ridden and predictable script honestly felt like it written by an uncreative child. The dialogue was consistently below average with every character spewing forth obnoxious 'witty-banta', the worst offender being Doctor Bones. Every single character was either one-dimensional or downright terrible with the only character going through any sort of arc or transformation being Kirk, and this was done entirely separate from the actual story. A good character arc is noticeably influenced and affects the events of the story, while in Beyond it was simply brought up in the first scene of the movie and concluded in the last scene.Easily the worst part about the movie was it's villain Krall. I'm sick and tired of movies trying to get their viewers rooting against the villain, by making the villains make up and design hideous, and having them kill of some random/nameless side character every five minutes because they feel particularly evil this morning. None of the actors gave a good performance, and no one brought anything to their characters. Simon Pegg gave possibly the best performance in this movie, although he never had anything to work with, which is bizarre because he helped write the damn thing.But hey, at least you can just enjoy the action, right? Not really. The visual effects varied from average to hideous, which is surprising for such an expensive film, and the actual action scenes and fight choreography were simply your bog standard affair with nothing special or entertaining about it. Despite that, this movie constantly wants you to be impressed with it's effects, continually shoving big CG images, set piece and alien design at you one after another. The actual science-fiction in this sci-fi movie was completely devoid of any interesting or any original ideas.Before I end this unsophisticated rant of a review, I want to point out one scene in particular which honestly dumbfounded me. This be a MASSIVE SPOILER by the way, and it's best if you have already seen the film, because I honestly do a bad job of describing the scene.In the middle of the climactic act 3 action set-piece, Kirk and the crew have to defeat the alien swarm of miniature space-ships, but don't have the weaponry to do it. So they cook up a plan to disorientate their enemy by destroying their communication devices, which they rely heavily on. Kirk and the crew somehow do this, by blasting rock- music at the alien swarm through their own spaceship. In theory this is admittedly interesting, although in practice it makes absolutely no sense, as it starts blows up the alien ships with no explanation as to why or how. But the scene gets even more absurd, as the alien swarm creates a massive wave, and Kirk's ship begins to surface up said wave, while blasting metal music, and leaving a trail of explosions behind him. This scene was a joke. And it could have been a good one. If this was a sci-fi parody, it would be hilarious. But Star Trek Beyond plays it off entirely seriously.I could go on, but you get the point. It is easily one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Left before the film ended - it's that bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did the people who rate this film so highly watched the same film as I did last night? I have watched many films in my life and yet despite how poor a film was, I never left a cinema before the film ended as it was a matter of principle for me; maybe there is hope that the story can improve, maybe the director has a good surprise at the end, maybe the special effects in the final scenes will make up for the cost of the ticket, etc... However this latest installment of the new Star Trek reboot hit such a new low that I just couldn't contemplate wasting my time watching such poorly written stories anymore. Why I left halfway through the film *Spoilers*: a) The scenario doesn't make any sense and is full of plot holes. Yorktown, a moon size federation star base built on edge of Federation space, happens to be located close to a nebula where a dangerous group of pirates captures/destroys spaceships entering it. An analogy of the would be for the US to build a New York size city next to the coast of Somalia. Or the Enterprise is on its 3rd year of a deep space mission yet they arrive at Yorktown which is by definition not in deep space but in federation space. How about the crew crash-lands on a planet in separate pods yet all happen to be at walking distance from each other. How about the fact that communication through the Nebula isn't possible yet the enemy seems to have this capability. Or Jaylah, alien female, immediately understands Scottish slang (Lassie,?). I could go on like this for a long time.b) Main characters have no depth &amp; no internal conflicts so we can't easily identify ourselves with them. All they do is go from one sequence to another with little character development. Also they all seem to have superman powers surviving the worst attacks, falls and injuries against all odds. For example Spok gets badly impaled with a metal spike yet recovers very quickly despite being stranded on an alien planet with no medical supplies. I didn't care at all what would happen to any of them as they seem invincible . Finally the main bad character was so clich that it was comical. c) The action sequences where incomprehensible as everything was going too fast and there were too many different camera shots in quick succession to make any sense of what was happening. I quickly lost any interest in who was doing what to who so had no emotional attachment to the film. So here I was watching a film where there is no gripping story to lure you in, no good characters to keep you anchored and no enjoyable action sequences to keep you entertained. I decided to leave the film when Kirk was attacking the alien enemy base riding on an old motorbike that he found on the planet? This sentence on its own says it all really.We are far away from the cerebral and idealistic Star Trek of Gene Roddenberry. This is fast &amp; furious in space, a Star Trek created for teenagers who don't want to think too much. Highly disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The producers should be embarrassed to invoke the name of Gene Roddenberry. Plot -- zero. Character development -- zero. Social message: zero. (Saying "unity" a few times ... please.) Sound and fury signifying nothing -- absolute. The producers gave free rein to the adolescents in charge of darkness and noise, they gave short shrift to what must be a talented writing staff (judging by the 3 or 4 good lines), they spent a lot of money on "special" effects, and they totally wasted a great deal of acting talent. It left us feeling a little resentful, and wistful for what might have been. Or should have been.A slight detail would be that James T. destroyed the flagship of the (thousands of planets) United Federation of Planets and not another word is said about it. Maybe because he gets to spend 60 interminable seconds riding around on a motorcycle! Really?? Did it not matter because there was no plot anyway? Was there an adult in charge of any part of this? Anyone who'd read anything of Roddenberry's? Seen any of the earlier movies? The nicest thing we can say about this sorry excuse for a Star Trek movie is that it was disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is the director trying to actively sabotage this series?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to preface my review with this: I was a massive fan of the first two movies in the series. The action, the witty dialogue, and the music all made for two incredibly enjoyable movies. Did you have to suspend belief at times? Sure. But overall they were well-done and you felt like you got your money's worth. Now, this film was an utter abortion. It was the equivalent of Fast and Furious in space. The plot felt like it was drawn up on a napkin. So much was left unexplained or didn't make sense to begin with. The main villain's character was so poorly written that it honestly makes me question if the writers let their kids handle his backstory and dialogue. They never even explained where he got such a large following and fleet of ships!! I could drone on for hours about the rest of the plot holes, but if you want to waste your time, go see the movie.As for the action scenes, I felt like the producers think that the more clutter you fill the scene with, the better it is. Are starships now indestructible? Why was gravity constantly ignored? Larger scale does not equal better action!Seriously, there is nothing redeeming about this movie. Go rewatch the first two and pretend this never happened. Call a loved one. Or an in-law. At the very least, don't go anywhere near the movie theatre, and maybe we can convince Justin Lin and his entourage to go take their "talents" elsewhere. Like a local high school play. Although I have no doubt that they would ruin that, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm back from watching the premiere of the movie in 3D and I'm extremely angry - mostly about myself in this case because I feel so stupid for actually thinking this might turn out well. I wanted to like the movie, I really did. Star Trek 2009 was okay even though it threw the canon out the window. Into Darkness was mess with lots of plot holes that was a disappointment in the end but at least watchable. This however is a nightmare visually. But lets look at it from the beginning. The first 5 minutes are looking okay. There is a bit of exposition, humor and some basic action and the movie looked promising.Then the movie really started and the thing that immediately annoyed me was that everything was shot in extreme darkness. It was hard to see anything properly. The 3D made things even worse, because it made the movie even darker because of the glasses. In addition I got headaches due to the extreme shaky cam. It was dark, shaky AND there were LOTS of close up shots so the action scenes in short are freaking terrible.The camera couldn't hold still for a second and this went on for 25 minutes. When the movie went back to focus a little bit more on characters and story the shaky cam stopped it became a bit better, but for me the damage was already done. The movie succeeded in p****** me of. Oh and the action scenes in the later parts of the movie have the same problems - shaky cam and very dark. You couldn't even see the ships properly. I felt like the director/camera man didn't really want me to see the effects properly - maybe because they weren't that great. It was hard to tell though due to the reasons mentioned above.The sound and music are average. The cast did their job well enough and the humor worked for me for the most part, but it's not enough to save the movie overall. It just made me give it a 3 out of 10 instead of a 1.In addition the story is not that exciting. The things that are happening (especially in the finale) are very predictable. The main villain pretty much has a basic revenge thing going on. However his plans don't make much sense if you start asking questions. AND there are a lot of plot holes so that the things that actually happen don't add up. People get to places so quickly that you have to ask yourself "How the hell did he do that?". The movie won't answer the questions for you though. Things just happen and they happen quickly.Overall I had high hopes for the movie after seeing the last trailer and I thought I could really get into the J.J.Verse. But I guess this Star Trek is not for me. I'll go back to older shows and movies that were mostly fun to watch even with the problems many of them had.It's funny though. I watched Warcraft and loved it while it got destroyed by almost every critic. This movie is highly praised and I hate it. What a twist...Last I just want to mention - 3D is terrible. The last movies I've seen in 3D I've always thought that it's a useless gimmick that no one needs. Please stop pushing this terrible technology down our throats. Tell a good story and people will watch a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What did I just watch?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Slight Spoilers Ahead***Let me just start by saying that I loved the first Star Trek and thought the 2nd was pretty good. This though? This was horrible and I can't believe it is getting these great reviews.I need someone to tell me. Seriously. If you thought it was good, please tell me why.There were times where my eyes got stuck in the back of my head because I rolled them so hard. Campy dialogue? (Dammit Jim! Hey there Lassie!) ....Check! Nonsensical plot? The bad guy's final weapon to exact his revenge needed a giant enclosed structure with lots of people in it. Oh you mean the giant orbed space station with a perfect deployment area that isn't that far away from where his home base is? ....Check! Groan worthy and 'what?' final battle? .....Check!I came out of the theater feeling like I have seen this movie a thousand times. And I have. It takes the best parts from Avatar (set design, landscapes, etc.) Thor: Dark World (bad guy, bad guys ultimate weapon, general feel, etc.) and old Star Trek episodes (interaction between characters, aliens, worlds, etc.) then distorts them into something that is literally not worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Star Trek, and I want this film to do well enough that companies invest a lot of money in future Star Trek projects, but this was an awful movie. There are many Star Trek fan videos on YouTube that are better than this. There are probably five-year-olds playing Star Trek with stuffed animals who come up with better plots than this film had and understand the characters better.I don't really care all that much about originality or realism. I just want the show to feel fresh and feel real. This didn't feel as if it was real, as if it were original, or as if it made sense. And the technical credits weren't even good. I'm sure many of the people who work in special effects in Hollywood do so because they are Trekkies. The film company could probably get great special effects people to work for free in exchange for getting to have dinner with George Takei. But most of the special effects work and set design work was really boring. I didn't even feel as if I understood the Enterprise bridge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simon Pegg should be banned from the franchise. He is taking it in the same campy direction as Bond went before Daniel Craig, where any danger in the movies becomes a joke. Same thing happened to Batman before Christopher Nolan took over and saved the franchise. The plot was incomprehensible with gaps in the logic you could drive a truck through. Whenever the narrative ground to a halt they compensated with some over the top, poor FX action scenes, in some you could even see the mat paintings. It was yawning all the way through. Why was Pegg getting more lines than some of the far more interesting and talented leads? Star Trek is not a joke, Simon Pegg is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Dreck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It should be called "Star Dreck". Ugh, it was terrible! The "plot" was an afterthought and took a distant backseat to explosions and chases. Spock looked puffy at best, chubby at worst, and with the bangs looked like a little girl. He was also emoting all over the place, he even laughed without the excuse of being controlled by a parasite or spore. Seriously, so BAD! It opened with Star-Wars level CGI aliens, reminiscent of Jar Jar Binks, and then turned into a Galaxy Quest parody. Need I remind anyone that Galaxy Quest was, itself, a parody? WORST. EPISODE. EVER! I must write fast, I'm blocking it from my memory as I type... Scotty did meet an alien girl whose head looked like an ice cream sundae. Vanilla ice cream, drizzled with hot fudge. I keep telling myself it's too late at night for a bowl of ice cream. All I could think was "How nice of that ice cream sundae to help them save the crew." Maybe next movie (ugh. something to dread!) could have something a little healthier, maybe a cameo by Bob the Tomato? The cut scenes were too fast (and yet, not fast enough!) and the camera work was headache-inducingly jerky. (Yum, ice cream and jerky. It did at least make me hungry!) There were maybe four decent lines of dialogue, all from McCoy, maybe a halfway decent line or two from Scotty, but plot and dialogue clearly weren't any kind of priority. No wonder they sued Axanar, the fan made stuff is much better than the movies, although I did like the first one, and gave it some leeway to develop later on, but the development never happened and each of the two sequels were worse than the one before. No character development, no Kirk flirting with ice cream girl, no rapport between him and Spock, no real, distinct personalities for any of them. Spock was actually MORE emotional than Kirk, or Sulu, or McCoy, other than that, anyone's dialogue could have been switched with anyone else's. As a Trekkie, I am sad. Maybe the next reboot will be better, this one is a lost cause.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>95% Special Effects, 5% rubbish script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've actually hurt my eyes from colossal eye-rolls endured by watching this movie. That's not a joke. This movie is awful start to finish.However, it's worth pointing out that if you liked the previous film, Into Darkness, then you'll like this film because it's more of the same: style without substance.My complaints can be summarised as points: ? The vast majority of the film is special effects, albeit high quality effects. But a film can't be made just by special effects - watching endless sequences of destruction porn is hardly entertaining.?&nbsp;The plot is shallow, contrived, intangible and absurd. Avoiding spoilers, none of it really makes sense - it's just a small amount of plot which pads out the excessive special effects sequences. There are lots of corny moments too, which made my stomach churn and previously mentioned eye-ache.? The self-fulfilling action sequences are just so confusing. A large portion of the scenes are in dim light, so it's actually not possible to see what's going on... just lots of mess everywhere and, apparently, people are running around doing something - but I can't tell what.?&nbsp;Character development is almost non existent. Just skims over them and presents corny, clich revelations of the main characters without enough exploration of the protagonist.? The directing is bloody awful - the camera is constantly moving all over the place and the action sequences flit between scenes with just a matter of seconds on each shot - no anticipation, no tension, too much confusion and disorientation. ?&nbsp;The 'comedy' is not funny. There was one joke which was amusing... the rest was very stale. I noticed the cinema was not laughing at the scenes which were presented as comedy.For fellow star trek fans:? There are inconsistencies with some characters' established personas, especially Spock's. Kirk is not presented as having captain-like qualities, just an action-hero. It's like you could put any plonker in charge of a space ship as long as they can win a fight.It's very hard to find redeeming qualities - Jaylah was good but there wasn't enough of her and, again, not much in the way of development. Karl Uban gets the tone right for McCoy but the jokes are stale and the relationship with Spock is spoiled by the terrible script writing. I liked the first Star Trek, although I felt it suffered from flaws. I didn't like Into Darkness at all and went into this film expecting mediocrity, as to not be disappointed. It was much, much poorer than I expected and will definitely say it's the worst film I've seen this year and possibly the worst film I've seen in a cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This episode of Fast and Furious is.... lost In space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do not be fooled by the high ratings as this Star Trek disgraces the name and the series;for me and I am sure many others it is a huge disappointment. I blame the director for making the movie look like an episode of fast and furious when nothing else matters. I lost interest in the movie well before it finished. In brief the story is that The Enterprise is captured by a man wearing a lizard costume. Star Trek up until this picture was all about clever space adventurers boldly going where no one has gone before with ingenious plots and interesting people: This movie is simply about trashy over the top action and special effects. Now we have no subtlety, no charismatic characters, hardly any humor and very little likability.Shame on you Producers!2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just got out of Star Trek 'Beyond'. What a disappointment! Just a noisy boring mess. Yes there was a lot of action.. but the characters were forgotten and just looked bored as well.I will say I am a bit of a 'Star Trek' fan. So for me.. this didn't live up to the basic Star Trek level. Which means a decent story and some interesting plot elements. This movie just didn't care about the plot and just wanted to blow things up. If you are just looking for explosions than I guess it does handle that part OK.I felt a bit bad for the actors. Sure they get paid well... but their talents were just wasted by the director. You could see they just didn't care too much and nothing was really clicking.Sure there were a few good moments... but I actually thought about walking out of the theater at a few points.Just could have been so much better.

		<fullReview>Gene Roddenberry sought adventure, diplomacy, and justice. Also, his stories warmed the hearts and minds of his fans, who kept the original TV series alive for three generations.The new installments don't understand any concept of any episode of the tome known as Star Trek. Instead, they set up a conflict between the crew of the Enterprise and some evil alien threat. Next comes a conflagration when there is no reason for it. Lastly, (no big surprise) the evil alien threat is neutralized.Compare and ContrastSpoiler!Take "The Devil in the Dark" where there is a mining operation deep inside of a large asteroid. The problem is the humans aren't the only life inside this rock. People are being murdered by a creature that looks like a cross between a pizza and lava. Kirk corners it. Spock communicates with it. Bones heals it's wounds. The miners discover they have been killing the creatures eggs. They make peace with it. And, they learn to cooperate.Spoiler!In "Star Trek: Beyond" the Enterprise is torn apart by a swarm of small space crafts called "Bees" and the crew is incarcerated on a class m planet (suitable for life of our kind). The evil alien leader of the Bees seems bent on terrorism. Later we find out that he's really a soldier who couldn't find solace in politics (autobiographical for the writers of this). His plans backfire. No adventure, no diplomacy, no justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What horrible waste of time and money.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't waste your time on the new Star Trek movie. I just walked out and demanded my money back. One of the few hopeful stories of a better world has been reduced to a plot less orgy about stupid, angry creatures blowing stuff up. Instead of car chases, it's exploding spaceships and flaming wreckage. The characters are a thin veneer over a shallow plot that never quite seems to develop. OK, I left after an hour, but by then I'd expected at least a bit of a story. Instead we got a few lines suggesting what seems to have been left out to make room for mire explosions and dead bodies. The producers and writers should be ashamed of themselves. They've destroyed the franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is star trek? This is the worst thing i've seen after the last transformers movie. There are more "what? what happened now? Oh, look, more special effect. Story? Uh, who gives a ** about it? BUT: we get IMDb-rating 7.7 for something that tastes like a week of white-bread and red bull. Special effects, special effects, special effects and in the end we're saving the world again, hooray. My opinion is: Makers, ask your financier which stone to crawl under. (oh, IMDb needs 10 lines at least for comment.) How many lines did it take for the story to make this film? children-book-size? Kirk got a part of a super-weapon, gets lured to a planet of the evil lord who wants that weapon to destroy everything, everyone is battling against, Kirk finds a motorbike - dream and symbol of liberty for everyone of the (real) world. Evil gets the weapon, but in the last moment Kirk stops him, tosses him to infinity of space: everything safe again, big adventure-mission accomplished. If it was a horror movie, the evil would have survived anyhow. But "normal" films tend to have a consequent, though sometimes crappy, story-line. Startrek beyond does not have a consequent story-line, it has fast special effects. If you're in for USS Enterprise vs unknown galaxies/critters, change the room: this is only an old story wrapped in special effects. And if i didn't mentioned enough yet: SPECIAL EFFECTS (no good story)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Wanted to Like This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a Star Trek fan. To the extent I've watched all the original eps, all Voyager, all of New Generation, Enterprise... the movies... I'm not a purist. I like the franchise, but I don't care passionately about it at all. So you'd think I was the ideal target for this film. Where do I begin? Perhaps I made the mistake of seeing the 3-D version. It didn't work for me at all. What wasn't blurry was dark. If it moved, I lost it, and trust me, almost everything moved all the time. This was not a film for reflection or personal growth. It was high-octane action the whole time. The jokes were lame. Even without seeing it I bet you can guess: playful grumpiness between Spock and McCoy? Scotty complaining that he canna do something? Spock not getting some human feeling? Yup, all there. Nothing new here, folks, move along. Yes, these things are what make the series worth watching but they were tired, oh so tired and stale.I can't even go into all the daft plot holes... no, actually I will. So, they find a previous version of a Federation ship (about 100 years old?) crashed on a planet. It's all still working. On board, Kirk finds a motorcycle. Uh-huh. Within a blink of an eye he's on it and careering around a fearfully rocky terrain winning the day. Bloody hell, my bike doesn't start after a day in the cold let alone 100 years. In my world petrol evaporates. But I guess in the 24th century they've invented the other kind. Actually there are too many plot holes to bother writing about. The whole film was fantasy more than fiction. Star Trek was always so careful to keep its science credible and consistent. No longer it seems. Anything for a good plot device. Then there's the women... shall I get into this? Oh, go on, John, no one's reading you anyway. Thank God for tiny little blonde slips of girls, cus, ya know, they can kick ass. They'll save the day. Save Kirk, save the whole damn crew. In fact, I don't think the future needs men at all. It doesn't need men's strength, men's instinctive desire to explore and discover, men's way of viewing the world. This film has just told us so. Women rock. Women rule. Fine. I'll switch my allegiance to another franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The action scenes: 99% of the film and were mostly incomprehensible. I never knew where people were on the ship in various action scenes. It was all very disjointed... and stupidly (fast and furiously) unrealistic. Suspension of disbelief NOT engaged. Oh and the dreaded camera shake, the tool employed by directors to disguise badly choreographed action scenes... I'd take massive amounts of Abrams' lens flares over camera shake any day.The story: almost non-existent. It finally revealed itself near the end, but I found by then I didn't give a *expletive deleted*. Jumping from scene to scene, huge leaps, no transitions. No flow. Just yuck The weapon used to defeat the bad guy army: .....give me a break,PLEASE.The characters that we all know and love: empty, consisting only of their clichs and one-liners. During the very rare and random scene where character and emotion were attempted, I simply didn't care anymore (save for one near the beginning, and scene with a trio of characters at the end. &#x202a;#&#x200e;llap&#x202c;) The laugh-track-esque laughter by about a fourth of he audience during the numerous one-liners: more proof that Idiocracy is becoming a reality.The best part of the movie: the two dedications in the credits. &lt;3 Over all, an EXTREMELY disappointing film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't say enough bad things about the movie so I will say what I think would have made it better. The gay kiss we heard so much but didn't get to see because it didn't make the cut. That would have been better than almost everything in the movie. The costumes were stiff and just did not seem to be believable,the actors are horrendous. Chris Pine - is he an actor or was he just lucky enough to have the look of the moment. Retool this mess and get rid of him and that Quinto fellow and maybe, just maybe, I will go to see the next movie and even pay for it versus sneaking in. I left that movie thinking it wasn't even as good as one episode of the original. Hollywood has run out of ideas and the best they could do on such short notice was this crap pile, written by a guy who isn't sure if he is a comedic or serious actor (he is neither, by the way). And he was kind enough to give us a taste of gay life -FANTASTIC, that really added to the quality of the film. In fact, in forty years, maybe we can get a gay Spock since the Quinto fellow is a homosexual. Maybe the Pegg fellow will still be writing great scripts. Finger crossed.</fullReview>

Well let me tell you BEYOND makes SPOCK'S BRAIN look like it belongs in the top 10 of all time episodes. Seeing BEYOND in IMAX 3 D was amazing you were literally part of the film but you did not have the option of leaving that film. I should not even call this piece of garbage a film it was a video game not a film there were explosions, crashes, firefights, hand to hand combat even a motorcycle chase one in which where Captain Kirk emit's a sort of Amber taken from the FRINGE TV series that J.J. Abrams had a hand in making all that would have been fine if their were a plot any plot . This film is going to leave a stain on the storied history of Star trek O it may find a audience one that likes action films but could not care less if there was a plot .

		<fullReview>Why did they have to blow up the starship "Enterprise?" AGAIN! I guess they had no original ideas for "Star Trek Beyond" so destroying the starship is the thing to do. Yeah, right. It makes up for a lack of imagination. Why the hell did Simon Pegg have to promote the movie in a short speech before the movie started? That shows "STB" is no good! It came off like the actress Virginia Madsen giving the opening speech at the beginning of the legendary sci-fi classic(laugh, laugh) movie called "DUNE." You're now literally begging the audience to like the movie! It doesn't work. A movie should be able to stand on it's own, without any speeches! No speeches, please! Adding insult to injury, the movie was filmed under "low light" conditions. Everything and everyone was filmed under low lights or in complete darkness. I couldn't see any of the fights at the beginning of the movie, because they were in the "DARK." Is this to make this movie appear or feel serious? It didn't work, because I couldn't SEE a lot of things clearly, because the movie was filmed "IN DARKNESS". Wasn't that the title of the previous Star Trek movie, which was called "INTO DARKNESS?" Thanks a lot! Lastly, the script for "Star Trek Beyond" (Beyond what, I don't know) was a rip off. Simon Pegg, you should be ashamed of yourself. The STB script was a partial copy (of key scenes) of an episode of Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda series. C'mon, Roddenberry fans, you ALL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. You know, that episode in the "Andromeda" series where an alien swarm race known as the "Magog" use their "swarm ships" to attack and board the starship Andromeda. "STB" uses that same scene. And other scenes. I was disgusted. I left after 35 or 40 minutes and read about the rest of movie in a synopsis on the Internet. In ending, I also hated the so called special effects, especially the one where the Enterprise is traveling through space. It looked like the starship was flying through space in a jelly mold. How dumb. I could go on and on. But I won't. Folks, don't waste your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually bother to review really bad movies as it just isn't worth the trouble.But this movie was especially awful, considering the considerable talent of the cast. The CGI was also majestic at timesThe awfulness of this movie rest squarely on the writers and the director, and frankly it seems it was written and put together with no care and thought whatsoever. If you like the Star Trek franchise you will probably be disappointed with the story-line and huge consistencies that make no sense. Also they even ripped off a Mass Effect character so badly they should have to pay royalties.Perhaps the most unappetizing aspect is that the director managed to make the evil protagonist look like both a Muslim and a black man at the same time .... that is quite a feat of intolerance and racism. The entire race actually looked like and had the mannerisms of Muslims. The best part was that the evil protagonist only did what he did because he couldn't be with star fleet, and hacked into star fleet headquarters by planting "spies/refugees" there.This movie should have had Donald Trump in the credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was utterly disappointing. I write screenplays, send them out to the Hollywood experts, and they are always talking about the great need for character arc. How about originality? How about an interesting story? How about plausibility? I don't know who wrote this, or how this script ever got the green light. Because it's utter garbage. There's not a interesting thing here. I don't really know where to start. In the first fifteen minutes of the movie, the enterprise is destroyed in ten seconds flat by a swarm of bee ships. So for the whole movie we have NO ENTERPRISE. I don't know about you, but I kind of like the ship being a story element. Anyway, the bee ships go back to the hive where they have been monitoring Star Fleet communications hoping that they would find this lost artifact which the stereotypical-monster-like-bad-guy needs to use to create a bio weapon. Why? I don't know, because he and his hive can destroy the enterprise in ten seconds flat. But it's "bio" weapon that eats a woman in three seconds flat, so I guess it's in there for the gratuitous (that sounds cool and scary) movie nonsense. Am I rambling here? If so, let me continue: there's an old Star Fleet ship found on the bad guys planet complete with a stereo-typical white makeup stuttering alien who has been restoring it's systems (ugh); there's Kirk on a motorcycle (also conveniently found on the old Star Fleet ship: "my dad had one of these" (double ugh)) which he uses to effortlessly run over and around the rocky surface of the bad guys planet to save the day; oh and there's rock music which will be played from the old Star Fleet ship (we got it running!) which is used to instantly (no need for any suspense here) destroy the hive of bee ships. The end (and I've left out fifty other additional low-end ugh parts, yes, ugh).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not disappointed anymore since the release of the last Star Wars awful movie. It came to my understanding that the SF genre is going to disappear since the story and script writers are out of ideas ... they combine the fantasy genre with super heroes and create the "SF" computer crap .Of course for those with low IQ and undeveloped intellect it's something perfect , they need special effects and action , for me it's a disaster ...But this is the road that humanity took : to be fake in every aspect of life.. All that matters is the profit and some good looking actors !Rip Star Wars / Star Trek / We'll see who's next ..There is a great lesson to learn from all these things that are happening : stay genuine , be yourself all the time , this is the only thing that makes life GREAT !</fullReview>
