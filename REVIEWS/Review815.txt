		<shortDescription>One of the best films noir ever, Double Indemnity communicates with amazing effectiveness the depths of depravity, greed, lust, and betrayal of the seemingly innocent and beautiful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best films of all time, not necessarily because of its story but because of the acting, direction, cinematography, lighting, and just the way that the story itself was told. At the time the film was released, the idea of revealing who the killer was in the opening scene was virtually unheard of, but it ended up being very effective because it allowed the audience to concentrate more on other elements of the film, which was the goal of Billy Wilder, the director. Instead of trying to figure out who the perpetrator was, there is more emphasis on how the crime was pulled off, what mistakes were made during the murder, who betrayed who, how close Barton Keyes (the insurance investigator) was getting to solving the case, and, probably most importantly, what kind of person Walter Neff is and whether or not sympathy should be felt toward him.Barbara Stanwyck, in one of the most remembered performances of her extensive career, represents (with nearly flawless ease) the cold and ruthless manipulator who has no difficulty in ruining other people's lives in various ways (including death, if necessary) in order to get what she wants. Known in the film community as the `femme fatale,' this is someone who uses her sexual prowess, seductiveness, and emotional detachment to drag an unsuspecting person (generally an interested man) into a scheme from which she is expected to benefit heavily and he is most likely headed for destruction. In these types of films, the man often either finds his life in ruins or ends up dead, as is often (but not always) also the case with the fate of the femme fatale. Barbara Stanwyck (as Phyllis Dietrichson, the murderous femme fatale in Double Indemnity) and Fred MacMurray (as Walter Neff, her ?victim'), have amazing chemistry on screen. Their attraction is incredibly well portrayed, and the development of their relationship with each other is so convincing that what happens between them almost seems normal. Besides that, their mutually calculated interaction, although it seems at first like it has been rehearsed endlessly and ultimately brought unconvincingly to the screen, is exactly as it was meant to be, because it represents each character's intentions, even very subtly foreshadowing their future betrayals against each other. Phyllis has gone through every word she ever says to Walter in her head. She has practiced what she wants to say when she brings up the idea of life insurance to Walter in the beginning and she knows what she wants to say whenever they interact with each other because she has been planning for quite some time the prospect of murdering her husband in order to collect his fortune. Walter, conversely, methodically makes amorous advances as though this is something that he does regularly, and then ultimately he also plans out his conversations with Phyllis because he begins to suspect her and is sure to tell her only what he wants her to hear. This seemingly stiff dialogue brilliantly represents Phyllis and Walter's precise (and sinister) intentions, and it's quick pace creates a feeling of urgency and restlessness.Probably the most fascinating and entertaining actor in the film, Edward G. Robinson, plays Barton Keyes, Walter's friend and employer at the insurance company where he works. Keyes is a very suspicious man who closely investigates the insurance claims which come into the company, having a striking history of accurately isolating fraudulent claims and throwing them out. His handling of Phyllis's (and Walter's, technically) claim and the way that he gets closer and closer to the truth create a great atmosphere of tension and drama. Double Indemnity is nearly flawless. From the shocking and unexpected beginning to the already known but still surprising end, the audience is held rapt by the excellent performances, the brilliant and imaginative direction, and the flawlessly created atmosphere. This is excellent, excellent filmmaking, and is a classic film that should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Justifiably At The Top Of Most Film Noir Lists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best-liked classic films of all time and I am among that large group of fans as well.Few movies have ever had dialog this entertaining.....at least the conversations between Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. I think it's a big appeal to this movie, except to younger folks who look at it as "cheesy."I read the book, Double Indemnity written by James Cain, and was surprised that the film's snappy dialog was not in it. This is one of the rare times when the movie was far better than the book. That's not a shock after you find out that literary giant Raymond Chandler and Hall Of Fame director Billy Wilder combined to write the screenplay,For a murder/suspense story, there is very little action, almost none, yet there are no boring lulls. The three main actors - Stanwyck, MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson, are what make this so good.MacMurray's narration is fun to hear as he tells the story in flashback, from the beginning by dictating into an old Dictaphone to his co-worker Robinson. The latter is almost mesmerizing in his performance, the way he delivers his lines. He can even make a speech about something as boring as insurance and still keep you riveted to the screen.Stanwyck was no sex symbol (at least to me) but she looked great here in the most seductive of 1940s clothing and, like Robinson, has a distinctive voice and accent that keeps your attention.This film was the inspiration for the 1980 movie, "Body Heat," starring William Hurt and Kathleen Turner. That, too, was a very, very good movie....but not many films are in the class of this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It fits together like a watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've now seen this movie 14 times in 25 years, at all times of the year, in all moods, sober or not etc - but always at night. I recorded my copy off TV in 1987 so I can only imagine what a remaster would do for it. With an atmosphere thick enough to cut with a knife it never fails to engross and enchant me, and although it's been dated for 40 years or more still seems relevant and watchable today. TV, answer phones, recordable CD/DVD, memory sticks and the internet have all come between us and yet I can still watch Fred MacMurray speaking into a Dictaphone without a qualm. Who wears a hat in California nowadays? Who buys beer whilst driving! Lift attendants have gone but I can still believe in Charlie working and laughing away in the garage past 11 at night.Woman and man agree to murder woman's husband but on the way to the cemetery they face grilling by insurance company. I think everything has been said before on the IMDb - by those who think it's one of the best films ever made! To those who simply think the main problem is that it's dated I wish you could see the TV commercials that dug into DI back in '87 - what a hoot - and compare. I've just noticed the print TCM UK is showing in 2005 is lip-synced out, very wobbly Rosza music track, fading and ageing fast - worse than my 1987 video tape (maybe logically). They're supposed to be encouraging people to enjoy the classics but they won't do that with such inferior screening copies. Dear TCM UK, this is an impressive iconic film - it deserves a billion dollar remaster authorised by the Library of Congress, not repeatedly trotting out unimpressive cheap worn dupes to fill those 2 hour slots.Everything about DI from the acting, production, direction, and music is superbly dignified and is as "close to perfection" as human beings are probably allowed to get with this form of Art - especially with the more limited technology at their disposal in '44. When most films from now are long forgotten and dated DI will still be getting re-runs on TV and art-house cinemas - God and remasters willing - that is the fact of it.Fortunia Bonanova certainly was fortunate to have appeared in bit parts in 2 of the best films ever made - Citizen Kane the other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimate film-noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Double Indemnity is based on a novel by James Cain adapted to the screen by great novelist Raymond Chandler, who made here his most important contribution to the cinema history in his career, though somehow matched by following screenwriting work for 1946 Howard Hawks' classic The Big Sleep, and Billy Wilder, who previously worked as a screen writer for Ernest Lubitsch and had been already nominated three times for Academy Awards in the process before making Double Indemnity, which nevertheless played the key role in establishing him as one of the best writer-directors in Hollywood, and giving him his fourth Oscar nomination as a writer and his first one as a director.Double Indemnity was the third feature Wilder directed after 1942 The Major and the Minor and 1943 Five Graves to Cairo, but it was definitely the first film, his primary American tragedy where the author for the first time revealed his black and somehow hopelessly pessimistic view of the American society and of the human society in general, blackishly desecrated in the film simply by populating it with exceptionally sordid characters, who independently of being a victim or victimized, of being the protagonists or just simple supporters are never really able to transcend the utterly low and devilish motivations in theirs as a consequence sordidly painful lives and reach such a state where the viewer might get relieved by considering one of them as a positive element. Instead the characters' lives shown in a continuous noir flashback of Fred MacMurray's not-a-confession are driven from the start to the very end by an utter greed in a form of double and not only indemnities with consequential and inherent to it risks and fears in a rather unsure world of insurance.An insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), a man with `no visible scars', starts to lose his already shaky dominance over his mind's yearnings when glimpses on a horizon a possibility of becoming a recipient of a monetary fortune along with no less seductive desire from a part of unhappily married and as devilishly beautiful as resourceful in pursuing her zany in its deadliness schemes, an ultimate femme fatale blond Phyllis (marvellously portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck).Initially apparent as a romantic, the relationship gradually mutates into double confrontation of the two fears of the two characters in their greedy and ambitious pursuits, a conflict which at one point apparently results in a sort of humanization of Phyllis' character, appearing hiding the eyes of her soul behind the sun glasses, a humanization which is let to happen by her only to accentuate later her unchangeably fatal nature.The double confrontation gradually evolves into a triple one when the threatening presence on the scene of no less and probably more resourceful character of Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) becomes more and more evident, as a result of his continuous and obsessive investigation conducted with different but nor less ambitious motives. A motives which find its ultimate revelation in a most touching, but finally most hypocritical scene of declaration of love (I love you - I love you too) between Walter Neff and Barton Keyes in the end, exactly reflecting the same nature of previous interactions between Walter and Phyllis, where such moments with the very words used, such as the supreme word of loving affection - Baby lowered to an unthinkable extent, only were a mere preparation to struck another blow in yet another outburst of hate caused by a new misfortunate complication in carrying out so well devised and apparently perfect plan.Permeated right from the start to the very end with the flavour of unstoppable fatality in an extent that a few other film-noirs achieved, accentuated by the wonderful music score by Miklos Rozsa, Double Indemnity's story is motored by the money like in nearly all of Billy Wilder films. But in this case all the misery produced by it as evident as never before resulting in utter corruption of already corrupted characters and their descent into a such a deep abyss of human misery as probably never before or after in a Hollywood film history, an abyss with no exit, with omnipresent hypocrisy, with no place for sincere human feelings of love, friendship or affection, an abyss to where the characters descent under the monotonous tune of Miklos Rozsa's score, which serves as a reflection of their monotonously hypocrite and ultimately doubly doomed lives. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Not-So-Perfect Crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Double Indemnity begins with a car speeding on a dark, rainy night. This begins the classic film noir plot. Billy Wilder directs a steamy and grabbing film. Billy Wilder pulls this film together with an awesome cast, perfect lighting and an amusing script. Fred MacMurray plays Walter Neff, an unsuspecting insurance salesman. He is unsuspecting in the sense that he is unaware of what the ?femme fatale' is going to put him up to. Barbara Stanwyck plays the ?femme fatale', Phyllis Dietrichson, a manipulative housewife who will stop at nothing to get what she wants.The film begins in present day giving insight into Walter's current plight. Walter Neff gives the voice over as the plot unfolds. It starts in the present time allowing the audience to know what crime has happened without the interesting details to support it. This is an interesting twist to the common film noir plot. Knowing the crime at hand keeps the audience hungry for those details. Walter is the victim of the beautiful woman who manipulates him into pulling off a murderous insurance fraud scam. Walter is an impeccable insurance salesman and Phyllis, in some ways, forces him into providing her with what she needs. Phyllis is the typical ?femme fatale' who has no problem in using others to get what she wants.Throughout the film Walter is completely enamored by Phyllis. Walter could have coined the pet name ?baby' with his fondness towards Phyllis by calling her that throughout the film. He is easily distracted by her beauty and evil charm. He seems to be entranced by Phyllis's ankle bracelet, so much that he mentions it numerous times. This allows the audience to feel the sexual tension between the two. Phyllis, on the other hand, shows the audience that she can use and abuse anyone who gets in her way. While believably attracted to Walter, Phyllis keeps him hopping to fulfill her needs. She pulls him in and handles him like a puppet. She is the epitome of the film noir genre's ?femme fatale'.Barton Keyes, played by Edward G. Robinson, is Walter's co-worker and friend at the insurance company where he works. Barton closely investigates all insurance claims that come across his desk. While at one time Walter assuredly agreed with this practice, once Barton starts to unravel the mystery behind Mrs. Dietrichson's insurance claim, we begin to see just how nervous and paranoid Walter is. Walter then begins to see Phyllis in a whole new light. Barton plays the integral part by piecing together details that are thrown around throughout the film. This keeps the tension high for the filmgoer. These details are pieced together perfectly through to the end.Double Indemnity has the perfect plot with the perfect cast. Walter and Phyllis' attraction are tasty and the crime is wonderfully puzzling. Double Indemnity is the true film noir giant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive Film Noir.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Double Indemnity is a film which fully embodies its genre, all the classic noir elements are present: venetian blinds, diagonal lines, a femme fatale and a victim of fate.Fred MacMurray takes the central role as victim of fate, Walter Neff; cast against type, MacMurray gives a thoroughly convincing performance as a typical insurance salesman transformed into a calculating killer.The estimable Barbara Stanwyck also delivers a typically faultless performance as the coldhearted and seductive Phyllis Dietrichson who enlists Neff in a plot to kill her husband and cash in on the insurance money.Although this film may seem clichéd today, as many thrillers since have offered similar plot lines, rarely has the story been told so well. For fans of Film Noir, Stanwyck or MacMurray, this is an absolute MUST SEE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I liked the way that anklet bit into her leg. I wanted to see her again, up close, without that silly staircase between us."--Walter Neff, after meeting Phyllis Dietrichson This is Fred MacMurray like you've never seen him before. He's edgy and sharp, and amoral, although he hides it well from his boss. Barbara Stanwyck's astounding performance set the standard for bad girls in Film Noir for years to come. I love this film because it is a perfect example of how the censorship of the time made it so that filmmakers had to get the sexiness across in a subtle way. This movie is undeniably sexy, and there's not a single 'love scene' in it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some times, when they least expect it.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are occasional times when all the elements come together to make a great film that will stand the passing of time. "Double Indemnity" seems to be an example of this phenomenon.First, there was a great novel by one of America's best mystery writers, James Cain, who created these characters that seem will live forever in our imagination. Then, the lucky break in getting the right man to direct it, Billy Wilder, a man who knew about how to make a classic out of the material that he adapted with great care and elegance with Raymond Chandler, a man who knew about the genre."Double Indemnity" works because it's a story we can relate to. There is a greedy woman trapped in a bad marriage, who sees the opportunity when she encounters an insurance agent who is instantly smitten with her and who has only sex in his mind. The manipulator, Phyllis Dietrichson, doesn't need much to see how Walter desires her. His idea of having her husband sign an insurance policy he knows nothing about, thinking he is doing something else, will prove a fatal flaw in judgment.Mr. Wilder achieves in this film what others try, with disastrous results. The director, who was working under the old Hays Code, shows so much sex in the film with fully clothed actors, yet one feels the heat exuding from the passion Walter Neff feels for Phyllis. He is a man that will throw everything away because he is blinded by the promise of what his life will be once the husband is out of the picture.In life, as well as in fiction, there are small and insignificant things that will derail the best laid plans. First, there i Jackson, the man who shouldn't have been smoking at the rear of the train, contemplating the passing landscape. Then, no one counts in the ability of Barton Keys, the man in the agency who has seen it all! Walter and Phyllis didn't take that into consideration and it will backfire on their plan.We try to make a point to take a look at "Double Indemnity" when it shows on cable from time to time. Barbara Stanwyck makes a magnificent Phyllis. There are no false movements in her performance. Phyllis gets under Walter's skin because she knows where her priorities lie and makes good use of them in order to render Walter helpless under her spell.Fred McMurray makes a perfect Walter. He is consumed by his passion and he will do anything because of what he perceives will be the reward for doing the crime. Walter Neff was perhaps Mr. McMurray's best creation. He is completely believable and vulnerable.Edgar G. Robinson, as Barton Keys, makes one of his best performances for the screen. Keys is a man that has seen all the schemes pass by his desk. He is, in a way, Walter's worst nightmare, because working next to Keys, he gets to know how wrong he was in the planning of the crime.The supporting cast is excellent. Porter Hall, Jean Heather, Tom Powers, Richard Gaines, Fortunio Buonanova and John Philliber are perfect.The music score of Miklos Rosza gives the film a texture and a dimension that capitalizes on the action it intends to enhance. Also the music of Cesar Franck and Franz Schubert contribute to the atmosphere of the movie. The great cinematography of John Seitz, who will go on to direct films, is another asset in the movie. Edith Head's costumes are absolutely what a woman like Phyllis would wear right down to her ankle bracelet.This film shows a great man at his best: Billy Wilder!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is great fun. Sxity years later, it's as taut and engaging and beautiful as any contemporary story.It simmers, it sizzles, the tension between Neff and Dietrichson is positively palpable. But, as the tension between Neff and Dietrichson fizzles, the tension between Neff and Keyes heats up.It's as pure a sample of classic film noir as there is, and it does it with unparalleled style.This is what movie-making is all about. It's not a labrynth of characters and trick endings and gimmicks. In fact, the movie starts with our tragic hero admitting he's the who whodunit...what are we left with?The story of how and why he dunit, of how he was intoxicated and bewitched, yet came to his senses, not soon enough to save him legally, but at least to come to terms with his own failure.</fullReview>

The screenplay itself is a work of art in its charater construction, plot structure and dialogue which is delievered by an ensemble of first class actors divying up first class performances. Barbra Stanwyck as the deadly, smouldering, scheming Phyllis Dietrichson turns in a performance that is right up there with Mary Astor's Brigid O'Shaughnessy. Fred McMurray delievers a performance of a smart but desperately lovelorn patsy and Edward G. Robinson is perfect in the role of Barton Keyes and just about steals the moment every time he appears on screen.I personally love a good Noir film and this is right up there with the best of them.

		<shortDescription>An all-time Hollywood classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film noir classic may be the best murder mystery of all time in this storied Hollywood genre. Fred MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson are excellent but it is Barbara Stanwyck who really makes the picture come together as a woman without a moral compass. Stanwyck set the standard for tough, calculating, shady women who exploit men without shame or remorse and her masterful manipulation of MacMurray is the movie's central theme. The film's imagery is filled with shadows and low lighting, accompanied by a tense, brooding music score. Stanwyck spins her web of ensnarement like a black widow with her victim seemingly unaware of the danger that enfolds him. MacMurray provides the narrative of the film which is told in flashback and delivers a cryptic account of the events in a confession to a boss who trusted him completely. Robinson is on target as the skeptical and suspicious boss who has a sixth sense about phony insurance claims. A nice supporting cast contributes to this thriller, namely Richard Gaines and Porter Hall.</fullReview>

Best of all was Wilder's "Double Identity." It was based on a real-life assassination in New York in 1927, when a wife and her lover killed the husband for his insurance money? In the film, a near-breaking-point tension was reached and sustained in the passion of an insurance salesman and a passionately sensual femme fatale ? an intense desire for each other and for money; in the murder of the poor husband; and in their useless attempts to escape the ability of a fast-talking investigator?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Try to forget all the film-noir parodies you've seen--this is the real thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years, I was entertained by film-noir homages/parodies like Garrison Keillor's "Guy Noir, Private Eye" and the Coens' "The Man Who Wasn't There," but I'd never seen an authentic noir. I finally got my chance with "Double Indemnity," which helped establish the genre as we know it. The expected elements are all here: Shadow-filled black-and-white cinematography. An ordinary man (Walter Neff, played by Fred MacMurray) who becomes an amoral criminal under the influence of a femme fatale (Phyllis Dietrichson, played by Barbara Stanwyck). Abundant cynicism, pessimism, and fatalism. Tough, stylized dialogue, including voice-over narration with a kind of hard-edged poetry to it.However, because in the 21st century we see film noir parodies more frequently than the real thing, we've been conditioned to laugh at some of the excesses of the genre--especially this sort of narration. Thus, lines like "How could I know that murder could sometimes smell like honeysuckle?" or "I got to thinking about what cemeteries are for--they're for putting dead people in!" strike us as much funnier than they were probably intended to be. Instead of helping create a dark, gritty atmosphere, they actually jolt us out of the movie by prompting our scoffing laughter.In short, "Double Indemnity" does a great job of establishing the rules of the world in which the story takes place, but we now have trouble accepting that world on its own terms. And I do believe that this movie was intended to have some humor to it--but of the grimly ironic kind, not the "isn't this a little ridiculous?" humor we find in it today.Still, there is much to admire about "Double Indemnity." It has a very strong plot--simply but elegantly constructed, and even though its general outlines get revealed within the first five minutes, the movie always remains interesting. The relationship between Walter and Phyllis is intriguingly ambiguous--it's not clear whether they are motivated by lust, greed, or something else entirely. (Roger Ebert's Great Movies essay has some noteworthy theories about this, and made me realize that this ambiguity is an asset, not a flaw.) Most impressive and unexpected is the character of insurance-claims investigator Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson). Though Keyes functions like a detective, his role doesn't indulge in any "film-noir detective" clichés. Instead, he's the most real-seeming person in the movie: rumpled, gruff, blustering, detail-obsessed, highly conscientious, and very funny. And gradually, the film reveals that the relationship between Walter and Keyes is even more complex and interesting than that between Walter and Phyllis."Double Indemnity" will always be watched because of its role in establishing the conventions of film noir, but more importantly, it's still an entertaining movie--even if, sixty years later, it's sometimes entertaining for reasons the filmmakers never intended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sharp. Really sharp.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a dynamite piece of filmmaking by Billy Wilder. Wilder is in my opinion a very underrated director, much like John Houston. The acting is in top form from all of the players. The cinematography is crisp, and beautiful. The sound is nice and clear, and the direction is arguably some of Wilder's best. However, the real star is the screenplay. First off, it was taken from excellent source material. James Cain is always great for a story where nobody wins out. Check out The Postman Always Rings Twice for an example. But it is Chandler who I think really put this one on the map. Chandler has a way with dialogue that makes it all ring in your ears. The lines are smooth, and the characters always say something that makes me wish I could be that clever and smooth in everyday situations. Chandler knows dialogue, Chandler knows LA, and Chandler knows how to deliver a story. Check out any of his novels, and you will see this. This is a teamup that I really wish would have happened again. Oh well. If you don't mind voice over narration, then this is a film for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Double Indemnity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the first time he sees that ankle bracelet, Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is a doomed man. As Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) descends her California home's spiral staircase, we are as enraptured as Neff. And it takes little time to figure out that being enraptured by this femme fatale is a very dangerous position to find oneself in. Is it accidental that the bracelet is worn around her ankle, as opposed to the more traditional wrist? Is it accidental that the sunlight streaming through the windows cast shadows not unlike bars across the living room? I suspect it's about as accidental as Mr. Dietrichson (Tom Powers) eventually ending up dead along the railroad tracks. We must remember that Billy Wilder is doing more than evoking noir here, he's inventing it. And how brave he is! Beginning the film by all but divulging the ending is hardly the route most directors choose to go when directing a thriller. But as he's well aware, the audience doesn't care half as much about where they end up as they do about the thrill of the ride it takes to get them there. The structure of the film is familiar to anyone who has seen "Body Heat," or any other knockoff. "Double Indemnity" is the original however, and it's intricate plot revels in its complexities nearly as much as Walter and Phyllis do in their convoluted plot to dispose of an unwanted husband. The audience learns only a minimum about the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Dietrichson, but we easily surmise that their union was not out of love. If the marriage was one of convenience, than the murder certainly is. It seems unlikely Phyllis is after the freedom to continue her heady tryst with Walter, and even the money provided by the double indemnity clause of Mr. Dietrichson's life insurance policy seems more like a bonus than a motivation. In other words, Phyllis just wants her husband dead. And Neff obliges. Several times while watching "Double Indemnity," I felt my pulse physically quicken. These scenes were most notably the ones in which it looked as though Walter and Phyllis' trolley car had finally reached the end of its line, and discovery of their crime was inevitable. The scene where Phyllis is forced to hide behind a door, knowing that incrimination awaits if the person on the other side sees her, is unrelenting in its suspense. After all, we want this reprehensible act to go off without a hitch every bit as much as they do. That is the sign of a good film. It also stands to reason, seeing as how we were there when the elaborate scheme was being plotted. That makes us accessories. And if they get caught, God help us, so do we.</fullReview>

They both play dark, sinister roles, unlike what they are both known for. I love the playful banter as they flirt and tease each other before things get more serious. Plot also has several clever twists, and the viewer squirms several times when the investigators almost catch people in compromising positions in a Hitchcock manner. Edward Robinson is MacMurray's boss helping to track down the clues. Billy Wilder directed. Movie was remade later in 1973 with richard crenna, but stick with the old b/w version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure I can think of any new original praise for this film. All I can say is that the suspenseful twists and turns of the the classic film-noir plot and the moral ambiguity of Walter and Phyliss brought to life by truly memorable performances by MacMurray and Stanwyck (and Robinson in his key supporting role as Keys) left an indelible mark on my cinema mad mind even before I had become aware of the film's deserved legendary reputation. When I think of this film, I think of Proverbs 5:3-5 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil. But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chandler's influence....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was impressed by the subtle changes Raymond Chandler and Billy Wilder worked on Cain's novella. The book DOUBLE INDEMNITY is a fast, slick morality piece wherein an amoral hero ("Walter HUFF") callously disregard notions of Good and Evil, only to find that Evil does exist (The things he discovers about Phyllis Dietrichson's past carry quite a shock.. and were omitted from the film.)and that he is sleeping with it. The ending is literally hellish and obviously influenced writers like Jim Thompson.The film, on the other hand, discards this to play up a love story between Edward G. Robinson and Fred MacMurray. Their mutual respect at the beginning of the film has turned into sad affection by the end, when Robinson lights MacMurray's cigarette, Fred says, "...It was right across the desk from you," Ed answers, "Closer than that, Walter," and Fred replies, "I love you, too." Tellingly, the exchange doesn't seem gay, just the expression of feelings between two men. Chandler knew how to write this and Wilder knew how to film it -- and very well indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Along with "Out Of The Past", one of the greatest film noirs of all time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wilder's astute direction, a cracking tale of murder and deception taken from James M Cain's pulpy novel, an appropriately dark atmosphere, and the lethal combination of Stanwyck/MacMurray and Robinson in support combine for a stunning film noir.MacMurray gives possibly the best performance (definitely the most well-known) of his career as the insurance representative Walter Neff, a weak-chinned chump who lets himself get talked into a murder-for-insurance scheme by the duplicitous double-crossing dame Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck), who's not very fond of her older hubby at all.Stanwyck's femme fatale performance is pure dynamite. She's fake and trashy yet alluring with her tart blonde hair (Stanwyck wore a wig), sweetly seductive voice and mesmerizing (to Neff, anyway) anklet. This girl's motives are purely selfish, covered by a pretence of romance, and she is apt to quickly change her line of attack to get what she wants. One moment, Stanwyck is "crying softly" on MacMurray's shoulder like a lost little lamb- the next, she is spitting venom like an angry cobra.'Double Indemnity' possesses an amazing script filled with plenty of juicy, hard-bitten dialogue and double entendres. Stanwyck and MacMurray's interactions always have a smoky sexy undercurrent punctuated by cracking one-liners.MacMurray's protagonist provides the voice-over so common to the noir genre. It is one of the best you'll hear, with MacMurray narrating the circumstances of his own downfall with a resigned, yet smooth manner. Great use of lighting and shadows- this film has amazing visual style; it looks foreboding.Robinson is a great in a supporting role as claims manager Keyes, who, after the couple commit their crime (knocking off Barbara's old hubby), quickly gets wise that his death was no accident. It was murder- and Keyes is determined to snuff out the criminal. He suspects Stanwyck from the start, but is oblivious to Neff's involvement. Here, with Robinson and MacMurray's characters, we have possibly the first open declaration of love between two males in the cinema. When Keyes finds out about Neff's involvement, there is no vicious air between the two men. Instead, a kind of hurt, disappointed sadness.One thing I found really nice amidst the dark deeds was Neff's relationship with Dietrichson's daughter, Lola (Jean Heather). As his world is crashing down around him, Walter finds some sort of ironic comfort with the distraught young girl, whose mother and father have both died under suspicious circumstances (Hello, Phyllis) along with her boyfriend being suspected in her father's murder. Ironic indeed, as Walter was one of the perpetrators of her pain. But one feels that their relationship has an underlying purity to it, so we accept it. She is the girl Neff should have taken up with in the first place. After all, Neff is our resident "poor sucker". It's that black-hearted witch Phyllis who we have to blame.Or is it? Neff could have backed out of the plan at any time, he was just weak and caught in the clutches of a powerful woman in control. Stanwyck merely activated MacMurray's long-held desire to crook the system. Phyllis does redeem herself to a degree near the film's conclusion, but it's too late for both lovers.The original of a type of crime flick that has been copied relentlessly over the years, 'Double Indemnity' is definitely one of the best, tightest noirs I've had pleasure to view .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic tale of double-cross and scheming is done to a nicety. Never mind the fact that the script is formulaic and predictable, and the characters are all selfish and self-serving. Just sit back and enjoy some great acting and smart direction.Billy Wilder knew exactly how far to stretch this tale of an insurance salesman who fatefully falls for the femme fatale who would spell ruin for him. He knew the strengths and weaknesses, and he let it ride from there.Fred MacMurray gleefully overplays his stereotype hero guy. He's got the smarts, the looks and he's almost got the dame. As said beauty, Barbara Stanwyck is a must, and few could do this sort of thing better. Cap all this with the dry, witty performance from Edward G. Robinson who lives and breathes insurance claims. He gets all the best lines and devours them.In a nutshell you have here a must for any 40's film buffs.Sunday, November 1, 1998 - Astor Theatre</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favorite movie. I think Fred MacMurray gives his best performance ever. Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson also stand out. The script, co-written by the film's director, Billy Wilder, and mystery author Raymond Chandler is crisp and tough. MacMurray's lines are memorable.It is a story of greed, fear and lust. Greed so intense that it drives the mild-mannered MacMurray to murder. And fear, grasping at his senses, that it permeates his ability to think reasonably. And, of course, lust, the kind of lust for the equally bad Stanwyck that drove him to commit evil in the first place.If you like old films, especially film noir, see this one. It is absolutely perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Collusion with Angora</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1943, director of the film, "Double Indemnity", Billy Wilder, was painstakingly determined to complete a motion picture about this compelling novel written by James M. Cain. Cain is known for other great novels such as "Mildred Pierce" and "The Postman Always Rings Twice". In the process of creating this major motion picture, several actors, including George Raft and Alan Ladd, turned down the job as the sinister leading male role in this movie. Finally, the part was offered to squeaky clean, Fred MacMurray, this appointment is literally, out of character for MacMurray! Barbara Stanwyck received the honor for the lead female role in "Double Indemnity", and Edward G Robinson was given the third billing as a star in this picture. This post of third billing was something that had not happened to Edward G Robinson since his prior acting days before "Little Caeser", which was made in 1931. Robinson capitulated to a third billing spot because he had a great admiration for the concept that the film "Double Indemnity" so intricately purported! The whole genre to "Double Indemnity" was set up flawlessly, as it orchestrated a deliberately contradictory dynamic. Behind the sunny pleasantry of Los Angeles, there lurked a deep rooted and conniving chicanery amidst a couple of masterminds who began implementing a horribly dark aspect of human behavior. The film, "Double Indemnity" manifested the rough exterior that the United Staes was besieged with because of their involvement in World War II. The American movie goer had become a little less naive since the advent of WWII, and, this reflected itself accordingly with regards to the type of movie they wanted to see. The film noir captivated the American public, and, now, the movie industry encompassed a myriad of wry depictions that were germane to the pejorative side of an individual. This dubiously sensationalistic technique by the motion picture industry was perceived as intriguing by the newly enlightened movie audience of the early 1940's!! The film "Double Indemnity" epitomizes the entire film noir pique, right alongside with the uncanny masterpiece "Maltese Falcon". "Double Indemnity" did not win for best picture in 1944, that year, the Academy Award was given to "Going My Way". As we all know, there are times when life simply does not make any sense, especially since a prominent Philadelphia critic rated "Going My Way" the worst Academy Award winning film in the whole history of the American cinema! "Double Indemnity" is considered to be Billy Wilder's best directing effort! The next year, Billy Wilder's directorial ability was totally vindicated, as he received his rightfully deserved acclaim with the film, "The Lost Weekend", which won for best picture in 1945. Billy Wilder received the Academy Award for best director that year as well. The film, "Double Indemnity" is truly remarkable!! The itemized and avaricious intensity to this movie was something that had not been depicted in films before the movie "Double Indemnity" was made. This film's wiles of malice and deceit were not expedited with a derivative and visceral disposition, rather, these antics were carried off with a dedicated fervor and paramount gratification. Fred MacMurray's character was perpetually afflicted with a relentless angst that infiltrated an acrimonious reveille to him about the primary repercussions of personal greed! His character, Walter Neff, endured a narrative agony which perpetuated a compulsive pontification about how people really are, as opposed to the way they are suppose to be! Barbara Stanwyck established her formidable status as a revolutionary femme-fatal in the Hollywood world of movies, with her performance in "Double Indemnity". Charismatically charming while wearing her diverse onslaught of angora sweaters, her beauty and allure became a necessary ingredient to the making of this film! The wig that Barbara Stanwyck wore for this movie, signified the overall mendacity to her heinously lethal and obsessive persona!! Stanwyck's intellectual ambiguity to this role was attributed to her overtly callous set of pecuniary priorities! Edward G. Robinson's character was the perennial voice of reason. Robinson was the legal eagle who would ultimately prevail in his tenacious quest to resolve all of these dubiously manufactured and felonious escapades! The final scene with MacMurray and Stanwyck was an all-time noir classic. This last scene with MacMurray and Stanwyck was one of the best scenes of any movie whatsoever, definitely head to head with the extraordinary last scene of the movie "The Killing". A respected production company ranks this ending the sixth best ending of any and all movies ever produced! The dramatic ending to "Double Indemnity" was rated right above "Casablanca" and right below "City Lights". The heightened glamor to the final scene for MacMurray and Stanwyck exuded a zenith within the realm of the classic film noir mystique. The emphatic, yet subtle, overtone to the song "Tangerine" playing in the background, became a melodic element to this final scene which was conducive to a sexually sedate form of apocalyptic doom and despair! Throughout the entire duration of this movie, Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck were always seducing each other with salacious innuendos! This ending wound up emulating a philosophical perspective used by writers of ancient Greek tragedies! Filming a movie in black and white is primarily advantageous to the quality of a film, as it obviates any disorientation to the impact of the characters' emotions!! AFI (AMERICAN FILM INSTITUTE) ranks "Double Indemnity" the 29th best film out of the top 100 American movies ever made! This website ranks "Double Indemnity" 53rd out of the top 250 films ever produced. Last, but certainly not least, America's Writer's Guild East, ranks "Double Indemnity" the 26th best written script ever in the history of American films!! The director, Billy Wilder, does a tremendous job with consummating the aggregate megalomania and rancor to this movie. The acting was sensational. "Double Indemnity" was up for seven Academy Awards in 1944! Without question! "Double Indemnity" is one of the greatest films ever created... FIVE STARS... PERFECT TEN!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anytime You Want A Husband Turned Into Cold Cash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's cynical self came to public attention in this classic noir film about a luckless insurance salesman and one coldhearted dame. Double Indemnity skirted the very edges of Code morality and it took years before someone brought James M. Cain's novel to the screen.According to a book on Billy Wilder the casting of Barbara Stanwyck was a must for Phyllis Dietrichson, otherwise the film might never have been made. Barbara Stanwyck was that rarest of players, one who could be good and convincing in all kinds of parts. Look at the films she got her four Oscar nominations besides Double Indemnity, Stella Dallas, Ball of Fire, and Sorry Wrong Number. Not one of those is similar to any one of the others and Stanwyck was acclaimed in all of them.Fortunately for Wilder and for Paramount's budget, their leading man was right on the lot. Fred MacMurray who has been playing comedic foils for folks like Carole Lombard, Claudette Colbert, etc. up to that time, made the most of playing the feckless Walter Neff who gets sucked into a homicidal scheme through passion.Double Indemnity is a landmark film in that it's two leads are really rotten people. Barbara Stanwyck has a husband in Tom Powers she can't stand and would like to bump him off for an insurance settlement and MacMurray's the insurance salesman she beguiles into her plot. Funny thing is that when the mechanics of the murder plot are discussed and formulated, the ideas are all MacMurray's. Billy Wilder made two other films similar to Double Indemnity where a weak protagonist gets caught up in a filthy scheme. In Sunset Boulevard William Holden plays the gigolo way to well and can't break from unto pain of death. And Kirk Douglas's scheme about exploiting the tragedy of a man trapped in a cave brings him down all the way in Ace in the Hole. I'd be hard pressed to say which of the three men was worse.The man who brings them down is Edward G. Robinson, the claims investigator in the insurance office where MacMurray works. Robinson is gradually putting the whole thing together and Wilder is at his best with the scenes of Robinson explaining the progress of his investigation to MacMurray with Fred trying to stay one step ahead.Robinson doesn't usually get enough praise for Double Indemnity. He's got a little man, Hercule Poirot has those little grey cells. Either way both are up to the challenge of solving what looks like a perfect crime. Lot's of Agatha Christie's Belgian sleuth in James M. Cain's Barton Keyes.Wilder for the one and only time in his career worked with another great mystery writer in Raymond Chandler on the script. It was not a pleasant experience for either. Chandler complained about the working conditions of Hollywood and Wilder complained about Chandler's dissipation. Both were probably right.Among the supporting cast look for a nice performance by Porter Hall who turns out not to be as valuable witness as Robinson originally thought. The man from Medford may not lie, but he's not above a little chiseling.Double Indemnity is one eternal classic it will be studied and dissected by film students for centuries.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great DVD Treatment of One of Billy Wilder's Greatest Films!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The super deluxe 2-disc DVD edition of the 1944 film noir classic DOUBLE INDEMNITY (DI) rocks! Director/co-screenwriter Billy Wilder's flair with suspense and black humor works so perfectly with James M. Cain's novel about adulterous lovers plotting to murder the woman's husband and scam the man's insurance company, that it even improves on the book (which I read years ago). The dark tone and scandalous subject matter freaked out Hollywood so much that it took 9 years to get DI from the printed page to the big screen. Fred MacMurray was the only leading man in Hollywood with the guts to take the role of insurance salesman-turned-murderer Walter Neff, though even MacMurray needed convincing at first. None of the other in-demand male stars of the period wanted Barbara Stanwyck's conniving, money-loving, hubby-offing temptress Phyllis Dietrichson to make a chump out of him on screen. Their loss! (I'd first seen MacMurray when I was a kid. Back then, he was best known to my generation as a Disney movie star and the lovable dad of TV's MY THREE SONS, so it was quite a revelation to me when I saw him playing underhanded types in DI, THE APARTMENT, and THE CAINE MUTINY. MacMurray had more range than he got credit for!) MacMurray and Stanwyck are dynamite in this, one of the most gleefully, unapologetically black-hearted films noir ever made. Their dialogue, especially in the first half of the movie, contains many of my fave movie lines of all time (if I start quoting them all, I'll pretty much be transcribing most of the script). The chemistry between Stanwyck and MacMurray blazes like the Chicago Fire as the wily, spellbinding Phyllis draws Walter into her web. As Richard Schickel points out in one of the DVD's 2 excellent audio commentaries, Stanwyck's Phyllis is always reacting in the moment, so you never can tell whether she means a word she says, making her all the more fascinating. What cynical Sam Spade says to the equally slippery Brigid O'Shaughnessy in THE MALTESE FALCON could also apply to the quicksilver Phyllis: she's good, awful good! Edward G. Robinson is DI's crabby yet kind-hearted Voice of Reason in his portrayal of Barton Keyes, the Pacific All-Risk Insurance Company's ace Claims Manager. As Keyes, Robinson is irresistible, with his zeal for detail, the "little man" in his gut giving him indigestion every time an insurance claim seems fishy, and his gruff affection for Walter. Heck, at times, there's more tenderness between Walter and Keyes than there is between Walter and Phyllis! :-) IMO, the biggest crime in DI was the failure to nominate either of the male leads for an Oscar, especially scene-stealing Robinson, though the Academy was smart enough not to overlook the mesmerizing Stanwyck. (For that matter, Robinson was never nominated for an Oscar for any of his superb performances. He was eventually given one of those special career Oscars, or as we like to call them, the "Yikes, He's So Old He Could Croak Any Minute and He Still Hasn't Gotten An Oscar? *D-OH!*" award. :-) DI boasts plenty of wonderful character bits, too -- really, there isn't a bum performance in the bunch! Our household's DI faves include Fortunio Bonanova as Garlopis, whose phony claim Keyes chews to bits "like a slice of rare roast beef;" and Porter Hall as Jackson from Medford, Oregon, the jovial train traveler who innocently throws a wrench into the murder plot when he turns up on the train's Observation Car while Walter pretends to be Phyllis' injured, crutch-bound hubby. (Speaking of the crutches, is the opening credit sequence with the silhouetted, fedora'd figure on crutches one of the coolest credit sequences of all time, or what?). Any fans of THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD who might be reading this shouldn't blink when Walter lets Lola (Jean Heather) into his office at one point, or you'll miss Douglas Spencer (with hair!) as Walter's associate, Lou Schwartz, coming out at the same time.If you love the movie (and why wouldn't you? :-), you'll go gaga over the nifty commentary tracks and extras. Among other things, we learn about the censorship issues in bringing Cain's juicy, lurid tales to the big screen. For example, there were several European film versions of THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE (including Luchino Visconti's OSSESSIONE, which works very well in its down-to-earth way and recently turned up on Turner Classic Movies) before Hollywood brought it to the big screen with John Garfield and Lana Turner in 1946. We're also told about how the different writing/working styles of Wilder and Raymond Chandler (who was hired to help adapt the story when Cain was under contract elsewhere and Wilder's then-collaborator Charles Brackett nixed the dark material) turned the experience into a collaboration made in hell. For the record, I wouldn't be surprised if Chandler was mostly to blame, since there are similar stories about him being just as tough to work with during Alfred Hitchcock's 1951 screen adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's STRANGERS ON A TRAIN. Hitch eventually brought in Ben Hecht's assistant Czenzi Ormonde to finish/polish the script when Chandler took a hike. Disc 2 contains the 1973 TV movie remake of DOUBLE INDEMNITY, which is worth watching if only to appreciate how much better the original is! This DVD set belongs in your collection!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's all story. There's not an ounce of superfluous material anywhere in this tightly plotted film classic about a wealthy middle-aged woman named Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) and an insurance salesman named Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray). The two of them conspire to kill Dietrichson's heavily insured husband, to cheat the insurance company out of a fortune. "Double Indemnity" is my all-time favorite noir film.The film's entertainment derives, in part, from the fact that we, as viewers, get to peek into their murderous scheme, and then watch both of them squirm, when their scheme starts to unravel. An undercurrent of paranoia permeates the plot, as the two incessantly look over their shoulders, as it were, to see if anyone has picked up on their plans or actions. And there are plenty of plot twists and turns. The dialogue is brisk, decisive, and memorable. Walter Neff gives one of my favorite lines: "How could I have known that murder could sometimes smell like honeysuckle?"The film's excellent structure is organized around Neff's confessional, spoken into a Dictaphone and directed at his insurance company boss, Barton Keyes, played by the inimitable Edward G. Robinson. Much of the story is then told in a series of flashbacks from Neff's POV, as he narrates his liaison with Dietrichson.The film's terrific B&amp;W cinematography, with its use of lighting texture and shadows, adds to the dark mood, and to an overall feeling of danger and deception. The visuals neatly correspond to the inner lives of the two main characters. The film's direction and casting are perfect. All of the acting is top notch. And the score is edgy, erotic, and at times appropriately menacing.There are a few minor plot holes. But who cares? The concept, story, characters, structure, and dialogue are so cinematically strong that they overwhelm any slight defects. And with topnotch film direction, casting, acting, cinematography, editing, and score, the result is a powerhouse film that will entertain viewers for at least the next ten thousand years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woody Allen once called "Double Indemnity" the finest American movie ever made. That may be going out on a limb a bit, but then again Allen is more than a film-maker. He is a historian, a listener, a writer and a supreme judge of movies. While I am not going to agree that this is the finest movie ever produced in the U.S., I am still going to say that this is easily one of the very best films ever conceived and executed through the history of motion pictures. An insurance man (Fred MacMurray) goes to renew an automobile policy for the ridiculously wealthy Tom Powers. Instead of finding his man though he meets Powers' super-wicked and highly sexual wife (Barbara Stanwyck, in an unforgettable Oscar-nominated part). They flirt immediately. There is something more than friendship there and a crazed affair starts. Stanwyck, a master manipulator tells sob stories to MacMurray about her abusive husband (embellishing quite a bit in the process). MacMurray, only having eyes for Stanwyck, comes up with a plan with her to have Powers killed so they can collect the insurance via the titled policy. Naturally though Stanwyck does not think near as much of the relationship as MacMurray does and the duo must constantly dodge pesky insurance investigator Edward G. Robinson (in one of his finer roles) and Stanwyck's suspicious step-daughter (Jean Heather). All told through intense flashbacks by MacMurray, "Double Indemnity" is quite possibly co-writer/director (Oscar-nominated in both categories) Billy Wilder's finest contribution to the cinema. As time passes, many film scholars confuse this as one of Alfred Hitchcock's productions. Looking back, this is a very odd movie for Wilder (considering latter triumphs with movies like "Sunset Boulevard", "Stalag 17", "Some Like It Hot" and "The Apartment"). However Wilder would continue a similar trend immediately following this in 1945 with the Best Picture Oscar-winning "The Lost Weekend", an intense character-study of one man's (Ray Milland) bout with alcoholism. "Double Indemnity" has nothing wrong with it. I cannot think of one negative throughout the film. I never found Stanwyck very attractive, but she has a way about her that makes her deceptively sexy here. MacMurray, one of those actors who never got any credit, does probably his best work ever in this one and Robinson is his usual dominant, scene-stealing self. Wickedly brilliant, fun to watch, dramatic, darkly comical, superbly written and flawlessly directed, "Double Indemnity" is one of those movies that should be embraced by all fans of the national and international cinema. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers hereinDouble Indemnity is another piece of classic film noir with all the classic elements of mystery, plotting, femme fatales and snappy dialogue. I just finished watching it and I have to say it's possibly the best I've seen.Not only is it a beautifully and craftily worked noir story but also a complex fable about greed and revenge, remorse and regret. From the moment it starts you know it's going to hit you, and it certainly does.Fred MacMurray plays insurance salesman Walter Neff, who relates the story to us by leaving a memo for his claims manager Keyes, played by Edward G Robinson. His intermittent voiceovers take the guise not only of the narrator but also of Neff's conscience as he retells the story of his involvement in the murder of his client Dietrichson after he plotted with Dietrichson's wife. They thought it would be the perfect murder, but as Keyes so rightly points out, no murder is perfect. It comes undone sooner or later, and when there's two people involved, usually sooner. Particularly in this case as Mrs Dietrichson and Neff begin to plot against each other. It becomes less about claiming the insurance money and more about which one, if either, gets away with the murder.As you can tell from my clearly blithering attempt to ruin the plot, it's a fantastic film. You come away from it and you want to ruin the ending for someone else because it's just so exciting. Billy Wilder directs with absolute precision, he blends perfectly the romance, frequent suspense, and dramatic irony dispersed throughout the film in absolute drones. The fact that Neff is present in all but one of the scenes in the film is a constant reminder of the irony of the story, the fact that he is involved on all sides and in all facets of the plot.Barbara Stanwyck also plays one of the best femme fatales I've ever seen on screen, it's not only a masterful performance but a masterful character in itself. The success of this film owes a lot to both her performance and the way the script works her in. Fred MacMurray is occasionally overly winsome at the start of the film, however, he definitely pulls his performance together at the end and it is not enough to detract entirely from the overall effect.A crafty, enjoyable and suspenseful film noir filled with anti-heroes, mystery, morals, and just good all-round entertainment. Not quite perfect but about as close as it can come. ****1/2 / *****</fullReview>

Robinson in a role that has to be seen to be believed.Robinson to me is a gangster (Little Caesar, Key Largo, Larceny, Inc), but he is apparently more than that because he was simple incredible as a claims adjuster in this film. The lines Wilder gave him were brilliant and he delivered them without flaw.McMurray was the original Absent Minded Professor and, of course, the father on My Three Sons. he plays the insurance salesman who gets over his head with Stanwyck (The Big Valley). Here she is a hot blond and McMurray falls like a rock.This is one of Wilder's best and one not to miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The long silent street of film noir, a street where it is always night, and where the songs are always sad. That street is usually a dingy urban alley or a dank sidestreet, but in Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity, it was a deceptively quiet suburban avenue. "Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself necessarily mean," wrote novelist Raymond Chandler, and as a screenwriter, he joined Wilder in sending one Walter Neff, insurance investigator, down the crookedest of these dead end lanes of the spirit.The streets of Los Angeles are busier and deadlier than they were in Chandler's heyday. Yet Chandler's disquieting, existential take on the City of Angels transcends fashions in both transportation and crime. Those mean streets remain mean, and mementos of Double Indemnity can still be seen all over the city. The Hollywood Bowl where Walter and Lola Dietrichson meet; Walter's apartment at the Château Marmont; the Glendale train station where the "perfect crime" begins... And the "death house" of Double Indemnity, where Phyllis and Walter meet, plot murder, and where their strange love finally reaches its apocalypse, still stands, secluded and quiet, high in the Hollywood Hills, at 6301 Quebec Street, in Los Angeles. Exteriors were shot there, and sets were modeled after the inside of the house. The house seems to rear up in the summer twilight, remembering the night fifty years ago when a cruel woman brought her husband out to a big LaSalle sedan idling in the garage, with a killer in the back seat. The house's silent, stuccoed cloisters look gloomily down on Quebec Street, while Walter Neff's disembodied footfalls echo off the asphalt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Film Noir Of Insurance Scam Murder With Three Stunning Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Neff is an insurance salesman who meets the sultry Phyllis Dietrichson and falls madly in love with her. Together they hatch a scheme to forge a life insurance policy on Phyllis' husband and then bump him off. The plan seems perfect, but once the deed is done Walter's nerves start to fail him and a cunning fraud investigator at his office begins to dig a little too close to the truth ...Billy Wilder's career was just a bit too acclaimed and strewn with accolades for me, but this classic adult film noir is deserving of all the praise it receives. The script, by Wilder and Raymond Chandler, is a dazzling adaptation of James M. Cain's pulp fiction classic. The murder sequence is both exhilarating in its detail and chilling in its realism - these are not gangsters or psychopaths, but ordinary people who do something monstrous borne out of lust and greed. Both MacMurray and Stanwyck (despite a silly blonde wig) give career-best performances which are charming, dazzling, amusing and chilling, all at the same time. Stanwyck is the ultimate cold-hearted femme-fatale (just pipping Lana Turner and Rita Hayworth in my opinion), and right from the moment she first appears (dressed only in a bath-towel), she eats up the screen. MacMurray is brilliant as Neff; a sap, but not a fool, who learns all too late he doesn't have what it takes to be a killer, and that women are never quite what they seem. Both are surpassed however by old pro Robinson as the wily claims investigator, who can smell a phoney setup a mile away. Robinson is amazing; a man for whom facts and statistics are never wrong and rule human nature, at least when it comes to money - a sad but profound truth. Equally good is the extremely dark photography by John Seitz (see also Sullivan's Travels, This Gun For Hire, Invaders From Mars and many others), with daring foreground shadows (Neff looking out his apartment window), stunning use of closeups (the big one of Phyllis while the dirty deed is being done) and many rule-breaking moments (when the husband is talking and signing the forms the focus should be on him, but it's on Phyllis). Best of all is Chandler's ricochet dialogue, which revs up the frisson and tumbles crookedly out of the actors. There are too many classy lines to mention, but my favourite is when Phyllis says, "I wonder if I know what you mean.", and Walter hits back with, "I wonder if you wonder.". Although movie adaptations of Dashiel Hammett's books kick-started this genre (The Thin Man, The Glass Key, The Maltese Falcon), this is the pivotal Hays-Code-ignoring lurid murder potboiler of the forties, followed by such greats as The Postman Always Rings Twice, Deadly Is The Female/Gun Crazy and D.O.A. (and later Blood Simple and Red Rock West). This is a stylish, extremely well acted movie of a great book, and a real treat for all fans of classic crime fiction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The premier "film noir" entrée, DOUBLE INDEMNITY stands as the model for the genre. Told entirely in flashback, it is the grim, yet seductive story of a life insurance agent who falls for a treacherously sultry married woman plotting to do her husband in for the payoff. DOUBLE INDEMNITY is nothing less than a requirement for anyone who asks, "What is film noir?" For all the ingredients are present: the cold-hearted criminal plot, the adulterous romance, the step-by-step implementing of the deed, the anxiety-ridden moments as a steadfast mind zeroes in on the guilty parties, and the inevitability of the final justice---all filmed in grim black and white.Did Fred MacMurray ever have a greater moment in his acting career playing Walter Neff, the Los Angeles insurance agent knocked out by a bored housewife who ropes him into her diabolical web? Did Barbara Stanwyck ever really overcome the powerful persona of Mrs. Dietrichson, the calculating murderess standing at the top of the stairs in a bath towel? And could there have been a better screen writer for DOUBLE INDEMNITY than the assiduous Raymond Chandler (THE BIG SLEEP, FAREWELL, MY LOVELY, THE LONG GOODBYE), who remains the unequaled master of the Los Angeles detective genre? Not to be outdone, Edward G. Robinson turns in a yeoman's performance as Keyes, MacMurray's boss. Keyes is a walking encyclopedia of fraudulent insurance claims and is nearly infallible in his ability to sniff out the rotten stench of not-so-accidental death. In one memorable scene, Keyes reduces his own superior to pulp as he lectures him that "no one ever committed suicide by throwing themselves off a train moving at 5 miles per hour." He cites the statistics of death by poisoning, drowning, lightning strikes, and electrocution straight off the top of his head. At what point Keyes becomes suspicious of Neff is never quite clear; but he is certainly suspicious of Stanwyck from the start--and Neff had taken Stanwyck's life insurance policy just before her husband supposedly went off the caboose.One certain proof that a detective drama is succeeding is the identification the audience has with the villains. A cold-blooded murder has been committed, yet we somehow squirm nervously for the perpetrators hoping their plot succeeds. The epitome of this identification occurs in the scene after Neff impersonates Dietrichson on the train. MacMurray races back to the car where Stanwyck awaits and the car engine stalls. He tries to turn it over again and again. We actually want the car to start! The only soft spot that exists in this sensationally crafted Ramond Chandler script is MacMurray's character transformation. He simply evolves from cavalier life insurance salesman to murderer far too soon after falling for Stanwyck. Moreover, Neff's seemingly air-tight plot to erase Dietrichson materializes a bit too quickly and precisely in his mind. What is central is that in the end it isn't Neff's boss Keyes who throws the light on the murder--it's the adulterous relationship between MacMurray and Stanwyck itself. No one other than the plotters themselves was needed to undo the evil, for the villainous collaboration contained the seeds for its own destruction. In the end, the lovers turn on one another and the twisted relationship destroys both of them. DOUBLE INDEMNITY is simply one of Hollywood's movie detective classics. And anyone who fails to include DOUBLE INDEMNITY in an all-time list of greats knows very little about films.Dennis Caracciolo</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything That Makes For A Great, Timeless Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The classic "Double Indemnity" is one of the greatest of all "film noir" movies, and it has everything you could ask for: great acting, interesting characters, an imaginative plot, and lots of tension. Put all this under the direction of the incomparable Billy Wilder, and it's one of the best films of all time.The three lead actors all give terrific performances. Fred MacMurray is at the center of everything, as an insurance salesman tempted in more than one way by an alluring customer (Barbara Stanwyck). MacMurray's character is torn between what Stanwyck offers, and his close relationship with his company's claims manager, played by Edward G. Robinson. MacMurray is excellent in portraying his struggle between his desire to grab the illicit pleasures offered by Stanwyck, and his deep admiration for Robinson as a person and as an example. Stanwyck in turn is perfect in her role as a woman who uses everything she has to get what she wants. Robinson's performance may be the best of all in bringing his character to life - a straight-arrow, perceptive and diligent worker who also comes across as a thoroughly enjoyable character.The three leads are so good that the film gets away with some occasionally dated (overly "hard-boiled") dialogue in some of the voice-overs and confrontation scenes. The actors were in such good form, though, that they were able to make any line sound pretty good.The rest of the cast all have much smaller parts, but they all fulfill their functions well, especially Porter Hall in one of his many fine character roles, and Richard Gaines, who is perfect as a clueless insurance company executive.Wilder uses his skilled touch to complete the atmosphere of intrigue and suspense. The overall result is a great film noir whose characters and tensions are as alive today as they were in the 40's. It is worth watching over and over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Noir Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Author James M. Cain virtually created a new genre with his extra-tough, sin-blackened, and sex-drenched novels--and they were so successful with the public that not even 1940s Hollywood could resist. The result was three of the most famous films of that decade: MILDRED PIERCE, THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE, and DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Although POSTMAN is probably the better film, INDEMNITY is the most famous--possibly due to the story's truly psychotic edge, which is given full life by Barbara Stanwyck in one of her most celebrated performances.Like POSTMAN, INDEMNITY offers the story of a married woman who plots with her lover to murder her husband. Given MacMurray's typically "good guy" image, I didn't expect to believe him in the role of Walter Neff in the role of skirt-hungry Walter Neff--but MacMurray's performance is exceptionally good here, and all the more effective because it so completely unexpected. But while MacMurray has most of the screen time, it is really Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson who dominate the film. Stanwyck is truly memorable here, and gives us a woman who seems at once sexed-up and completely frigid, at once completely natural and absolutely artificial. It is a remarkable and often disturbing effect. Robinson, who endured decades of type-casting, is equally good as the blustery, slightly comic, and absolutely honest insurance man whose job it is to ferret out suspicious claims; it is largely due to his performance, which gives the film a moral center, that we are able to buy into the otherwise off-beat performances that drive the action.This was one of director Billy Wilder's first major hits, and he deserves considerable credit for making the weird elements of the story work as a whole, keeping the film smartly paced, and heaping it up with atmosphere. So influential that its impact would be difficult to over-estimate, DOUBLE INDEMNITY is a touchstone for the entire film noir genre. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Noir" by Any Other Name...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film hits the screen like a well trained Olympic runner with comfortable shoes who can feel the gold around his neck before his heels are even in the blocks. It's what they call `film noir,' because from the opening frames you know that the guy doing the talking is looking at a no-win situation, that he's going to lose and lose big. Oh, sure, he knows it now; everything you're about to see has already happened, his goose has already been cooked, and now he's going to tell you about it, let you in on what went down, how it went south and why. He'll even give you the heads up on the irony of the whole thing right out of the chute, how like our Olympic runner he could feel the gold in his hand before the ink on the insurance paper was even dry-- yeah, that's right it was an insurance scam, see, and a good one too-- all the bases were covered and checked for chinks, but in the end-- and here's where the irony comes in-- in the end, he didn't get the money and he didn't even get the girl who put the whole thing in motion.`Double Indemnity,' a classic `noir' thriller in anybody's book, was directed by Billy Wilder, a guy who knows all the ins and outs, ups and downs and double shuffles of the business better than a short jockey on a tall horse. He's the `go to' guy in a game like this, because he knows all the angles, he knows the lingo and more than that, he has the insights to make it play out like it was the real deal; this guy knows what makes people tick, what motivates them and it's an ace up his sleeve that he plays like a trump card when the chips are down or even if a stack or two looks like they're about to go over. He knows the whole layout, from top to bottom and side to side because he wrote the script along with another guy you might have heard about, Raymond Chandler, another member of the club who just happens to know his way around the block and back again. This is a guy who doesn't need a road map to tell him which way to go; he's the guy who `invented' the map. And when a couple of the boys like Wilder and Chandler get together to make it up and put it down, it's as good as in the can, especially when they're getting the skinny in the first place from James M. Cain, who it just so happens wrote the novel this movie's based on. Besides which, they got the names Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck down on the dotted lines, the ones that count, the ones that say they're the ones who are the stars of the picture, see? Let's face it, that's like having Ruth, Mantle and Mays in the outfield at the same time with Sandy Koufax on the mound and Don Drysdale warming up behind him in the bull pen. The opposition might as well climb back on the bus and take the long ride on the short pier, because Wilder's team already has the big `W' next to their name in the box score.Like I said before, and I'm going to say it again because if there's one thing I've learned during my time on the planet it's that sometimes people just don't listen, or maybe there's some things they just don't want to hear. But like I was saying, this story's about an insurance scam, a dirty deal that all starts when Mr. Walter Neff (MacMurray), a salesman with a head a couple of sizes too big for his hat, makes a house call and runs into a dame, and not just any dame; her name is Phyllis Dietrichson (Stanwyck), a woman with the kind of beauty that stops traffic, turns heads and makes monkeys out of guys like Neff, guys that think they got it knocked when all the time they're standing in quicksand and don't even know it till they're in up to their ears and gasping for that last breath. But that's the name of the game; Neff isn't the first guy to find his tiller on the wrong side of the mule because of a pretty face, moist lips and the sweet smell of perfume that sells it all like the siren's song, and he won't be the last to have the deal closed by promises of something that never will be and never has been, though it's victims are heaped along the side of the carefree highway like mounds of bark dust just waiting to be spread or lost in the wind.Maybe that's not a pretty picture, but everything can't be a glossy print on Kodak paper, and you can take that to the bank because history's full of stories like this. Let's face it, Monet didn't have good eyesight, Van Gogh was down an ear and neither Mona nor her sister Lisa knew how to smile. And when a pair like Walter and Phyllis get together to cook a stew, there's always a Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) waiting in the wings for them to screw up, take a wrong step or flash a tell that attracts a guy with a nose for fraud like a metal rod drawing lightening.It takes some real `pros' to play the game at this level, and that's Wilder's team all right; but he needed some support to win this big, and he got it from the likes of Porter Hall (Mr. Jackson), Jean Heather (Lola), Tom Powers (Mr. Dietrichson) and Byron Barr (Nino). This film will give you the kind of ride a Six Flags park could only dream of, and that's what makes `Double Indemnity' one you're going to remember like a first kiss on a warm night in summer. 10/10. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1938, the experienced salesman of the Pacific All Risk Insurance Co. Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) meets the seductive wife of one of his client, Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwick), and they have an affair. Phyllis proposes to kill her husband Dietrichson (Tom Powers) to receive the prize of an accident insurance policy and Walter plots a scheme to receive twice the amount based on a double indemnity clause. When Mr. Dietrichson is found dead on the trails of a train, the police accepts the evidence of accidental death. However, the insurance analyst and Walter's best friend Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) does not buy the version and suspects that Phyllis has murdered her husband with the help of another man.In my opinion, Billy Wilder was the greatest director of Hollywood ever, directing many masterpieces including "Double Indemnity" among them. This is the second time that I see this magnificent film-noir, now on DVD recently released in Brazil (the first time was in the cable television, since this masterpiece has never been released on VHS in my country). The story and screenplay are stunning, disclosing a sordid story of lust, love, greed and betrayal. Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwick and Edward G. Robinson have magnificent performances. The cinematography is simply spectacular, with an awesome use of lights and shadows and the music score completes one of the best movies Hollywood has ever produced. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "Pacto de Sangue" ("Pact of Blood")</fullReview>

Double Indemnity is the King of all 1940's crime melodramas, told in a flashback style. A urban crime dramas in which a greedy, weak man, Fred MacMurry, is seduced and trapped by a cold, evil woman. Phyllis Dietrichson, Barbara Stanwyck, seduces the insurance agent Walter Neff Fred MacMurray into murdering her husband to collect his accident policy.

		<shortDescription>A film noir classic. Close to perfect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James M. Cain's 'Double Indemnity' is one greatest crime stories ever written. It's not even novel length, only 80 pages or so, but close to perfect. I approached the movie version with some trepidation. I was aware that it was regarded as a film noir classic, and Billy Wilder is a great director, but I was put off by the casting of Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck in the lead roles. I grew up watching endless re-runs of 'My Three Sons' on TV so MacMurray was the last person I could imagine to play tough guy insurance salesman Walter Neff, and Stanwyck is one golden age actress I've never warmed to, and I don't think she was anywhere near as seductive enough to play Phyllis. However I needn't have worried, both actors are excellent, and screen legend Edward G. Robinson steals every scene he is in. A few things were changed from Cain's original novella by Wilder and collaborator Raymond Chandler, especially the ending, which is nowhere near as dark and pessimistic as the book version, but I have no complaints, as a movie it is close to perfect. 'Double Indemnity' is without doubt one of the best crime movies I've ever seen, up there with 'Rififi', 'Out Of The Past', 'The Killing', and a handful of others. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm afraid that Double Indemnity still just doesn't grab me. Partially it's because the film simply isn't good enough to live up to its reputation, but largely because of the disastrous miscasting of Barbara Stanwyck, who simply doesn't sell as the kind of woman you'd kill for. Enter a dodgy real estate deal or run confidence tricks with, sure, but she's just not the kind of gal to make a feller's privates jump up and do tricks until he's so desperate he'll kill her husband for her, and the trashy wardrobe and wig just makes her seem even less likely. She doesn't give a bad performance, but she's the wrong actress in the wrong movie. Fred McMurray isn't a perfect fit either as the easily corrupted insurance man behind the plan, but he at least is able to twist his image enough to more or less get away with it, even if at times it does feel like you're watching the local scout master and the church organist in a production of Streetcar? Edward G. Robinson fares better in a part that relies more on fast-talking statistics than especially good dialogue (there are far fewer gems here than in probably any other Wilder film), but his character still feels more like a plot device than a person at times, only really delivering some genuine humanity in his last couple of scenes. Don't get me wrong, it's an okay film ? just not in any way an outstanding one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Possible Spoilers!* Released in 1944 - Double Indemnity's story of vicious betrayal may be somewhat flawed and inconsistent - And, its 3 principal actors may have been miscast (especially Barbara Stanwyck as the deceitfully wicked femme fatale in a really cheap-looking wig) - But, overall, it's quite easy to see why this vintage, Hollywood Crime/Drama is considered to be a true "classic" of 1940s Film Noir.Containing plenty of loaded dialog, shadowy settings and frequent flashes of well-timed tension, Double Indemnity's story of murder and deception comes together quite nicely like that of a master jigsaw puzzle where all of the scattered pieces of its plot-line eventually become one.Even though I view Double Indemnity as essentially a "Chick Flick", its story is told (chiefly in long flashbacks) by a man who was directly involved in this double-crossing crime-of-passion that went seriously haywire.Fred MacMurray plays Walter Neff, an over-confident, yet naively gullible insurance salesman, who, thinking that he's got it all figured out, gets played for an all-time sucker when the seductive, well-to-do Mrs. Dietrichson snares him into a diabolical plot to kill her husband in order to collect $100,000 through the double indemnity clause in his life insurance policy.Needless to say, once Neff gets himself completely tangled up in a web of establishing alibis (while setting the wheels of the "perfect" crime into motion), things literally begin to come apart at the seams once he inadvertently learns about the treacherous activities (both past and present) of the calculating and conniving Mrs. Dietrichson.Filmed in glossy b&amp;w, Double Indemnity's story was co-written by the famed crime-novelist, Raymond Chandler. It was directed by Billy Wilder, known for such other notable films as - Sunset Boulevard, Stalag 17, The Seven Year Itch, and Some Like It Hot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:This works so well that Kasdan copied so much of it. McMurray is out of his typical role as a jaded salesman looking to do more than sell insurance policies. The first feature that is great is that Phyllis is like an iceberg, what you see of her, just like Matty Walker in Body Heat, is very, very little. The first meeting is just two predators walking around each other sizing, no pun intended, each other up. Dressing to kill with perfume and bracelets, she is constantly looking for an existential vacuum cleaner to rid herself of an unwanted husband. What works well is we never know how much Keyes knows about what is going on. Wilder starts with Keyes tearing up a phony claimant right in front of Neff, this sets the stage for, upon first viewing, never knowing if Keyes is toying with them. The mark of a great Film Noir is inversion, like Out Of The Past. There, the woman we thought was the victim was the tarantula behind the scenes, the biggest villain of all. Here, as in Body Heat, Phyillis is the picture of the needy, helpless, unhappy woman, she plays Neff like a violin. Again, as in Body Heat, she lets him think the killing is his idea, not hers. The actual killing, while meticulously planned, had one big hole in it, a witness verifying Phyllis' husband on the back of the train before the 'accident.' This comes back to haunt both of them for they need to establish that he was there, before he, supposedly fell.This bungle is what starts Keyes on their trail; Mr. Statistics breaks out the memorized table for accidents and convinces himself of the truth. This starts the unraveling of the never quite happy couple. Neff gets spooked and starts to panic, what is creepy, when you watch this over, is that Phyllis was already planning Neff's demise during this period. Stanwyk's performance is the star of the movie; multi-layered with deceit upon deceit. Neff underestimates her, and he pays with his life for it. The most disturbing part is where the step-daughter relays how Phyllis was a nurse and how she killed her mother. Like Body Heat, the male protagonist discovers that the poor victim is actually a malevolent predator. By the end, Neff is the helpless one, I love when he walks towards her thinking that she would never shoot him, wrong. This remains the classic for its writing above all; nothing is as it appears upon the surface. Wilder toys with us, we start looking over our shoulders for Keyes, just as Neff does. Like all classic Noir, watch for the shadow filled first meeting between Neff and Phyillis, compare to the ending. Shadows in Noir are existential metaphors for Darkness inside of people. Even in the first meeting, the room is full of shadows, often behind Phyllis and on parts of her body. The husband is drawn unsympathetically to increase your surprise when you discover she has been planning this since she was a nurse who killed the first wife. This is why people compare Body Heat to this classic; the Femme Fatale is a sliver of her true self. As the male victim gets in over his head, both Kasdan and Wilder unveil the hidden monster. While I prefer Out Of The Past, for Douglas and Mitchum, this is a very close second. Don't let McMurray scare you away, Wilder has him under control here; honestly, it is not the rambling McMurray of The Caine Mutiny. Edward G. steals all of his scenes, the movie was attacked on the grounds of his role being more of a cameo than real support. Yes, he has just a few scenes, but he looms invisibly in the background worrying both Neff and the audience. The 40's movie code sanctioned infidelity quite severely, this movie is no exception. It attenuates Neff being as truly a victim as Mitchum's moral protagonist in Out Of The Past. It is simply, one of the best written, acted and directed Film Noirs. When you watch it, study how the director uses shadows in the frame; they usually fall upon the people. Excellent Classic, Wilder's Best Movie By A Mile. Q.E.D.</fullReview>

This Billy Wilder's first thriller is one of the finest Noir film ever made . A scheming wife (Barbara Stanwyck) lures an insurance salesman (Fred MacMurray , though Alan Ladd, George Raft, Brian Donlevy, James Cagney, Spencer Tracy, Gregory Peck, and Fredric March were all up for the leading role) into helping murder her husband and then declare it an accident . Both of whom concoct a twisted scheme to collect the benefits of a insurance policy . As the hubby's policy contains a clause that states that if the husband's death caused by a moving train the policy pays double face value . The investigator's boss (Edward G. Robinson) , not knowing his colleague is involved in it , suspects murder and sets out to prove it .This first-rate and entertaining American classic Noir film draws its riveting tale and power from the interaction of finely drawn roles as well as drama , emotion and moody atmosphere . This classic mystery thriller follows James M Cain's book fairly closely otherwise . Twisted film Noir about murder , troubled relationships , treason , dark secrets , including an unforgettable dialog ; being based on the James M Cain's novel , which in turn was based on the true story of Ruth Snyder, the subject of a notorious 1920s murder trial , being screen-written by the prestigious Raymond Chandler and the same Billy Wilder . However , Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler did not get along well while writing this film's script, a process that was apparently filled with arguments . As Billy Wilder didn't really get on with the famous novelist whose constant drinking irritated the director . It packs a good realization , an original script , haunting atmosphere , intriguing events ; for that reason madness and murder prevail . Fred MacMurray is superb as insurance salesman coerced into murder plot and Barbara Stanwick as predatory and alluring Femme Fatale is magnificent . Here his colleague Edward G Robinson is extraordinary and as cool as ever ; he plays as the astute and stubborn investigator , his scenes with Fred MacMurray are awesome and at their best . But Edward G. Robinson's initial reluctance to sign on largely stemmed from the fact he wasn't keen on being demoted to third lead . Good support cast formed by notorious secondaries such as Porter Hall , Tom Powers , Jean Heather , Byron Barr and Fortunio Bonanova . And Raymond Chandler's cameo , this marks the only film appearance of screenwriter and novelist Raymond Chandler .Exciting as well as complex film , possessing a mysterious and fascinating blend of gripping thriller , serenity , baroque suspense in which especially stands out the portentous performances , evocative cinematography in black and white by John F. Seitz and thrilling musical score by the classic Miklos Rozsa . The motion picture was stunningly directed by the great Billy Wilder , as the American Film Institute ranked this as the #29 Greatest Movie of All Time . The film was nominated for 7 Academy Awards but lost out on the night to Going my way (1944) by Leo McCarey. It got a deep inspiration for other films , it is particularly obvious for ¨Body heat¨ by Lawrence Kasdan with William Hurt , Kathleen Turner and Richard Crenna . Remade for TV in 1954 by Buzz Kulik with Frank Lovejoy , Ray Collins and Laraine Day , and 1973 TV remake of the 1940s classic by Jack Smight with Richard Crenna , Samantha Eggar , and Robert Webber .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliantly Written Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Double Indemnity" is a great movie with many great attributes but foremost among these must be its scintillating screenplay which combines wit, intelligence, razor sharp remarks and double entendres in such an effective way that, as well as being immensely entertaining, it also contributes strongly to driving the pace of the story. The quick fire dialogue and superb repartee are so engaging that they command the attention of the audience right from the start and also provide added impetus to all the action that follows. Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler collaborated in adapting James M Cain's story for the movie and the end result was nothing short of brilliant and was understandably nominated for the Academy Award for Best Writing, Screenplay in 1945.The characters featured in this evil tale are very memorable and in the case of the two main protagonists are also very immoral. Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is a fast talking insurance salesman who goes to visit a client and in his absence meets his wife Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). Their first encounter during which Dietrichson appears dressed only in a bath towel, leads to some flirting and their relationship develops further when Dietrichson eventually convinces Neff to take part in a scheme to sell her husband an accident policy (unknown to Mr Dietrichson) and then to murder him so that the couple can collect the insurance money and enjoy a future together.Neff advises that the policy will pay out double if the fatal accident occurs on a train and so, when Mr Dietrichson is due to go on a business trip, arrangements are made for him to travel by train. Neff carries out the murder and dressed like Mr Dietrichson (complete with crutches) takes his place on the train journey before the couple place the body on the tracks to give the impression that Mr Dietrichson died as the result of an accidental fall from the observation car of the train.After having carried out their plan successfully, the events that follow conspire to introduce a series of complications which lead to the couple losing their trust in each other and also to the movie's dramatic conclusion.Fred MacMurray is perfect in his role as the very self assured Neff who's corrupted by lust and a greed for wealth. His portrayal of someone who thinks he knows all the angles but whose confidence is gradually eroded as things start to go wrong is very convincing and Barbara Stanwyck is also excellent as the cold, manipulative seductress who is utterly ruthless and seemingly devoid of any human feelings. Edward G Robinson appears in the role of Barton Keyes, a claims investigator who works for the same firm as Neff. Barton is very experienced and incredibly good at his job and possesses a strong instinct which enables him to sense immediately if a claim is likely to be fraudulent. He and Neff enjoy a longstanding friendship which involves a good deal of warmth and mutual respect. Robinson's performance is outstanding as he delivers some super-fast speeches and conveys the nature of his character's idiosyncrasies with great panache.In typical film noir style, the story is told in flashback with Neff's narration providing a particularly matter-of-fact account of what happened. When he says "I killed him for money and for a woman. I didn't get the money and I didn't get the woman", there's an inherent poignancy in his words but the delivery is completely lacking in any sentimentality or self pity. The same can be said for his remark that "we did it so that we could be together, but it's tearing us apart"."Double Indemnity" is a dark thriller which became the prototype for many later movies which told similar stories but rarely with the same style and impact as the original. Billy Wilder's direction is superb and especially successful in contributing to the high levels of suspense that are generated at various junctures throughout the action. This is a film of rare quality and one that, because of its subject matter, will undoubtedly continue to be a source of great entertainment and fascination for movie lovers for many years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I couldn't hear my own footsteps... it was the walk of a dead man." This flick is the ultimate black comedy in my opinion. And not only in tone and story line... but it is dark night pretty much all the time and even when it isn't, there are shadows all over everything. It looks cool. It feels uneasy. Sometimes I want to laugh but I feel somehow immoral when I do. The suspense is incredible, if you can go there with it. Go there. Walter Neff narrates the tale of his own demise. What a dope, a funny, smart, and likable guy, but a dope just the same. Keys is great with all his ranting around and his little man. And Phyllis is the most conniving femme fatale I've seen. She looks and feels like sleaze. I'm afraid of her. I love to be afraid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A prime example of film noir and the rare genius of Wilder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When we think of film noir, we think of a corrupt and glamorous world of gangsters, cigarettes and femme fatals. We think of shadows of venetian blinds and wide angle close ups. Double Indemnity is one of the best and most known examples of this genre. Billy Wilder is an absolute genius, his stories always unfolding at the right pace, and his way of bringing them to the screen barely ever impeccable.This is the forties cinema. A story of love and betrayal, of manipulation and big money. The story of femme fatal Barbra Stanwick luring poor insurance salesman Walter Niff to kill her husband so they can be together. Stanwick has what it takes to make her character look sexually dangerous and desirable. Niff has the ways and traits to make his character look like a stylish fool. But as far as acting is concerned, both are surpassed by the wonderful Edward G. Robinson, who is extraordinary delivering lines faster than MacMurray can say "shut up, baby".This sort of cinema will never age. It will always find a point of relation to today's society. And when it's directed in such a beautiful way, it's little wonder that the noir is so loved and remembered. The mise sn scene is beautiful. MacMurray's and Stanwyck's character are never really portrayed close. Even when they kiss, they are always shot at an awkward angle. When they are in the same frame, Wilder always makes sure that there's something in the way, whether it's a mother and a child in a supermarket, or a fish tank in the study room of the man whose murder is being secretly plotted. This murder plot reaches its height of tension when MacMurray lures Stanwyck's husband to sign a life insurance, as he thinks he is signing an ordinary car one. He is in fact signing his life away.As in too many noirs, though, it pitfalls into the use of voice over. That is forgiven because from the start we know that he is telling Edward G. Robinson the story, speaking into the voice recorder, confessing his crime of passion. It is a film of which we know the ending already. In fact, one of the most interesting things about the film is the way we observe the main character, and the way that we back him up sometimes, only to change our minds other times. Almost every scene is necessary to make up our minds, when really the only good guy is Robinson in the whole movie.WATCH FOR THE MOMENT - When the murder plot is put in act, from the arrival to the station, to when the car won't start...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ten times twice as dangerous?Double Indemnity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What many call the ultimate film noir, the murder mystery that is spoiled at the start, setting the stage for a retelling by our protagonist of the perfect crime, is unraveled before our eyes. Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity revolves around an insurance fraud murder that appears foolproof until the seams start to tear. Walter Neff, the top salesman two months in a row, falls in love with the young wife of an oilman, a woman looking for a way to leave her troubled marriage. Who better to get away with the perfect crime then a man that sees false claims avenged everyday? Their tracks must be covered and their guilt assuaged. However, being as our first scene shows Walter confessing to everything, we know the well-laid plans were unsuccessful. The trick to the film becomes how it all went down, how the puzzle pieces fell into place, and the power of a conscience, eating away at you until you can't stand the pressure any longer.It is not giving away anything to say that the two complete the task of killing Mr. Dietrichson, a businessman with a temper. The deed is orchestrated to look like he fell off a train, a venue for accidental death that comes with a special double indemnity clause, one that pays twice the cost of his recently purchased insurance of $50,000. That money is the impetus that pushes Neff over the top to help his new mistress. Phyllis Dietrichson is the damsel in distress, the nurse of her husband's first wife that was na?ve and heartbroken for her boss after his loss. She says it compelled her to stay with him in a union that never held any love. The chance arrival of Neff not only opens her eyes to the possibility of a clean break without any strings and actually some cash to boot, but also to a man she can spend time and possibly settle down with. It is a strange coincidence that the Dietrichson's auto insurance was allowed to lapse, creating a house call, and a happy accident that the man called to visit was one as immoral as Walter. Right from the start he flirts and makes advances towards the woman he knows is married to his client. It's not until the end that you start to consider whether none of it was by chance at all, but instead carefully planned out and manipulated from the first second.Neff is played by Fred MacMurray?a perfect fit for the role of a shady salesman, unafraid to get his hands dirty. The confidence and swagger allow us to believe he can win over the girl as easily as he does. He is the kind of guy that can fool the world into thinking he is on the level, a man of intelligence and pride. His boss, Barton Keyes and he have a very close relationship, one based on mutual respect and admiration. Neff has them all fooled into believing he is a man of character, one Keyes would personally vouch for, and his initial balk at the offer to help kill Dietrichson shows that maybe he is. Maybe there is some semblance of humanity behind the quick-witted banter and devious smile, a moral compass that won't allow him to cross the line. But greed and lust can tempt even a saint, let alone a guy like Neff, and it doesn't take long for him to begin the blueprints for what will be the perfect crime; one that not even Keyes and his keen lie detector can spot. It is that question of virtue that will ultimately undo him, though, as the strong stomach he thought he had might not be indestructible.The story revolves around MacMurray and as a result he is on screen almost the entire time. He is our narrator and our entrance point into the proceedings. However, it is not a role that we necessarily relate to, nor even begin to feel sorry for to hope he gets away with the crime. Instead, knowing about his confession from the beginning, we sit down to watch his hubris shred his world to pieces. Each person is a cog to the tale at hand; it is the plotting of the film that takes center stage and top billing. The pieces are moved and we follow them through the twists and turns and revelations that change our preconceptions of each. No one is truly as they seem and they all have an ulterior motive just below the surface, propelling their actions and attempts for survival whether the other does or not. Our two criminals are selfish at heart, but until you watch the entire journey, you won't know just how much.While the acting is definitely dated and a product of its time, it doesn't mean that it's not good. Barbara Stanwyck plays MacMurray's partner-in-crime Phyllis with equal panache. She holds her own in every situation, whether with her sharp tongue in some very funny back and forths or in her steely disposition when things get rough, it's a part that needs to be strong and is. Barton Keyes is the role that sticks with you, though. Edward G. Robinson is fantastic as the cocky claims agent, self-proclaimed as never being wrong when his gut says something isn't right. He delivers some of the best lines with such deadpan seriousness that you laugh even harder. The ego, cynicism, and attitude all add up to a man you have to respect, because under the tough exterior lies a man with heart. His dynamic with MacMurray is an interesting one, especially when seen through to the end. While they aren't completely fleshed out, each character is a detailed piece to the intricate web of deceit on display. Surrogates for the story to be shown to the audience, we watch them not for who they are, but for what they will do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Great Billy Wilder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't think of a director that got so many great movies in the different genres as Billy Wilder. In comedy he made the excellent "Some Like It Hot" and "Irma la Douce"; he also made the romantic "Sabrina"; "Sunset Boulevard", "The Apartment" and "The Lost Week-End" were his contributions to drama; "Stalag 17" is a war film; "Witness for the Prosecution" is a great mystery thriller; all memorable products in the history of Hollywood.With "Double Indemnity" he obtained what is probably the ultimate Film Noir. There's not much to add about this extraordinary movie to what I¨ve red here in other comments. Just that I never was a fan of Fred MacMurray and yet I have to admit he does a very good job in this one (perhaps his best ever along with his treacherous and false navy officer in "The Caine Mutiny").Billy Wilder was indeed a very talented man as a movie maker and also had an undeniable skill for recognizing a good story when it came his way. One of the great directors ever, no doubt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"How could I have known that murder could sometimes smell like honeysuckle?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some cinematic matches seem made in heaven, no matter how discordant they may prove on Earth. Such was unquestionably the case with legendary writer/director Billy Wilder and author Raymond Chandler, when paired up to craft a film adaptation of a dark, seedy novel by James M. Caine, dealing with such rich cinematic potential as deception, double-crossing and murder. While the feuding between Wilder and Chandler was legendary, each despising each other's methods and taking any possible opportunity to ridicule each other, their cinematic concoction, Double Indemnity, was even more legendary. One of the most pitch perfect noir thrillers of all time, each component of the film fits together seamlessly to create a flawless slice of dark movie magic which has lost none of its atmospheric punch and poignancy when viewed in a contemporary setting, over sixty years later. Double Indemnity proves unlike any other films of its time, as the film's tension is extracted not from the question of whether or not the lurid scheme of the central characters will succeed, but instead through the sickly knowledge that they are fated not to, inviting the viewer to watch the whole sordid affair unfold, to see each piece fit disastrously into place. From the opening titles, the film positively drips with fatalism between MacMurray's grim voice-over to the sublime noir lighting, all creating a pitch perfect mood of unease and despair. The masterful technical work is matched by the perfectly honed screenplay by Wilder and Chandler, delivering an engrossing treatise on greed, lust and their abilities to ensnare and corrupt while cleverly mixing cynical introspection with snappy banter and the kind of exquisitely stylized lines filmmakers simply could not pull off now (see the dynamic, thinly veiled "speeding ticket" sexual innuendo exchange between Stanwyck and MacMurray). The idea of walking an audience through the planning and execution of a murder was a virtually unprecedented one, but the ingenious daring of Wilder and Chandler does not stop there. Not only does the film empathize with the murderers, Dietrichson for personal gain and Neff as much to shake up the prescribed order of things as his sordid infatuation with her, but also demonstrates how exhilarating and, crucially, entertaining the act of killing could be. Bathing the viewer in a seedy world of secret encounters, lurid sexual acts and casual violence played up as darkly fascinating as opposed to downright immoral, Wilder and Chandler choose to side with characters who ordinarily would have filled the roles of cinematic villains, with the lawful figure Keyes instead played almost as grotesque antagonist, blithely subscribing to a system revolving around asphyxiating order fated to collapse. Though evil is eventually punished, not only is it seemingly predisposed to overcome good, the film seems to silently state, but it is more interesting anyway - a pitch black, endlessly captivating moral stance which has lost not a shred of potency. The casting of lead character Walter Neff carries a similar parallel story of infamy to the film itself; a series of successful stars passing on the role, concerned about the implications of humanising an unrepentant killer. The final casting choice, perennial nice guy Fred MacMurray playing decidedly against type proved simply brilliant, as MacMurray inhabits the role like a cool leather glove, his fast talking salesman veneer carefully concealing a deadness in his eyes, a forever looming darkness barely veiled. MacMurray accomplishes the truly laudable feat of taking a downright unsavoury character yet still retaining the audiences' sympathies despite each unethical act, perfectly essaying the moral crux of the film. Of course, the simply stunning performance by Barbara Stanwyck as one of the most memorable femme fatale figures of the era proves a lurid highlight, as Stanwyck arguably steals the show with her searing, sultry yet devious intensity, far too charismatic and cunning to ever be reduced to a simple object of desire. The two powerhouse leads are well supported by character actor Edward G. Robinson giving a deliciously repellent performance as an order obsessive insurance agent increasingly suspicious of the insurance scam presented to him.Despite the hefty competition, there can be little doubt that Double Indemnity marks its place as one of the most emotionally gruelling and captivating film noirs of its time, and arguably in the history of the industry. Each flawless element of the film melds together to create a truly mesmerizing work just as grimly entertaining as it is technically laudable. For any in search of a taut, hard hitting piece of staunch film-making, few films would prove more fitting than Double Indemnity. -10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind of a crazy story with a crazy twist to it. One you didn't quite figure out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a new favorite movie. If it's not Double Indemnity then at least it's the whole film noir genre. Double Indemnity was THE greatest story I have ever have had the pleasure of seeing. It had it all. It was black and white, it had a great theme song and it had such deep characters. Characters you really feel with. This was my first REAL film noir. I had seen Chinatown before this one but that is classified as neo noir because it's in color.Did I mention that the acting in this movie is the best acting I have ever seen in a movie? And I mean real acting. Not like real acting like you'll find in Mockumentaries where the acting is so natural only because it's improvised. No, the acting in this movie is in the scale of stage actors. The best there is. The lines are all delivered in such a natural way because they are natural. Meaning that there isn't a single line in this movie that I would even think about changing.The directing and cinematography were the best I have ever seen. The opening credits feature a man in crutches walking towards the screen in Silhouette while dramatic music plays over the soundtrack and credits appearing and disappearing on the screen. From there on the movie had me. How could I stop watching after a credit sequence like that? As the movie plays out we keep hearing the same theme. And I wouldn't have it any other way.This movie is recommended. Recommended to everyone by me. If you like any sort of cinema. And if you don't laugh at Adam Sandlers jokes then go and get this movie. Get it and never sell it. Because it is the greatest piece of cinema I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Truly Great Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Maltese Falcon" is generally considered to be the very first film noir, but Billy Wilder's "Double Indemnity" is the first GREAT noir. With actors that perfectly understood Wilder's penchant for black as tar humour, this film is as seedy, dark and many times funny as they come. Barbara Stanwyck is a knockout as the classic femme fatale, complete with cheap blonde wig and ankle bracelets. Fred MacMurray makes a terrific dope, his silly machimso preventing him from realizing that Stanwyck is one step ahead of him through the entire film. And Edward G. Robinson shines as usual in a small but important role.For me, this film breaks new ground in the hard-boiled/detective/murder mystery genre. I believe it was a bit of a flop when it came out, but that's easy to understand. Films that in retrospect prove themselves to be cutting edge are frequently dismissed at the time of their release. "Double Indemnity" doesn't have the look of other studio films of its period, not even other gritty detective films of its period. The lighting is stark and grimy; you can almost see every speck of dust in the shafts of light slanting in through the windows. Wilder gets the feel of a corrupt L.A. just right. But even more than its look, the film is years ahead of its time in its moral tone. Not only do the characters in this film not find redemption, they appear to be unredeemable. Each shows him/herself to be colder and more cynical than the other, and there's a "Bonnie and Clyde"-like inevitability to their eventual fates.Simply sensational. And watch for the list of "supposin'"s MacMurray and Stanwyck throw back and forth at each other in one scene. It's hilarious and perfect, and those who've seen the film will know exactly what I'm talking about.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The finest of a fine genre...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A regular reviewer would get into the heavy details of the plot of Billy Wilder's `Double Indemnity', but I wont, because I feel that a film like this should be viewed by someone who knows practically nothing of the plot, so every scene can be a surprise. What I will say about the plot, just so you have an idea if you don't already know, is that insurance salesman Neff (Fred MacMurray) and his client Phyllis (Barbara Stanwyck) have a criminal plot to carry out, and claims man Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) is onto them.The movie is a Film-Noir, a terrific B&amp;W genre that died out, I guess, in the early sixties. Sure, Noirs are still being made today, but those ones are more of a homage to the classic Film-Noirs of the thirties, forties and fifties. `Double Indemnity' was released in 1944, when Film-Noir was at its prime, with releases like `The Maltese Falcon' right behind it and `The Third Man' just ahead. To me, `Double Indemnity' is the greatest.It's hard to differentiate Noirs from the regular crime or mystery movies of the past, but I think Roger Ebert said it best in his review for `Out of the Past': `The noir hero is doomed before the story begins -- by fate, rotten luck, or his own flawed character. Crime movies sometimes show good men who go bad. The noir hero is never good, just kidding himself, living in ignorance of his dark side until events demonstrate it to him.' That character in `Double Indemnity' is Neff, a man who thinks he's carrying out Phyllis' plan because of his love for the woman, but indeed is not. He likes the plan, he likes doing it, just for the sake of carrying out the evil deed.Phyllis shares his love for the dark, and the evil scheme is the basis of their relationship. They are never seen talking about anything but the plan, they don't want to, instead of being in love with each other they're in evil with each other.And then there's Keyes, a man who's life has been consumed by his profession so much so that he once dumped his fiancée because he found out about some sketchy business from her past, he says. But he is a great man, strong willed and smarter than any other man working at his firm, including his boss. When his boss asks the wrong question he flares into a huge speech about why the question is ludicrous, and why the boss is unfit for his profession. Sure, he's rambling, but he has the right to, he's the cleverest claims man you'll ever find.So the better part of the movie is about Neff avoiding and out-maneuvering Keyes, a situation which generates such heated suspense, on account of both the actors and Billy Wilder's expert direction and script (co-written by Raymond Chandler). MacMurray is perfect as the everyman with a dark side, using his pan expression and voice as an advantage. Some say Bogart would've been more suited with the role, but Neff is the kind of character that would look and sound tired all the time, just like MacMurray. Stanwyck shows delicious darkness in an Oscar-nominated role, there's a scene where her face gradually turns from tearful regret to y evil that sent chills down my spine.And, of course, there is Edward G. Robinson, in a stellar performance, stealing every scene he is in from under Mac Murray (or whomever's) feet. The role is played with such skill and focus that personally I think it's a travesty he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for it.`Double Indemnity' is the best Film-Noir, a template for perfection, 9/10.</fullReview>

The film on a whole reminds me of The Godfather or an old classic murder drama, the dark rooms the fast New York accent talk and the fascinating dress sense (not to mention the way Neff can light a match like that so slick)!!

		<fullReview>Double Indemnity is a movie that is like the periodic table to science. This movie is absolutely essential to the medium of film. It is one of those flicks that will always stand the test of time. It's a film to study as well as one to love and enjoy. It is a muse for a lot of films that have been made since this 1944 masterpiece.The story is about an insurance representative, Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), who falls in love with a woman, Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). She wants him to help her murder her husband and the bonus behind this plan is that the death of Mr. Dietrichson will trigger a heavy life insurance payout. The crime is carefully inspected by Neff's boss, insurance investigator, Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson).This film was nominated for seven Oscars for a reason. The acting is superb and is to a standard that modern audiences will appreciate. The directing of Billy Wilder (Some Like It Hot, Sunset Blvd.) makes it film noir classic. And the screenplay is one of the best that Hollywood has produced.Double Indemnity is a film that everyone should watch. It should be something that should be passed down from generation to generation. It is a perfect film in so many ways and one that should be held in the highest regard by all who watch it. This film defines 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Odd Triangle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No need to recap the plot or echo consensus points.From the minute he sees her slinking down the stairs in that spangled ankle bracelet, he's hooked. Walter Neff's already boarded that long, lonely trolley down the one-way track. Yes indeed, sultry Phyllis appears to be just the ticket he's been looking for. Great noir classic. All in all, Neff should have paid attention to that other member of the oddball triangle. Old man Keyes may be a born cynic, but despite himself, he's a father figure looking for a son to take his place, and warning Neff about the "Margie's" of the world. What he doesn't know is that this "Margie" definitely doesn't drink out of a bottle. What's more, Neff's already chosen to ride with the flashy crowd, get out of that dumpy apartment, and get into Phyllis's vicious little insurance swindle. As Keyes tellingly remarks, "You're not smarter than the rest, Walter, just a little taller. I like to think that Walter finally realizes his folly in that brilliant final scene, even if it is too late. Still, the film's cynical veneer is misleading. Because beneath all the deceits, betrayals, and ironies, lies a lighted match and one of the odder father-son relationships in Hollywood annals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do you drive a new Cadillac to appear inconspicuous at crime scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone knows this film and everyone loves it.I tried to observe some flaws if there are any in it. The actress playing the daughter looked too old for the role. Stanwyck was 37 when this was made and Mc Murray was 36.I agree with the reviewer who stated Mc Murray's later roles in TV sit coms and so forth tainted his image. It's true it was hard to take him seriously.A new Cadillac driving around the rail road tracks might attract some notice especially in 1939 (the year this is supposed to take place).Also you have to suspend disbelief that Mc Murray would be so smitten by Stanwyck he would attempt anything like this. She is not especially at 37 (or any age!) the most attractive woman in the world. The blond wig? I guess was supposed to make her look ?? maybe cheap or tainted. She can carry any role though plouging through it like a bulldozer.But these are so minor. I loved the movie watch it and read the other reviews.RECOMMEND HIGHLY</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Double Indemnity" has all the makings of a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many ideas out there on what constitutes a great film. Many would say a great film?in other words, art?is not necessarily an entertainment piece, but a movie which makes comments about life and pushes the audience to do some thinking even when the screening has ended. Personally, I've never stood with the idea that all great films are merely absorbing and never entertaining. That silly idea that films are intellectual stimulants and movies are just trash pumped up in a way that comes across as giddy. Although I do agree that many great films probe the audience to think, one of my solutions is this: when I finish the screening, I sit there afterward and tell myself that there was nothing else I would have rather done in those two hours. That sensation swelled me when I finished watching "Double Indemnity" for the first time about a year ago, and it has returned with me every time I have seen it since.This marvelous film-noir, directed by Billy Wilder, shoves a dagger into the idea that art cannot be entertaining, only observable. Now "Double Indemnity" does not make its central plot?a salesman co-opting with an unhappy housewife to murder her husband for a $100,000 insurance clause?into something exciting?something people might want to try out at home. In fact, as the movie progresses toward its third act and the two murderers start to lose their grip on what's happening, it poignantly resolves the seemingly tired idea that crime doesn't pay. But there is a certain level of joy to be had from this film. Most of it comes from the brilliant performance of Edward G. Robinson as a comically brilliant claims manager on to the big scheme, and the rest of it comes from the way director Billy Wilder brings tremendous energy out of a leisurely paced story.As much as I've enjoyed his lighthearted performances, I had always felt that Fred MacMurray was capable of putting darker edges on himself. "Double Indemnity" does not give him the coldblooded meanness I always felt he could play effectively, but it brings him somewhat close to that level. A man who is more clever and intelligent than he appears (not just a dumb salesman, although he does allow femme fatale Barbara Stanwyck to manipulate him), not afraid to undergo any task he puts before himself. But what is also brilliant about MacMurray's performance is the way he gets us the care. That is tricky. The character is a murderer; he planned it out; he arranged it. The movie does not condone his crime, even though his victim is hardly the world's nicest guy. And yet the audience follows MacMurray's story with a certain affection for him, and by the end, much to our shock, we actually sort of wish that he might be allowed to dodge the authorities. Or at least escape the gas chamber. The screenplay by Billy Wilder and novelist Raymond Chandler provides the motivation, the dialogue, and the drama, but MacMurray rounds it off with an easygoing, effortless shine of a performance. I do not know of Fred MacMurray was the sort of actor who took methods and concentration to a deep level, but he was one of those talents who made good acting look easy.I give MacMurray special attention, for I feel even the film's greatest admirers have more or less taken his work for granted. I do not by any mean wish to demean Barbara Stanywck's performance. She, too, is excellent. I'll go even further and say this is one of the best villains ever put on-screen. At one point, she looks up at MacMurray, we see the white in her eyes as she smiles, and shivers always run down my spine. I do not begrudge her, it is just that everybody mentions her character first of all when discussing the acting of "Double Indemnity." The movie's got three great performances, and the third goes to Edward G. Robinson, once again, as that eccentric claims manager. Robinson provides most of the movie's bits of comic relief, such as when he stands up to his own boss during a claims dispute, sides with the victim, and goes on a rant about "six volumes of suicide" and "suicide by poisons, subdivided by types of poison" and so forth. Robinson is the straight-shooter of the story, and his dynamic with the MacMurray character is a very fascinating sort of friendship. MacMurray even says "I love you, too." Today, we might take that as some sort of homoerotic subtext. Ignoring the fact that that was utterly forbidden in 1944 films, "Double Indemnity" plays it as a strong friendship. So as the movie progresses, the audience again starts to feel empathy, this time for how Robinson might react when he finds out his best salesman is a murderer."Double Indemnity" has all the makings of a great film. The photography is rich and wonderful (the Venetian blinds are used at their ultimate here), and Miklos Rozsa's string-dominate music score is more than something that just plays in the background like an out-of-tune jukebox. The film has a snappy motif theme that repeats at just the right moments and never wears out its welcome. And Billy Wilder, the director, always finds the right decisions on how to shoot a scene and when. When to keep his camera locked for a long stretch of time and when to cut away. The screenplay sure paces itself well, but Wilder was the one who had to figure out how to keep things interesting. And he did with flying colors.Here is another test for a great film. Watching a movie that you know is great with friends or relatives, and not only relishing in the fact that you love the movie, but when you can tell your associates are loving it too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant is a small word.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Words will not define the things that I achieved by viewing this film. The fascinating part that comes into my mind before going further is the extraordinary narrative that binds you physically as well as mentally. The film follows the journey of a sales person of an insurance company who gets into a number of events which made the whole film. It is a mix of attraction, cheating and surprises.PROS:Without a fascinating story, the film would not have been this better, so most of the credit I would give to it. Then I liked the narration which was because of the actor's firm voice. The acting is superb by all the actors. The story starts with a very fast pace from the starting itself and maintained this till the end which was beautiful. The different instances in the film are shown so properly that you would not feel that it is from the forties.CONS:Found the film absolutely perfect.MESSAGE: "You can't escape longer."VERDICT: "A must watch for anyone."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of pure reverse existentialism ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Billy Wilder in 1944, "Double Indemnity" set the standards of film-noir, inaugurated by Huston's "Maltese Falcon", a genre that captures the pessimism of post-war America and within which "Double Indemnity" is not only a masterpiece but also a reference, always imitated, but never equaled. "Double Indemnity" is a tale of greed and lust, incarnated by one of the most controversial movie couples: the insurance salesman Walter Neff (with two 'F' like in Philadelphia) played by the handsome and everyday looking Fred McMurray, and the flirtatious housewife Phyllis Dietrichson, Barbara Stanwyck, both sensually dangerous and dangerously sensual. Together, they mastermind the perfect crime: killing Mr. Dietrichson and disguising it as an accidental jump from a train, to guarantee the 'double indemnity' in the life insurance, the clause that doubles the payoff for an unusual accident. Based on a 1935 novel from James M. Cain, the story was inspired by the case of Ruth Snyder, the woman executed in Sing Sing prison in 1928 for a similar crime. But it couldn't make its way to Hollywood, the Hayes Code Cerberus judged the material too sordid as the way it glamorized crime would negatively influence younger viewers. But one decade later, Billy Wilder bought the rights granted his film would never convey the idea that crime pays. And to a certain extent, the Hays Code restrictions elevated the film by privileging the atmosphere, the relationships and the tension, instead of action, the subtlety of sexual innuendo and double entendre instead of explicit dialogs. The brilliant 'speed limit' exchange is one of its greatest illustrations.Indeed, the film was voted #38 in AFI's Top 100 Thrillers, yet it opens with a wounded Neff coming to his workplace by night and talking to a Dictaphone. Neff addresses a confession to his colleague and friend Keyes (Edward G. Robinson): "I killed him ? for money and for a woman", he adds: "I didn't get the money. And I didn't get the woman". We know who committed the murder and we know the plan failed. What's left for the suspense? Well, the point is that the story contemplates the motives of the characters, the feelings lying beneath their actions. Why a man like Neff would associate with a woman like Phyllis? This question is crucial because it sets the most important characteristics of the 'femme fatale' figure.And Phyllis Dietrichson, #8 villain of AFI's Top 50, is the quintessential femme fatale: a cheap broad using her luscious charms to lure a man into deadly actions. Neff comes to her house, expecting her husband for a car insurance renewal. She appears at the top of the stairs holding a bath-towel around her torso, throwing lust and temptation at Neff's face. It's one of the most legendary screen character's entrances because it establishes the character's personality in one iconic shot. At the second meeting, she climbs down the stairs with an ankle-bracelet, high-heeled shoes, like a viper determined to attract Neff to her nest. Neff understands what she's into when she asks if he can buy a life insurance without telling her husband. He leaves the house, but it's too late, he's already obsessed."Double Indemnity" centers on Neff's tragic choices. Wilder makes it clear that the passion was consummated. But it's not love, not yet anyway: Phyllis hates her husband more than she loves Neff. Their passion rises below society's morality, and both despise its mediocrity. The Dietrichson's house is vast and luxurious, but the cinematographer used aluminum dust to create an impression of total carelessness. Phyliss is tired of her monotonous life, and Neff would probably love to break his routine. Why do they commit a crime together? In fact, it's because they found themselves together that they could do it. Phyliis catalyzed Neff's lowest instincts. She's indeed a great 'femme fatale' (also with two 'F') "Double Indemnity" is not about a crime, but human motives, not quite money, not quite lust but pure reverse existentialism. And Robinson admirably carries the psychological aspect of the film as Barton Keyes, the claims adjuster capable of detecting the phony claims. He's a living encyclopedia when it comes to statistics and his 'little man' never failed him. Only a man like him could have tried to figure the motives with this scientific accuracy, not an average detective. Keyes has a fondness on Neff, and it's reciprocal, their exchanges are punctuated with the film's only running gag: Neff giving Keyes a providential match to light his cigar, he eventually retorts to an insult by a tender "Yeah, I love you, too". Yet, Neff fears that his demise might come from his friend, the iconic venetian blinds' shadow on Neff's face almost feel like prison bars. How Robinson and McMurray didn't get nominated is beyond me. The film lost all its Oscar nominations for "Going my Way", more feel-good and less cynical I guess.But it's not a cynical film, it's about people tired of their own society's standards: marriage, fidelity, honesty, all hypocritical: Mr. Dietrichson hates his wife, his daughter Lola lies to him and people are just the lousy bunch of consumers. It's significant that Phyliss and Neff regularly meet in a supermarket, an 'un-film-noir' place illustrating the world they try to escape from, but can't because they're trapped and Neff knows it. And as Keyes predicts, it ends up in an exchange of bullets. Phyllis dies, and Neff, wounded, confesses. He couldn't escape his condition, he couldn't even escape from his office and reach the elevator, he collapses, agonizing in front of Keyes.Keyes lights his last cigarette, the last as a free man, a deserved one. because if him and Phyllis were both villains, within his own confession, Neff found a bit of redemption.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic touchstone of film noir experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In order to begin a story with the ending and still maintain suspense throughout the movie a film-maker needs to be quite sure of his skills to capture the attention of his audience. Director/writer Billy Wilder, assisted by established novelist Raymond Chandler with the screenplay, knows how to do it. He presents his film noir entirely in flashbacks, narrated in atmospheric voice-overs leading eventually to what we've already seen in the introduction. And despite the fact that we know where it's all heading we're still glued to our seats. New at the time and often copied ever since, but rarely done that well.Central point is the mutual plan of an insurance rep and the wife of a rich husband to commit the perfect crime and literally get away with murder. Said salesman Walter Neff (Fred McMurray) not only commits the crime, but is also supposed to investigate it along with insurance inspector and friend Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson). Reluctantly but inevitably he stumbles into his own demise, which he is unfortunate to experience from either side of the law. What makes this dark existential dilemma so exciting is not so much what happens but how it is presented to the viewer and how the components fit together to form a supreme whole. Thanks primarily to an amazing script and aided by Wilder's flawless direction that leaves nothing to desire for a film noir devotee the film indeed lives up to the expectations of its promise and has since become an invaluable reference. Aside from McMurray and the terrific Robinson there's also Barbara Stanwyck playing the ensnaring femme fatale, and all of them deliver sharp dialog. Add to that high-contrast black and white cinematography, effective lighting, multiple Oscars winner Miklós Rózsa's score - all the best ingredients for a touchstone of film noir experience, complete with fatality drive. Classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doubly Satisfying .......This Wilder Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1944 film noir directed by Billy Wilder is fantastic. Written by Wilder and Raymond Chandler, the words sizzle as the 3 principle actors fire out lines that are white hot. Walter Neff played by Fred MacMurray, Phillis Dietrichson ,(Barbara Stanwyick), and Barton Keyes, (Edward G. Robinson) are all sensational in a movie that ticks every box. Insurance Agent (Neff) makes an unlikely pact with Mrs. Dietrichson after he becomes infatuated by her. Neff doesn't know it, but he has made an alliance with the original femme fatal. After they get rid of Mr. Dietrichson (for financial reasons) there relationship begins to unravel. Neff gradually begins to realize he has a dangerous and cunning "partner in crime". Edward G. Robinson as claims Manager Barton Keyes is very good at his job,and has deep instincts. His "little man" knows all ...and soon he smells a rat. Could Neff...his co-worker and friend...do the unthinkable? This fabulous movie was the great Billy Wilders third attempt at directing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Wonder if you Wonder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. "I wonder if you wonder." Every time I hear Walter Neff say those words to Phyllis Dietrichson as their initial encounter concludes, I smile and settle in for another round of Double Indemnity (1944) ... one of my all-time favorites. Though I have seen it many times over the years, I recently saw it for the first time on the big screen ... and from a 35mm print! So much of the subtle filmmaking becomes apparent - the variance of lighting, the intensity of shadows, and the vividness of close-ups. This reinforces my belief that we should never miss an opportunity to view good films in a theatre setting ... just as the director intended.Since this film was released 67 years ago, it's difficult to discuss without noting a key plot point or character reaction. If you haven't seen it and plan to, you might stop reading here. If you would like a little insight, then let's keep going. Billy Wilder (left) directed the film and his place as a Hollywood legend is quite secure. He was nominated for 21 Oscars (Director, Writer, Producer) and had 3 wins. Some of his classics are: The Lost Weekend, Sunset Blvd, Witness for the Prosecution, Some Like it Hot, The Apartment, The Front Page. Many think of Wilder as a comedic filmmaker and he certainly had success in that genre, but if you watch closely, even his comedies have a dark element to them.Double Indemnity is based on the novella by James M Cain, who also wrote Mildred Pierce and The Postman Always Rings Twice. Wilder was a fan of Cain's book, but knew the dialogue wouldn't work well on screen. So together with Raymond Chandler they wrote a screenplay filled with crackling lines and a constant feeling of dread and pending doom. As great as the script is, it is heightened by a wonderful cast that includes Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G Robinson, Porter Hall, Jean Heather, Tom Powers, Richard Gaines and Byron Barr.For me, MacMurray's performance is what brings the words to life and jumps the film to the "must see" category. He is playing against two Hollywood heavyweights in Stanwyck and Robinson, but we are somehow sympathetic to this not-so-bright guy who gets played like a fiddle by the villainous, wily woman he lusts after. Even as he is recording his confession, a part of us understands how he got drawn into MURDER! Not just any murder, but one for money and love ... only there is no money, and there is no love.Ms. Stanwyck is perfectly cast as the femme fatale who weaves her web of deceit and destruction. She quickly spots the vulnerability of MacMurray's character and uses her assets just enough to hold the leash tight. It is a testament to her screen presence that she can pull off the sultry siren while sporting a less-than-desirable blonde wig. At the time, the wig was so controversial that the producers compared it to George Washington and wanted it trashed. However, filming was too far along and now it's impossible to imagine her looking any other way. Besides, MacMurray only seems to notice her anklet!Edward G Robinson made a name for himself as a tough-guy actor ... cop and mobster all rolled into one. Here he plays the insurance investigator with a sixth-sense for fraudulent claims. He is a hard-nosed, dedicated employee who takes his responsibility very seriously and has no sympathy for those who cheat his cherished system. He has a soft spot for co-worker MacMurray, even though he is one of the back-slapping salesmen he so loathes. Their relationship in the film is one of respect and about as close as two professional men could be, given the era. When Robinson goes off on his rant about suicide research, he is a joy to behold. This guy could flat chew scenery.In addition to the infamous wig, you might also notice that MacMurray is wearing a wedding band throughout the film, even though his character is clearly a single man. Wilder and MacMurray stated many times over the years that was simply a mistake and not "caught" until post-production. Expect a chuckle when MacMurray, as the narrator, enviously describes a Spanish style Los Angeles home as costing $30,000 ... probably less than the property taxes would be on that house today. The film originally was to end with MacMurray in the Gas Chamber and Robinson looking on (inset), but this was deemed inappropriate. One last little nugget: early in the film, MacMurray walks out of Robinson's office and past a man sitting on a hallway chair reading a paperback book. That man? Raymond Chandler, in his only on screen appearance.The film is often described as quintessential Film Noir. Another prime example of Film Noir would be The Big Sleep (1946), based on a Raymond Chandler novel, directed by Howard Hawks, and starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. While Film Noir might not be an easily definable term, there are certain elements that must be present. Lighting is key. Shadows must be prevalent. Some type of detective story is usually at the center, and we typically get some poor schlub of a guy being yanked around by the femme fatale. The right "mood" is essential ... as a viewer we know things are headed down the wrong path, but we just can't save the characters from their own poor choices. But neither can we look away. That helpless feeling is a strong indicator that you just watched a terrific Film Noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not read the book or anything concerning the original case, and this is the only version that I've watched. If the novel is this spellbinding, I may have to get a copy. I suppose I should address something before I get into the review itself; yes, the story is quite similar to The Postman Always Rings Twice(and while this is superior, I would definitely suggest giving that one a whirl, too... the original, that is). It's the same author, and they aren't identical. They are also both somewhat reminiscent of Macbeth. Other than that I did not find myself falling in love with these leads(as I did in the Garfield/Turner one), I really cannot complain about this film(and I won't even attempt to argue against the immense chemistry that this duo has; they light the screen on fire). I have not seen a lot of Wilder's work, but I thoroughly enjoyed Some Like It Hot, as well. This is a classic piece of noir, and ought to get a viewing by every fan of such. The brilliant dialog and narration is full of metaphors, plays on words(and the like) and every line is carefully phrased, with several utterly unforgettable exchanges. Editing and cinematography are excellent. The lighting and use of shadows... incredible. This does an amazing job of building suspense and tension. The plot is well-written, and the twists are impeccable. Every acting performance is spot-on. The characters are credible and well-developed, and the women are allowed strong-willed moments. MacMurray is rather cool. There is a little racism and sexism(on account of when it was made), some innuendo and brief mild and not graphic violence in this. I recommend this to everyone into these movies. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Double Crossing True Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Double Indemnity (1944)Double Crossing True LoveThe are a million reasons to love this movie and a million people who have already said what they are: tight filming, great plot, fabulous acting, and the beginning of a new, truly American genre of movies: the film noir.This isn't the first crime film with noir qualities, but it has two key ingredients: a man with a morally sound core led astray, and a woman (the femme-fatale) leading him astray. I suppose you could interpret this in sexist ways, or as an extension of Adam and Eve dynamics into our century. Not that Adam killed Eve in the end, as far as we know.As an example of classic, early noir this is notable for coming before the war had ended, and it lacks the most common thread of the man coming from some unknown past (life as a G.I. or just life somewhere unspecified), but in a way Fred MacMurray's main character, who leads the whole film, is comparably adrift. Maybe he represents that man left home during wartime, feeling out of place for the simple reason of not being over there, somewhere. And maybe living in a separate morality.MacMurray is cast perfectly, even if he was a second choice by director Billy Wilder. His bumbling intelligence, his compromised morality, his giving in so easily (if easily is the word after the murder) all make sense, and they might not with a Mitchum type of stronger character. Even his inner morality, and his ability to say "I love you" at the end, to the character who he clear does love, are convincing. And a movie with this many fast twists has to be convincing as much as it is dramatic. Barbara Stanwyck? Cold and deceptive at her best, making Mrs. Dietrichson truly horrid. But highest kudos goes to the insurance investigator, the third main character, Edward G. Robinson. The screen bristles and bursts whenever he comes on, and he seems overdoing it and yet not a bit overacting. It's just a scintillating performance. John F. Seitz is brilliant behind the camera (proven here, absolutely, but also in Sunset Blvd and many other films, see the listings for the late 1940s for the classics). Music, editing, and most of all, smart, snappy direction make the film tight and truly great. The only small thing that might hold it back from that top edge of the most moving films is some weird sense of skimming the surface of all these emotions and conflicts. They are issues of plot more than character. Yes, we hear Neff with the voice-over recasting the events from his plaintive and regretful tone, and that works brilliantly. But Stanwyck, especially, comes across as simply cold. We never quite feel why she's the way she is, we just accept it. The daughter strangely makes more sense than the mother, though her role, and her impact on the film, are both small. Finally, relating all of this together, I don't ever buy into their passionate love--of course hers is fake all along, but Neff is supposed to throw everything away for the Mrs. Dietrichson, and we swallow that, too, without tasting why.But quibbles, quibbles. One measure, for me, of a great movie is if I can watch it again even when I know the plot. And this one I can, I did, and you should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ture Noir Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paramount Studio's 1944 release Double Indemnity is one of the best examples of true-to-form film noir. The plot of the film is straightforward. Fueled by greed, a wife decides to take out an insurance policy on her unsuspecting husband, with plans of murdering him for the proceeds. The policy contains a double indemnity clause, which will pay twice the policy amount in the event of death by accident. To make her plan succeed, she enlists the help of an accomplice to help murder her spouse and make it seem accidental.Adapted from a novel by James M. Cain, Double Indemnity is loosely based on the real-life Snyder-Gray murder case of 1927, in which a New York housewife persuaded her young lover to commit murder. The woman had taken out a double indemnity life insurance policy on her husband without his knowledge. The murder succeeded but the killers were caught and executed the following year. Just as actual events influenced the making of this film, Double Indemnity has influenced numerous movies based on the same premise, the most notable of which are 1946's The Postman Always Rings Twice and 1981's Body Heat.The film stars Fred MacMurray as Walter Neff, a fast-talking insurance salesman, attempting to pull the perfect fraud job. It is Fred MacMurray who is narratting the film. Of course he didn't start out with that idea - it all stated when he met, and immediately fell for, Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). From there the tale she spins of her unhappy marriage, complicated by a tempestuous relationship with stepdaughter Lola, takes him on the slippery slope to crime. With his extensive knowledge of the insurance business, nothing can stop Walter from covering his tracks ingeniously? except the analytical skills of his friend, the fraud investigator Barton Keyes.Frequently told in flashbacks, this movie is utterly compelling from the word go. It's interesting to ponder whether this film could have had the same impact if it had been shot in colour - but I don't think so. The filming is spot on, the camera angles, use of shadow and perspectives on the actors all add to the tension of the film. The screen does sometimes get so dark as to be impossible to tell what's going on in a couple of scenes, but this is done deliberately so as to add to the suspense.The film is very wordy, as so many films of the era were and the dialogue is often brilliant. Billy Wilder's direction is another part of the key to this film's being in the IMDb Top 250 Movies of All Time list and also features in the Top 50 among the IMDb Film Noir list in fact at # 3 when I last saw it. There are moments of humour to lighten the mood and scenes of compelling drama / intrigue / emotion. With the excellent acting, awesome script and breathtaking art direction / cinematography it makes one of the best films of all time in a lot of peoples' list - including mine.In case you didn't know (I didn't), the term "Double Indemnity" refers to an insurance clause where a double payment is handed out if someone whose life is insured dies in an unusual manner. Theoretically of course the chances of this happening are remote, meaning little danger of them ever having to pay it out? and cases when someone has died in this manner shortly after taking out a life insurance policy would automatically be viewed as suspicious. The way Walter covers his tracks, and the way Barton uncovers them, are quite brilliant and show (to a layman at least) a deep knowledge of the insurance business.Double Indemnity was nominated for no less that seven Oscars; sadly it didn't win a single one. But from 1944, it's popularity has increased year after year and when you talk of noir movies DOuble Indemnity instantly come to ones mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Double Idemnity is very fine film-making - with both Raymond Chandler and Billy Wilder on board and a killer cast (pun intended) it's a winner all the way.For us it's the script, the cool, almost bebop rhythm of the words, staccato and tense - it must have been amazing to hear this first time round - a use of language that just blows you away every time.An excellent plot, brilliant filming, and great acting all the way - murder never seemed so easy or the guilt and repercussions so brilliantly handled.It still works - 65 years on this is still a fresh slice of cinema that deserves each of its seven Oscar nominations - dark, cold, twisted - brilliant!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Double Indemnity" is a 1944 film directed by Billy Wilder, and it's a classic. The plot has been around forever - a beautiful woman seduces a man because she wants him to help kill her husband. What Wilder does with it demonstrates his mastery.Wilder's genius starts with the casting of Fred MacMurray, Everyman if there ever was one, as Walter, an insurance man. A boring profession and what appears to be an ordinary, albeit attractive man who is also a good salesman. Barbara Stanwyck is Phyllis, the femme fatale. Blonde with a beautiful figure, an icy, challenging manner, and a seductive voice. Edward G. Robinson is Keyes, the insurance investigator and good friend of Walter's. Dogged yet warm as he follows clues to what he believes is a murder and not an accident.There's nothing tender about the MacMurray-Stanwyck love affair, and Stanwyck delivers her lines in a cold, calculating way - the same way she does the love scenes. Walter comes off as fresh at first - what salesman would flirt with a married woman as obviously as he does - but he probably realizes when Phyllis appears wrapped in a towel that she probably wants him to. There's nothing spontaneous about Phyllis asking about life insurance for her husband; it's been on her mind since Walter showed up to renew the car insurance. The minute she says she doesn't want her husband to know about it, Walter knows what she's up to. Though their plan is brilliant, Keyes is smarter than they realize.I love the way it's introduced into the plot that Phyllis was the first Mrs. Diedrickson's nurse and that Lola, Phyllis' stepdaughter, suspects Phyllis hurried her mother's death along. I also love Walter's cold feet as he becomes interested in Lola - but it's too late."Double Indemnity" can only be described as compelling - it's not action-packed but there isn't a wasted or slow second. Stanwyck, who could be a very likable actress, plays a real conniver, and she does so brilliantly. MacMurray gives a relaxed performance - he's actually perfect casting, as one can see how easily he gets sucked into Phyllis' plan. Edward G. Robinson is the film's anchor as Keyes, who is like a father to Walter but also a man who takes his job very seriously. He's determined to get to the truth of the case, and every word he says is like chalk on a blackboard to the guilty Walter.Wilder's brilliant direction and pacing shows in every frame, and the surprise ending is the icing on the cake. A great noir, a dream cast, a great director, Hollywood at its very best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the greatest movies of all time. This movie is brilliant in every sense of the word. Technically it plays with shadow as well as any movie ever. It is as dark a movie as can be made without the screen being totally black. The shadows cast by the venetian blinds are beautiful and terrifying. The story is of an insurance salesman(MacMurray) who is quite taken with a lonely housewife (Stanwyck). Together the two plan to do away with the husband of the woman by putting into motion what they both consider to be the perfect crime. It is nearly impossible to find better written dialog. The script crackles with funny one-liners and great plays-on-words. Innuendo has never been better. This is one of my all time favorite movies. The characters are unhappy and bitter people, as they should be in any great film noir. The movie is so simple and yet so complex , making it perfect. The best film noir ever and easily one of the best movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mere words cannot express my love for this film. This movie is a crystallization of silver screen perfection, a rare event where every little thing aligns to bestow the lucky viewers with what can only be described as breathtaking art.The performances in this movie are superb. In a script riddled with hardboiled dialog and outlandish implausibilities, everyone hits the right note, and makes the endeavor compelling. Stanwyck is at her most seductive and powerful, and Edward G. Robinson gives the movie the perfect moral ground.But the best performance has to be given to Fred MacMurray who turns the clichéd role of a man seduced by a woman into something more than the sleaze bag he should be. He becomes a character you're invested in, a man who is shaken from his complacent life and thoroughly destroyed by the demons he creates. And through this all, through murder in its many incarnations, you still can't help feel for the man. The character of Walter Neff, in so many words, takes on a life of its own thanks to MacMurray, and keeps the audience compelled no matter what sins he commits. The tics and libido exuded add to his charm and make him deservedly one of the most iconic characters of all time.A lot of this credit must be given to Billy Wilder, my personal favorite director and a man whose films can all be completely different but possess enough tics to be instantly recognizable. The beauty of his shots and the set up of the script blend perfectly, creating a universe that is tangible and complex.If you have not seen this movie, please do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was fantastic. Definitely one of the twenty best films of all-time, maybe 10. The plot was so good that it even put Hitchcock to shame. This is one of the few times that a movie did justice to the book. In this case the movie might have even been better than the book. This is one of those movies where I cannot find a flaw, anywhere in it. In a sense it was a perfect movie. There is not one genre to define this movie. It has romance, crime, noir, mystery, with emphasis on the last 3 in heavy dosages. All I can say is, for those who haven't seen it, you don't know what your missing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I teach critical viewing of film in high school and since this is the best film noir ever made, I showed it in the fall of 2005 to my classes, only to be met with universal hatred and scorn. Nothing about the film pleased and I was rather disheartened. Later in the year, however, several kids said that they think they probably couldn't appreciate it that early in the course and suggested that I save it for later in the year.So, I showed it in spring of 2007 and got a completely different reaction! The kids loved it and several were rather bowled over by the use of light and shadow and how it contributed to the over-all tone of the film. I also had by this time a really good documentary to show with it that gave good insights into the making of the film which I think helped as well.Anyway, my hope in the ultimate taste of the adolescent restored, this film will remain a late entry in my syllabus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film Noir by which all others are judged</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes "Doubled Indemnity" more sinister and ultimately more disturbing than other movies of its type are the movies' characters, or better said the "station" of the characters. Unlike other noir classics such as "Public Enemy", "Detour", and "The Postman Always Rings Twice", the characters of DI are not half-forgotten lowlifes crawling in the gutter of society. Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck are upright respectable people. MacMurray is an insurance agent, and Stanwyck, who is married to a rich businessman, lives among the Los Angeles upper-crust. I can't remember if her house is supposed to be in Beverly Hills, but it is in one of the more exclusive areas of LA.These two characters do not engage in their illicit activities for reasons of pure survival as in "Postman" or "Detour". Their motivation is far more complex and terrifying. They are bored with their present situations. MacMurray realizes that as an insurance agent, he is on a permanent plateau financially. He will probably never exceed what money he has already made. Stanwyck, despite being the wife of a wealthy man, finds her life dull, without excitement, without sex. MacMurray wants greater financial power. She wants greater sexual power and freedom. When the two meet, they sense a strange chemistry in which each can gain something from the other. MacMurray can gain wealth and higher standing from Stanwyck. Stanwyck can gain freedom with the help of MacMurray. And the means to these ends is an insurance policy. Stanwyck holds the policy but MacMurray understands certain implications about the policy that is not even known to Stanwyck. From this very simple seed, an insurance agent, his client, and an insurance policy, grows crime, betrayal, and murder. And yet these characters are people you might have met in town in 1944. Typical upstanding citizens. And yet what lurks inside them seems at first hideous and evil. And yet, strangely familiar... The characters of DI represent the darker sides that we all have within us. Every hetero male has moments when he might covet the beautiful wife of a wealthy neighbor or acquaintance and wished for a moment that he could take the other man's place. And isn't there something deep inside some hetero married females who wish they could extract themselves from their marriage without losing their wealth? Certainly, the actions that lead to the undoing of MacMurray and Stanwyck may be grotesque on the surface. But deeper inside, the motivations behind their behavior represent something that is inside many of us. We identify with these characters while the morale of society says we should not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much closer than that, Walter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Billy Wilder's masterpiece. Though "Sunset Boulevard" is a great movie, it has a few script holes that "Double Indemnity" does not have. For example, in "Double Indemnity," Walter Neff admits at the beginning of the movie that he has killed a man. He does this by dictating into a machine. He then proceeds to tell how it happened. This could very likely take place in the real world. In "Sunset boulevard" a corpse is floating in a pool; the corpse begins through narration to tell how it ended up dead. This is a major flaw since dead people don't tell tales.The only other film noir thriller that even comes close to capturing the essence of the genre is "Murder, My Sweet." The lines in that movie are almost as clever and memorable as the lines in "Double Indemnity." Interesting that the two were released the same year (1944), one based on a James M. Cain novel, the other on a Raymond Chandler novel. There are so many catchy lines in "Double Indemnity" that aid the viewer in understanding the inner workings and machinations of the characters that they fill almost the entire film. IMDb provides the best lines under "quotes." My favorite because it so defines the relationship between Neff and his boss Barton Keyes is toward the end when Neff stands before Keyes totally exposed. Neff states,"Know why you couldn't figure this one, Keyes? I'll tell ya. 'Cause the guy you were looking for was too close. Right across the desk from ya." Keyes knowingly replies, "Closer than that, Walter." The father, son relationship of the two men is now broken forever and the tragedy of the severed bond is apparent.Everyone involved in this movie both before the camera and behind the camera give their inspired all to make this film one of the greatest in cinema history. True, it may rightfully be classified film noir, but the total picture transcends labeling. It is so much more than just the best film noir movie. The three leads could be no better. They play their parts perfectly. The much underrated Fred MacMurray who was so often relegated to minor features was a gifted actor. He stays on top of it all and truly equals the inspired performances of Barbara Stanwyck, the ultimate femme fatale, and Edward G. Robinson in his best role ever. Edward G. Robinson plays the penultimate insurance actuary. He knows the statistics inside and out. He can recognize a false claim almost immediately. Neff knew this but he let another part of his body rather than his brain do his thinking for him. He is completely blinded by love and lust. And what a name given him by Wilder, Walter Neff, so common it compares with the name Willy Loman for some of the same reasons. He is too weak to withstand the wily maneuvering of this cold, callous yet greedy woman, who knows how to shake that thing. He is doomed from the start. In the end everyone loses, even Keyes. He will never be the same man again. He cannot dismiss Neff the way he dismissed all the other frauds and fakes. A part of himself has been removed permanently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boils down to three great aspects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Double Indemnity is a great film noir that keeps your heart beating and your palms sweating. But none of the greatness in this film could have been achieved without the three best aspects: 1) John Seitz's stunning cinematography. No other film-noir has managed to contrast black and white so vividly as to capture the perfect mood of the story and characters. Because of this technical achievement, the viewer can't take his eyes of the screen.2) Barbara Stanwyck's beautiful performance. Only until Gloria Swanson in Sunset Blvd. has there been such a mesmerizing femme fatale. She underplays every line and fills it with innocence, seduction, despair, desperation, and love. She IS Phyllis Dietrichson.3) Billy Wilder's unforgettable script. A story that nowadays would seem simple turns in great dialogue, plot twists, and a narrative structure that keeps you on the edge of your seat right from the start. The characters do exactly what they're supposed to do and the script shows you exactly how and why.Other great aspects include the direction, the settings, the music, and the great performances by Robinson and MacMurray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A planned and committed murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting plot of this thriller. An attractive woman (Stanwyck) married to a man much older than her, who was previously married or was widow, with a daughter from his first marriage, live in a very tense relations. She did not want to continue living with his husband and detested his daughter. At this point, an agent from an insurance company (MacMurray) thrived as an 'angel' for Stanwyck, he proposed different assurances, one of them foresaw insurance in case of an accidental death, but he also felt in love with Stanwyck. This passion led to a planned murder that was committed nearly perfectly. But another intelligent person (Edward G. Robinson), the boss of MacMurray in the insurance company, step by step started to discover the plot for murder. This is a film with very modest means if you compare with those presently in use, but it is of a very high quality. Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray showed their class, but the best acting came from that 'monster' of the screen named Edward G. Robinson, who acted perfectly. Looking the way he did one may think that he was not an actor but simply the real boss of the insurance company.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been so many reviews of this classic and much imitated "film noir" creation, I am tempted to review at least some of the reviews rather than the film, but I won't.If the script is "silly and laughable", as one recent reviewer seriously contends, then the laugh is on the reviewer because some of the dialogue was written deliberately to be comical in places, especially if lines repeatedly begin with the word "suppose". To the contrary, I found the script, written by the director himself and Raymond Chandler, to be very snappy, especially as they were so skillfully brought to life by three of the best in the business, Stanwyck, Robinson, and MacMurray, in no special order. I especially enjoyed Mr. Robinson's bursting soliloquies that underlined his character's extensive knowledge of the risks of the insurance business. Who else could have succeeded in this endeavor so well?As much as I enjoyed the three wonderful lead actors, I also appreciated all of the meticulous details of the director, Billy Wilder, including minor but memorable characters such as the elevator man ("They wouldn't sell me a policy..."), Netty, the Dietrickson's maid ("They keep the liquor closet locked up." If I were in the employ of this unhappy and unlikable couple, I would need an occasional nip myself.), Mr. Jackson, the witness ("I'm a Medford Man--Medford, Oregon."), and Nino Zachetti, the angry young man who bitterly resents how he has been cheated by society but may never realize how truly lucky he is. Even the scenes in the food market allowed us an authentic glimpse of everyday life in wartime 1944 Los Angeles, revealing, among other tidbits, that farina packages haven't changed very much in 72 years.The film unfolds in a series of flashbacks with periodic breaks in "present time", including the beginning and the end. As Barton Keyes suggests at one point, the film itself is very neatly "wrapped up in tissue paper...pink ribbons on it." Unlike many other movies of its "noir" genre, it is relatively easy to follow without distracting us with unnecessarily convoluted plots that we didn't have to struggle to understand in the first place.Neff's questionable character is revealed from the start as he has no qualms about destroying a marriage and a family until the presence of Lola, Dietrichson's daughter, challenges his conscience. His fatherly relationship with Lola and then his compassionate assistance to Zachetti, her boyfriend, demonstrates that Neff isn't completely morally depraved as much as he is weak in the face of temptation. Regardless of how disagreeable Dietricksen, his victim, is, Neff can't redeem himself from his crime by being nice to Lola and Zachetti. It is not an even exchange. This exercise in portraying a repentant, moral weakling is refined by the actor a decade later in MacMurray's role of Lt. Tom Keefer in "The Caine Mutiny". Then, MacMurray takes immorality to a new level six years after that in "The Apartment"' as the shamelessly dishonest Jeff Sheldrake, who is totally void of introspection. For those who only know MacMurray as the father in the television series "My Three Sons", you ain't seen nuthin' yet!Although I was fully absorbed in the action, Neff's ability under extraordinary pressure to get Jackson out of the observation car just in the nick of time seemed improbable to me. Didn't he and Phyllis consider the possibility that someone would be out there who was unwilling or even incapable of leaving on time? And wouldn't the coroner have established early that Dietricksen was the victim of strangulation rather than accidental death? I'll leave it to you to decide. And did Phyllis actually undergo a "change of heart" just before she was able to fire a second shot? Should it make a difference to us by then? I think not. Nothing could ever redeem this despicable woman--or that wig.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stanwyck MacMurray and Robinson Shine in Wilder Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Barbara Stanwyck is unhappily married but not helpless in this hypnotic Billy Wilder film classic, "Double Indemnity," based on the James Cain novel. Stanwyck is hardly ever helpless. She plays the quintessential femme-fatale, as she seduces insurance salesman Fred MacMurray into her web and entices him to kill her. The target is her husband. That's all you really need to know. But why am I reviewing this with so many reviews already? #1: To be among the masses who say and agree that this is arguably the best film noir ever, and #2 : To sing the praises of Edward G. Robinson! Many people will invest a lot of time in Billy Wilder's stylized technique of movie-making and his attention of each minute detail and the incredible dialogue and script, co-written by Raymand Chandler, and perhaps Fred MacMurray's best performance on screen, but while all this is true and all these factors come together to make a perfect film. One of the biggest factors is Edward's contribution to this film. The words on the page burst forth, when Edward says them. His tirades about death statistics bring life and breath to the film in contrast to the other two, who are somberly serious and only thinking about how to get out their problems alive! The balance of "hammy" Edward and his outbursts conveying joy, revelation, frustration and feeling about his job and his "little man" and "Papa," solving each mystery, along with the walking dead characters make for a mesmerizing movie experience. I have praised the always professional and exceptional Stanwyck before in other reviews. To go on any further with anything would be redundant; this is Billy Wilder and his cast's finest hour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The quintessential film noir !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with maybe John Huston's 'The Maltese Falcon', Billy Wilder's 'Double Indemnity' is considered by a majority of critics and audience to be the film that pioneered the rise of the film movement that later came to be termed as Film Noir. 'Double Indemnity' has all the tropes and clichés that became an integral part of the subsequent films of the aforementioned genre. It has the shady and morally crooked characters, the voice-over narration, the seductive and vicious femme fatale, a gloomy look and cinematography which involves a constant attention to the use of shadows and darkness. No one can ever deny how influential a film 'Double Indemnity' is. One has to only see the number of remakes and rip- offs that have been made of it to grasp its legacy.For me, the greatest part of the film are the characters. There are no flawless characters in the film. Everyone is shady. Yes, Phyllis is the femme fatale who initiates the journey towards the dark side. But watching the film, I have always thought that Walter was not completely upright from a moral standpoint when he entered the Dietrichson mansion. Of course his sexual attraction towards Phyllis was the factor that was responsible for his initial interest in her, but I don't think that was the major reason why he decided to devise the plan and commit the murder. I think there was always a hidden urge in him to use his know-how of the insurance business and manipulate the rules and the system to his benefit just like the analogy of the roulette conductor who ends up wanting to rob the house which was mentioned in the narration. He always had this darkness in him, but the chance encounter with Phyllis actually brings that darkness out. Billy Wilder had a dark and cynical side to him, however even in his dark films, he always used to throw in some humanism which is apparent in this film too. We find that although Phyllis is a 'gold digger' and a master manipulator, but Wilder's representation of Phyllis' cranky, husband who doesn't care about his wife's future does provide some justification for her motives. Walter also gets humanised through his great friendship with Keyes. As a matter of fact Wilder himself stated that the relationship between Walter and Keyes was the only love story in the entire film. The way both Walter and Phyllis meet their respective ends in the film also humanises them.The film is directed with meticulous precision. The film uses exaggerated shadows and darkness reminiscent of German expressionist cinema but in a meaningful way in the context of the plot to visually portray the darkness that lurks inside the central characters. The cinematographer uses Venetian blinds expertly to give the illusion of a prison that Wilder wanted. In a way, 'Double Indemnity' uses the plot structure similar to another Wilder film 'Sunset Boulevard' where a man enters a big mansion and meets a woman who ends up making his life a prison. In 'Sunset Boulevard' the mansion itself becomes the prison, while in 'Double Indemnity', the prison is more figurative. Barbara Stanwyck is fantastic as Phyllis. She expresses a lot through her eyes and effortlessly shifts from innocent to seductive throughout the film. It is very difficult to play a character who remains a mystery for the viewer as well as the other characters in the film and she does it very well. Fred MacMurray expertly plays a man who thinks he has everything figured out while the viewer knows that this is just his overconfidence. It is fascinating to see his facial expressions change from one of confidence to one of extreme paranoia over the course of the plot. Edward G. Robinson puts in a dynamic performance as Keyes. His character is cynical and unsentimental, but his scenes with MacMurray are probably the most humane in the whole film and these scenes exude a sense of mutual respect which lacks in the scenes with Phyllis and Walter.The screenplay written by Wilder and Raymond Chandler keeps the film moving at a brisk pace. What makes the film a little less effective in my eyes now after all these years is the lack of a gradual rise in the sexual tension between the two characters. I think this was well executed in Kasdan's 'Body Heat' which was a remake. I thought the relationship felt slightly rushed, but of course the strict censorship of the 1940s also plays a role in this. Another aspect is that the plot of the film has been reused on so many occasions that it no longer has the same impact that it once had. This is not a blot on the film, but that's the honest thought that I had watching it in 2016.'Double Indemnity' certainly deserves its recognition and acclaim as the film that led to the rise of Film Noir. It is well acted and brilliantly directed. But unfortunately due to the umpteen number of remakes and similar films that have appeared subsequently, the impact of the basic plot of the film might feel a bit diluted at this day and age.</fullReview>

I loved how you get the feel of what life was like back then captured so easily making us see the generation of its time and how they thought and acted. There is a scene where Walter tells Keyes to ask for matches when he buys his cigars because he is constantly lighting one for him. Keys responds, I don't like carrying them in my pocket because they go off. What many don't know is that the chemical needed to create the light was included on the tip thus striking it anywhere worked. Today, that chemical is separated from the match requiring a strike source. Who would know this unless it was explained? Other references to eating at a drugstore, catching a movie for the hell of it and living in an apartment that supplies car washes. Look for these and more as they are informative. Watch this with a sandwich, tasty drink and a favorite nibble snack. NO cell phones or bathroom runs. Pay attention and be entertained</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Double Indemnity is a true spectacle. It handles every aspect of film making perfectly. The dark lighting illuminating everything bet the character in question heightens suspense. Never showing the murder take place doesn't take away from the impact because Barbara Stanwyck's blank, emotionless expression gives even more of an impact. Edward G. Robinson shines as Barton Keyes. His abrasive yet respectable candor is played incredibly well. Your stomach drops at points when the culprits plan may be uncovered and your heart skips beat when the two perpetrators may be caught. But what really ties this film together is the friendship of Walter Neff(Fred MacMurray) and Barton Keyes which is torn in such a pitiable way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is a keyword I would to describe Double Indemnity, its dialogue. Exposition is a very tricky line to cross; when done poorly is can come off as immensely frustrating, but when done right it can be music to the ears, leaving me dying to hear more like I'm watching an engrossing documentary. Throughout Double Indemnity with the use of narration, Fred MacMurray will explain what's clearly appearing in the frame, but as nobody does narration quite like Billy Wilder. Instead of making Double Indemnity coming of as a movie which feels the need to dumb down and explain everything to the viewer, this expositional narration comes off a poetry, enhancing any scene in the film. Even with hearing noir dialogue parodied countless times, it doesn't affect my enjoyment of the movie.I've generally never thought much of Fred MacMurray as an actor; he strikes me as serviceable but never an enigmatic screen presence. His role as Walter Neff in Double Indemnity is the one major exception in his career. This casting against type may be my favourite one hit wonder performance ever; his uttering of the words "Baby" and "Hello Keyes" never gets old. When I first watched Double Indemnity I assumed MacMurray must have been an icon of film noir, turns out he was anything but. Barbara Stanwyck was a sexual siren in a number of her films, I'm not aware of what Stanwyck's ideological or moral beliefs where, but a number of her films are some of most sexually suggestive old Hollywood films I've seen. There is her pre-code work such as Baby Face, but in the post code era she appeared in the code breakers Ball of Fire, The Lady Eve and yes, Double Indemnity. In her introduction scene as Phyllis Dietrichson she is dressed in a titillating manner with her legs crossed while wearing a skirt, almost expecting her to pull off a Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct. Culminating this trio of actors at some of their greatest work is Edward G. Robinson as Barton Keyes, the claims expert. When watching his performance I don't feel like I'm watching someone playing a claims expert, I feel like I'm watching an actual claims expert. Double Indemnity offers an intriguing insight into the profession of the insurance salesman, but like being a lawyer, I'm sure this is one job which Hollywood makes out to be more exciting than it actually is.Like a number of films in the noir genre, the ending is revealed at the beginning of the movie, leaving me not wanting to know how the film ends, but rather how the story and characters got to that point, and boy am I dying to know. For an example of one of the film's suspenseful scenes, take the moment in which Phyllis arrives at Walter's apartment to discover Keyes is also there. All within a single frame Phyllis is hiding behind the door with Walter trying to prop it open and Keyes in the background. When Keyes walks towards the door and there is a bump in the music score, it's moments like these which get the blood rushing, yet they look so deceptively simple.Why do Phyllis and Walter agree that honking a car horn three times a signal when that would easily draw attention? When a plot hole or nonsensical moment (Or Barbara Stanwyck's wig) doesn't bother me in the slightest, it's a testament to how great a movie is: not affecting the movie's heart racing, tearing the leather of the sofa's arm rest levels of suspense from start to finish. Why are so many people dismissive of old movies? Because they are corny and cheesy? Few other movies pose such an aurora of cool as Double Indemnity, baby!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Noir as it gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Double Indemnity (1944) follows insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) who gets involved in a plot with Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) to murder her husband for the insurance money. It certainly had a sort of noir all star crew; Wilder directing and writing with Raymond Chandler based on a book by James M. Cain. In my opinion, the score by Miklos Rozsa elevates Double Indemnity above the rest of the pack. It's varied and rich and creates suspense, very mature for the 1940s. The writing is beautiful and tragic, and the dialogue cracks like a whip. Los Angeles looks classic and is beautifully shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>lust, corruption, and greed in a world where profit and self-preservation are primary values</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best examples of Film Noir, Double Indemnity is a stylistic crime drama about an insurance salesman who is convinced to take part in a murder/fraud scheme by a beautiful woman. A great film to watch late at night, it's a claustrophobic masterpiece, told from the point of view of the criminals in an utterly dark and irredeemable environment. It has a razor sharp script and exquisite use of light and shadow, both of which came to define the Noir genre. While the film has no virtuous characters, not even the murder victim or the investigators looking into the crime, the film stands as a document on lust, corruption, and greed in a world where profit and self-preservation are primary values. Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray star in Billy Wilder's enduring, genre defining crime thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WIlder's most iconic noir ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's striking from the beginning in Double Indemnity is the quality of the dialogs, as often happens with Wilder. Granted, this was made in the 40's so some turns of phrase seem a bit pompous or outdated, but lines fly and follow each other with a remarkable fluidity, without any downs. As for the rest, the movie comprises every characteristic of the film noir genre whether on the form or content, from lighting to the voice-over or the typical characters. The plot is implacable but some elements are not very credible, like the emerging romance for example. The Machiavellian scheme and the investigation that follows it lack suspense, tension, and the outcome turns out to be a bit disappointing because it's rather telegraphed although it perfectly concludes this noir which probably remains Wilder's most iconic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was interesting watching this movie having already seen so many movies that clearly used this as source material. The fast talking, witty dialogue, woman with a money making scheme, and the use of romance/feminine wiles to achieve those means are all things that became the cornerstone of film noir. It's easy to see why this movie had such an impact given how perfectly each was executed. It was interesting to watch their so called perfect scheme unfurl bit by bit, especially in regards to how the characters reacted to this. The only thing that I wish is that I had gotten a little more invested in the romance and the characters themselves. Some later film noir films really nailed making me care about the plot through the eyes of the characters, which is my favorite approach to film. That is just my personal preferences though, and setting that aside, this was an incredibly well constructed film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As this classic film noir begins protagonist Walter Neff returns to the insurance office he works at; it is late at night and he is clearly injured. He sits down and starts to record a confession; he starts by saying that he had helped a woman kill her husband for the insurance money. The action then flashes back and we see the events from the moment of his first meeting with femme fatale Phyllis Dietrichson when he flirts with her while visiting to remind her that her husband's car insurance needs renewing. On their second meeting she brings up the idea of taking out accident insurance without her husband knowing? he knows she is talking about murder and walks out but inevitably they meet again and start to plan how they could do it. Walter decides it must be done on a train as a clause in the policy doubles the payout? of course with that sort of payout the company will investigate very closely and Walter's friend Barton Keyes always figures out what happened.This year may mark the seventieth anniversary of Double Indemnity's release but it does not feel dated. The opening scene lays out what is going to happen but even though we know Mr Dietrichson will be killed and that Keyes will suspect the wrong man it is still tense from start to finish. Fred MacMurray put in a nicely understated performance as Neff; a surprisingly likable character given that we know what he is going to do. Barbara Stanwyck was great as Mrs Dietrichson; a less pleasant character but even she is initially sympathetic initially. The third of the main cast Edward G. Robinson is a lot of fun at Barton Keyes; possibly the only good main character. Director Billy Wilder does a great job bringing the story to the screen; the atmosphere is great. Overall I thought this was a great film; any fan of classic cinema is sure to love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great photography really brought the drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall this was a great film that really captured my attention throughout the whole thing. Barbara Stanwyck has an accent and a voice that can mesmerize and the way her and Fred MacMurray were speaking to each other was interesting and exciting and really kept the attention of the audience. The photography was also amazing in this film. There were very dramatic lights and shadows that subtly resembled German expressionism. It contrasted greatly with the bright sunny weather on the outside with the gloomy dark lighting in the insides telling a story that anyone is capable of murder no matter what they look like on the outside. Apparently John F. Seitz used a technique called "venetian blind" which gave the lighting a look as if the characters were trapped behind prison bars. All in all the photography was very good with its dramatic shadows and gloomy/ scary appearance. And of course the plot was very good. Barbara had Fred wrapped around her finger throughout the whole thing and when he finally snapped out of his twitterpated comatose that's when things started to take a turn for the interesting. When Fred finally saw through all of Barbara's deceiving and evil plots his love for her vanished and he was determined to stop her whatever it took. The ending really did it for me because it felt as if justice had finally been served for the young deceiving mistress who was fooling Fred from the beginning.</fullReview>

The way the movie was played out was excellent as well, because the audience already knows a lot of the story right from the beginning, giving the audience time to focus on other things such as the black and white shots and wonderful acting throughout the rest of the movie. The plot of this movie also moved right along during this movie that was shy of two hours.

		<fullReview>After just having watched this film, what initially sticks out to me is all of the suspense. There were a few instances when I was just sitting here, wondering what was about to happen. What were the characters going to do now? Even by the end I'm still asking myself questions. For what I thought film noir to be, it was pretty much as I imagined. There were higher contrasted scenes and shots of characters shadows and things. Not throughout the whole thing, in day time shots, but it was still there. But it did seem like that whole stereotypical noir feeling with the narrating by the main character. I feel like parodies of film noir in todays culture base everything off a movie like this one. A cool sounding guy sitting at his desk, telling you how it all went down. That feels very "noir" to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good but very dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the film that many, including myself, considered should have won the Best Picture award in 1944 over Going My Way, and one of the greatest film noir. After watching it again last week I'd have to agree with many reviewers that the film is still good but is now badly dated, notwithstanding the revolutionary villain/hero narrator technique, as many other noir films of that decade are, while others (Maltese Falcon,Out of the Past, Big Sleep, Mildred Pierce, Lady from Shanghai, The Killers, just to name a few) have not faded as bad. Wilder's 1945 "The Lost Weekend" in particular is as harrowing and relevant today as it was in 1945, and deservedly won the Oscar for Best Picture. Stanwyck, who I found very sexy in other movies (Ball of Fire, e.g) doesn't do a thing for me in this film, not the least because of the ridiculous blonde wig or whatever she had on her head. The scenes in the supermarket and in the back of the train where MacMurray never faces the stranger who offers to get a pack of cigarettes, are very clumsily done. The side stories of the daughter and her boyfriend also don't help. The ending, however, is still very effective today,as are many scenes, most of them involving Edward G. Robinson, who's excellent. Also, the music by Miklos Rosza, who would score many of Wilder's films, is memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a wonderfully movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is about greed and seduction with a plot that probably won't fly in the modern film era, as it would be ripped apart by forensic evidence and detections; but in the 40s such science was not that much available so the plot was just right. The plot is about an insurance salesman (Fred Mac Murray) who got lured (which was quite easy due to his greed) into insurance fraud. The story was simple he taught, all he had to do was kill the lady he so desires husband and make it look like an accident, while tricking him to sign an accident insurance policy where everything goes to his lady friend, so he will get the girl and with her comes the money. The movie is best put using the word nice, and a classic as it has come to be. Double Indemnity is beautiful and captivating, based on a 1943 novel of the same name by James M. Cain. This movie was the height of film noir in the 40s spring out many copycat B movies from other producers.The screenplay is penned down by Billy Wilder, who also directed the movie, and from the way the movie drove you just have to appreciate the work of the screen writer, I while watching I was so eager to know if they will get away with it or not. Fred MacMurray narrated and starred in the movie, although the movie was a huge critical success and was nominated for seven Academy Awards but did not win any. Billy Wilder's writing and directing of this movie is a masterpiece worth treasuring and a work of art worth owning.The movie and the book's idea is based on the Double indemnity clause provided in life insurance or accident policy whereby the insurance company agrees to pay the stated multiple (double) of the face amount in the contract in the case of death caused by accidental means.The movie was a box office success making over 5 times its production cost, and the cinematography used "venetian blind" lighting which became popular in later film noirs. Double Indemnity was well received by the American Film Institute, in AFI's 100 Years?100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) it was rated 29th; it also got other American Film Institute recognitions. This movie is wonderful, so if you have not seen or heard about the movie now you have so go see it.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Double Indemnity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's earlier vintage work, DOUBLE INDEMNITY is an unapologetically thrilling film- noir, without any fluffy fillers, this morally shocking murder tale has justified itself as a textbook exemplar of how cinema is able to be a heavyweight platform to narrate a story, apart from all those auxiliary foils (both visually and sonically), the marrow here is a neat but impeccable script (by Wilder and Raymond Chandler).The impending tragedy has been explicitly unraveled since the very beginning, the storyline starts as a flash-back, our protagonist, Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), suffering from a bullet wound in his shoulder, has stated that he neither got the money nor the woman after executed a ruthless murder, then the film jumps to the overture to delve into the details of Walter's fated encounter with Phyllis Dietrichson (a gracefully confident Barbara Stanwyck to portray a standard femme-fatale character), as an insurance rep, Walter is smitten with her and assists her to murder her wealthy husband so as to get the so-called "double indemnity" insurance compensation. The murder scheme certainly is not the most difficult part, the real challenge is after the evil conduct, in one hand, Walter's super-acute superior Keyes (a bona- fide scene-stealer Edward G. Robinson) who gradually detects the real motive after the presuming accident death; on the other hand, the more devilish past of Phyllis suggests that there is an even bigger conspiracy is under the way.One could never argue that the script is prodigiously witty and most notably is Keyes' eloquence in harnessing his professional intuition ("the little man inside") to find out the loophole behind any ostensibly qualified insurance cases. It's quite unimaginable that Robinson had been snubbed for a supporting acting nomination while the film has acquired 7, including BEST PICTURE, DIRECTOR and LEADING ACTRESS (without win though); while MacMurray, had been eluded by the Academy throughout his wholesome career, potentially had delivered his best work in depicting an ambiguous figure with all he had; Stanwyck's role is a tad feeble due to her not-too-copious presence but she is just marvelous to watch with each gesture and expression entangled with her own breed of complexity, but the final convolution of her heartlessness-turns-soft tactic is a self-conscious compromise, woman falls prey of a man's world is just an illusionary chimera, which has been haunting us until this moment and will thrive on and on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of film noir? Probably!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not one to bash television. Yes, it has plenty of fluff, but it also has some pretty decent programs, as well. There is one thing about t.v. that sometimes makes me a little sad -- that it diminishes the reputation of serious actors that (usually later in their careers) turn to television. That can certainly be said for Fred MacMurray, who could do a great job in films as diverse as "The Egg And I", "The Miracle Of The Bells", "The Caine Mutiny", and this film. Comedy, melodrama, war, and film noir -- all done quite nicely. Because of "My 3 Sons", MacMurray's reputation suffered, and many have forgotten that at one point he was one of the highest paid and most popular actors on the wide screen.This is an excellent film for a couple of reasons. If you don't know the plot in advance, you still know the murdering couple is going to trip up somehow, and the trick is guessing how. And this film does keep you guessing for quite a long while...and that's the suspense of the film. MacMurray, as I indicated, is excellent here, as is Barbara Stanwyck...and this was quite a departure for her...cheap blonde and all. But a sometimes unsung hero of the film is Edward G. Robinson, whose role really is critical to the picture. Taking third billing, this was a step down for him, but one in which he earned significant praise.It's difficult to find much to criticize here. Of course, with today's crime detection, this plot really wouldn't work. But it's nice to savor a very fine crime film of yesteryear. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Double Indemnity's storyline has probably been played over thousands of times since insurance claimants have existed. Rotten relationship, money at the end of the tunnel and scrupules vanish like snow in the spring...this movie covers its bases admirably, however.Barbara Stanwyck captivates at the black widow drawing Neff into her web. Could he interest her in some Accident Insurance? What if they split the claim? Hubby is so heartless and cold...could he help at all? It's easy for us in front of the big HDTV screen to mock Walter but the truth of the matter is, emotion and passion rule the day at times.Fred MacMurray is spot on as the hapless insurance salesman caught between his otherworldly clairvoyant boss Barton Keyes, the sultry Phyllis Dietrichson and his own principles. Phyllis' husband is murdered in a plan so intricate that it should, nay will, fool the claims investigators. That is, until the big boss considers it fishy and Barton gnaws at the case's inconsistencies like a rat on a piece of rotten flesh. Eventually Neff confronts Phyllis, who has had enough and tries to dispose of him (as she has her husband's ex-wife, told through her daughter) and her statement that she is utterly empty inside before succumbing to gunshot wounds in a close quarters fight with Neff is chilling, to say the least.Simply can't say enough about this one folks. If you want to catch a taut murder-mystery, put Double Indemnity at the top of your list!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Wilder's Noir Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder was a phenomenal director, at home in genres as wide-ranging as the delightful goofiness of SOME LIKE IT HOT, the twisted courtroom puzzle of Agatha Christie's WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION, and the somewhat darker comedy/drama of films like THE APARTMENT and SUNSET BLVD. In fact, he was so good that picking out a "masterpiece" for this director is a little like trying to choose one Van Gogh.But if I had to name one film as Wilder's greatest achievement, it would be DOUBLE INDEMNITY, possibly the most noir of the entire film noir genre.Wilder did not invent the film noir; some feel that the definitive noir was Huston's MALTESE FALCON three years earlier. But as good as Huston's film was, DOUBLE INDEMNITY is noir honed and fine tuned to its ultimate expression: hard-boiled, sexual but cold, and usually featuring a cast in which it is hard to tell the scoundrels from the good guys.The story, taken from a novel by James M Cain, is typical noir fare. Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), an insurance salesman, is sent to call one day on a man named Dietrichson regarding renewal of his car insurance. At the house, Walter also meets Dietrichson's wife Phyllis (Barbara Stanwyck), a crudely made up bottle blond sporting a too-tight skirt and sweater and an anklet to draw attention to her legs.Despite the fact that Phyllis practically has the word "SLUT" tattooed on her forehead (or perhaps because of it), Walter falls for the dame, and she cons him into a scheme to sell her husband a life insurance policy, and then murder him, making it look like an accident to double the payoff (hence the title).They carry out their plan practically under the nose of Walter's best friend, insurance analyst Barton Keyes (Edward G Robinson), a man who smokes cheap cigars but never seems to have the matches to light them. Robinson is wonderful in a rare departure from his gangster persona; a good deal of what comes out of Keyes's mouth can be considered comic relief, but it isn't long before it begins to dawn on Walter that his best friend will turn out to be his nemesis.Wilder was a real actors' director. Fred MacMurray, a modestly attractive man whose acting abilities were seldom really stretched, is not only given an actor's field day in this role, but Wilder actually makes him a sex symbol. No mean feat for the actor whose most memorable role would be the father on TV's "My Three Sons" some two decades later.As for Stanwyck, all I can say is WOW! Far be it from me to take away Ingrid Bergman's Oscar for GASLIGHT, but as good as Bergman was, Stanwyck is sensational here. Stanwyck was always one of the most versatile actors of her day, and she could literally play anything, but I've always enjoyed her when she plays the bitch. And Phyllis Dietrichson is as cold-hearted and mercenary a bitch as you can ask for. Not even Bette Davis's amoral murderess Leslie Crosbie in THE LETTER packs quite the wallop that Stanwyck does here.The "love story" between Walter and Phyllis is basically about sex and money; true to the noir form, it is a cold sexuality, though the script by Wilder and Raymond Chandler is about as hot and heavy as any movie could get during the years of the Production Code; in fact the sexual tension between Stanwyck and MacMurray is so thick that after the film ends you might feel the need for a cigarette and a shower.This is one brilliant film: tersely written, sensationally acted by the entire cast, and directed to cinematic perfection by one of the best auteurs in the business.This is one of those movies they mean when they say "They don't make movies like that anymore." And more's the pity. It is sensational, exciting, sexy, and you will definitely want to see it more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So noir, so good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another of my dad's favourite films and was he ever right. Along with that other celebrated James M Cain adaptation "The Postman Always Rings Twice", this particular cocktail of sex, murder and intrigue becomes the cinematic equivalent of a page-turning thriller as workaday insurance salesman Fred McMurray falls hard for Barbara Stanwyck's anklet and soon afterwards the rest of her so that before he knows it he's ankle-deep in a murderous plot that will have catastrophic consequences for them both.Of course the film could hardly go wrong with Wilder himself and Chandler adapting Cain's novel, Wilder behind the camera and Edward G and Ms Stanwyck in lead roles but it's Mr Family Guy McMurray who's the real revelation, giving the performance of his life as the wise-guy sucker taken for a ride by femme-fatale Stanwyck.There's constant exposition in the screenplay as McMurray's Walter Neff flashbacks us through the preceding events and Robinson exercises his "little man inside" to crack the case in progress, but you hardly notice it, you're so gripped by the plot. The dialogue is sharper than a buzz-saw, particularly the first encounter between McMurray and Stanwyck where you can almost see the flames crackling into life between them while Wilder's direction keeps up the suspense from first to last and yet is never unnecessarily hurried.As to which is the better movie between this and "Postman" it's the difference between a twenty and two tens. Essential Golden Age Hollywood film-making, murderously good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitively nostalgic film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Double Indemnity" in a modern context seems remarkably unoriginal. An unhappy but wealthy housewife and her insurance salesman lover plot to scam and murder her husband to collect $100,000 on a double indemnity clause in his life insurance. But the film is a darkly lit, chain-smoking bona-fide film noir thriller, an execution of incredible suspense and style with dialog and narration that you just don't hear in film anymore. It's unflinchingly nostalgic, like an ageless perfume -- often mimicked, but still distinct. The structure of the story offers more of its originality. It opens with the main character, insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), confessing a murder into the voice recording cylinder of his boss. It's a murder mystery told in hindsight, flaunting its mastery by managing to be suspenseful in Neff's retelling despite having revealed the end result. Though it takes awhile to get rolling, the film has you hooked and dying to know how it all went down.Neff's narrative gives the film its noir tone. Previously a romantic comedy actor, MacMurray absolutely nails the persona and voice of "it was a dark and stormy night." His ability to light matches with one hand is a party trick that even today's ardent opposers of secondhand smoke would kill to know. His transition from slick, smooth-talking salesman to paranoid killer is the film's strongest plot arc.Billy Wilder writes and directs a film that flows surprisingly well. It's very clear what's going on and each scene takes time to set itself up and set a specific mood that he echoes with lighting. Scenes in front of windows or in doorways are a favorite of his in the film."Double Indemnity" is one of the earliest examples of movies depicting the downfall of the small-time criminal who can't easily look past or forgive his/her own actions. 65 years later, this message has been diluted by many more films that echo it in more complex and intriguing ways. If you don't absolutely love this film, you probably love a film that borrows at least some element from this richly rooted classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One fine constructed movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a classic movie that is made by its story. It has a great deep murder-plot, with normal characters being put in not so normal circumstances. Within its genre this is simply one fine movie, that with all of its ingredients embodies the crime/film-noir genre of the '40's.Like all of these movies it begins all rather simple, with a good thought out murder-plot but of course soon things start to go from bad to worse. This is what I like mostly about this type of movies. Characterers change throughout the movie and the plot thickens fast. It's really a movie that gets better by the minute and besides also features plenty of nice twists and developments. A real fine constructed movie.It's of course also being made great by it's atmosphere, that I don't consider typically film-noir like, cinematography and directing by Billy Wilder, who handled a lot of different genres successfully throughout his career, film-noir being just one of them. He also helped to write the screenplay for this movie. His directing and writing both earned him an Oscar nomination for this movie. The movie got nominated for a total of 7 Oscar's, including best picture but it won none however. Nevertheless the movie has grown out to be more of a classic than the movies that did won an Oscar over "Double Indemnity" that year.Fred MacMurray isn't really the best known actor but he suits his role in this movie just fine. He really fits in well within the genre. I wasn't too happy about Barbara Stanwyck though, who has played far better roles throughout her career. She also looked quite ridicules with her blond wig. Ironically enough she still got nominated for an Oscar for her role in this movie. It was great to see Edward G. Robinson in this. It was the first time ever he appeared in a film-noir and prior to this he was mostly known for his tough roles in gangster-movies.A must-see for the fans of the genre.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film is a must see for any fan of film and one of the best in its genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So very rarely do you get such a film that withstands the test of time without being too innovative. Films such as Citizen Kane, Casablanca and 2001: A Space Odyssey are all fantastic examples of what film can be and how a single film of however long can innovate, entertain and spellbind at the same time but something so simple and so straightforward as Double Indemnity can also prove to be of equal quality.Double Indemnity is not a film that is particularly visual, it's not a film that relies on standout performances or lines of dialogue that you hear quoted and see spoofed in other films years later; but where the genius and I must emphasise 'genius' lies is in its camera control and emphases on character and plot. The way the camera is used as an actual 'tool' rather than something to just point and shoot, the way the character of Phyllis (Stanwyck) is glamorised but at the same time presented in a dangerous way and of course, the break-neck pace in which the film moves along all culminate in a film experience that is truly entertaining and that gives us an education; not only in film but in morality.I mentioned the script has no standout lines but the way the characters communicate to one another is funny and so realistic, it's like being in the rooms with them. The way Walter (MacMurray) talks to his work colleague Barton (Robinson) about the case once its been carried out is not only fascinating because we know the truth but also just merely entertaining. There is no "Here's looking at you kid" or "Open the pod bay doors" but instead a series of humorous lines, witty put downs and amusing anecdotes; my favourite being when Walter's talking about insurance to a semi naked Phyllis and he states that he'd hate the household not to be "fully covered". I also liked the way the narration puts you in the film ? Walter describes just about everything he does and everywhere he goes. He tells us what he's feeling and even what he smells: Honeysuckle in the air, last nights party cigars in the hosting room. We find out how he feels as we centre around him; I ask you: how many films are there that attach us to a character so much that we feel what he's feeling because he's telling us what it's actually like? Once all the classic flirting between Walter and Phyllis as well as the now iconic way in which she is glamorised through the camera as it moves with her, focuses on certain body parts and has her wear what it is she chooses to wear, the film beds down into the actual act of crime in sets up so well. The tension and atmosphere during the second third and beyond is tense enough but when little things pop up such as the injuring of Phyllis' husband's leg as well as suspicions in the office scene that includes a company chief suspecting foul play whilst Walter and Phyllis herself stand and sit waiting the outcome is brilliant as it's unpredictable. Barton's persistence in the office scene just involving Walter is fantastic as is when he turns up at Walter's flat when we are all expecting Phyllis any moment.Few other films get more and more intense as the plot carries on ? it's like the scene of the crime as the detective tries to find clues only the scene is one massive world of evidence, witnesses, murder and suspects and the twist is that our protagonist is the guy who's got to pray nobody cracks the case. As an example of film noir, Double Indemnity is as good as it gets; as an example of story telling Double Indemnity is again, as good as it gets. In fact whatever things Double Indemnity does do in a minor and unspectacular fashion, it still manages to pull off as either mere entertainment or as tension wrought twists of the knife.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched DOUBLE INDEMNITY probably no less than 10 times. It entertains me each and every time.I think the movie is cast perfectly. Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck &amp; Edward G. Robinson are all excellent. They played it out to perfection.Fred MacMurray was only known to me as the father on "My Three Sons" the first time I saw this movie. I loved him as Walter Neff. He played it so well - very believable.And Barbra Stanwyck as Phillis Dietrichson... Oh my gosh! She has been one of my favorites for a while. She, as usual, plays "the bad woman" so well. She makes you believe she could get a man do anything she wants. I will say, I very much dislike her hair in this movie. It is very unflattering.Edward G. Robinson is so funny &amp; odd to me. I love to see him in movies. He balanced out the cast perfectly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mac Murray's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic of the film noir genre. The old story of Eve seducing Adam and leading him down the path of evil and ultimate destruction. Stanwyck smolders in the role of the disaffected housewife who sees MacMurray as a means of ridding herself of a husband and reaping the financial rewards. EG Robinson shines as the insurance investigator but it is MacMurray who steals the movie. One has no trouble in believing him in the role of an opportunistic killer. Who would have thought that the doting father of My Three Sons could be so sinister. MacMurray should have won the Oscar for his coruscating performance. Hollywood should have a category for posthumous awards rectifying past mistakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Straight down the line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Insurance companies pay a double indemnity on certain unique kinds of accidental death. Its a marketing tactic. So, for example, if your husband is insured for $50,000 accidental death and he dies on or falling off a train (the probability of which is extremely low), the payout is double i.e. $100,000.Walter Neff, an insurance salesman, is the lead role in this director Billy Wilder's finest film. The femme fatale is Mrs. Phyllis Dietrichson and the insurance investigator is the wily Barton Keyes. The three central roles are played by Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson. The film has a great visual style (starting from the opening credits of a man on crutches to the intelligent usage of the dictaphone as a narrative device) and Robinson constantly needing a light with dialogue (written by a reportedly drunk Raymond Chandler) as good as that Out of the Past or Maltese Falcon. The score is a classic.I thought MacMurray was fine in this role but I do wonder what a Bogart or Robert Mitchum or even a lesser Kirk Douglas or Edmund O'Brien would have done with. Apparently Wilder thought that the wig Stanwyck wore was a mistake but he was already one month into shooting and it was too late. She does seem kind of silly in it! Robinson is great as usual as the investigator.Noir fans may also want to check out The Killers with Edmund O'Brien as a persistent insurance investigator investigating the death of Burt "the Swede" Lancaster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching The Maltese Falcon, another famous film noir, and being hugely disappointed by it you can imagine the trepidation with which I approached Double Indemnity. However, within a few minutes my fears disappeared as I knew I would thoroughly enjoy this film.Everything about this movie was great, from having the ending at the beginning, the voice-over, the cinematography, the plot, the twists, the tension. Even though Walter and Phyllis have done something wrong you still care about them and actually want them to succeed to be together. Note the high use of blind shadows which could be interpreted as prison bars to tell us that they wont get away with it, justice will prevail.Although this is a great example of film noir I still think Sunset Boulevard, another of Billy Wilder's films, is the classic version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Barbara Stanwyck was in her late thirties when she played Phyllis, and wore a wig, but she looks every inch the seductive femme fatal. The only flaw I personally see in this film is the fact that Neff starts to fall for the immature stepdaughter, who is so daffy she already has a boyfriend that treats her like dirt. Phyllis's husband is also not the kind of guy that garners your compassion, even when they kill him. Although they don't show how Neff actually kills the husband from the backseat, or talk about it, it seem plausible that Neff broke his neck. After all, a knife wound would rule out the possibility of an accident, and there was no gun shot. I grew up in Glendale, Ca. and several scenes in this film were shot in the the same town in the 40's. Not everything has changed all that much geographically. I love old movies that show LA as it was. The obvious father/son relationship between Neff and Edward G. Robinson makes it so much more exciting. It's amazing that Robinson's character, who is so quick to feel the "little man" in his stomach when anything is wrong, would fail to notice the character flaws in Neff, even before the murder. I guess Phyllis just brought out the underlying dormant evil that was always in Neff. But her evil was never dormant, up until the moment when Neff has a gun at her chest and she tells him she couldn't pull the trigger on her own gun again to finish him off. Too late now, "lady"...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film noir, before anyone knew what "film noir" was.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It came out in 1944, a year before I was born. The French would later coin the term "film noir" for this kind of movie, with dark themes and set mostly at night or in dark interiors. It is told in the manner that "Columbo" movies and TV episodes would be told decades later -- we learn early what happened, and who did it, and the movie is about why and how. "Double Indemnity" is told in flashback, as the main character is dictating a late night message for his boss the next morning. Fred MacMurray is Walter Neff, insurance salesman who also has an eye for the pretty ladies. Barbara Stanwyck is Phyllis Dietrichson, wife of a wealthy and boorish business man. Edward G. Robinson is Barton Keyes, Walter's boss and company's man who investigates possible fraud. SPOILERS. When Neff calls to see if Mr. Dietrichson wants to renew his auto policy, he only finds Phyllis, is smitten, and immediately sees an opportunity to get into her good graces. He will sell the husband an accident policy that has a double indemnity clause if he is killed on public transportation. But the husband must not know, so gets his signature by misdirection. Husband breaks a foot and has to travel by train, Neff hides in the car and strangles him as Phyllis drives him to the train station. Neff dresses up as the victim, boards the train, and jumps off the back observation platform, meets Phyllis, they put the body on the tracks, cops find the body and assume he fell to his death. Accident. Collect $100,000. But guilt and jealousy get the best of them, Neff is shot in the shoulder by Phyllis, he makes it to the office, bleeding, dictates the message, confesses all, and dies trying to walk out, just after Keyes comes in at daybreak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the moment I saw it...it was great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people can articulate here, better than I can because they know more about the film-noir genre, which is the classic-genre that appeals to me the most (I greatly enjoyed "The Big Sleep", "The Manchurian Candidate", "Night of the Hunter", "The Maltese Falcon" and "The Man Who Wasn't There" also). Is this a good example? Hell yeah.The concept is deliciously simple. Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is persuaded into helping the femme fatale Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck), kill off her husband in order to claim the insurance policy she takes out for him. The title of the movie stems from the clause they can double their claim, if Mr. Dietrichson dies in a particular manner. The plot then unfolds as they plan the murder, and the fallout that will - being film-noir - result. There's a lot of mention of the great chemistry between the two leads - Walter and Phyllis - and that's certainly true. Nice little performances for both of them (which got Barbara nominated for an Oscar). And the others - particular Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) as the man set out to investigate Phyllis' unusual insurance claim - are equally good. All round great cast helps add a lot to the movie.It's the script tho' that really bangs home the movie's classic status. It's very sharp - some of Keyes lines for example are hilarious black comedy. The execution of the plan is meticulous and smart - the sort of attention to detail we see in this movie is so rarely exhibited in recent times. There's fine direction all the way that help create the exact mood of the moment - whether its the worry of Neff, his isolation, or Phyllis' conniving chatter. It's no wonder that it got nominated for a bunch of Oscars, including Best Picture and, since it was a deserving winner in its year, it's no wonder the Academy didn't give it the prize....A sharp and engaging drama, with fine performances throughout, I can't but recommend "Double Indemnity". It mightn't be for all of the MTV-generation, who want quick visuals, but for anyone with an ability to immerse themselves into the movie, this should be seen. 8.3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Double indemnity is a Film Noir classic. Director Billy Wilder gives the film the classic Noir look, with dark shadows and a twisted murder plot. Whether it's the darkness of a house or a poorly lit street the scenes are given an attitude by the lighting that Wilder chose. Walter Neff, played by Fred MacMurray is pushed in the middle of a femme fatales' unscrupulous scheme. Neff an insurance salesman is coaxed into a murder/fraud scheme by a beautiful woman. Neff gets lured into this plot of deceit because of an anklet that the femme fatale, Phyllis Dietrichson played by Barbara Stanwyck, wears throughout the film. Stanwyck's performance is superb, she plays a cold-blooded woman with a mindset of taking what she believes belongs to her. Dietrichson is nonchalant, and methodical when it comes to her femme fatale characteristics. Neff and Dietrichson tend to light up the dark scenes with their lustful looks towards each other. Lola, Phyllis' stepdaughter, on the other hand is the complete opposite of the femme fatale. Jean Heather playing Lola does an excellent job of selling her character as an innocent and meek teenager wary of her stepmother's actions. Edward G. Robinson plays Barton Keyes an insurance investigator with a `little man' that gives him clues to the status of a claim. Keyes is like a father figure to Neff and they spend much time together as Keyes throws his ideas of what happened around.This was a great film going to great lengths to please the viewer. This Film not only leans towards the serious side but also has some comic relief mainly in the use of the word baby, and the endless search for one mans matches. A great work of art Double Indemnity should be on everyone's list of movies to see soon. It will not only keep you wrapped up but also will keep you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next plot twist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From its filming style, its lighting, to its cast, Double Indemnity has defined film noir for over 50 years. But should it? Voted by the AFI as one of the greatest 100 films ever made in the past 100 years, AFI forgot to mention Out of the Past or Touch of Evil as an equal. Maybe he was right for the part in 1944, but why on God's green earth would they cast Fred MacMurray as the male lead? Today he shall always be remembered for one word.....flubber!

		<shortDescription>One of Billy Wilder's best with outstanding cast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although made in 1944 "Double Indemnity" still packs a punch today with its racy (for 1944) dialogue and fast moving plot. Definitely a 10/10. The three leading players (Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson) have never been better and give powerful performances. In my opinion Fred MacMurray should have won the Best Actor Oscar for his offbeat casting as Walter Neff, Billy Wilder deserved to win as Best Director and the film should have had Best Picture. The three major awards that year all went to "Going My Way". (Ironically, Billy Wilder won Best Director the following year for "The Lost Weekend" which also won Best Picture so that was some consolation for losing out with "Double Indemnity"). This is one of those films which can be enjoyed over and over again with repeated viewings - a "film noir" masterpiece. "Double Indemnity" is the film that first made me aware of Billy Wilder as a director who then went on to make many other classic movies such as "Sunset Boulevard", "Ace in the Hole" (also known as "the Big Carnival"), "Stalag 17", "Some Like It Hot", "The Apartment" and several others. Worthy of being in anyone's "Top Ten" list of the best films ever made! Clive Roberts.</fullReview>

In other words, another potboiler. But as much as I wanted to, I couldn't find anything wrong with this movie! This movie is terrific! Fred MacMurray (the gentleman from My Three Sons) plays one of the great heels in Hollywood motion picture history. Barbara Stanwyck ( who was from Brooklyn, New York) is at her sinister best. But the real star is Edward G. Robinson. His performance as the the insurance actuary Walter Neff is incredible. How many movies are there that portrays an office bureaucrat as a hero? That is what makes this movie so unique. This movie is a tribute to all the office workers of the world who push the papers, compile the facts, analyze the information and keep things going. Maybe if NASA had listened to their Walter Neffs, the 1986 Challenger disaster would have been averted. Who knows? But after watching this movie, one thing is certain: respect your office workers because someday they may save your life ... and your business.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Double Indemnity is a classic story that shows what happens when lust meets greed. Fred MacMurray, as Walter Neff an insurance salesman, meets Barbara Stanwyck. Stanwyck wants her husband out of the way so she can get his money. MacMurray wants the husband out of the way so he can get Stanwyck. They hatch a clever plot to get rid of the husband. Edward G. Robinson plays MacMurray's boss Barton Keyes. Keyes is like a tenacious terrier who once he picks up a scent won't give up until he finds the source. He smells something is wrong with the insurance claim and spends the rest of the movie trying to find out the truth.Billy Wilder chose a clever way to tell the story. He starts the film with MacMurray shot in his office dictating the story which is told in flashbacks. So from the beginning you know parts of the story but not everything.Robinson was known for his gangster roles but in this film he plays a good guy. If you want to know why Robinson was a screen legend just see him in this film.MacMurray's character is interesting because you wonder why a likable guy like him would ever get involved with a spider like Stanwyck.Stanwyck plays the conniving wife for everything she's got.Double Indemnity is a classic of film noir and is ranked #38 on the American Film Institute's top 100 movie list. The screenplay was by Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler from the novel by James M. Cain.</fullReview>

He smokes, lites matches with his finger, and simply enjoys his flirting with Phyllis. He constantly reminds her of "his plan" to free her of her husband, with 100k as a reward unaware that the whole time it is "she" that has pulled him into her trap, much like a spider to the fly. Edward G. Robinson as Barton Keyes, the man trying to prove a murder with the help of his "little man" is really great. As with all perfect plans, there are little problems that can destroy the plans but this movie ends with the problem walking around with two legs, wearing an ankle bracelet.

Sure, it has a snappy dialogue, the dame is desirable, the hero both lovable due to his sentimentalism, and exciting due to his high intelligence, the narration is very well done. The acting is not, contrary to popular opinion, that good. The main characters were not so hot, the best piece of acting was actually the portrayal of Keys, his character was almost Holmes-esque. The plot is very generic. Of course, this film may well have been one of the first to carry out such a plot, it may have been a real trend-setter, but I'm sorry that doesn't make it a classic by any stretch of the imagination. Regardless of how it received and how influential it was, it is not a great in its own genre. I adore film-noir and found this a let down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Clipped" Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I enjoyed this movie a lot, I found some interesting flaws in it as well. For instance, Fred MacMurray seemed to try too hard to be a bad guy. I adore Barbara Stanwyck, but who did her hair? It looked like a poorly styled wig. This film certainly was fodder for a Carol Burnett parody, if for nothing else, her hair. The only believable character I found was that of Lola, the victim's daughter. Edward G. Robinson was great, thus I felt that the part was written for him. Now the part of the casual observer on the train from Oregon seemed to be terribly stereotyped, and the racist overtones as with Mr. Galopus and the "colored woman who comes in twice a week" didn't excite me either, but I guess that was what it was like in those days.Now for the clipped part. The dialogue seemed very quick and unnatural. It sounded like everyone was reading from the script while they were acting. This may have something to do with Wilder's penchant for "tight" scripts, especially in his early films. I must say that he improved later on in such films as "Sunset Boulevard." I did enjoy the scenes of Los Angeles in the 1940's though. It's a period piece to be admired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film-Noir of the First Order</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Gang of truly talented Folks ignited a Flame that would become known as Film-Noir and released this Electrifying Movie to Critical Acclaim and Seven Oscar Nominations. Behind the Scenes things were not as Smooth as the Finished Film.There was trouble casting the Lead. Director Billy Wilder's teaming with Hard-Boiled Novelist Raymond Chandler (creator of Gumshoe Philip Marlowe) came to blows Writing the Script, with Chandler literally leaving the Set and refusing to come back unless apologies and compromises were made. The Ending that was shot and in the can was trashed and a new one Filmed. The Blonde Wig that Barbara Stanwyck wore was considered a mistake but it was too late to change it.So, what is now considered a Great Film, a Seminal Film-Noir, and a Bonafide Classic, took some Cool Heads and Compromises to complete this "Edge of Your Seater". What turned out was a highly enjoyable and Stunning Suspenser that Cracks with Creative Dialog bathed in Diagonal Shadows, and moves "Straight Down the Line" to its Downbeat Conclusion.Fred MacMurray thought the Role "Iffy" at first and had to be talked into changing Type. Stanwyck thought Her Femme Fatale was too Heartless and Diabolical and Edward G. Robinson had to think about His Third Place Billing.But in the End it all worked out and basically a New Genre was Unintentionally Formulated. It would not be recognized as such until much later and After the Fact. It was a Genre that happened spontaneously and organically with Seedlings planted before this one and would come Full Flourish and Thrive until the Turn of the Decade.Note?The Movie was based on a Novella by James M. Caine who noted that the Film was better than His book. Extraordinary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came into this film expecting a great deal. I was not let down. After watching "Mildred Pierce" I held film noir's to a very high standard, and though that could be unfair, Double Indemnity was very very good. The masterful use of flashbacks to tell most of the story was similar to that of Mildred Pierce, but there were plenty of differences. Editing was crucial in this film just to pull off the easy transition from reality to flashback. The story itself was easy and interesting to follow. Shadows played a big role in portraying a character, hard shadows for intense characters and soft shadows for more lax characters. The mes-en-scene, or feel of the movie, was interesting. Phyllis murdering her husband with the help of Walter Neff gave the movie a dark feeling. That is something I find key in a film noir. Like I said, I fell in love with this film and it is a must see for film noir fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killing for love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very suspenseful, and well done. I wouldn't call it a new favorite, but it was still a good movie. The acting was good, very dramatic, and the actors had really good chemistry as lovers. It was appropriately dark as a crime movie, and there was good use of light and shadows in scenes that were serious or dark. There were also a few good scenes of cinematography that were shot, it really added to the suspense of the movie, there was one part where the woman was so close to the man that wanted to arrest her, only separated by a door it was full of that thriller feeling while watching it, really directed and shot well. The entire movie was thrilling and I would recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazingly involving great picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Double Indemnity" (1944) is a pure movie-making at it's best - highly involving, superbly acted with top notch directing, amazing script and once again a story and storytelling which just doesn't let you go from start till finish. The story is very intriguing but it is the narrative who sold this story, i can only guess how incredible this movie felt like back in 1944 because even now seeing it for the first time in 2015 this is edge of your seat type of storytelling and movie. Won't spoil anything but lets just say i wasn't ready to be this taken by a seemingly simple mystery story that much. Movie also deals with greed - why would a man who loves his job and is very good at it risked everything for money? "Breaking Bad" anyone?Overall, "Double Indemnity" is a superbly involving picture with a mystery which is seems (and kinda is) clear from the beginning, but how it arrives to it's conclusion is superbly intriguing. I also loved the acting by all three lead characters and script is amazingly sharp. All in all this a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dawn of the modern thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Double Indemnity' is a tale of an insurance salesman who fancies he can engineer the perfect crime but who doesn't reckon on others being more ruthless than himself. It features a script by Raymond Chandler, and direction by Billy Wilder: you couldn't get much better than this in the 1940s. In it's favour, it's nicely paced with some sharp wise-cracking dialogue, and Edward G. Robinson is fun in a supporting role. Against that, it rather leads its audience by the nose, with a voice-over telling where it would have been better to simply show. This puts a distance between us and the film, which doesn't spoil the tricksy plotting but which does rather kill the movie's emotional dimension. For sure, it feels its age; but the film's redeeming virtue is in its genuine interest in telling its story, something you feel more modern films, art-house and blockbuster alike, often seem to lack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would Two More Murders Make Sense?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Neff is an insurance salesman who conspires with Phyllis Dietrichson to murder her husband and collect on an accident policy. Walter is good friends with Barton Keyes, an investigator with the same company who has an uncanny ability to spot a phony claim. As a result, Walter knows all the angles and he and Phyllis almost manage to commit the perfect crime.The coroner rules it to be an accident, and so the police do not bother to investigate any further. But the insurance company is on the hook for the $100,000, and so Keyes starts looking into the matter, especially after he gets one of his hunches. Suspecting that Mr. Dietrichson was murdered, Keyes realizes it would be easier to murder him before he got on the train, which is what happened, rather than kill him on the train. That means that Phyllis must have had a male accomplice to pretend to be her husband. He starts having her house watched. As a result, Walter and Phyllis have to stop seeing each other until the investigation is over. Phyllis's stepdaughter, Lola, had a boyfriend, Nino Zachetti, but they broke up, and soon he and Phyllis start having an affair. Keyes concludes that Nino is the accomplice in the murder and calls off the surveillance. He tells Walter he is going to reject the claim, daring her to take it to court.What follows from this point on seems to make no sense. Walter goes over to Phyllis's house intending to strangle her, and she slips a pistol under the cushion so that she can murder him. Let us consider the situation from Phyllis's point of view. Unless we assume she is psychic, she does not know of Walter's plans to kill her. So, what does she hope to gain by killing Walter? The police have already dropped the case, but if Walter is murdered, the police will not only investigate his death, but it might make them reconsider her husband's death as well, since Walter sold her the policy. Furthermore, shooting Walter in her house will not only get blood all over the place, but she will then have to dispose of the body. What is she going to do, cut him up in the bathtub like the guy in "Rear Window" (1954), and then make several trips to the city dump with the body parts in a suitcase?The prudent thing for her to do is to just sue the insurance company. If she wins, she can give Walter his cut and all will be well. If she does suspect Walter wants to kill her, then she should simply refuse to let him come over to her house. After all, he is not going to gun her down on Main Street. Therefore, it makes no sense for her to shoot Walter.Now let us look at it from Walter's point of view. By this point, Walter has obviously given up on getting his share of the money, because she cannot very well collect and split with him if she is dead. So, what does he hope to gain by killing Phyllis? All Keyes knows is that Phyllis has been seeing Nino, which means she has been having an affair with a younger man. Big deal. He says he has investigated Nino's movements on the night of the murder, and they cannot be accounted for. We later find out from Lola that he broke a date with her the night of the murder, claiming he was home sick. But that is not exactly evidence that he committed a murder. In any event, we know that Nino did not do it, so he is not likely to get tripped up in a cross examination in court, as Keyes seems to think. With nothing more to go on, Keyes has little chance of successfully denying Phyllis's claim in court, and it certainly would not be enough for the police to reopen the case. Walter should just quit having anything to do with Phyllis.But let us assume that beyond all reason, Walter is afraid that enough would come out in the civil suit that would lead the police to reopen the investigation into the death of Phyllis's husband, and make them to suspect not Nino, but Walter. In that case, Walter should simply turn in his resignation at the insurance company and go to Mexico for a while. If Phyllis's lawsuit does not lead to a new police investigation in which he becomes a suspect, he can always return to the United States later; if it does lead to a new investigation and he does become a suspect, he can continue to hide out in Mexico. But his killing her will definitely cause the police to investigate. Walter's plan is that Nino will be blamed for Phyllis's murder. But Nino might have an alibi for that night. As it turns out, Nino was coming to see Phyllis just as Walter was leaving the house, but Walter could not know Nino was going to do that. Walter tells Phyllis, just before he kills her, that he knows Nino will be coming to see her in fifteen minutes with the cops right behind him, because it has been all set up. Now, how would he know that? Furthermore, Nino would have no motive for murdering her. If anything, the police might end up suspecting Walter. Therefore, it makes no sense for Walter to murder Phyllis.However, it is reasonable to assume that two people who have committed a murder and are afraid of getting caught might not be thinking clearly. Each one might suppose that killing the other one would make them safe, because then there would be no accomplice to testify against them. So, their behavior might make sense on an emotional level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity is A Potent Film-Noir!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity doesn't really try to make us care about its protagonists, insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray making a great chump) and femme fatale Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck's finest hour). Hell, the film itself hardly cares about them! We learn the score from the get-go, when Walter recites his confession into a Dictaphone: "I killed him for money and for a woman. I didn't get the money, and I didn't get the woman." So much for last-act revelations! But that's fine: any loss of suspense is more than compensated for by the thrills we encounter on the twisting road to his demise.The film then goes into a flashback. When Walter turns up at the Dietrichson home to discuss the renewal on Mr. Dietrichson's auto insurance, he takes an immediate shine to the coquettish, anklet-wearing Phyllis. The chillingly amoral Phyllis, motivated by little more than boredom, makes no secret about her loveless marriage to an older man, and how much she'd like to see her husband get insured heavily - and then die. Walter, having fallen in love hook, line, and sinker, tells Phyllis that that if the husband has an accidental-death insurance policy with a double-indemnity clause, Phyllis (and, by extension, Walter) stands to get some serious coin and since he knows the business inside and out, he can stage a foolproof murder. All seems to be going according to plan, until the salesman's shrewd boss Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson, in a wonderful rat-a-tat performance) begins to smell a scam. As the screws tighten on Walter, he starts to realize just how devious Phyllis can be and over the next hour and a half, we are irresistibly drawn into the drama that ensnares them all.Film noir is the most intoxicating of Hollywood cocktails, and none is more potent than Double Indemnity. Billy Wilder breaks the rules of filmmaking with breathtaking confidence and is all the more satisfying for it. It has all the hallmarks of film noir ? it's a moody, pessimistic crime story with strong overtones of spiritual bankruptcy and moral cynicism. Like the best of film noir, it sizzles with crackling, sardonic dialogue (watching Neff and Phyllis interact belies the twisted beauty of the film), veiled lust, overtones of impending doom and a seductively devious femme fatale. And the brooding look of the film is magnificent ? the City of Angels, haunted throughout by human weakness and greed, somehow appearing dark even when the sun's shining.Double Indemnity is a splendidly chilling noir about murder, immorality, lust, and greed - both a starkly realistic and a carefully stylized masterpiece of murder!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a true murder mystery movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't expect the movie to be as good as it was, Double Indemnity encapsulates what I feel a murder mystery should be.The story was just about Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck's trying to get away with murder. It goes over the whole planning process, how the executed it, and what the result were. The story contained suspense and truly made me wonder what was going to happen around each corner.The acting was great from everyone, I never felt like anyone was over acting or underacting. These were characters on the screen and they did a good job.The camera work was by far the best part though. The cinematography was amazing, there were really nice shots in almost every scene. The noir feel of the film was even passed over through the camera with the dark shadows and serious characters.This movie was the perfect murder mystery to me. I was others would take from this formula because it was done right. The characters weren't stupid, they planned it like anyone else would.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Billy Wilder Work Hints at Genius to Come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film before, but tonight I saw a remastered version in theater as part of TCM's series. I felt that the quality of sound was uneven, but otherwise it was very satisfying.Like Billy Wilder's "Sunset Boulevard", most of the action is related via flashback. Fred McMurray plays an insurance salesman, Walter Neff, who dictates the story into a machine for his claims manager, Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson). The story revolves around Neff's relationship with a client's wife, Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck)--a shady lady who is unhappy in her marriage.This film is considered one of the best examples of film noir and is routinely on best films lists. The B&amp;W photography certainly supports that claim and it is an excellent film, but it has a shortfall.Fred McMurray was generally regarded as a film good guy. Wilder convinced him that he could play Neff, an unsavory character. He was right, of course, and he would do it again for Wilder in the film "The Apartment". But the tough-guy lingo that comes from McMurray's lips, especially in the early part of the film, seems out of place--not because it's McMurray saying it, but because his character is an insurance salesman. Such Chandleresque dialogue feels natural coming from Bogart's private dick in "The Maltese Falcon" or from John Garfield's drifter in "The Postman Always Rings Twice", but not here.We might also ask if Barbara Stanwyck is convincing as a woman who could drive Neff to obsession or moral abandon. Perhaps, but it's debatable. I don't think there would be a debate if the actress was Lana Turner ("Postman") or Kathleen Turner ("Body Heat").It is interesting they way Wilder gets the viewer to identify with Neff. When there are threats to Neff's nefarious plan, the viewer feels his anxiety. That adds to the film's feeling of suspense, even though the viewer has an idea where the story is going.Edward G. Robinson is brilliant as the corporate crime solver with a nose for fraud. He is the moral compass of the film. In this film, Wilder provides a glimpse of the genius that would produce so many masterpieces to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Classic Noir Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught this film as a TCM Classic film event on the big screen recently at a theater in Knoxville. I had heard of this film, but knew nothing of it other than its name: and I'm ashamed to say that I didn't know what the word "Indemnity" meant before seeing the movie.It turns out that this is a great example of a classic film noir movie. The plot is engaging, with quite a few twists and turns. The acting is good, including the supporting cast, and the story that is told is enjoyable, even if it is "dark".I'm going to say 8/10 stars for "Double Indemnity". There are movies I'd rather spend my time on, but this one is certainly worth seeing at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Double Indemnity (1944) **** (out of 4) Masterpiece about insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) who sits down at an audio recorder to confess to a crime he committed. Turns out while trying to sell car insurance, Phillis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) becomes interested in accident insurance and sure enough soon the two are trying to knock off her husband. Walter thinks he has the perfect crime planned but his boss Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) starts to see some flaws.Billy Wilder's DOUBLE INDEMNITY is often called the greatest film noir ever made and I'm not going to argue that or try to rank them since there's been so many terrific ones made. There's no question that the film is a true classic and manages to work on so many levels that you really can't help but fall for the romance, the suspense and the plot twists no matter how many times you've seen the film. Everything from the camera work to the lighting to the music score are flawless but what makes this film work so well are the direction, the performances and of course the screenplay.Wilder directs his and Raymond Chandler's screenplay with a fiery passion that just jumps off the screen. What's so remarkable about the screenplay is the terrific dialogue, which contains so much back-and-forth that you can't help but smile and wonder how long it took to write such lines. Just take a look at the sequence where Walter and Phyllis first meet. Look at the dialogue being shot off when they discuss the insurance plans. Heck, take a look at Robinson's speech whenever he's debating his boss about what really happened. The screenplay works in a terrific murder plot, wonderful dialogue and of course the twists that work flawlessly.The performances are certainly a major reason for the film being so great with both MacMurray and Stanwyck doing some of the greatest work of their careers. Stanwyck is so wonderful during the scenes where she's talking about her abuse and she manages to make you, the viewer, and MacMurray believe everything she's saying. Then that coldness that starts to show is priceless. MacMurray is perfectly believable as the normal guy who finds himself in over his head and constantly trying to out- thinking people who are a lot smart than himself. Robinson, one of the greatest actors in history and one who never gets enough attention, is flawless in his fast-talking role.DOUBLE INDEMNITY is without question one of the best noirs ever made and it constantly gets better with time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cold-blooded classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DOUBLE INDEMNITY is pretty much a perfect film noir thriller, directed to the hilt by Billy Wilder and containing cracking performances, a near-perfect script, and a solid storyline. The tale, about an insurance agent who falls for a classic femme fatale and then conspires with her to bump off her husband, is simple in the telling, and much familiar from other similar fare, like THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE. But it's the execution where this film really delivers.Barbara Stanwyck is an intense delight as the ultimate femme fatale; completely cold-blooded, a literally chilling character. It's testament to Fred MacMurray's acting ability that his character continues to hold the audience's sympathies despite his murderous behaviour, while Edward G. Robinson brings warmth and humour as his boss. The real star, of course, is the script, written by Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler, which screams quality throughout. Wilder's expressive direction - all ominous music, shadows, and tension - is the icing on the cake. Having read Zola's THERESE RAQUIN recently, I'm surprised by the similarities to that novel, which was clearly a huge inspiration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Double Indemnity (1944): Dir: Billy Wilder / Cast: Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson, Jean Heather, Byron Barr: A film about guilt, lust and the inability to hold it together when truth threatens to reveal itself. It regards double play and double crosses and the risks taken to achieve a consequence too grim to bear. Barbara Stanwyck wants her husband dead so that she can collect the insurance. Insurance agent Fred MacMurray already approached her husband regarding an automobile claim. They plan the murder so that MacMurray will have an alibi and the body ends up on a train track. Plan foils when foul play is suspected and the victim's daughter reveals crucial information. Director Billy Wilder strings viewers along with mood and style. MacMurray demonstrates extreme regret as he is led along by lust and betrayal and eventually consequence. Stanwyck creates the ultimate femme fatale who seduces males to their doom until she is forced, all too late, to care. Edward G. Robinson steals scenes as he slowly pieces everything together. Jean Heather plays the victim's daughter who reveals Stanwyck after her mother's death, now her boyfriend may be seduced and framed if MacMurray doesn't act for the good. Byron Barr plays Heather's boyfriend caught within the web of deceit. Theme of consequences brought on through lust and manipulation. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd first seen "Body Heat" years ago, so this story was very familiar; but really, "Double Indemnity" is in a class by itself. More to the point, when someone you know asks, "what's film noir?", you point to this movie. Between the irredeemable sinners, profiteering, the lighting and that killer dialogue, it's all here. And speaking of fiery dialogue, when it's not MacMurray and Stanwyck bandying about the double entendres, there's Edward G. Robinson sneakily stealing the whole show. Great performances all around. And Stanwyck, playing the classic femme fatale, still manages to be alluring despite that awful wig.You feel kinda guilty for wanting them to get away with it, but that's part of the fun. And this is just one of those movies that seems ideal for late-night viewing.Great stuff.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A partial analysis of Double Indemnity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Double Indemnity falls under the Tragedy class. Walter Neff's choices lead him to committing serious crimes and ultimately ruining his life. He grows wiser around the second culmination when he realizes he's made a mistake, however, his growth isn't deep enough for lasting change as shown when he tries to flee to Mexico. Another evidence that leads us to believe it's a Tragedy is that he never actually accomplishes his objectives. "I didn't get the money and I didn't get the woman." He ultimately loses the fight and has minimal growth. Walter Neff is the main character because we experience the movie through him. It is his story and we are curious and sympathetic with him before anybody else. We gain a negative empathy toward him and am satisfied he doesn't get away in the end.The camera was used as narrator effectively when Mr. Neff and Phyllis first meet. We see Phyllis from Mr. Neff's point of view (first person) and it makes us feel sort of voyeuristic and we enjoy that cause she's in a towel. A fantastic use of a psychological gesture was when Keyes searches for his cigar light after coming to some sort of conclusion about the case. It clues us in to his state of mind which is befuddled by the case. He does this multiple times, allowing for the planting and payoff of Neff offering a light.The first planting is the silhouette of a man limping on crutches during the opening credits. That shadow is paid off multiple times but the limping figure is paid off most powerfully when he is limping to the observation car on the train. The second planting is Neff's words "straight down the line", those words are paid off when Phyllis repeats them to him at the 2nd culmination. The third planting is when Neff lights Keyes cigar and says the words "I love you too." That planting is paid off in the 3rd act when Keyes responds saying "closer then you think" and again when Keyes lights Neff's cigarette for the last time.Omniscient Point of View was effectively used when Phyllis shows up at Neff's door while Keyes is inside. We know she is hiding but Neff and Keyes don't know that right away. Neff finds out but Keyes never does. We feel suspense when Keyes, who is standing at the elevator, changes direction and goes toward the door.Lola Deitrichson is a subplot character. She has an arc and acted as a catalyst for Walter to question the motives of Phyllis. The Janitor is an example of a one-string character. He has no arc.The "Point of Attack" or "catalyst" to the story is when Walter Neff decides to check up on an auto insurance renewal at the Deitrichson home. Had he not stopped by, he never would have met Phyllis, and the story would have never happened. The First Act comes to an end as Phyllis leaves Neff's apartment repeating his words "straight down the line." and then slides into the 2nd act with Neff's words "the machine was now in motion". The main tension is fully in force when they officially join together to bring down Mr. Deitrichson. The 1st Culmination happens when Neff and Phyllis dump Deitrichson's body on the tracks. Although not complete, they have achieved the outer arc in a big way. It seems as though they will get away with it. The 2nd Culmination happens in the Grocery store. Neff knows they can't get away with it and he wants them both to back out. Phyllis refuses and insists that they stay with it using the payoff "straight down the line." Billy Wilder gets us to suspend disbelief at the beginning of the film by showing a large silhouette of a man limping on crutches. We immediately become curious about who it is and why is he limping.Wilder leads us to further curiosity through an erratic car and a hunched over man going up the elevator with his back to the audience. We gain some sympathy when we see he had been shot but that sympathy became negative when he decided murder was an acceptable means to obtaining money and women. We gain negative empathy when Walter decided fleeing to Mexico was his best choice instead of facing the consequences of his murders. The filmmaker gets us to hope that Walter and Phyllis would sever their relationship early and fear that they would actually follow through with their plan.The tension increases when Keyes began to listen to his 'little man inside' and also when the "Man from Oregon" was on the observation deck. The tension is challenged when Lola is introduced. Neff doesn't like thinking about them cause it makes his task more difficult. Finally Neff's arc was completed at the end of the film and we walk away satisfied that good triumphed over evil. Even though Neff had temptations that any of us could have succumb to, we leave feeling good that he didn't get away with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From director Billy Wilder, Double Indemnity is a film film that hits on a very real subject that has occurred through the years. the setting and lighting really contributed to the true film noir feel to the movie and the role of Phyllis, played by Barbara Stanwyck, as a femme fatale gave the movie a deceptive presence. the role of betrayal in the movie plays a huge part as there are many temptations provided throughout the film. The filmmakers used darkness terrifically to set the overall mood to the story and present a sense of mystery to the movie. Fred MacMurray's character, Walter Neff, gives the film a protagonist that is albe to be transformed from a straight and narrow person to one that falls down a darker path and the casting for the film was brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Double Indemnity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this film and a couple other Billy Wilder films such as "Sunset Boulevard", Billy Wilder has to be my favorite film noir director. Before even getting into the form of the film, the content is just great. The woman in this film (Phyllis) is a classic woman figure in a film noir film in the sense that she is not who she appears to be. She comes off as an average woman but secretly wants her husband dead. The plot is very eery and dark with Phyllis being the center of evil. This film utilizes many other aspects of the overall film noir genre. Low key lighting is seen throughout the film as well as oppressive music which gives the pessimistic feel which is seen in many other film noir films. Even the costumes the characters wear help with its overall feel. The men are seen wearing gangster type suits while the women are well dressed in dresses. This film is significant because of its influence on other films. In other words, this film helped set the standard for future film noir films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a sucker for Film-Noir so Double Indemnity was right down my alley. It's your prototypical noir film, from its intense score to it's over the top dialog right down to the insurance salesman protagonist? Not what I would have expected, but to each their own. I liked Double Indemnity, but I'm bias because I love noir films. The lightning in this film wasn't quite as high contrast as I enjoy, while there was obvious separation of light and dark, it wasn't as extreme as some other films thus the tension wasn't quite there in some of the crucial scenes. I won't say that there isn't any contrasting lighting, just not as extreme as I tend to like from my noir films. This is to be expected however with this being an early noir films that inspired latter films I prefer. I'm sure that the content of this film was considered to be incredibly taboo at the time, but for modern audiences it's fairly tame. This being pre-code Hollywood prevents anything from getting too scandalous, but it's interesting to see how they worked around it. This is easily a film I'll watch again as I find the more noir films I watch the more I appreciate the ones I've already seen. Comparing various methods of telling similar stories only strengthens the genre overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Double Indemnity was another one of your average Film Noirs. I found the movie to be rather enjoyable, but a little over the top for my taste at points. One aspect of the film that I enjoyed, somewhat surprisingly, was that fact that they revealed the murderer right at the beginning of the film. I also found the filming of the film to be pretty great throughout. Other than that though there were some humorous parts to the film that kept it interesting. And the soundtrack to the film was very good and I felt that it really went with the scenes of the movie throughout. Overall, it was a good movie; I guess I'm just not the biggest fan of the Film Noir styled films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Double Indemnity directed by Billy Wilder was an okay movie I felt. I thought it would be much better due to the whole murder/insurance fraud plan. I am also not a big fan of noir films either, so that could be a big reason why I didn't think it was that good. I thought it would be more of an action/suspense type of movie but it wasn't boring though. It was still a decent movie, I just expected more. I really liked how they told who the murder was in the opening scenes. Sometimes that can backfire on you because it can ruin the suspense later in the movie. There was narration throughout the movie from Walter Neff. The movie also had a lot of humor in it. I also really like the score music they used in it. It really went perfectly with what was happening in the movie helping you to the feel the mood of it better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic, but not in my book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Up to a point I can understand why this is a classic, but it didn't work all that much for me. I think that has mostly to do with the leads, whose roles did not speak to me as they should; as humans drawn into a dark corner and plotting a deed that seems to be none other than a necessary evil.The plot seems especially silly nowadays; a smart, hard working man (we can only assume) falling for a dame that hard and that fast... Well, okay then. Then, to top that off, it turns out he had been scheming all his professional life (that's why we must never assume, I suppose) and comes up with such a weird plan: a million things could have easily gone wrong... and a couple of things did, of course.Apart from that, which means 'consider it a good old film noir with a lot of atmosphere, posture and clever dialogues', it was good enough fun to watch.A small 7 out of 10.P.s. E.G. Robinson never disappoints.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautifully shot film noir that has you on the edge of your seat from the very beginning. Fred MacMurray playing Walter Neff, an insurance salesman, is willingly seduced into committing murder for a $100,000 double indemnity insurance policy and the opportunity to have the beautiful Phyllis Dietrichson, played by Barbara Stanwick, to himself. Phyllis skillfully traps Walter into coming up with a "foolproof" plan to kill her husband and collect the insurance money without being suspected of fraud or worse, murder. Unfortunately, Walter works with a very clever investigator (Edward G. Robinson as Barton Keyes) whose "Little Man" and 20 plus years of experience, figures out the scheme. Because Neff and Keyes are friends, Keyes does not suspect Walter and it is not until Walter and Phyllis confront each other, with words and bullets, that Neff finally comes clean. Gripping and suspenseful, brilliantly acted, this film has some twists that you won't see coming right away and you'll be glad you spent the time to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clever and quick witted responses on top of an enthralling thriller give "Double Indemnity" a classic idiosyncrasy. Armed with a cast full of fantastic actors, the story unravels in a magnificent fashion and is really a spectacle for viewing. A tale of deception and greed treads into forbidden depths; an itching for riches that can only be gained from murder. The film is able to teach its audience of the evil side of love, the one that operates strictly for materialistic purposes. The double indemnity clause is not only the means for the obtainment of wealth, but symbolic for her double dalliance with two opposite yet gullible men. Be careful who you become involved with or you might just have to lay the affliction to rest with a swift "goodnight, baby."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think what's great about the online film community is that there is a constant sense of spreading the word of films that most people haven't seen. Double Indemnity was one of those films that I had heard of, but I didn't plan on watching it until AMC Rewind, a film pod-cast hosted by Jon Schnepp and Alicia Malone, brought the film up. I cant believe it took me this long to see the film. It's not only one of the best film-noir's I have seen, but one of the best crime dramas ever made. It's ability to tell a story in which we think we know the entire plot and then unravel in a completely unexpected way was pure brilliance.Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck play an insurance agent and a fed up wife respectively. Phyllis, played by Stanwyck, convinces Walter, played by MacMurray, to set up a murder in order to ensure Phyllis of compensation. Only Walter truly believes that he can create the perfect murder without being caught and ride off into the sunset with Phyllis, whom he only just met. It's narrated by Walter through flashbacks so that we know from the get-go that he admits everything to his co-worker Barton Keyes. You would think that a murder set up by an insurance agent sounds silly, but Walter meticulously crafts this case. Just as Billy Wilder crafts this masterpiece. Except that when the case unravels, the film doesn't, it elevates. There have been some great murder movies, including particular mysteries involving trains. I can think of Strangers on a Train, The Lady Vanishes, and North by Northwest right off the top of my head, and that's just classic films. There's just something involving trans that makes a story stranger than usual.Knowing what film-noirs consist of I wasn't sold on Phyllis, but I was still pleasantly surprised with the outcome of her character. Each scene is just as suspenseful as the last so it creates a plot that's impossible to predict. Sure, the way the detectives/insurance agents find out about the set up was a bit far-fetched. Considering the police should have been suspicious of the autopsy, but that's a minor detail. The point is, Double Indemnity is a masterpiece of a film, and I highly recommend it to anyone, baby.+True suspense +Meticulously crafted +Wilder's direction +Train mysteries -Farfetched moments 9.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 1938. Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is a salesman at the Pacific All Risk Insurance Co. He leaves a confession to his friend Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson). Keyes is a smart claims adjuster with brilliant hunches. The year before, he meets the seductive wife of his client, Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). She tries to get him to write out an accident policy without her husband knowing about it. He rejects her at first but she gets her hooks into him. Compelled by the challenge, he comes up with a scheme to receive double the $50k payout from the double indemnity clause if he's killed on a train. They seem to be getting away with the perfect murder but his boss doesn't want to pay up and Keyes has one of his hunches.This is one of the iconic film noir. Fred MacMurray is a natural insurance salesman. He fits the role perfectly and his corruption is completely believable. It's inspired casting from Billy Wilder. On the other hand, Barbara Stanwyck is the easy choice. She is great as the phony femme fatale. And it's never wrong to cast Edward G. Robinson. The corrupted unlikeable characters only add to the flavor of this movie. You can't go wrong by checking out this classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was filled with betrayal, greed, and lust: basically the seven deadly sins. The love that Walter had for the evil, bewitching Phyllis Dietrichson was a bit bizarre. I say this because it happened so quickly in the film. I expected it to develop more over a longer period of time because it seemed as if everything was happening so fast. I mean I get it but it was just too much for the beginning of a film. Keyes was brilliant, definitely one of the best detectives that I've ever seen. I felt bad for the daughter...she had to live with her mothers murderer, accept the fact that she killed her and try to be nice while still having a smile on her face. She had one of the most difficult positions to be placed in. The over all quality of this film was impressive. I loved how every scene was shot and also the lighting. It seems as if the director was going for that soft look when it came to the female leads.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Double Indemnity Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I LOVE the beginning of the film and how it starts off with Nick Walter's confession and then the rest of the film takes place as a flashback. The entire plot takes place during the flashback; this makes for a really cool POV.This film is a black and white film but most of the "white tones" appear to be grey. Everything also seems to have a matted look to it. Overall the movie was very dark and hard to watch. Also, the sound was very poor. The dialogue was very quiet yet the music was very loud. I had to turn my television up very loud just to hear them talk. I also liked how throughout the film there is a voice over effect which, since it is told in a flashback, makes it seem like it is more of this thoughts that we are hearing.I think the love story behind the plan is kind of corny. I personally think that she sees a man who is crazy for her and is able to help her get the money, so she just takes advantage of him. To me the love story is not real and takes a backseat. The end is perfect when she claims she has really fallen in love with him, when she can't shoot him a second time, and he just shoots her. I love/ think that the manipulative characteristic really worked for Mrs. Dietrichson. Even though she was in on the plan that killed her husband she was still able to play the "poor widow" card and make the detectives feel bad when accusing her. Overall this film was very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Double Indemnity is the particularly effective thriller and apparent cornerstone of the film noir genre that tells the tale of Walter Neff; an insurance salesman that finds himself plotting and staging the death of a client for his black widow wife. To someone like me, a child of the future where toilet paper sometimes doesn't have rolls in it anymore and plastic bags are illegal in California, the plot seemed sort of cookie-cutter, but now that I've found out that was just because this is the film that made this cookie cutter that other cookie baking bakers have been using to cut their own femme fatale shaped cookies with I've become a staunch admirer of this film and the legacy it left for the people of the future that have developed the technology to use our toilet paper rolls for paper bags to carry our groceries in.I started watching Double Indemnity under the jaded pretext that any 'thrills' it contained wouldn't have the same effect on me that they would've had on a moviegoer from 1944. It's what I've had to do whenever I've watched an older horror film, so I guess I started thinking proper, nail-biting tension was something that hadn't quite been discovered by film yet. After so much apathy you can imagine my joyous surprise when this film ended up being able to hold its own against the better contemporary thrillers I had grown up with. I was completely ecstatic when I realized the film was actually bringing me to the edge of my seat, and the scene where Keyes almost finds Phyllis in Walter's apartment actually made me get out of my chair and pace around the room while I watched. For me, the champion of this movie was Edward G. Robinson as Keyes. Where Walter Neff was bland, monotoned, and same-faced; Barton Keyes was a sharp, quick-witted bloodhound and Robinson gave him all the disarming charisma he needed to set up every major antagonatory force in the film and single-handedly unravel Neff's plot in a way that seemed completely plausible. The film may have had its problems, but Keyes didn't, this guy was gold.Double Indemnity is a movie deserving of multiple viewings. Not because of a complex plot, but because it's a fun movie with pacing so good I feel like it understayed its welcome. At 107 minutes, I wouldn't say it felt rushed, but I definitely wish there was more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Double Indemnity is a great noir film that has a great story and performances to go along with it. The story is very effective the way it starts out basically at the end of the movie with the confession and having Neff narrating the story was a great idea and I can see now how it influences other filmmakers later because of how good it worked in this type of story. The characters are also great and Phyllis works really well, you start out liking Neff and Phyllis's relationship but towards the end she's the least liked character and the film does a great job developing them. Overall, Double Indemnity has a great story and characters that keep you sucked in this noir classic and gets an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are in insurance business or if you love films in general, then it's a must watch. Now this is a film that is based on insurance and how an insurance clause of "Double Indemnity" can be used for getting someone killed. Billy Wilder unveils his genius again by keeping it believable and yet so emphatically thrilling till the last minute. We know well in the beginning that it's about murder. 20 minutes in the film, we also know that is the murder of a man, whom the wife is cheating on. Now, this turns on into somewhat unexpected as the plan goes a bit berserk with the protagonist unable to understand the woman's character. He thought both are in for it, but actually he is being used by the woman. So someone is killed and someone has to be the culprit, now who is it and how is it all done. It's all point blank and detailed to the extent of planning a murder in a very detailed manner, until its blown up. How did Billy Wilder make all of this and from a story of James Cain is just extremely poignant. It's so very relevant even today, that so many people are conspiring against each other, there are suicides and murders more than ever before and all for money, damn.Now, coming to movie it's great in terms of characters, screenplay and the lighting and production design. Acting is top notch as is always in most of Billy Wilder's movies. And above all, we have the captain Billy who is responsible for the way this film was made and he must be applauded in every sense. Just look at that scene in the beginning where Neff interprets the intentions of Phyliis is where you understand that everything is right in this film. From lighting to dialogues, all of them have added in creating the atmosphere that is for sure thrilling and suspense.This is noir film and has an open ending with us leaving to think what could have happened to Walter Neff. It's 4/5 for a film that's a must see. Just love Billy Wilder more and more as I keep getting back to his films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Although it has spoilers, the review from secondtake ("Double Crossing True Love", secondtake from United States, 16 July 2009) is a good read. There are also spoilers with the review from ElMaruecan82 ("A masterpiece of pure reverse existentialism ...", ElMaruecan82 from France, 4 August 2012), but the review mentions the true story that James Cain's novel is based on.*** "Double Indemnity" (1944, Billy Wilder&#xfeff;) is justifiably considered among the best of Film Noir&#xfeff;. It is excellent curriculum for aspiring writers, directors and actors. It also features two of the greatest characters in cinema history.James M. Cain&#xfeff; wrote the 1935 novel, basing the story on a real crime (i.e., Ruth Syder, executed in Sing Sing on 1928). It actually took nine years to bring Cain's gripping story to the silver screen. While not the first film with a female villain, "Indemnity" apparently languished because of the overreaching Hays Code, as well as the reluctance of other film stars to portray the criminal romantic leads. (The Hays Code prohibited movies from being made that would potentially glorify crime and/or suggest it as a career choice. Movie morality is almost completely the opposite today. Also, it is worth noting that Billy Wilder brought Raymond Chandler&#xfeff; to help with the adaptation, and the two did not get along.) Fred MacMurray&#xfeff;'s Walter Neff, a successful insurance salesman for Pacific All Risk, is the central figure in this murder and insurance fraud caper. As the film's narrator, he confesses to the killing in the opening scene. Through flashbacks we learn that Neff has been plotting to kill a businessman for a big insurance settlement and to continue his relationship with Phyliss, the victim's wife. (How he could ever believe he can still see Phyliss after the crime is committed is best left unexplored.) Neff is trying to remain in control of his relationship with Phyliss while crossing wits with the dogged, formidable claims investigator Barton Keyes. Neff's love for both connects the audience with him emotionally.Phyliss is portrayed charismatically by Barbara Stanwyck&#xfeff; (37 at the year of release and wearing a blonde-wig.) Stanwyck's sultry Phyliss is an inspiration to actresses who have been told they are too mature to portray a romantic lead. Stanwyck never surrenders a scene while simultaneously making the actors around her look good. Meanwhile, Edward G. Robinson&#xfeff; takes Keyes to the stratosphere. Robinson has multiple one-take monologues laden with insurance terminology that he delivers with show-stopping skill. While both are supporting players, the Robinson-Stanwyck duo are cinematic lightning. MacMurray also turns in a career-best performance and is very good with his confessional monologue. (BTW, almost everyone in the film smokes rapaciously.) I enjoy the foreshadowing in the narrative. Once example is with the conclusion. While trying not to spoil it, it contains a (now much-imitated) merger between murder and sex that was racy for its time. (In other words, the film's climax has its own climax, if you get my drift.) When watching the conclusion, recall that earlier in the story Phyliss is having trouble starting their getaway car. Neff lends a hand, turning the ignition key slowly. The tension that the engine turning over is released for both, as if sexually. This is not the only early scene which comments upon (and hints at) the conclusion. (Here's an unrelated question: Has any other film caper had a principal character with as much of a foot fetish as Walter has?) As the director, Billy Wilder employs negative space very effectively. For example, Keyes often discusses the "little man" inside him that enables him to see through the smokescreen of an insurance claim. The little guy that Keyes refers to can be seen as the boxer who is the subject of several paintings hanging on the wall of Neff's bachelor pad. The painted fighter is ready-to-rumble, and is particularly visible when Phyliss and Walter are worried about Keyes. In addition, Wilder handles the crowd-pleasing, conspirator-hiding-behind-the-hallway door moment with great skill. (Too bad Wilder didn't stay with film noir. This is what he was born to do.) Cinephiles should see "Double Indemnity" every time it arrives in a revival theater. Make sure you mind your crutches when arriving by open-air passenger car on a train.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barbara Stanwyck at Her Delightful Worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fred MacMurray falls for Barbara Stanwyck in a big way. She has big ideas but needs a favor. He is an insurance agent and she wants him to doctor a policy for her. He soon finds himself (initially resistant) in the middle of a murder plot. As is the case with film noire, he becomes her lap dog, thinking that he is somehow going to earn her love. We don't need much imagination to know that things aren't always as they seem. The strong women of Hollywood had more of the femme fatale in them in those days, even the leading ladies who normally played desirable parts. Think Bette Davis or other minxes who got their own ways. MacMurray and Stanwyck cook up a plot to get some insurance money in a double indemnity situation, where the right kind of situation results in double the money. Sometimes the characters are so full of themselves that they can't see the forest for the trees. What does Fred offer this lady; is she so bent on giving him what she wants. This is a classic film with great characters, dark moody sets and music, and a really cool plot. MacMurray does all the dirty work and we have this tale laid out after he is shot. The camera is in its glory, even today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is DOUBLE INDEMNITY such a great film? It has a lot to do with the performances: Fred MacMurray cast against type as Walter Neff, the insurance salesperson drawn into a web of intrigue, contrasted with Barbara Stanwyce, at once so alluring yet remarkably expressionless as she puts her plans into practice. And there is Edward G; Robinson as the fast-talking investigator, outwardly friendly yet with a mind like a steel trap. Billy Wilder's film is perfectly structured around a series of close-ups: the characters' expressions are perpetually put under the microscope so that every change in emotion is signaled to us. There is also the light, with the bars of the windows shining on MacMurray's face, emphasizing some kind of imprisonment; and Miklos Rozsa's haunting music, with its central motifs signifying doom. Yet perhaps this movie's greatest asset is its script: the story of how Wilder and Chandler's collaboration went through several problematic stages is a legendary one, but the end result is a taunt, literate piece of work, allowing the characters full rein to express themselves. MacMurray's voice-over leads us into the story, while emphasizing his guilty feelings for what he has done. There are also several humorous exchanges between MacMurray and Robinson; despite what he has done, it's clear that Robinson's investigator has a lasting respect for Neff as a person. There is also a running leitmotif throughout the film, as Neff keeps lighting the investigator's cigar with a match; the tables are only turned at the end, when the wounded Neff takes out a blood-stained cigarette and the investigator lights it for him. DOUBLE INDEMNITY is one of those films to watch again and again, not only because of the subtleties of structure and performance, but simply because it's a really good piece of work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder is one of the few, perhaps the only director whose films I liked all of the rows, 11 of them for now. If I had to rank them according to quality, as objective as subjective character, there would be a very big problem, almost impossible one. But perhaps of all these movies this one can be especially highlighted and placed in pole position. It is, as you can see, a film-noir Double Indemnity (Double Indemnity). Although I love Bogart and Maltese Falcon, perhaps my favorite noir, I have to admit that this is definitely above par, if not a little better but The Maltese Falcon built in favor because it was one of if not the first "big" representative of this genre. Double Indemnity is recorded based on the novel by James M. Cain and the story is based, as was later discovered, on a true story, Snyder-Gray case, in which they recorded and later film The Postman Always Rings Twice and Body Heat. The film scenario was written by famous Raymond Chandler best known for his screenplays for The Big Sleep, Strangers on a Train, Murder, My Sweet and The Long Goodbye, which is incidentally a kind of remake of The Big Sleep.Chandler is in the film and has a cameo appearance and this is his only appearance on the big screen ever recorded. The film follows protagonist Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) who specializes in selling insurance and thus meets the fatal Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) who hints that he wants the death of his wife. Since Walter works in direct contact with the insurance they begin to forge a perfect plan, the plan flawlessly. In addition to these two actors phenomenal there is still a great Edward G. Robinson in the equally essential role. Double Indemnity is a film that you will see in a single breath, a film in which absolutely everything works perfectly without any slowdown and loss of pace, he's doing what the viewer rare that a film can - keeps it continually in suspense until this, fascinated and intoxicated by its quality keeps nailed with a chair experiencing an adventure for adventure. The film offers us to "enter into it," become part of the attending and feel just like the characters, as if somewhere next to them watching. Although starting Politics and operates retrospectively striking a note of some stuff he still works perfectly. About Noir elements do not need to waste words, because it is indeed a wonderful staff, impressive games of light and shadow and the characterization of the characters, which is one of the strongest assets of this epochal achievement. I think it is now almost impossible to make a movie like this or try remake same as it would not go near this quality. Almost dare to say that this film does not have a flaw and that is the definition of perfection. It is interesting that many actors refused the role of Walter, but many are also badly wanted to he went to MacMurray in whose place here do not even dare to imagine any other reason that is perfectly acted and did not know how not earned an Oscar nomination. The film was nominated for seven or Oscars and did not win a single which is considered one of the greatest injustices ever speaking of the Oscars. But later, Wilder received his Oscar for The Lost Weekend, which was even then earned four prestigious awards, which is justice, we can say, is met. Double Indemnity is mandatory reading for all film lovers to be as soon as possible to look if it has not already done so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Double Indemnity (1944) directed by Billy Wilder, is a noir film about murder and passion. The film is full of good acting and action sequences. The film is dark in tone and implores low key lighting. The characters are typical archetypes of noir films. The film's plot is interesting, but not surprising. The camera shots are superb and suck you into the film. There are many close up shots of the characters. The music fits well into the theme of the film, and the film has the signature Venetian lighting synonymous with noir films. The film is great, and is deserving of an 8 out of 10, since it helped the noir genre and was definitely an excellent example of such.</fullReview>

Stanwyck wants her husband out of the way so she can get his money. MacMurray wants the husband out of the way so he can get Stanwyck. They hatch a clever plot to get rid of the husband. Edward G. Robinson plays MacMurray's boss Barton Keyes. He is like a trained dog once he picks up a scent he will not give up until he finds the source.The story was paced just right and really allowed the tension to build and build. This movie is by far one of the movies I enjoyed watching the most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Double Indemnity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is considered by some the first film noir, it touches on all the key aspects that a film noir has, the alienated main character: Walter the normal insurance salesman, femme fatal: Phyllis the seductive but evil wife who is able to convince Walter to help her kill her husband, and redemption in the end. Along with these characteristics they way the movie is film, for example low key light that causes a lot of shadows and angular camera shots. Double Indemnity has a lot of great scenes that really tell you a lot about the characters with out having to say anything, and just let the way it is edited to give you the information. One scene that is a good example of this when Phyllis and Walter first meet, Phyllis is on a balcony looking out and the camera angle is low to high, because Walter is looking up at her. Having the camera angle from low to high gives us the impression that Phyllis is in powered and we are already clued in on who will be the dominant one in the duo. Another great example of this is the scene where Phyllis is driving her husband. We already know Walter is in the back seat waiting to murder her husband, and when he does start to strangle him the camera cuts away and shows us a close up of Phyllis instead. Her face has a shadow covering parts of it and she slowly begins to smirk. This shot is powerful and very telling on the kind of awful women Phyllis is. One last example of good editing in Double Indemnity is a scene towards the end, when Walter's boss begins to understand what he has been up to. His boss shows up at his apartment when Phyllis is there, so she ends up hiding behind his door and his boss is standing in the doorway. All that is separating the two from each other is the door, this causes a lot of tension and anxiety for the viewer. The shot is also very interesting in the fact that it has all three characters in this one frame, and it is a symbol for Walter's inner struggle, he literally has Phyllis on one side, and his boss and old life on the other. This movie is a suspenseful wonderfully film movie with really interesting editing, definitely one for film noir fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect example of a film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's "Double Indemnity" (1944) is dark and gripping; faultlessly summarizing what a classic film noir is expected to be. The chilling story is edgy, the continuously low-key lighting is suiting and the dialogue is full of witty double entendres. The plot is a little far-fetched, to be sure; but is appropriate to the mood and purpose of the film. The casting is admirable, as well. Barbara Stanwyck is perfect in her role as the femme fatale that the genre demands. The only drawback I really noticed was how unrealistic the plot can be? but I got over it when I realized there's really nothing to be done about that, seeing as it was adapted from a novella. It's a film noir, after all! Overall, worth taking the time to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epitome of Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into this film, I was not sure what to expect because of the seemingly cheesy idea of an insurance claim, greed, and lust all being combined together. It seemed like a crime plot, but it turned into an enjoyable guessing game of who will come out on top. Right from the start you know how it will end because Walter's tells you he got neither the money nor the girl, but the real fun of the film is in figuring out how it ends up being that way, because at some points he seems to be getting a clean break and then you remember how the film truly began. I definitely thought that Lola would have had a more prominent role, but she seemed almost like a distraction.Double Indemnity is the pure definition of a Noir film. Every element is artistically met and well executed. The crime that envelops a decent man and the femme fatale that leads him down a dark path, where ultimately he meets some sort of doom. In this case, it almost cost him is life, and definitely his freedom. The film was also submerged in several shadows, especially towards the end in the final scenes at Phyllis' house.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Murder is never perfect, no matter how calculated it is, and the insurance supervisor knows that the trolley won't stop for the wife and co-conspirator of a dead man until it reaches the cemetery. "Straight down the line", cool blonde Barbara Stanwyck and insurance salesman Fred MacMurray keep reminding each other, from the time they begin the plot over an accident policy which pays double on certain death claims. Stanwyck is a cool cat and her past here is explored just like some other great future screen sociopaths, Glenn Close in "Fatal Attraction" and Kathy Bates in "Misery", here revealed by the dead man's daughter (Heather Angel). The rather tacky blonde wig Stanwyck wears has been the subject of much ridicule (even worn by Steve Martin in the film noir spoof "Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid"), although it serves a certain purpose in establishing her character. MacMurray isn't some dumb sap naively pulled into her scheme. He's established as pretty amoral himself, making an obvious pass at her at the minute they meet. In one of his greatest performances, Edward G. Robinson is a brilliant super-sleuth, uncovering the truth with such calculating wit, his "little man" revealing to him everything he needs to figure out the truth, yet not at first aware of all of it, simply using his gut instinct to bit by bit figure out what's going on.MacMurray and Stanwyck, in the second of four appearances on film together, are a great team, delivering the dialog with fire and passion, eating each other alive as their scheme threatens to be revealed, yet not willing to call it quits. The "Suppose" dialog dominates their first meeting and it is just the beginning of a truly engrossing screenplay that is directed with perfection by Billy Wilder, a master at riveting his audiences with outstanding melodramas like this (and later "Sunset Boulevard"), as well as making them laugh hysterically with some of the greatest comedies of all time.One of the greatest mistakes of Oscar history was the ignoring of Fred MacMurray in the category of Best Actor, as well as a supporting nomination for Robinson, even though Barry Fitzgerald was nominated in both categories for the same film performance. Stanwyck certainly was worthy of the award, yet in the mid 1940's, voters were presumed to be scared of giving a film villainess (one of the deadliest) an Oscar. Stanwyck shares one scene with Robinson who would end up on crutches (like her husband here) when playing her husband a decade later in an entertaining western, "The Violent Men", where she is just as deadly as she is here. It should be noted that in the scenes where Stanwyck meets MacMurray in the grocery store, she still looks rather suspicious as she maneuvers around the same counters, and surprisingly didn't attract attention as a possible shop-lifter. It is also a shame that the original intended ending (with MacMurray heading to the gas chamber) ended up being eliminated from the final print.</fullReview>

Or better yet, don't trust a woman who wants to kill her husband! Our leading lady in question is a gorgeous black widow who uses our poor Neff to kill her husband and help her get away with it. In the end he is either dead or unconscious, completely worn from his struggle with her. Throughout the story you will be internally screaming "NO NO WHAT ARE YOU DOING" You feel for Keyes as he tries to uncover the mystery that surrounds the woman. The moral of the story is: Women who want to kill their husbands are not to be trusted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Double Winner!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Double Indemnity is a Noir classic and for all I can say it is a riveting watch even today. With it's rotten characters and unconventional twists this movie takes you into darkness. It makes you an accomplice in their crime and not for one moment you seem to recognize the darkness within. It lays the foundation of deceptive dark tales Hollywood have so long since exploited. Blurring the lines between a protagonist and an antagonist it makes even the most abominable character look sympathetic. In most movies the monologues do nothing more than be an ambitious approach to character exposition but here it's so finely intertwined in the narrative that it takes you closer to the motives and lets you see through the crime itself. Double indemnity succeeds not just as an entertaining thriller but also as a character driven drama. Why do I call it a character driven drama? Because it has such a fine story line between Keyes and Neff, Neff would do anything to save his neck but ultimately confides to his one true friend. Characters and their motives are so finely laid out, every step they take no matter how dark it may me has a well laid out motive to it, you really wonder if it could have been any other away at all.Another appealing aspect of the story was it's dialogs. Slick, smart and brilliant. They were wonderful to hear and equally revealing. Such wonderful dialogs combined with Noir cinematography and Mr. Wilders prolific direction makes Double Indemnity a double winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lust &amp; Insurance Scams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder gave away the climax to his movies more than most directors. All it took was 2 or 3 minutes of Sunset Boulevard and Double Indemnity to know where the movies were going. Double Indemnity starts off with scummy insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) racing to his office with a gunshot wound. Rather than leave town or get medical treatment, he is compelled to confess his crimes. Then we see why somebody would shoot this rather dull fellow. This framing device wasn't as common in 1944 as it is now, so kudos to Wilder for making it work so well.Maybe Neff doesn't just blow town because he's in love with his semi-genius co-worker Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) and needs closure on that relationship. Okay, they're not in love sexually, but this is one of hundreds of great movies that---if you think about it---feature a bromance that overshadows any man/woman attachments. As outstanding as the outstanding Barbara Stanwyck is as the fatal femme fatale, the real story is the strong friendship betwixt Neff and Keyes.Wilder's story (co-written with Raymond Chandler, adapted from James Cain's novella) is luridly delicious. Neff meets married Phyllis Dietrichson (Stanwyck) on a visit to renew her husband's insurance policy. They decide to make sure her hubbie has an "accident" so they can make off with a big payday. Keyes, however, is smarter than the gullible cops and he won't let the case go. He doesn't KNOW that Mr. Dietrichson was murdered, but he's going to figure it out. Meanwhile, Walter and Phyllis don't trust each other.The American Film Institute loves Double Indemnity almost as much as I do, proving that by ranking it 38th in 1998 and then 29th in 2007 on their Top 100 lists. Not bad for "The Insurance Movie"! The AFI appreciates it as a thriller and as a love story too, even if it's hard to believe that Walter and Phyllis ever had any real feelings for one another. She's rotten to the core and he's too horny to notice until it's too late. It's pulp and it certainly isn't the most uplifting movie made during WWII, but I smile just thinking about how bad these people are.If you dug this snapshot review, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the "Podcasts" section for our 36-minute Double Indemnity 'cast...and many others.

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder directed this early film noir that stars Fred MacMurray as insurance salesman Walter Neff, who one day meets the wife of one of his clients, a Mr. Dietrichson. His wife Phyllis(played by Barbara Stanwyck) is a devious woman who convinces Walter to join her in a plot to kill her husband for the insurance money. Walter has the idea of making it a double indemnity policy which will pay out twice the amount for accidental death. After they arrange his murder, Insurance investigator Barton Keyes(played by Edward G. Robinson) becomes suspicious of Phyllis, and thinks she arranged the death with another man, not knowing it is his friend Walter... Well directed and written mystery with Robinson stealing the picture with his crafty performance(an early version of "Columbo") Indeed, his is the only character you can root for...the lead characters get what they deserve!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dripping blood in 1938 Los Angeles, unmarried 35-year-old insurance salesman Fred MacMurray (as Walter Neff) arrives at work in the dead of night. Struggling to light a cigarette, he records his confession to a murder. You should know, however, he may not be entirely responsible for the death in question. In flashback, we learn the details? Arriving to renew a client's automobile insurance, Mr. MacMurray meets sexy blonde Barbara Stanwyck (as Phyllis Dietrichson), wrapped in a towel. After getting dressed, Ms. Stanwyck discusses her absent husband's lapsed car insurance with MacMurray. Making sure he gets a good look at her shapely legs, Stanwyck proposes MacMurray sell her husband some life insurance...When their mutual attraction takes over, MacMurray and Stanwyck contemplate crime. And, if they can make it look accidental, "Double Indemnity" applies - this would mean $100,000 for the lovers. Although we know something about where all this leads from the opening, this film is full of surprises..."Double Indemnity" is brilliantly directed by Billy Wilder, who earned two of the film's seven "Oscar" nominations (having shared co-writing credit with Raymond Chandler). Photographer John Seitz and Stanwyck were also among the award-worthy. Oddly, MacMurray was not included; however, this was his best acting performance to date and he is unquestionably the leading player. MacMurray did poll at #3 in the annual "New York Film Critics" poll, relatively besting both Stanwyck (#5) and Wilder (#8) in their respective categories. Also noteworthy is notoriously nasty leading man Edward G. Robinson (as Barton Keyes), perversely playing a conscientious supporting character with a "little man" in his heart.********** Double Indemnity (4/24/44) Billy Wilder ~ Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G.

		<shortDescription>The Quintessential Film-Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Establishing the genre of film-noir in cinema, catapulting Billy Wilder into the big leagues of Hollywood filmmakers &amp; expertly sustaining its foreboding ambiance throughout its runtime, Double Indemnity is one of the brightest works of Wilder's career which, in spite of revealing its finale to the viewers in its opening moments, manages to carve out its own moments of suspense.Based on James M. Cain's 1943 novella of the same name, Double Indemnity tells the story of an experienced insurance salesman who starts an affair with the seductive wife of one of his clients &amp; devises a scheme to murder his client in a manner that invokes the double indemnity clause of his insurance plan. Trouble begins when his boss begins to suspect a foul play in the cleverly-executed accident.Co-written &amp; directed by Billy Wilder, Double Indemnity is the first masterpiece of his career &amp; marks the beginning of a legendary filmmaking journey that would later go down as one of cinema's finest. The film opens with what's supposed to be its closing moment &amp; is then narrated by our protagonist, eventually coming full circle over the course of its runtime. And Raymond Chandler's contribution to the script cannot be understated.While the story alone lays down the groundwork for what a film-noir is supposed to be like, the technical aspects still introduce a number of innovations that would later be associated with this particular genre only. Cinematography makes terrific use of light &amp; camera, Editing skilfully paces the whole plot throughout its 107 minutes of runtime &amp; never lets the mystery fizzle out while the background score continues to elevate the suspenseful moments.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck &amp; Edward G. Robinson, all of whom chip in with sensational performances. MacMurray plays Walter Neff; the insurance salesman, &amp; is quite convincing in the given role, Stanwyck plays the femme-fatale Phyllis Dietrichson amazingly well too but for me, it's Robinson who really steals the show as Neff's boss Barton Keyes and moments between him n MacMurray are easily my favourites.On an overall scale, even though Wilder followed Double Indemnity with many more quality films, it still ranks amongst the most memorable &amp; top-rated works of his illustrious career. Influential &amp; unforgettable for its contribution to cinema, still hailed by many film lovers as the quintessential film-noir and effortlessly sustaining its thrills &amp; nail-biting tension despite giving away the ending within the first few minutes, Double Indemnity is a brilliantly plotted, superbly executed &amp; cleverly narrated cinema that comes strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loss of morality destroys everything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Double Indemnity is about the idea that the loss of morality destroys everything. It demonstrates this idea by a man who gets on the slippery slope of adultery that ends with a double murder. In the process, he loses his career, friend, a woman who really loved him and ultimately his life.The main plot of the story is the external one: to get away with the perfect murder in order to be with the woman he loves. This plot ends in failure. Suspicion ruins his love and he commits another murder to hide the first. His suspicion is proved to be misplaced as his lover refuses to kill him before he kills her. In the end, he is caught, confesses and dies from his wounds.But we already knew that he doesn't get away since the movie starts with his confession and the whole thing takes place in a flashback that catches up to the present.If the movie ended where it began, it would have been a simple morality play about how the slippery slope of the loss of morality (that started with some innocent flirting) can quickly spiral out of control and take everything with it. But our hero chooses to redeem himself at the end. He realizes he has lost everything and chooses to confess. He also choose to put two young lovers who have broken up because of mutual distrust back on track to be reunited. This minor plot line of Lola and her boyfriend's love is crucial to the hero's redemption.Double Indemnity is a very tight story. Each character plays roles on multiple plot lines and each scene provides turning points of expanding stakes and meaning. It absolutely proves the idea that even a small loss of morality will lead to the ultimate destruction.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only those who understand the core beauty of film noir can appreciate what a fine masterpiece "Double Indemnity" is. I'm glad I'm one of those who appreciate that beauty. There are few movies or works of art that I consider greater than this film.There are facets of this movie that I find difficult to explain, though.The first is the terrible murder plot, and what role it plays in the emotion stirred by this film. Do we humans have a heinous dark side aroused by the very idea of cold blooded murder? I don't think so (at least not most of us). My best explanation is the huge contrast we see transpire in Walter Neff as he crosses from normal caring insurance man into killer under the influence of Phyllis Dietrichson. Although rare, this is something we know can exist in reality in everyday life in some human beings. The rare chance to watch that metamorphosis occur in a normal real-life setting provides a morbid fascination to us. Billy Wilder depicts it masterfully on screen, but it seems that a powerful and fascinating story is truly an important element for a great film, even for film noir, even for a genius director.Another facet that I find difficult to explain is the casting and sets. Obviously the choice of actors was a significant element in this film's success, as was their appearance (such as Stanwyck's blonde wig), and the scene settings. The appearance and settings, of course, were by Billy Wilder's design, but whether the actual casting was more accident than design is something I often wonder about. Fate has often played an important role in many of our classics. Regarding visual effects, film experts point out Wilder's use of venetian blind wall shadows, which add greatly to the noir realism. Another visual effect might be the tall ceilings in the home and offices. I'm not much in psychology, but I sometimes wonder if this doesn't give the Dietrichson home a castle-like impression of wealth, another contrast effect. We all know it's much more shocking when people of wealth and influence commit crimes than when average Joe's like me do. The tall ceilings in the Pacific All Risk offices make me think of old buildings, and in my amateur analysis I wonder if this doesn't add a nostalgic appeal to the film today. But maybe I'm wrong. Some of the office building scenes are actually quite modern.Finally, I must mention that New York Times' Bosley Crowther was one of the few critics to give Double Indemnity a negative review in 1944. Two years later Crowther gave the film "The Postman Always Rings Twice", a good review. Postman is a fine film, but it doesn't hold a candle to Double Indemnity; just further proof of my claim that Crowther wasn't much of a critic. Some people wouldn't know a good movie if it fell on them.</fullReview>

Back in the day writers were so focused on great plot twists. This film has all that and more. It packs a great punch. Recommended to all film buffs.

		<fullReview>If I were to describe 'Double Indemnity' it would be how the over-romanticization of love can pervert one's sense of morality. It's the blind purpose of alienating other people just for the sake of sacrificing for one person. Manipulation, lust, ignorance. 'Double Indemnity' is all these things that play a part in blindly "falling in love" with someone, without knowing that person is acting purely on lustful desires. Once the movie begins and we are introduced to our main character, we are already aware things have taken a bad turn, but we just don't know how bad. All we know is that things are not looking good as our character is about to begin his confession.We cannot help, but feel pity for Neff, but I think we can all agree that this was a lot of stupidity on his part for not using his brain to investigate things further before he went in too deep. This is an engrossing story and as the story unfolds, many layers of the mystery begin to peel off, unveiling one shocking revelation after the next. With each twist and turn, we can feel our insides twisting more and more as the big picture starts to show revealing the disturbing truth.This has everything I love about the film noir genre. From the witty dialogue delivered to its dark tone, its just all in all, a well thought out plot that is bound to cast a spell on its viewer and hold her or his attention until the end. It did for me, and I'll never forget the impact of its story.</fullReview>

This film actually seemed based off of real life events. But to be more specific, it actually was based off of a real life scandal between two people who had an affair. Which made it even more interesting to watch. The whole movie was a filmnoir. Which is my favorite. So this film had a lot of very low lights when needed and very dark, long shadows where they were supposed to be. It was a film that was put together in a great way. And to think this all happened at a local insurance office. Just imagine what could happen anywhere else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Romance, affairs, money, and murder; three words that perfectly grasp this film's plot. The film's title when coupled with the proactive cover art, is perhaps what draws many viewers in. The film's title come from the term that is widely used in life-insurance policies to state that, due to an accident death, the company must pay the policy holder's beneficiary double the original amount. Viewers watch as an unsuspecting insurance salesman, Walter Neff (played by Fred MacMurray), is drawn into a murder scheme by a flirty (a dirty!) wife, Phyllis Dietrichson (played by Barbara Stanwyck). The already corrupt insurance industry is suddenly thrown into murder mystery that is driven by Phyllis' provocative mannerisms, desire wealth, a cold-heartedness. Even though this film was released with high hopes from critics, I suppose there is a reason the film never won any Academy Awards! Personally, I enjoyed the film, for it captivated me in a weird sense, but I can see how the distinct dialogue and chilling plot would turn some viewers away from this classic!</fullReview>

Dietrichson is the ultimate femme fatale, and she keeps Walter under her spell with a bat of the eye. The tension between the two of them is almost palpable and really well done. The beginning of the film is great though, usually you have to wait till the end to figure out whodunit. The beginning leaves you wanting more and it pushes you through right to the end. The plot gets a little complicated but its worth it as its one of the darkest films I have ever seen. But as with all noir films in the end everyone receives their just deserts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really love Film Noir. I love that it keeps you guessing the whole way through, right up until the very end. The dark shadows, the interesting storyline, the dark mysterious characters, and everything else! I just love them! I think that this movie had everything a film noir should. I was hooked from the very beginning! The beginning was just so shocking and I stayed shocked until the very end. In this movie, Barbara Stanwyck played the perfect femme fatale! I thought she did so well in the movie, her acting was amazing. I would recommend this movie to almost anyone who likes to be shocked from beginning to end!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder, deceit, and femme fatale in a Wilder classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Double Indemnity is a film noir released in 1944 and directed by Billy Wilder. Starring Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck, the film opens with insurance salesman Walter Neff (MacMurray) confessing into a Dictaphone his involvement in the murder of Phyllis Dietrchson's husband; Stanwyck portrays Phyllis ? the femme fatale in the movie. Neff then becomes the voice-over narrator as the story flashes back to Walter and Phyllis first meeting. Phyllis is unhappy in her marriage, and while flirting with Walter, persuades Neff to write a life insurance policy covering her husband, and then helping her plot his death. Neff is a bachelor, and is captivated by the opportunity to be with the alluring Phyllis. With his experience, Neff believes he can plot the perfect murder, so that the investigations by the police and his insurance company will all lead to the same conclusion ? accidental death.The character of Neff is bored with his life, and sees the insurance scam as a method to win the love of a beautiful woman and become wealthy. The antagonist in the story is Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) who portrays a stubborn, persistent claims adjuster who refuses to accept the accidental death claim, and eventually senses a murder has occurred. Initially Neff is confident in thinking he can outsmart everyone and succeed in the plot, but as the movie progresses, his character becomes less assured and paranoid, ultimately leading to his demise and confession.The movie has a run time of 107 minutes, and one should pay close attention to the cinematography and use of shadowing throughout the film. Neff's character is often in low-key lighting as compared with the other characters in the same scenes. Wilder uses this method to enhance the imagery in this classic film of murder and deceit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Mainstream Hollywood Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Double Indemnity is a film noir, directed by Billy Wilder, co-written by Wilder and Raymond Chandler, and produced by Buddy DeSylva and Joseph Sistrom. The script was based on James M. Cain's 1935 novella of the same title which originally appeared as an eight-part serial in Liberty magazine.The film stars Fred MacMurray as an insurance salesman, Barbara Stanwyck as a provocative housewife who wishes her husband were dead, and Edward G. Robinson as a claims adjuster whose job is to find phony claims. The term double indemnity refers to a clause in certain life insurance policies that doubles the payout in cases when death is caused by accidental means.Double Indemnity represents the high-water mark of 1940s film noir urban crime dramas in which a greedy, weak man is seduced and trapped by a cold, evil woman amidst the dark shadows and Expressionist lighting of modern cities. Phyllis Dietrichson seduces insurance agent Walter Neff into murdering her husband to collect his accident policy. The murder goes as planned, but after the couple's passion cools, each becomes suspicious of the other's motives. The plan is further complicated when Neff's boss Barton Keyes, a brilliant insurance investigator, takes over the investigation. Told in flashbacks from Neff's perspective, the film moves with ruthless determinism as each character meets what seems to be a preordained fate. Movie veterans Stanwyck, MacMurray, and Robinson give some of their best performances, and Wilder's cynical sensibility finds a perfect match in the story's unsentimental perspective, heightened by John Seitz's hard- edged cinematography.Also,the film is a brilliant collision of evil and the mundane, and one of the reasons viewers respond to it so well is that it makes the mundane seem a little sexier in the resulting debris.Double Indemnity ranks with the classics of mainstream Hollywood movie-making as it was characterized by dark, dialogue-heavy classic of grim suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's gotta be perfect; straight down the line."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film noir is often both mystery and tragedy intertwined as a single genre. It was a one of a kind film experience, one that has remained an undeniable classic for some time. Though elements of film noir have been duplicated from time to time in modern films, such as Sin City and the animated film Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, the original films are simply a band apart. Film noir most specifically represented a time of change in American history. At a time when World War II was awakening people to the horrors men were capable of, and the perfect picture was that of that of the suburban family, film noir was almost a shadow cast by those things. The genre was an exposure of the blackness of the human soul. Housewives and insurance salesman, ordinary people that committed heinous crimes for the hunger of sex and money, not uncommonly both. Not to mention due to the censorship code being in full effect, the writers and filmmakers had to be subtle about their subject, and what it lead to was sharp characterization that didn't use just words. All of these aspects come together to form the mise en scene of Double Indemnity.Consider the cast: Fred MacMurray as Walter Neff was a promising choice from the start. After all, prior to this role MacMurray had done light-hearted comedies, and the same went for after the role. The character of Walter Neff was obviously a lot darker than anything he'd portrayed before in his career, and to audiences it must of seemed very cold and unfamiliar to see him play the part as well as he did. The audience first meets MacMurray's character Neff as a confident and cool salesman, completely in control of his little world, till that is he meets the character of Phyllis Dietrichson, played by the luscious Barbara Stanwyck.Stanwyck is the temptress, a model example of the film noir femme fatale. Of course one of the fundamental key components of the film is the relationship between Stanwyck's character and MacMurray's. Right when they first meet, a low angle shot reveals to him a smooth-skinned angel, eyes glistening and all. We see him on the other hand from a low angle, before anyone even realizing that the cinematography is establishing the nature of their relations. The femme fatale was many things, a seductress, a siren, but to be more exact one might say bluntly a wolf in sheep's clothing.Edward G. Robinson is more of a character actor this time around, playing Robert Keyes. He is not only a friend of Neff, but he is the incorruptible 'detective' of the film. Even though he's just a claims man, it is made evidently clear he's somewhat of a protagonist. I use the word somewhat because throughout the film he inadvertently puts heat on MacMurray, saying "A claims man is a surgeon. That desk is an operating table, and the pencils are scalpels and bone chisels". It is subtly symbolized that the occupation is a breeding ground of human treachery, for when Keyes refers to the claims themselves that he receives every day, he remarks "they're packed with drama; with twisted hopes and crooked dreams." Another powerful film noir component is the nature of the story. While ach one obviously varies, at the root of all film noir is the temptation of money and so-called love, full of people who will literally kill for those things. The nature of the screenplay captures the dark side of the human nature perfectly. Notice how Barbara Stanwyck creates the mood of vulnerability, using it to deceive Walter. He at first seems to be weary, but he shot of their first kiss already sets up his inability to resist. The low key lighting helps to enhance this dark mood. Foolish Walter eventually does take the vile deed upon himself to orchestrate, and composer Miklós Rózsa adds a dark cue as he takes on the sinful task.The consistent hard lightning returns as Neff walks down the street, and tells the audience "It was the walk of a dead man." The film opens up with his character confessing, so already it is known who has committed the crime, and yet as the climax draws closer more and more of the plan begins to fall thru, and one can feel a sense of disaster ahead.A combination of hard and low-key lightning adds greatly to the film, all of it used to heighten the character's emotions. Coupled with MacMurray's cynical narration, the effect is quite devastating. Remember the brightly lit outdoors of the peaceful suburb neighborhood in the opening scenes, where we even see innocent children running and playing. Once Walter enters the house, however, he finds himself in a gloomy otherworld, one from which he will not be able to escape. The ever present Venetians blinds cast prison bars on Walter in many scenes. This fusion of lightning and subtle symmetry set up the doomed aura surrounding Walter.Note the tight framing at first with the two 'lovers', but by half-way thru the film much looser framing is used as the two's trust diminishes with every exposed lie. It is in their final moments together the spacing becomes tighter for one last moment of intimacy. The final scene between the two is both a landmark for its music, or lack there of, and its visuals. There in that near blackness we see the glimmer of a gun. When the music stops as the curtains are shut, the only source of light in the room now gone, we hear the crack of the first gun shot.Double Indemnity is a classic by all means, the genesis of film noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie! Classic Film Noir!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first became interested in the film noir genre after seeing the 1958 film, "King Creole", starring Elvis Presley, Walter Matthau, Carolyn Jones, Dean Jagger and Delores Hart. It was directed by Michael Curtiz of "Casablanca" fame.I've watched "King Creole" many times over the years and count it among my favorite films, it's certainly my favorite Elvis movie and as I understand it, it was also Elvis' favorite film of all the ones he made. I can't watch a film noir without giving credit to the movie which first interested me in the genre to begin with, "King Creole".Because I like "King Creole" so much, I decided I'd like to see some other films in the same noir genre, so after I discovered "Double Indemnity" was available instant stream on Netflix, I thought I'd give it a go and I'm glad I did! I can clearly understand why so many people consider this movie a classic. It is! Don't let the fact the film was made in 1944 fool you. It's not "too old" to watch...not by a long shot. In fact, I found the movie more suspenseful and entertaining than just about everything that's being released nowadays.The actors turn in great performances, particularly Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck. The story is great, but how it's told is even better...in true to form noir styling. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie and if you give it a chance, I think you'll like it, too! Like I said before, don't let the age of the movie fool you...It still packs plenty of punch! I hold no reservations in recommending this movie. Check it out, I think you'll be glad you did!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well executed film noir, courtesy of Billy Wilder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Double Indemnity" is today regarded as one of the paramount examples of film noir. The movie's source was the short novel of the same name by renowned crime author James M. Cain. In it, a dissatisfied wife schemes with an insurance salesman to murder her husband and split the proceeds. However, the crime that seemed perfect in the planning stages ends up imperfect in the execution.The stars of the film give it most of its flavour. Fred MacMurray contributed a suitably cynical performance in the male lead while Barbara Stanwyck smolders as the film's requisite femme fatale. Though Stanwyck nabbed the film's only Oscar nomination in the acting categories I think that third-billed Edward G. Robinson actually delivered the film's best performance. In any case, the acting is in good hands with these three individuals on board.Fortunately for them, they were working from a crackerjack script by Billy Wilder &amp; Raymond Chandler. While some of the dialogue struck me as hard-boiled to the point of caricature I think that these guys did a good job of translating Cain's novel to the screen. They may have had to lose a bit of Cain's intricate plotting but they made up for it by adding some interesting touches of their own.Two of the film's key Oscar nominations resulted from Billy Wilder's direction and the moody cinematography of John Seitz. The cinematography in particular would be much imitated in later films. The score by Miklós Rózsa was also Oscar-nominated, though I didn't find it as impressive as the visuals.In the end, "Double Indemnity" is a fine film though I can't help but think that it's a little over-rated. The way it's venerated by critics you'd think that Wilder &amp; company invented film noir out of whole cloth. There were indeed precedents, though this film perhaps proved to be the most influential in the end. By all means, see the movie but don't expect something that's on quite the same level as Wilder's masterpieces "Sunset Blvd." &amp; "Some Like it Hot".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, it's hard to know what to say about this film. It's been copied relentlessly, but it's hardly any less powerful for it. Like all the best Hollywood movies of this period, it goes down like milk and whiskey, sweet and smooth, deceptively intoxicating.The dialogue sparkles but never too much. The camera work and direction is flawless without ever once drawing attention away from the characters. Don't expect Hitchcockian symbolism or hints at fathomless intellectual depths, but the darkness that inhabits the characters is depicted in a few remarkably imaginative, yet vivid and immediate (stomach-turning, even) moments stomach-turning moments.Wilder, his crew and the script-writers don't so much capture the enduring essence of Noir, as define it with unparalleled clarity. You are vicariously experiencing the greed, the violence, and ultimately the self-inflicted, self-gratifying terror and shame. In this version of Noir, it's a temporary state of mind, but the consequences are permanent and inescapable. Yet this is no 'crime-doesn't pay' morality tale'. The morality is so twisted by the end that it may not be immediately apparent to a modern viewer just how far gone the characters are. Tally up the moral score at a later date and you might be shocked just how dark a vision of humanity Hollywood was selling. There's no doubt in my mind that this echoed with a public that had been repeatedly shocked by war, degraded and desensitized. Having said that, there seems to be a small distinction drawn between crime of passion and cold blooded murder.If there is a problem for the modern viewer it's probably that it's not all that easy to take George MacMurray seriously, but you probably will by the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Double-Crossing the Double-Crosser in Double Indemnity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film-noir went through its greatest blossoms in the late 1940's but already during the years of World War II it crystallized to its final dynamic form -- and this finest form of film-noir is represented by Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity (1944). In the film, the dark variant found its true form: people were dissatisfied and unheroic. Double Indemnity, and just almost every noir after it, was characterized by sadistic and brutal cultural behavior or; the complete lack of behavior. In this interpretation a clear difference was made to more romantic noirs, such as Howard Hawks' The Big Sleep (1946). The genre is both unlimited and connected; it is hard to draw the line between dark films and films that are "film-noir" but crime is a thing that unites them all -- it is a necessity of some kind -- it is a prism through which we can observe life as it is, ahead of all the illusions.Double Indemnity starts with a wounded insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) walking up to his partner Barton Keys' (Edward G. Robinson) office. He has got a confession to make: we enter a flashback which equals most of the film. He was seduced by a beautiful woman into cheating his insurance company in order to get a double indemnity for the woman's husband's death. But soon their love turned into hatred. Film-noir can mean an attitude, series of films, sub-genre or a mode, and just like other genres -- western and gangster-film for instance -- it uses the same milieus over and over again: night clubs, hotel rooms, apartments, police stations, offices, docks, run-down and luxury restaurants, rural houses that are about to collapse, boxing rings and railway stations. In a typical film-noir story there is a desperate man who gets seduced by a dangerous woman. But in Double Indemnity there is also another reason for the protagonist's action: the temptation to try one's luck, to try if you could succeed in a perfect crime which is probably the reason why Alfred Hitchcock loved the film so much.The directors who created film-noir came from Europe. In M (1931) Fritz Lang developed the atmosphere for film-noir with its strong contrasts and expressionistic imagery. Since the people who created the genre were from Europe, the influences obviously came from their colony: French pessimism (Duvivier), German expressionism and European surrealism. To this colorful group the director of Double Indemnity Billy Wilder also belongs to. He came to Hollywood from Austria-Hungary also in the 1930's. These filmmakers were creating a world where the latitude of man was limited; the chance of individual freedom was impossible and unreachable. The best cinematographers achieved to combine expressionism with realism, in this limited milieu, to light actual sites by aesthetic styling.Fatality, guile and cheating were always part of the thematics of film-noir and in Double Indemnity nothing is what it first appears to be and each first impression bluffs: Keys' ex-girlfriend who he was going to marry turned out to be manic depressive and Phyllis first seemed to be truly worried for her husband. Then Phyllis and Walter cheated Mr. Dietrichson into signing the life insurance but Phyllis was actually cheating Walter all along. Their love had now turned into hatred. After the picture started to get clearer for Walter, he decided to double-cross Phyllis but what he didn't guess was that Phyllis knew that he knew that she was a double-crosser. They both tried to cheat each other but neither succeed in it. The whole world double-crosses and acts.The aesthetics of film-noir is often tied around big cities like New York and Los Angeles, and its visual world has its own icons too: dark and narrow alleys, rainy streets, wet and moist surfaces, images of water, mirrors, shiny steel, the dim lighting of the milieus. And through visual aesthetics and first-person narrative Double Indemnity reached poetry of summer nights: the Californian hills and mountains, strolling roads, old chateaus, dusty and rainy suburban blocks.The "poetic-like" first-person narrative and flashbacks are also a big part of film-noir. Especially after Double Indemnity which, as said, was the culmination of the genre's dynamic form. Through Walter's monologue, his confession, the story gets a deterministic twist: like it was all fate, and everything we observe are constantly related to Walter's subjective truth. For its time the story is set in the year 1938 -- just like the original novel by James M. Cain -- loose from the year 1944 and WWII, to the age of recession; to its psychology and financial awareness. It gives an inner explanation why Walter is desperate and does what he does.The confessions of a murderer waiting for his death, relay a picture of life as lead by fate or chance to judgment. Only when Walter has to face death he is ready to confess, and sees life as it is -- just like Camus' Mersault. As mentioned, through this the film gets a deterministic twist, but the ending also indicates to Hollywood's censorship: crime must always have its punishment. But this juvenile message is relayed to us ironically: the violators of law and morality have to redeem their sins, in the double-crossing world.Billy Wilder always liked to criticize just about everything, from communism to capitalism, and from militarism to pacifism. Just like Some Like It Hot (1958) so does Double Indemnity brush the subject of the American dream. But unlike in Some Like It Hot, it's not about the different versions of the dream and the mad profusion of it but about its true naivety. In Double Indemnity the American dream is seen as a juvenile way to get satisfaction, at any price. If the film is for its themes purely about Americanism, guile, existence, anxiety and the double-crossing world, its thesis is this: when fear enters the game, love suddenly turns into hatred.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Double good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neff (Fred MacMurray) and Mrs Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) devise a plot to murder Mr Dietrichson (Tom Powers) and pocket the life accident insurance money using a double indemnity claim, ie, the type of accident will pay out double as it is so unlikely. Things go smoothly until Walter's boss at the insurance company, Keyes (Edward G Robinson), gets involved and follows his hunch concerning foul play.The main bulk of the story is told in flashback. There is tension, suspense, a good cast and many good scenes. A particular favourite of mine is when Neff is relaxing in his car drinking a pint of beer at the wheel - those were the days! The cast are good with Edward G Robinson and Barbara Stanwyck stealing the show. Stanwyck plays deception very well, eg, the scene where she is called to an interview after the death of her husband and more than holds her own when challenged about the circumstances. She also has a few things up her sleeve including a twist at the end. MacMurray is good in the lead role - it's a shame he was given some daft dialogue, though, which is surprising given that Billy Wilder did the writing. His use of the word "baby" at the end of almost every thing he says to Stanwyck is extremely cheesy. Maybe this was "hep" talk in those days but today it sounds crass and is laughable.The film is a good length with twists that reveal themselves gradually throughout the film right until the end.</fullReview>

She offers him a proposal that would ruined his life.OK, this is a big classic, and i see why is so respected. It's entertaining, got lots of classic lines and the first class direction. Barbara Stanwick is not the best femme fatale ever, she is kind of sexy but she looks sometimes ugly in this movie. Don't ask me, i don't know why. Fred MacMurray is, instead, incredibly handsome here, and the routine of the though guy is good. But Edward G. Robinson steals the show. I usually don't like Robinson atypical face (perfect for villain character), but here, he is the character you most will remember. Of course, all actors are good, but i debt too to Wilder's direction.So, it's not the best noir ever, but its definitely a great motion picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For many people this is the ultimate film Noir,it is certainly one of the greatest thrillers ever made.It's based on the novel by James M.Cain, directed by Billy Wilder and all the ingredients for a successful Noir are present,a beautiful and deadly Femme Fatale,shadows,murder and a doomed love affair that can only end in tears.Several actors including George Raft were considered for the lead role which eventually went to Fred MacMurray,an actor who usually played all round nice guys,the change resulted in one of the best performances of his career.Los Angeles,July 16th 1938, injured Insurance man Walter Neff(Fred MacMurray)records a memo for his close friend and fellow Insurance man, Claims Manager Barton Keyes(Edward G.Robinson)confessing to a murder.In flashback we learn his story several months earlier he drove out to the mansion of Mr and Mrs Dietrichson to renew their Insurance policy on the car.He meets the wife Phyllis(Barbara Stanwyck)every inch the seductress who convinces him to get her husband Accident Insurance Policy and help her kill him so they can collect the cash.Neff strangles him to the delight of an obviously aroused Phyllis and they drop his body on the tracks,with Phyllis claiming he fell off the train.Everyone except the persistent Keyes buys the story and Keyes becomes convinced that Phyllis murdered her husband with the help of another man.Yet his blind devotion to Neff,leads him to overlook what is staring him right in the face.It all leads to a shootout and a confession of love between a heartbroken Keyes and Neff.The three leads especially Robinson are excellent and in Neff we have one of the genres most pitiable victims of the most iconic Femme Fatale Phyllis,eating himself up with fear and disgust knowing it's all going to end badly yet not having the strength to get away from her.Wilder did film a much grimmer ending with a heartbroken Keyes watching Neff die in the Gas chamber but decided the ending at the Insurance company was more fitting and that was a good call on his part.Impressive and stylish with a gripping and unforgettable story of murder,love and deception Double Indemnity is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best noirs of the Golden Era of Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Satyajit Ray in his Oscar Acceptance Speech mentioned about Double Indemnity and how he was impressed with the movie which made him write a letter to Billy Wilder but he did not reply back because Ray was a nobody then. Ray has mentioned somewhere that American directors have had a huge influence on him especially John Ford and Billy Wilder. I bet Double Indemnity is a huge part of that inspiration. Double Indemnity is one of the best noirs I have ever seen. It is almost a perfect movie - Technically brilliant having a great director and supported by a great cast. The movie name refers to a double indemnity clause that comes with accident insurance policies where the insurance company has to pay double the amount to the customer in case of an accidental death. I guess the plot is clear now. The movie consists of love, betrayal, murder, suspense and above all insurance. The movie never looses it's grip over the viewer since it is a constant cat and mouse game shifting from one spectrum to another instantly. On the acting front, Fred MacMurray plays the smooth talking insurance salesman perfectly. I wonder why he did not got the fame his other contemporaries got. He had a great screen presence and was a fine actor. Barbara Stanwyck plays the manipulative, gold-digging seductress perfectly. She stole the show for me. A special mention to Edward G. Robinson who in my opinion is one of the most under-rated actors of the golden era just because he played supporting roles more often. When he is in the frame, he manages to steal the show most often than not - He did it in 'Key Largo' stealing the show from Bogart, he does the same here. Overall, a must watch movie for noir fans of the golden age of Hollywood.Rating : 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Murders don't come any neater"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the dawn of the studio era, there had always been producer-directors ? accomplished filmmakers adept at handling both the creative and business end of things. Extremely rare in those days was the writer-director, but in the early 1940s a handful of them started to emerge. Orson Welles, Preston Sturges, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and Billy Wilder, writer-director of Double Indemnity.Of course, Wilder didn't write alone, but then few writers did anyway. Double Indemnity is co-scripted with novelist Raymond Chandler. However, while Chandler may have had the gift for prose I feel Wilder in particular helped to bring a new understanding of how writing could work for the screen. Instrumental here is the use of voice-over narration. Rather than burden the picture with too many words or spoon-feed plot points to the audience, it actually smooths over a lot of bumps in the narrative which would otherwise have to be done with potentially awkward dialogue. For example, two characters are introduced with the words "On the piano were pictures of Dietrichson and Lola, his daughter from his first marriage". A simple, effective and unobtrusive bit of exposition. Having to shoehorn that piece of information into a conversation between two characters would be clunky to say the least.This fills an important gap in cinematic technique that had been looming since the end of the silent era. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but sometimes the reverse is true. In a silent movie you could throw in a title card saying something like "This is Nathan Butts, owner of the second-largest shipping company in Massachusetts", followed by a shot of Mr Butts in person. Come the talkies, you could still have the shot but had to get the accompanying information across in other ways. This isn't to say the voice-over narration is the only way, or that it is always the more effective ? even in the earliest sound features there was some great use of inventive dialogue and visual cues ? but it is certainly an important string in any screenwriter's bow.However Double Indemnity is not merely a deluge of word-based exposition. There is plenty going on here visually, and I'm not just talking about that eerie cinematography, wonderful though it is. Wilder may have been relatively new to the job but he was already shaping up to be a fine director. He's not afraid to keep the camera on one character while another is speaking, focusing us on reactions and motivations. A great example is the long-drawn out close-up of Barbara Stanwyck while her husband is murdered in the seat beside her. He also places things in the frame that look incidental but are no doubt deliberate, and seem to be speaking out to us. In the first supermarket meet-up, look at how prominent he makes those tins of baby food, with the child's eyes looking innocently out over the scene. Juxtaposed with a frank discussion of murder it adds to the creepy guilt-ridden feel that we the audience will no doubt be sharing.And Wilder was from the off a great director of actors, and shrewd at casting. MacFred is not generally a mark of quality on any picture. It's not that he's bad, he is just incredibly bland. In Double Indemnity though his blandness becomes like a kind of blank slate. He's a believable everyman, but not in a charismatic, likable way as, say, Jimmy Stewart. The way he tries to mute his body language and avoid eye-contact ? just as people really do when they have a guilty secret ? is highly effective, and he would not work so well in the part if he were this engaging, watchable character. Barbara Stanwyck on the other hand is the very model of icy indifference. She does not need to show guilt because her character does not have the morals of Neff. But what she does need to do is lie a lot, and Stanwyck is acting well enough that there are palpable but not overstated difference in the tone of her performance when she is fibbing and when she is being sincere. Cold-heartedness has never appeared so complex. Finally Edward G. Robinson provides a lively counterpoint to MacFred, always talking with his hands as well as his mouth. He also secures the note of poignancy in the final scene, and really deserved at least a nomination for Best Supporting Actor.Although Wilder's career of director as well as writer began a little after those of Orson Welles and Preston Sturges, and certainly Welles is now the more lauded figure, Wilder probably did far more for the medium than any other writer-director.

		<shortDescription>A Fine Introduction to Billy Wilder and Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An insurance agent and a young woman scheme up a way to kill the woman's husband and stage it as an accident, cashing in on the man's insurance (which he did not even know he had, due to a forged signature). But the woman may have other ideas in mind after the agent is no longer useful.This is my first official journey into film noir (although how exactly this is defined is unknown to me) and my first journey into the world of director Billy Wilder. If this is typical Wilder, I'm very excited for my next journey, "Sunset Boulevard". From the opening credits with the man on crutches to the closing scene, the narrative was presented in a gripping, suspenseful fashion...I'm not sure if I like Barbara Stanwyck as a blond. I love Babs with all my heart, but blonds? Not for me. Edward G. Robinson is the perfect film noir man with his distinguished look and the way hats and suits just fit him... he gives a wonderful lecture comparing a desk job to that of a surgeon and pencils to scalpels and another great rant about all the suicide stats and kinds of poisons used. I wish I could recreate them here in his signature voice. (This same year, 1944, he made "The Woman in the Window" -- another great tale.) I feel bad this review is so short... truly, this is one of the best films I've seen this year, and if you're into that old time film, you should see this! Now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitive Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this definitive film noir, an insurance salesman lets a seductive woman talk him into murdering her husband. In a departure from his usual nice guy roles, MacMurray is terrific as the doomed insurance agent. With her blonde wig and icy demeanor, Stanwyck creates one of cinema's greatest femme fatales. However, Robinson steals every scene he's in as MacMurray's suspicious boss. Although he had been writing screenplays for 15 years, Wilder here created the first of several masterpieces as writer and director, aided by great cinematography and score. Wilder co-wrote the screenplay with Chandler based on the Cain novel, and it truly sparkles with witty, rapid-fire dialog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CSI: City of Angels (or is that Angles?) Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have watched EVERY episode of CSI, CSI: Miami, and CSI: New York at least once prior to viewing DOUBLE INDEMNITY for the first time, you may find it a little hard not to wonder exactly WHY Pacific All Risk Insurance Company is relying primarily on the wayward gut feelings of insurance claims investigator Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) to nail would-be fraudsters, rather than close liaison work with the LAPD. As this story progresses, you may not be able to help shouting at the screen, "where are the fingerprints?!; where is the video-surveillance footage?!; who has cell phone pictures?; where is the fiber evidence?!; why haven't they sent the victim's clothes to "trace" to check for DNA evidence?!; why haven't they ordered a psychological autopsy?; why hasn't the "grieving widow" been hooked up to a lie detector machine yet?!; etc.; etc.;"--and then you'll probably realize the picture is black and white because this is all taking place in the 1930s. (Then you might start wondering why EVERYONE wasn't rubbed out for their insurance benefit back then, since this sort of crime looks so much easier to get away with than it would be today.) The bottom line is this movie, as scripted, cast, and directed, is riveting (and probably would be if it were set in 1848). Compared to this nail-biter, the 1973 TV version produced from the same script looks worse than CSI on an off-night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its Narrative Style Remains Intact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mystery of Billy Wilder's seminal noir, the exceedingly brilliant trick that preserves even now as the silent, invisible motor for the story, is what the two main characters in actual fact feel about each other. They swagger from beginning to end the practice of a drum-tight murder scheme with dangerous figures of speech and chilly flirting, but they never give the certain impression that they actually care about one another to any particular degree, neither do they evoke such a concrete desire for the insurance money.Wilder dug out the rapport between MacMurray and Robinson. To give a sample of the plot is easy, but it is better to see this film without reading too much about it, because really it is the shade that makes it enticing. A crafty scheme. Though why? Stanwyck certainly has a motive, though it is seems like the inclination to murder occurs no more than because MacMurray comes in by sheer chance. The usual understanding of the essential customs of its plot are that the man is weak to a subtly dominant woman. But he's detached, indifferent, thick-skinned, curt. He always refers to her with nicknames that make her sound like she's a product he likes to buy. And this brand name of his? She's cold as ice, but later she says she cares more about their being together than the money. If they both seem driven by greed, then that is why they plot to kill her husband, but I am not quite convinced of that. And if they ever have a passion for or attraction to each other, it appears as if more like pretension, or like they are deceiving each other into thinking that way, because either way, that tension dwindles later on. Both are infatuated not so much by the crime as by the adventure of perpetrating it with the other someone. The motives we assume throughout are simulations.When it all boils down, they are film noir caricatures with not much mental or emotional profundity or individuality, and that is the intent. Wilder said that the director can never flaunt his style in any technical sense because it would distract from the story. So, in essence, he wisely believes that a director must hide. Pertaining to Double Indemnity, Wilder's sense of remaining hidden is ahead of the film's time, audience, its story and its characters. I would give anything to travel back in time to witness first-hand Wilder directing MacMurray and Stanwyck on the set. What could he have possibly said? He isn't concerned with the same issues the characters are, but rather what happens to them subsequent to what they consider so central.More actual feeling is focused in a different place. It has to do with MacMurray's worry of being found out, and the way he feels about his boss, Edward G. Robinson, who robs every scene blind, plays the claims adjuster as an idealistic maverick who skates the edge of the dress code when he wants to loosen up, treats his office like his own personal den at home, chain smokes, and sees MacMurray as his protégé. He plays a paternal role for him. He's also constantly thinking thinking thinking, and sooner or later he figures things out, setting in motion moments of uneasy apprehension in us, the audience.Double Indemnity was one of the earlier films noir. The photography by visually facilitated the noir style of sharp-edged shade and silhouettes, peculiar points of view and lonesome urban surroundings. But Wilder may have achieved a timelessness with this movie through some of the sneakiest, most cunning directing ever. I don't believe that many people see the story the way he saw it, but he told it the way he saw it, in a manner that appeared to meet the natural presumptions of the audience. Subsequent noir may have borrowed from its visual style, but its narrative style remains more intact than even the most bewildering in film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does justice to Chandler's work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a well-put together movie, does justice to the classic novel by great pulp fiction writer, Raymond Chandler. The screenplay is great, witty, and enjoyable. It doesn't derail, stays right on point throughout. Small cast but well developed characters. Hardly has any fancy stuff but it is pure cinema, some lesson for today's movie makers.The character of Keynes should have won some Oscar, each and every word he spoke was fun, witty. I really admire the way that character was written and then filmed. The best scene is when Keynes pretty much throws out his boss from the window.I had last seen MacMurray In The Apartment, where he plays a negative role,so it took me few minutes to take him as the lead in this movie. The movie is well edited and remains crispy, you keep guessing how this will end. The chemistry between the couple is also great, again the dialogs are quite stylish-elegant and the one-liners are very much Chandler. All in all well adapted, directed and acted. Still amazing after more than 6 decades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic that has aged well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 40's classic was actually unknown to me before I saw it a couple of years ago. But as a lover of good film noir, I must say that this movie must be one of the very best in that genre. The plot with the loving couple that mutually are driven to murdering the husband or wife of one of them has been copied and modified numerous times after this much praised movie, which was nominated for 7 Oscars (but oddly enough, it didn't win any of them). Not least during my youth in the 80's and 90's, we saw many variations of this theme with big stars in the leading roles. The stars of this original are Barbara Stanwyck as a very credible "femme fatale", and Edward G. Robinson as the experienced, highly intelligent investigator Keyes. The director Billy Wilder needs no further presentation, and his cooperation with the father of private eye Philip Marlowe, Raymond Chandler, really bore fruit in this exciting thriller. If you haven't seen this movie before, but if you saw "Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid" (with Steve Martin, 1982), you will recognise the supermarket scene here. Fred MacMurray (Walter Neff) is almost forgotten today, but he acts well here; he reminds me a little both of Cary Grant and James Stewart here, to compare with more well-known Hollywood icons. Even 64 years after it was made, this film still feels fresh - Barbara Stanwyck really is sexy, the music is strong, and the cutting is professional. There are many other examples of film noir that are either too predictable and/or a bit too stylized, but "Double Indemnity" is a minor masterpiece still worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>cracking, snappy, brooding and clever Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Double Indemnity' is a leading example of the Film Noir genre, one in which gumshoe detectives (in this case, Fred McMurray) trade snappy comic-book dialogue with sexy 'dames' (in this case the anklet wearing, predatory Barbara Stanwyck), and plot wicked deeds like murdering unwanted husbands.We're in 'The Postman Always Rings Twice' territory here, and for my money Garfield and Turner just had the smouldering edge, but this tale is a familiar one, well-told, with an interesting twist and a core supporting performance from the always-reliable Edward G Robinson. We meet our hero McMurray when he starts a recording of his confession, leading to a flashback so dark you need a torch to navigate it (see, the kind of dialogue is catching).McMurray, for me, is not the best choice for this kind of material. I'd have been interested to see what Dana Andrews or Robert Taylor could have done with it, but still, he's effective enough and a good foil for Stanwyck, who, not an obvious beauty, still makes you understand why a good man turns bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You know why you couldn't figure this one, Keyes? I'll tell you. Because the guy you were looking for was too close -- right across the desk from you." "Closer than that, Walter." Amazing. God, do I love black and white films. Easily one of the finest film noirs ever made.Barbara Stanwyck &amp; Fred MacMurray star here as the duo who find themselves entwined in a plot to kill Stanwyck's character's husband, who had signed a double indemnity clause.The thing that I love about film noirs the most is that they portray how the world really works. Every person is on the take. Everyone is capable of murder.... Even that guy down the road who sells Insurance.There are so many things I love about this film... But I think my favorite scenes are the one's involving Walter Neff's (MacMurray) fear of discovery, and his feelings for his friend Barton Keyes ( Edward G. Robinson), who plays the Insurance investigator who just won't go away.... and who always listens to his gut or as he describes it "the little man who lives in my stomach." The acting is really astonishing-Stanwyck's ice-cold Phyllis is who all femmes fatales are compared to. As far as I am concerned, that look of satisfaction on her face when her husband is murdered is one of the greatest scenes ever.That first initial chat between Phyllis &amp; Walter is better than some current films that have just been released and eaten up.Then there is MacMurray, a strange choice for the role considering his body of work..and yet a big stroke of genius. A part of doom, and he carries it off. That line he had "I couldn't hear my footsteps. It was the walk of a dead man" is just so haunting.Love the narration on his part as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating film noir classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Double Indemnity" is often considered one of the greatest film noirs ever made and with good reason. It has all the essential elements - a poor sap as the protagonist, a truly evil femme fatale, a plan that gets way out of hand, and lots of snappy dialog. The dialog in particular is fantastic. Its so quickly paced and rapid fire that one needs to watch the film several times to pick up on all the classic lines. Considering the fact that the screenplay was a collaboration between Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler (and based on a novel by James M. Cain to boot), this shouldn't be surprising at all. The film is constantly engrossing and one seems to actually care about the characters, despite there not being a single remotely likable or moral person in the film (with the possible exception of Edward G. Robinson).The technical credits for the film are first class as well. Billy Wilder's direction is superb as usual - he keeps everything moving at a quick pace, yet shows much care and skill for the final product. The acting is good also. Fred MacMurray, an actor best known for "Father Knows Best", is very good as the poor sap whose undone by a femme fatale. Also, Barbara Stanwyck, an actress who I've never considered particularly good looking, oozes sex appeal as the ultimate femme fatale. Edward G. Robinson steals every scene hes in as the fast talking insurance claims investigator. "Double Indemnity" is a must-see for any fan of film noir. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic all the way around.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the way Billy Wilder was so willing to take risks and go and do a film that no other director would touch. He pushed the envelope three major times in his career, this being the first one. By casting Barbara Stanwyck, arguably the biggest female star of the time, and Fred MacMurray, who was known at the time for doing family-type comedy, as two lovers who commit murder to get money, he created a new standard in casting as well as making the definitive film noir. It may not be the best one, but it's up there and the reason, in this critic's opinion, belongs to MacMurray. He is so good in every scene, whether he is flirting, murdering, or simply narrating, he convinces you all the way and makes you wish that he hadn't made the mistake of going to the Dietrichson house that sunny afternoon. Stanwyck is devilish as the femme fatale and Edward G. Robinson is so smooth as a fast-talking, intelligent insurance claims adjuster who lets nothing get in his way from solving a mysterious case. This is writing and directing at its finest. Do not miss this absolute classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that I am a somewhat novice when it comes to the genre of film noir. As a film student, I've heard the term thrown around before but, with the exception of the film L.A. Confidential, I haven't had very much exposure to the genre. Based on my first viewing of Double Indemnity, it definitely seems like a genre that I would like to get more familiar with.The most intriguing part of Double Indemnity was the way that it gently toyed with the audience by giving them a satisfying but original non-Hollywood style ending. Based on Hollywood films of today, it's pretty easy to see how Double Indemnity would be remade today. Walter and Phyllis would steal the money, end up together, and the final shot of the film would probably be them sipping margaritas as they talk about how they fooled the world (a'la Swordfish or Wild Things).If Hollywood were to do a remake of this film noir classic, I'd be willing to bet it would be a bastardized version as they have done so many times before. Remember the Casablanca inspired Barb Wire? Sadly, I do.Thankfully, there is no bastardization of the novel that accrues in this adaptation. There is no happy ending for anyone. Walter Ness sealed his fate the moment he agreed to help Phyllis with her deceptive con. This is a story of without heroes and without villains, everyone has faults and everyone has flaws. I say bravo to Billy Wilder for creating a film that stands with test of time with characters that are something unlike anything in films today. They are human, not merely devises for carrying on a mechanical plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of the best suspenseful Film Noir ever. Billy Wilder directs and co-writes with Raymond Chandler. Totally out of character is Fred MacMurray as Walter Neff, an insurance salesman that is smitten with the beautiful and devious Phylis Dietrichson(Barbara Stanwyck),who is tired of her abusive oilman husband(Tom Powers). Together they concoct a plan to kill Mr. Dietrichson and share the double indemnity insurance that Neff sold. The crime goes awry when Neff's suspicious boss(Edward G. Robinson)figures out the fraud scheme. Both Walter and Phylis think of covering themselves with hastily thought double-cross. MacMurray, Stanwyck and Robinson are flawless with most likely their finest performances. Based on a James M. Cain novel, DOUBLE INDEMNITY is one of those great movies that is a crime to miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Billy Wilder masterpiece. Film noir at its finest. Insurance agent Fred MacMurray portrays a poor sap soaked into Barbara Stanwyck's desire for her hubby's demise. Together they plan the perfect murder, but alas, they have crafty old Edward G. Robinson to contend with. How can a film with this director and these stars miss? Simple, it can't and it doesn't. The casting of MacMurray as a murderer is a stroke of genius -- take a star who staked his career on good guy roles and show his vulnerability. Terrific performance by Stanwyck, who always holds her own up against any other actor in the business, but even so, it's a 3 way tie for kudos on this one. Beautifully paced, this story of lust and greed practically mirrors "The Postman Always Rings Twice", but stands tall all by itself. John Seitz makes great use of his camera, blending shadow and light to perfectly examine the motives of the characters and the movie's mood. Based on a James Cain novel, this film was forced to change its ending as it was deemed too graphic for 1940's viewers. MacMurray's narration throughout sparkles, and this movie works because it has a conscience in the form of Robinson. Simply great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Turning Point for Two Lovers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's "Double Indemnity" was filmed in 1938 but released in 1944. The film had to pass the Production Code as all films had to do at this time. This was the reason for the delay. The film is a tale of adultery , murder , and fraud. The first sin was the main obstacle in approving the film for release. Since nudity and bedroom scenes were never shown on screen , the sexual context had to be suggested in the script and the imagery. In one key scene , Phyllis (Stanwyck ) comes to Neff's (MacMurray) apartment. Neff at this point is unsure of "helping" her. In one two-shot , both are on the sofa,Phyllis reclining and Neff sitting beside her. The film cuts to the Neff narrative of the story and then returns to the two-shot in the apartment. Now , he is reclining on the sofa , fully dressed but his legs are apart. Phyllis is on the other end of the sofa putting on lipstick.Looking at the subtext of the scene , we see the suggestion of a completed sexual encounter , probably ending in oral sex. After the sex, Neff agrees to help Phyllis murder her husband. This , then , is a key scene that sends both on "a one-way street' to the finale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(There are Spoilers) Prefusely Bleeding from a gunshot wound insurance salesman Walter Neff, Fred MacMurray, instead of getting immediate medical attention drives to the Pacific All Risk Building in downtown L.A. After staggering into his office Walter sits down and pops a blank cylinder into his dicta-phone and spills his guts out about what a fool he was over a woman who in the end painted Walter into a corner that if he survives his wounds he'll end up facing either life in prison or the California gas chamber.Walter at first wasn't all that impressed with Phillis Dietrichson, Barbara Stanwyck,when two months earlier he showed up at her home to renew her husbands, Tom Powers, auto insurance. Phillis started to probe Walter about insuring Mr. Dietrichson for as much as $50,000.00 without him even knowing about it. Walter started to smell a rat, or murder, on Phillis' part and told her to take a hike; if only he would have let it end then and there. The poor man didn't realize just how cold blooded and manipulative Phillis was and in the end Walter's mistake would cost him very dearly.With Phillis showing up at Walter's apartment and giving him a long cock and bull story about how she loves him and what a rat her husband is. It didn't take long for him to take the bait and fall right in line with her. Walter gets Mr. Dietrichson insured for $50,000.00 with a double indemnity clause, making it a grand total of $100,000.00, if Mr. Dietrichson gets killed in an accident.Mr. Dietrichson for his part is easily fooled by both Walter and Phillis into signing the policy thinking that it's to insure his car not is life.The two would-be murders, Walter &amp; Phillis, wait for the right time to get Mr. Deitrichson alone and finish him off making it look accidental. That time comes when he suffers a broken leg at his job in the oil fields. Planning to drive to Palo Alto for a get-together with fellow oil executives Mr. Dietrichson is forced to take the train and it's on the train where Walter and Phillis plan for him to have a fatal accident. That's after they murder Mr. Dietrichson beforehand and then have Walter impersonate him. Everything goes like clockwork with Mr. Dietrichson murdered, by Walter, in route to the train station and then later dumped on the tracks. Walter in a leg cast, and wearing the same clothes that Mr. Dieterichson was wearing, puts on a show on the train trying to convince everybody on it that he was Phillis's husband. It's only after Mr. Dieterichson's death that things started unraveling for the two schemers. This unraveling would lead to Walter finally getting wise to Phillis in what she really had planned for him as well as her step-daughter Lola, Jane Heather, and Lola's boyfriend as well as Phillis' lover Nino Zachetti (Byron Barr) but by then it was too late.Walters best friend and insurance investigator at Pacific All Risk Barton Keys, Edward G. Robinson, who at first bought the story of Mr. Deitrichson's accidentally death started to look deep into the matter. The "little man" inside his gut, who was never wrong in all the time he investigated claims, wouldn't let Keyes rest and that lead Keyes, like a determined bull-dog, to keep the Dietrichson case open until he finally broke it.Keyes for his part had no idea that Walter had anything to do with Mr. Dietrichson's death, or murder, being that Walter covered his tracks so well. Keyes felt certain that it was Nino in concert with Phillis that did her old man in. Walter started to get very guilt-ridden over Nino being set up,unknowingly, by Keyes to take the the rap for a crime that he committed. At the same time Walter felt guilty in sweet and innocent Lola, who had nothing but hatred and contempt for her step-mother, taking him into her confidence after he ,not Nino, brutally and cold-blooded murdered her dad!Thinking that he's home free with Nino and Phillis about to be arrested and charged with the murder of Mr. Dietrichson Walter foolishly, or was it his guilty conscience, confronted Phillis at her house that evening only to have himself blasted by Phillis. Phillis for the first time in the movie, showing that she was really in love with Walter can't bring herself to finish him off with a second and fatal shot which turned out to be a fatal mistake on Phillis' part.It's now after 400:AM and Keyes shows up at Walter's office with the police and ambulance not far behind. Walter trying to get a head start from the police in order to cross the US/Mexican border falls right on his face before he can even reach the elevator. It's then when we, and Walter, begin to realize that Keyes may well have known that Walter was the one, not Nino, who together with Phillis tried to pull off the perfect crime. Because Keyes was so close to Walter, much closer then even Walter realized, he didn't have the heart and mind to suspect and have him arrested for murder. It was Walter himself who solved his friends Keyes very pressing and emotional problem by implicating, with his voluntarily taped or recored confession, himself!</fullReview>

No real redemption for the murderer, no great love reconciling it all in the end, just a good friend having matches when they are needed. And the guy more or less being a puppet on a string to the deadly female, after once he spotted her golden chain on her knuckles. And he becomes a walking zombie, once he enters the train, disguised as the guy he just killed. And, playing her string to the end, towering above all, the deadly queen, perfectly performed by Barbara Stanwyck.

		<fullReview>"Double Indemnity" begins with its central character dictating a confession, which means that it is not a "whodunit" in the traditional sense, but rather a film which concentrates on the execution of the crime and the motives behind it. (This would be a common device today but was unusual in the 1940s). The central figure is Walter Neff, an insurance salesman and a law-abiding citizen until he meets Phyllis Dietrichson, a young housewife, when he calls on her about her motor insurance. Phyllis is trapped in a loveless marriage to an older man, and sees in the handsome bachelor Neff a chance to break free. The two begin an affair and hatch an ingenious plot to sell life insurance to Phyllis's husband and then to murder him for the money. They decide to make the death look like a railway accident because of a "double indemnity" clause in the contract which means that the normal $50,000 payout will double to $100,000 in the case of certain categories of accidental death.The film was made in the film noir style, much used for American crime films in the forties and fifties. "Noir", of course, is French for "black", and these films were generally black in two senses, the physical and the moral. All were made in black and white (the genre came to an end in the sixties when it became standard practice to make films in colour) and were characterised by the use of dark, gloomy or night-time settings, often with striking lighting effects comparable to chiaroscuro in painting. Morally, these films often reflected a dark view of humanity, and in this respect "Double Indemnity" is one of the darkest of all. A noir hero such as Humphrey Bogart's Philip Marlowe from "The Big Sleep" may be a cynic on the surface, but beneath that surface he actually has a deep concern for honour and decency. "Double Indemnity", however, does not have a hero, only in Neff an anti-hero, an individual who is at the centre of the film (and who in this case acts as narrator), but who is deeply unsympathetic, indeed a criminal. Neff narrates his story in a similar laconic, world-weary tone to that used by Bogart's heroes, but lacks their inner decency, being totally ruthless and self-seeking. Phyllis is similarly lacking in moral scruples; indeed, the two have no loyalty even to one another.The nearest thing to a hero in this film is Barton Keyes, a colleague of Neff's in the insurance company. It is Keyes's dogged persistence in investigating Mr Dietrichson's death (the police do not regard it as suspicious) that finally results in the downfall of the evildoers, but even he is not a really sympathetic character. He is obsessive about his job, the sort of man who today would be referred to as a nerd or an anorak. He can, and does, quote from memory the latest statistics on various methods used to commit suicide. He has a particularly cynical view of human nature, automatically suspecting all insurance claims of being fraudulent. His interest in the Dietrichson case arises less from a desire to see justice done than from a desire to ensure that his firm's money is not paid out in settlement of a false claim.Unlike some films in the genre, the plot is not excessively complex. Fred MacMurray- not an actor with whose work I was particularly familiar, although he was later to give an excellent performance in "The Caine Mutiny"- is good as Neff, but the two best performances come from Barbara Stanwyck as the seductive femme fatale Phyllis and Edward G. Robinson as Keyes. Billy Wilder acted as both scriptwriter and director, and in both capacities his contributions are first class. The dialogue is crisp and holds the attention well, often displaying a sardonic wit. The action is never less than gripping, with some notably tense sequences such as where the car fails to start immediately after the murder and the one where Phyllis is hiding behind the door. Although Neff and Phyllis are such unsympathetic characters, we hope that, in the short term at least, they will get away with it because we want to see just how far their plan will go before they are discovered. This is not only one of the darkest of films noirs but also, in my opinion, one of the best, with very high standards of acting, writing and directing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those of you that know this film might think it blasphemous to compare it to Army of Darkness. However, I'm betting more readers have seen the Evil Dead movies (and hey, if not, watch those too). Simply put, I have seldomly seen one-liners delivered with such precision. The direction of this movie was superb (of coarse, Wilder rarely misses), and the acting above average, but what really stands out is the great cinematography and the clever writing. This movie is full of great quotes. It's very difficult to add humor to a great film noir, but Billy Wilder delivers. I enjoyed this more than "Some Like it Hot", "the Apartment", and "Seven Year Itch". In my opinion, it's Wilder's best work.All in all, if you consider yourself a fan of movies, any kind of movies, you MUST watch this. I wouldn't bother renting it, just bite the bullet and buy it, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

I was pleasantly surprised to see Fred MacMurray in a role like this...where he plays the suave, handsome, ladies man. And he did a great job. It's the age old story about the "perfect crime" going horribly wrong, and one of the best examples of that theme. The plot is complex, twisted, and unpredictable. I had no idea what was going to happen next. And Barbara Stanwyck as the femme fatale was brilliant. She had that sweet look and little by little you find out just how "fatale" she really is. This movie is truly a gem, and all film buffs should see it immediately to bask the beauty of this brilliantly crafted film-noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently viewed this classic Billy Wilder movie of the 1940's on video tape. Wilder's friend and protege` Cameron Crowe won a writing Oscar for last year's ALMOST FAMOUS and among his dedicatory remarks mentioned the MASTER (Mr. Wilder). What a masterful cinema classic this noir "who dun it to whom" is even in the brand new century!! Fred MacMurray was also cast against his "nice-guy" type in Wilder's THE APARTMENT (1960) but in this film he's a victim of sexual attraction that keeps him dying throughout the majority of the film. The use of flashback framing is great and the not-yet resolved ending is also highly memorable. The question I'm left with at the end of this masterful narrative is: WHO LOVES WHO and WHO REALLY WON IN THE DOUBLE-CROSS ENDING?  The ultimate villain is played by Barbara Stanwyck who really embodies sexuality turned up to the maximum. She controls and manipulates every character who crosses her path. We fear for everyone in the "back-story" that she got her "hands" in strangle-holds on (necks and other body parts). She avows her love for her fellow murderer at several junctures of the narrative but his love and appreciation are also oddly expressed for his co-worker at the insurance agency. The story of DOUBLE INDEMNITY is not simply told and the ending is highly unresolved. The author of a recent significant film's screenplay, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, owes in part his big surprises to brainy earlier writers like this movie's master plotter, Billy Wilder. High praise and sincere recommendations for all young movie fans with only a few Parental Guidance (PG-13) aspects to be mindful of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not hard to put a finger on why "Double Indemnity" is so good. The acting and story are both so mesmerizing, it's hard to say anything more than what's rightly been said about them already. Barbara Stanwyck makes the gas chamber seem a small price to pay, while Fred MacMurray pulls off the trick of making a loathsome character sympathetic to the audience. Edward G. Robinson deserves a better class of cigar for the fine work he puts binding this whole thing together, by working simultaneously as MacMurray's trusting foil and instrument of his doom.But what makes this film work, and hold up so well more than half-a-century later, are the small touches. The clever opening (the killer reveals his identity in the opening scene) puts us on early notice that attention will need to be paid. Attention is rewarded, by the many little bits of business that are next to nothing on their own but make a great picture better when taken as part of the whole.* The opening conversation between a taciturn Walter Neff and a chatty elevator operator. We don't find out until a little later why Walter's so gruff.* How Neff accurately reads what Phyllis is proposing before it's even out of her mouth, tells her so, and then walks away. Was there ever a more unpromising beginning to a film noir tryst than this? Yet it shows us the guy has brains and some sense of morality, which makes his subsequent fall more of a challenge to accept, and more involving once we do.* The thumbnail match-lighting that goes on throughout the movie, usually at witty moments of simultaneous understanding and deception between Neff and Keyes. (Bet the Ronson people were glad this was one movie fad that didn't catch on.)* The problem with the car starting, which may seem a cheap bit of momentary suspense except when you think how it underscores in retrospect Keyes' great speech of murder accomplices sharing a trolley ride to the cemetery.* The fact that the only time the three main characters in the movie share a speaking scene together, it's one dominated by a fourth character, the supercilious insurance company president. His "suicide" theory, as delivered to the Widow Dietrichson, is perhaps the funniest moment in an often-very-funny film, closely rivaled by Keyes' subsequent, satisfying dressing-down of his boss. (What an exit line: "Next time I'll wear a tuxedo!")I'd say more, but I'm heading into spoiler country, so I'll let it go with a "must-see" recommendation, and this point about the last scene: Did you notice how Fred's last cigarette was soaked with blood around the middle, from being in his jacket pocket when he was wounded? So even the small enjoyment of a smoke would soon literally be cut off by his culpability in the crime. Gotta love that iron code of irony in film noir!</fullReview>

She charges the screen with so much electricity you don't need to plug in your VCR.It's always good to see MacMurray in something more uplifting than "My Three Sons." Then there's Edward G. Robinson in the support role which he turns into a major presence. One of the best scenes in the movie features the pompous head of the insurance company who interviews Stanwyck in front of Robinson and MacMurray(in order to "show them how it's done"). Edward G gets all the good lines, and in a Wilder script, that's a lot.A movie that refuses to be dated, "Double Indemnity" makes the case for simplicity in a story. Lay it down and just let it happen. Of course, it doesn't hurt to have Stanwyck along for the ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What starts out as a simple attempt by Fred MacMurray to sell some additional life insurance erupts into a murder scheme concocted by Barbara Stanwyck on the life of her unsuspecting husband in this 1944 film classic "Double Indemnity." Told with a crisp, quick dialog style, the film depicts first the meeting, then develops the interest in the two schemers, leaps to the murder, then sees the "perfect plan" start to erode because of the efforts of Edward G. Robinson to protect the company from having to pay a double indemnity charge on the life of the deceased.The viewer will be able to follow the movie rather easily, but it is obvious that Robinson sniffs something suspicious, and is not going to let go of the matter without giving a serious effort t uncover the truth. Eventually, the tensions mount to the climax, and the lovers are ultimately pitted against themselves in an effort to avoid the legal charges.This film did receive several nominations from the Academy Awards festival, including "Best Picture" and does remain a great example of suspense coupled with tension and mystery. An easy 9/10, and a must see for fans of this genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The term 'film noir' gets tossed around quite a lot describing the dark, moody crime films of the '40s. And while Bogart is considered the king of the genre, special attention needs to be paid to Fred MacMurray's performance in Billy Wilder's classic 'Double Indemnity'. 'My Three Sons' it ain't.Revealing any part of the plot would be a crime, but if you know what the term 'double indemnity' means, it won't be too hard to figure out. What I will reveal is that the dialogue is outstanding(certainly a Wilder trait), and the two lead characters are unsympathetic misfits. MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck took huge risks and gave classic performances. Equally outstanding is Edward G. Robinson, who plays the only likeable person in the movie. Of course, Robinson is remembered for his heavy gangster roles, so this twist is even more remarkable. The only thing that brings the movie down to a 9 for me is the hokey voiceover. Wilder reused the device with better results in 'Sunset Boulevard'.</fullReview>

Barbara Stanwyck is perfect; you can just see her calculating and planning in those first few meetings with MacMurray, who is no slouch himself. I don't think he ever calls her by her first name, constantly calling her "baby," while giving a great example of a man bored with his career and excited by a challenge and a hot dame. Edward G. Robinson is fabulous too. I was amazed by that suicide statistics speech! I don't think Miklos Rozsa's perfect score gets enough credit for creating the mood of this picture. It's so wonderfully foreboding, getting us ready for the cool, hardened crime drama that those first few notes and shots promise us.

		<fullReview>Now entrenched deeply in the echelons of cinema history, Double Indemnity is a Film Noir classic and a must see for any avid film enthusiast. Directed by Billy Wilder, who co wrote the screenplay with Raymond Chandler, the film is based on James M. Cains novella of the same name that originally appeared as an eight part serial in Liberty Magazine.Walter Neff, played by Fred MacMurray, is an experienced insurance salesman who meets a sultry young broad by the name of Phyillis Dietrichson who wishes her husband dead. She uses her lascivious charms to convince him to enter into a macabre scheme where she can cash in on her husbands death. Neff quickly succumbs to her toxic allure and before long is conspiring with her to do away with the husband and assist her in claiming twice the amount, in a policy clause that pays double in the event of a death arriving by accidental means. Hence, Double Indemnity.Drawing upon his vast knowledge from years in the business, Neff steers Dietrichson through the potential pitfalls of making such a claim, and the convoluted plan needed to outsmart the astute claims adjuster, Barton Keys, whose job it is to sniff out any bogus claims.Throughout the film we see how the nefarious arrangement begins to erode Neffs conscience as the film regularly cuts to the protagonist in flashback as he archives a dicta-phonic confession to his mentor Keyes.Apart from the meritorious plot and brilliant directorial skills of Wilder, this picture boasts some of the finest dialogue and exchanges in any film I've seen. The sublime and effortless performance by MacMurray and his perfunctory deliverance is matched perfectly by the leading lady Dietrichson, played by Barbara Stanwyck. It's easy to see why critics and film buffs wax lyrical about classics such as this. Everything about this piece is perfect, from the acting, the plot, the cinematography, and perfect economy of scene time that keeps the viewer gripped at every turn. This film was also a trailblazer for what followed, paradigmatic in its conception and style, it set the tone and standard for many Film Noir classics that succeeded it. Chosen in 1992 by the U.S Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry it cements its worthwhile place as one the all time greats. Flawless from start to finish and comprehensively agreeable, Double Indemnity is a film any serious film lover should see.</fullReview>

Double Indemnity is up there with his very best. Wilder directs impeccably, but his direction is not the only great thing about Double Indemnity. Everything is great about it, it is a timeless classic and defines the term quintessential film noir.The cinematography is gorgeous with no rough edges or shaky moments, instead it is all fluid and beautiful, and the costumes, sets and scenery also help. Also superb are Miklos Rozsa's wonderfully atmospheric score, the compelling story which sizzles with romance and sexual tension and the truly crackling screenplay.The acting also is impressive. Fred MacMurray overplays slightly, but this is one of the cases when overplaying works, because he is still witty and charming as well. Barbara Stanwyck I think is sexy, her character appeals and her dialogue is so good as is her delivery of it, while Edward G.Robinson gives a superb supporting performance.All in all, a stunning film and one of the very best of the genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply the greatest fim noir ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the great actors (such as Humphrey Bogart), directors (like John Huston and Fritz Lang) and femme fatales (see "The Postman Always Rings Twice" or "The Killers"), it's quite surprising that an actor rarely mentioned with the all time greats, a director known for making comedies, and an actress supposedly over the hill would combine to make the greatest film noir. However, Billy Wilder's "Double Indemnity" trumps all other entries in the genre, even the great ones like "The Maltese Falcon" and "M". Based on James M. Cain's novel, the story follows insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), who enters his office one night bleeding from a bullet wound. Neff dictates his confession to his boss and friend Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson). He describes his first encounter with Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck), who convinces him to help her murder her husband for his life insurance. The inquisitive Keyes, however, is not ready to call Mr. Dietrichson's death accidental just yet, and soon enough Neff and Phyllis turn against each other, culminating in an unforgettable finish. The script is full of dialogue that is delivered in a humorous way (like Keyes's speech about suicide) by talented actors-the three leads are all terrific. MacMurray is the austere antihero present in just about all film noirs, but it's Stanwyck and Robinson that make the acting in this stand apart. As Phyllis, she starts off with an almost childlike innocence, but by the end has proved herself to be one of the most reprehensible of all characters in cinema history. Robinson provides comic relief as Keyes, but at the same time delivers several dramatic speeches. Billy Wilder does a terrific job with his direction, creating a milieu of darkness, the quintessential setting for a film noir. The murder scene in the car and the first encounter between Neff and Phyllis in Neff's apartment are two of the most conspicuous examples of Wilder's manipulation of light and darkness to engender the aforementioned ambiance. Miklos Rosza also provides a suspenseful score helping to capture the mood throughout. As a whole, "Double Indemnity" simply takes all of the necessary aspects for a film noir and accomplishes them , resulting in the greatest entry in one of Hollywood's best genres.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is really hard to older movies, because I am so young and they are not longer original or fresh. A lot of film techniques and plot devices have been used (poorly many times) in every movie seen. So the plot twists were not a huge surprise and the deviousness of the situations is not as shocking as it would have been if I grew up in that error. But besides all of that anyone can tell this is an outstanding movie and anyone that appreciates good dialog will love this movie. This movies has some of the quickest and sharp dialog that I have ever heard and was delivered in a way one just does not see anymore. I watched this with my room mate and he commented on how he would never kill for this girl, but I think an idea like that is lost through the ages and he cannot feel the electric draw of Phyllis's character as much as we might have if we grew up in a different generation. Besides that we have a performance with so many nuances that it is hard to catch them all. I think one of my favorite aspects of the character the female lead is she was able to outwit a very smooth talking salesmen who outwits people for a living with a blink of the eye at the very beginning with the dialog about speeding. If that does indicate that she is dangerous than I don't know does. But it is so quick that one may not realize that is the biggest clue that she can outwit all of them. The best part about Walter's character is that he is able to kill her at the end without a blink of the eye and he turns out to be just as evil as her in a way. As she opens up her heart to him he just shoots her. It is brilliant. No one gets the girl and there is not happy ending, but it is very satisfying to watch. The thing I would like to say about the director is that this is probably the best paced movie I have ever seen. It is extremely quick and only lets you breathe for a second and that is only when Walter gets to breathe. Consider there is so little action and it is mostly dialog this is quite a feat to pace it so well. I am glad I have seen this movie and would enjoy multiple viewings. But I think I can only give it a 9 because of the time frame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1990's I managed to see this film as part of my film history class. Only knowing Fred McMurray from the TV series "My Three Sons", this was a welcomed changed. I've seen this movie countless times.The film begins from the end, and takes you through the journey of how they got there. A rather unique way considering other movies of the 1940s, then again, film noir was itself a brand new mode of film making.Barbara Stanwyck was the perfect blend of beauty and danger that made her the perfect femme fa-tale. Who can forget her entrance, posed a top the stairway, clothed in only a towel. As Walter Neff is hooked by her, you are as well, and you are along for the trolley ride, as Edward G. Robinson points out.The way The Neff character plans his alibi is beyond genius, and it also shows that this rather mild mannered looking man himself has a dark side. The plan is perfect, even to the viewer. Though you know how it's all going to turn out, you still expect them both to get away with murder. You even applaud Neff's protection of the young daughter, who's now lost both her mother and father. While Neff's explanation is that he is seeing if she'll tell about her mothers action the night before her father's death, by the end, you see that his act of kindness towards the young girl was genuine.Enter Edward G. Robinson, who became my all time favorite actor after I saw this. Robinson, himself many times the ruthless film villain, is on the other side now. He's hunting down the killers as he tries to save the insurance company from paying the double indemnity clause. Robinson talks about his "little man" likes he's an actual person, and who believe Robinson when he talks about him.The climax is exciting without being action packed. It presents the last bit of drama, as a one man is forced to turn his best friend over for the crimes he's done. That is the hidden drama in this tale.The movie is one of the best, bar none, and is one of the quiet films never mentioned in the same breath as CasleBlanca, Maltese Falcon, or Pride of the Yankees. Maybe it should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Film Noir!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the great actors (such as Humphrey Bogart), directors (like John Huston and Fritz Lang) and femme fatales (see "The Postman Always Rings Twice" or "The Killers"), it's quite surprising that an actor rarely mentioned with the all time greats, a director known for making comedies, and an actress supposedly over the hill would combine to make the greatest film noir. However, Billy Wilder's "Double Indemnity" trumps all other entries in the genre, even the great ones like "The Maltese Falcon" and "M". Based on James M. Cain's novel, the story follows insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred Macmurray), who enters his office one night bleeding from a bullet wound. Neff dictates his confession to his boss and friend Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson). He describes his first encounter with Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck), who convinces him to help her murder her husband for his life insurance. The inquisitive Keyes, however, is not ready to call Mr. Dietrichson's death accidental just yet, and soon enough Neff and Phyllis turn against each other, culminating in an unforgettable finish. The script is full of dialogue that is delivered in a humorous way (like Keyes's speech about suicide) by talented actors-the three leads are all terrific. Macmurray is the austere antihero present in just about all film noirs, but it's Stanwyck and Robinson that make the acting in this stand apart. As Phyllis, she starts off with an almost childlike innocence, but by the end has proved herself to be one of the most reprehensible of all characters in cinema history. Robinson provides comic relief as Keyes, but at the same time delivers several dramatic speeches. Billy Wilder does a terrific job with his direction, creating a milieu of darkness, the quintessential setting for a film noir. The murder scene in the car and the first encounter between Neff and Phyllis in Neff's apartment are two of the most conspicuous examples of Wilder's manipulation of light and darkness to engender the aforementioned ambiance. Miklos Rosza also provides a suspenseful score helping to capture the mood throughout. As a whole, "Double Indemnity" simply takes all of the necessary aspects for a film noir and accomplishes them , resulting in the greatest entry in one of Hollywood's best genres.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow--this movie had the absolute snappiest dialog of any Film Noir movie in Hollywood history. For dialog alone and Fred MacMurray's voice-overs, this must rank as one of the best Noir films of all time. The words they say are all so carefully chosen and magnificent--the writers really did their work well. And, the acting and direction are excellent as well. About the only reason I don't score it a 10 (and it sure came very close) was that, for Film Noir, there wasn't a whole lot of action or even suspense in the movie--considering you KNOW that MacMurray is making a confession so he isn't going to get away with the murder plot. Still, these are VERY minor complaints--the film is simply great. I suggest after seeing this film you watch an episode of MY THREE SONS and see the two extremes in Fred's work--the absolute apex and the absolute nadir (if you don't know what those words mean, look 'em up yourself, ya mug).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it's so embedded in the popular culture and cinema history its easy to forget how much fun the film is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Double Indemnity, first showed to me a few years back in a film class (naturally), struck me in certain ways, and then the more I thought about it afterward even more-so. I watched it again very soon after, and of course agreed with the teacher that it was the "textbook film-noir", practically defining the 'average Joe' male lead, the 'femme fatale, and the usages of very specific lighting in almost all of the key night scenes (outdoor and in). But through a lot of the hype surrounding the picture, it would be one thing if it had all of these qualities and then ended up being not too interesting. As it turns out not only is it that, it's also a great hoot of a story, with tongue at times placed so much in cheek the real seriousness and grit of the picture gets lost in the attitude. I can imagine Billy Wilder, after his many strained writing sessions with the master Raymond Chandler, reading the script and wondering 'should a movie from the point of view of the criminals pulling multiple crimes be this amusing'? At the time, perhaps, it was nothing but hard-to-the-bone thrilling stuff, with Fred MacMurray's tough, though of course clever, dialog, and the sultry Barbara Stanwyck (and lest not forget Edward G. Robinson, who's presence in the film is enough to garner it attention right away). But with time maybe the film has even grown more appealing in a way; I know that, for example, the narration in some parts was such a direct influence for the Naked Gun movies that it almost becomes funny in and of itself. But all through this its just a solid story, from Cain's novel, pumped to cinematic life and given enough vigor to last long enough to be written about as one of the all-time classics of cinema in general, not just American. It also contains the one time a man says to another man "I love you, too" and it's so humorous and keenly cool that its almost endearing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Noir Zenith With Unbeatable Wilder-Chandler Dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The crackling, whip-smart dialogue provided by master film auteur Billy Wilder and supreme crime novelist Raymond Chandler is what makes this 1944 film noir such a timeless classic, certainly among the very best of the genre. Considering this was just the third film he directed, Wilder is already at the top of his game here in this adaptation of a James Cain novella about a sleazy hotshot insurance man named Walter Neff, who is out to renew an auto insurance claim with a wealthy oil driller named Dietrichson. The man isn't home but his lethally cool wife Phyllis is, and the sexual combustion between them is palpable from the moment they meet. Told in flashback, the story unfolds constant layers of duplicity by stupid, morally bankrupt people - which is why this film is so much fun to watch, simply because the behavior is twisted in a rather exaggerated manner that makes you cringe and laugh at the same time.It certainly helps that Wilder cast three actors who turn in exemplary performances. In an about-face from his usually genial roles, Fred MacMurray is surprisingly effective as a man weakened by his passions and seeking salvation far too late. It's easily his best screen work at least until Wilder cast him as the immoral, adulterous office boss in another classic, "The Apartment", sixteen years later. Calculating and seductive in a cheap blond wig and a provocative anklet, Barbara Stanwyck personifies the hard-boiled dame with a brilliant turn as Phyllis. She is the role model for all femme fatales that came after her - including Kathleen Turner's star-making turn in "Body Heat" nearly forty years later. Walter and Phyllis claim to be in love, so much so that they plot to kill her husband for the insurance. But there is no love between these two - just reciprocal contempt. She's just a conquest to him, and he's a pawn to her. What's more, their plan is ridiculous. Neff breaks her husband's neck, and then they plant him on the railroad tracks to imply he fell off the back of a 15 mile per hour train after taking out a policy that pays double for a death on a train. As the most decent person of an unseemly lot, Edward G. Robinson portrays Barton Keyes, a wily insurance investigator who likes Walter in spite of himself and the revelations about him. It all ends the way you would expect but in such a darkly humorous way that it's enjoyable just to see how.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best of its genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plan is devious, but a simple one. In an effort to rid herself of her allegedly abusive ex-husband, a woman strikes up a romance with an insurance salesman who just happens upon her doorstep with some auto insurance renewals. Since it's not enough to get out of her marriage without financial security, she enlists the salesman to not only commit fraud by having the cuckolded husband sign a life insurance policy with a double indemnity clause without any knowledge of doing so, but also to help her bump off her husband by making it look like an accident. Unfortunately, paranoia and conscience tends to get in the way in situations like these, and even something that seems to be a "perfect murder" can go sour, fast. This is the plot of Billy Wilder's celebrated 1944 noir masterpiece, "Double Indemnity", in which Phyllis Dietrichson (Stanwyck) and Walter Neff (MacMurray) find themselves embroiled in a situation that at the time, seemed like a good one, until they end up way over their heads; mainly due to their lack of trust in each other. Rounding out the cast is Edward G. Robinson, who plays Barton Keyes, Walter's friend and co-worker at the insurance company, a man who is on the trail of the murder plot due to his position as the manager of claims."Double Indemnity" has been hailed as one of the best, if not the best, of the film noir genre. It is such a dark film, both in plot and aesthetically, that it is sometimes easy to forget that Billy Wilder didn't just direct romantic comedies like "Some Like it Hot", "The Seven Year Itch" and "Sabrina". Particularly in his earlier filmography, we see wonderful dark films mixed in with the fanciful, like this one and "The Lost Weekend". Dimly lit, with wonderful shadows and people hiding behind dark glasses and behind doors and corners, "Double Indemnity", while not the first film in the noir genre, certainly is one that defines it. Wilder's direction is brilliant, particularly the machine-gun pacing of both the action and the dialogue. The screenplay in particular is inspired, as the rapid-fire dialogue between characters is spewed as fast as one can process it. Lines like, "Do I laugh now, or wait until it gets funny?" or "How could I have known that murder could sometimes smell like honeysuckle?" or my personal favorite exchange between Phyllis and Walter: Phyllis: "I wonder if I know what you mean?" Walter: "I wonder if you wonder" are so deliciously classic that it's difficult not to enjoy every one of them.I cannot picture any other actors in their roles than MacMurray, Stanwyck and Robinson. Stanwyck, at this point a legend in cinema already, had previously worked with Wilder on the screwball comedy "Ball of Fire" with Gary Cooper, but despite their comedic history, Wilder had the foresight to cast her. Fred MacMurray is so typecast as Steve Douglas in the television show "My Three Sons" and as the "Absent-Minded Professor" in a series of Disney films, that no matter how prepared one is to see him in this film, personally I can't help but chuckle the first time he is on screen. His casting was certainly inspired though; a quick glance through his filmography does not show any kind of break out role prior to this one. The heat between the two of them is very present, but more importantly, they are able to convey the more subtle emotions of paranoia and fear of one another with one single glance. Edward G. Robinson, always a great actor, is superb as Keyes. One thing that he has always managed to do, despite (or maybe because of) his less than matinée-idol looks, is to play a strong character that still comes across as emotional and human. Even after he eventually figures out that his protégée may not be what he thought he was, he still exhibits an almost fatherly concern for Walter.Personally, of all the many films I have seen in the film noir genre, "Double Indemnity" is not my favorite; Otto Preminger's "Laura", released the same year, is superior, in my opinion. However, the beauty of "Double Indemnity" is that it is so thoroughly compelling, so entertaining and so well made that despite its miniscule shortcomings (like Stanwyck's terrible wig) it is a film that, although it is one of several hundred films of its kind, it contains the mainstream appeal to define the genre. If somehow you have not seen this film - maybe you've been under a rock, perhaps you see a black and white film and instead of it creating a Pavlovian response of salivating like it does for me, you run screaming ? whatever the reason, check it out; you're missing a great film. 8/10 --Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a great film! The acting was superb and the directing marvellous. The director kept up the tension throughout the film. There is not enough praise in the world for this film.The best character with the best lines was that of Barton Keyes. My favourite scene of his is when he is in Norton's office, telling Norton - the president of the company - that, in effect, he is an idiot. I think many people would love to say what Keyes did to their bosses. I felt sorry for Keyes, as well. Keyes wasn't a man who gave his friendship and, in particular, his trust, lightly. He never once suspected that Walter Neff was the murderer and to find that he was, well, it must have hurt the man deeply.I found the last scene touching, where Keyes, despite knowing what Walter had done, still was trying to help him as best he could. He was still his friend and he lit his cigarette the way Walter had lit countless of his, Keyes, cigars.Having said all this, the storyline was weak. Let's put it this way, if you were in a pub and a guy told you about a guy who died in an odd accident on a train just two weeks after he had taken out an accident policy, wouldn't the first question you asked be 'So, have the police charged anyone for the murder yet?' It is a sign of the director's genius that he kept the audience's attention away from the weakness in the plot.One more thing: it is really good to see a film in which a woman was depicted as a black-hearted villain. I'm sick of the politically-correct portrayal of films these days. Phyllis Dietrichson used almost every trick in the book: she displayed her body, she flirted, she cried, she claimed that her husband beat her and wouldn't let her out of the house. It is clear, though, in the scene where she is driving her husband to catch the train that she was the one who was controlling him. She wanted him dead, not because he was terrible to her, but because he wasn't rich enough for her anymore.All in all, despite the weak plot, this is a great film. 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the film most noirs are judged by. It has a wonderful cast, but they are helped immeasurably by the script. Raymod Chandler was evidently firing on all cylinders when he wrote it, the dialogue sparkles, it really is sharp stuff. You couldn't get this is any other genre, and there's no other words to describe what goes on other than "hard boiled". It's tough stuff, and it's an amazing film.Essentially we have an insurance salesman here getting embroiled in a sticky situation with a beautiful blonde femme fatale. It goes awry, needless to say, with Eddie G Robinson pulling the strings as an amazing support character, he gives one of his best performances here in my opinion, although the two leads have such magnetic screen presence not one scene in the film drags.If you like this, I recommend Earnest Hemmingway's The Killers, another classic.But this is the daddy, Double Indemnity is well worth they hype.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy's best with Some like hot and the best film noir ever made. If you watch this one, I hardly can imagine you being deceived. The set, the acting (specially a Stanwyck in a 1000%), the script and the direction, the music... Everything can be the best for a film noir. The scene of the crime is fascinating, with a short plane of the diabolically happy Cooper's face after sounding the claxon, and the elegance (Wilder) of not to show the murder explicitly, but only to suggest what is happening by this plane. If you have seen Garnet's The postman always rings twice, you're likely to prefer this one, although Garnet's movie may be very good. If you like film noir, and you have not seen this one (?!), after seeing it, you will be able to remember a lot of scenes, scripts and all sort of details in every movie made after Double indemnity that have been developed or taken out from it: from Kasdan's Body heat to Verhoeven's Basic Instinct or Edel's Body of Evidence -look at the pyjamas of Stanwick in the last scene-. This one can be considered as one of the best "telling by flashback" Hollywood classic movies, with Curtiz' Mildred Pierce -based upon another Cain's novel, as The postman is too-. The worst... Well, I think it's Stanwick hair-stylist, but I prefer watching the good things... The rest of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With its crisp dialogue, rain-soaked atmosphere, low-key lighting and plot machinations, this is film noir as only Billy Wilder could envision it in the '40s. Are there are any flaws? Well, for me anyway, there's the problem of Barbara Stanwyck's tacky looking blonde wig, so evident that you wonder whether she deliberately chose it because it made her look cheap. Perhaps. But for me, it's the only thing that detracts from her otherwise solid performance. Problem is the wig makes her look like the phony she turns out to be--and Fred MacMurray, an insurance man who's been around the block a few times, should have known better. If he doesn't know people, who does??Whatever the flaws are in this film, they're more than compensated for by the clever photography, the Miklos Rozsa score, the witty screenplay and the three central performances of Edw. G. Robinson, Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck--each one playing off each other brilliantly.And who says the ending isn't resolved? It certainly is--with MacMurray waiting for the ambulance and puffing on a cigarette lit by Robinson and some classic lines of dialog...like Robinson admitting that MacMurray was more than just the man who sat at a nearby desk. "I love you too," is MacMurray's closing line.Fascinating film noir that would have been even better without Stanwyck's decision to use that tacky blonde wig.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We begin at the end. Double Indemnity is a film which tells you its ending right at the start. And then the flashback begins and we spend the rest of the film seeing how it is we got to that ending we already know. It would seem that under these circumstances there may not be much drama or tension in the film but that could not be further from the truth. We may know the film's ultimate destination but the journey never fails to be compelling. It is fascinating to watch this classic film noir story unfold. It is a film which will hold your attention throughout.Fred MacMurray has the lead role in the film, that of insurance salesman Walter Neff, an ordinary man who will find himself entangled in an extraordinarily complex murder plot. The drama begins when Walter meets Phyllis Dietrichson, a woman quite eager to see her husband meet an untimely demise. A demise which will prove to be quite lucrative for Phyllis if only she can manage to take out a life insurance policy on her husband without his knowledge. Here of course is where our insurance salesman enters the picture and the plot will very quickly be put into motion.Barbara Stanwyck plays Phyllis in what would come to be one of film's most famous femme fatale roles. While Walter initially is not at all interested in murder he certainly is interested in Phyllis and it does not take long for her to entangle Walter in her web. The fact it takes her so little time to convince a man she doesn't even know to murder her husband does strain credulity a bit. One moment Walter meets Phyllis and seemingly a moment later he's willing to kill for her. It is very obvious who the stronger of the two characters is. Phyllis is cold and ruthless and apparently has her ways of convincing a weaker man to do her bidding. Since this is a film produced in 1944 we're not going to see explicitly what those ways may be but you can hazard a good guess. Walter never stood a chance.The story always captivates and it is fascinating to see the seemingly perfect murder plot play out. But the movie does have some flaws. Much of the dialogue seems clipped and forced. MacMurray is the biggest offender in this regard, so often speaking in a tone which seems completely unnatural. His insistence on referring to Phyllis as "Baby" every time he speaks to her wears thin quickly. It's as if Walter is trying real hard to be the cold, hard tough guy but it never convinces. He's no match for Phyllis. In fact while MacMurray is obviously playing the key figure it is Edward G. Robinson in a supporting role as insurance company investigator Barton Keyes who really shines. Watching Keyes try to unravel the plot, the plot we already know inside and out, is great fun and Robinson does an excellent job with his role, creating a truly memorable character. And of course Stanwyck is excellent as well. MacMurray's OK, just not up to the level of his co-stars, which is exacerbated by the fact that it is he who narrates the story throughout the film-long flashback.All in all, director Billy Wilder did a magnificent job creating a wonderfully atmospheric thriller. The look and feel of the film are perfect, adding to the great tension. The fact there is so much tension and drama even though we pretty much already know what's going to happen is remarkable. Yes at times the film seems a little dated, most especially with its dialogue. But there is no denying the film is very well done. It's not a perfect film by any means but it is one which rightly will stand the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fred MacMurray is a southern California insurance salesman who stops by a client's house one afternoon to renew a contract and meets the client's wife, an anklet-wearing, glinty-eyed dame with blonde hair styled like a lascivious doll. They flirt a little, but when she starts inquiring about taking out a life insurance policy on hubby without him knowing about it, MacMurray gives her the brush-off; no matter, she looks him up in the phone book and winds up on his doorstep! Canny, clever murder-plot concocted by director Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler, via James M. Cain's novel "Three of a Kind". Cain, who also penned "The Postman Always Rings Twice" (which this plot has a faint trace of), masterfully knew how to create sultry, no-nonsense broads who get what they want, and Wilder's handling of Barbara Stanwyck in this role is sensational. MacMurray, on the other hand, always looks about to blanch, and his character (savvy on customer relations) falls prey to Stanwyck mighty quickly. As Fred's boss, Edward G. Robinson does well with a sketchy character, though his wordy summations and 'intuitions' are just plot contrivances, pushing this story along to its inevitable conclusion. "Double Indemnity" is not without flaws, and has become overrated in the previous two decades, though it is ripe with scintillating, low-life dialogue and does build suspense even though we all know where these characters are headed--to the cemetery! *** from ****</fullReview>

Not stopping until he unravels the crime, mind full of statistics and possible scenarios, and trusting no-one, every scene he is in, is a classic. although i haven't read the book, i have read much other Noir, and while this is nowhere near as violent or erotic as those, it retains their atmosphere, and the feel of the period. 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is truly classic film noir. It has it all. Shot in low-key black and white, a crooked hero, a scheming femme fatale, great-looking bars of shadows and lights from the venetian blinds, good (if not always very good) performances and a marvelously overripe show by Edward G. Robinson coming up with a face-reddening tirade in front of his boss before grabbing a glass of water out of the guy's hand and saying politely, "You mind if I have this?" This is one of those films that is better than the novel it's based on. James M. Caine seemed to have even less time for flowery prose than Hammet or Hemingway. "She did this. Then she did that. Then she looked there." Could he have sent the ms. to his publishers as an unusually long telegraph?The ending is an improvement over the novel as well. Instead of committing joint suicide the lovers deliberately double-cross and murder one another, which is more in keeping with their previously established characters. It probably is more congruent with the director's sentiments too. Fred MacMurray, the Illinois sax player, was given a good deal of credit for his performance, as dramatic as it is and as remote from his usual type, but it doesn't stand up that well. He's competent. But when he wants to project an emotion he does so like a hunting dog, some kind of setter, aiming at it bluntly. In his conversations with Keyes, whenever Keyes seems to be catching on to something, MacMurray stands sort of crabwise and looks out of the corners of his eyes, as if trying to alert the audience to the fact that, "I am now concerned and a little suspicious." Barbara Stanwyck comes as close as she can to a sex bomb, which has never been very close, except perhaps in "Ball of Fire," and the puffy blonde wig and tight sweaters don't help very much. Tom Powers, as the unpleasant husband, has a face that suggests he spent some time in the ring. Jean Heather is pretty in a corn-fed kind of way but doesn't light up the screen. Actually, the most interesting character in the film is Nino Zachetti. He provokes unusual reactions in others. He's a real loser. Flunked out of USC pre-med, waits on tables, treats his girl like dirt, insults people on first meeting them, conspires with Phyllis against Lola and Walter while evidently enjoying her favors, and probably is unkind to small animals. Yet Lola's love for him endures. And Walter muses about Nino, "Maybe he's not as bad as he seems." I suspect the real tragedy takes place after Walter and Phyllis are dead and the movie ends. I see a marriage taking place, after which Lola becomes a bored, unhappy drudge and Nino Zachetti turns into a coarse, alcoholic wife abuser who spends all his time brooding over revenge fantasies that somehow revolve around USC Medical School.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An impressive and tough piece of noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Returning to his office late one night, insurance salesman Walter Neff picks up his tape recorder and begins to record a message to his boss Barton Keyes. The message is a confession of a crime that Walter has committed and starts the day he made a casual sales call to businessman Dietrichson. It was here where Neff first met the beautiful and playful Mrs Phyllis Dietrichson and started to flirt with her. When she invites him back another day to sign papers he goes like a dog on heat but recoils when she floats the idea that he help her take out a hefty accident policy without his knowledge. However Phyllis is very persuasive and soon he decides to not only help sign her husband up but help to kill him in such a way that she will gain the maximum money but not arouse the suspicion of the insurance investigators.Not a name that I really associate with noir or tough drama, this Billy Wilder film was a real joy to watch as it delivers a noir story with plenty of sharp dialogue and tough acting. The story sees Neff being seduced by Phyllis and getting drawn into "the perfect crime" which quickly turns sour once his boss Keyes starts sniffing around it. It works on several levels, not the least of which is the sexual power that the audience sees shifting in the early stages. At the start it appears that Neff has all the power as he flirtatiously circles Phyllis, however soon his panting is soon turned on him but the script does well to keep him from knowing it and instead has him continue thinking he has the power. It is a genre staple but it works well here and the characters, although cookie-cutter, are good. Following genre lines, the film builds up to the crime before seeing it crumble and, although we know the rough outcome due to the narrator-structuring it is still engaging as it develops and we follow Neff as he gets in over his head.Wilder's direction is solid and he uses shadow really well, easily moving the action away from the sharp daylight where we first see Neff and Phyllis meet. Wilder's script is beefed up by Chandler and together they have produced plenty of tough but convincing dialogue which gives the film a real hard edge to it and befits the genre. The cast also fit the genre well. MacMurray is hardly the most emotive man in the world but he is perfect here as a tough nut who falls in due to desire. He works well with Stanwyck who is good as the femme fatale even if she didn't totally convince me all the time. That said she was playful and manipulative most of the time, which is what the character needed. Robinson steals his scenes with a colourful and lively performance that contrast well with the darker scenes.Overall this is a classic piece of noir with all the genre staples accounted for and done really well. Easily engaging and enjoyable with fine direction and solid performances and well worth a watch for those familiar or unfamiliar with the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Double Indemnity" is considered by many to be among the best, if not the best of the "film noire" genre of the 1940s and 1950s. I agree. It has all of the classic elements of film noire: the helpless (or hapless) hero, the femme fatale, moody lighting, dark shadows and the story unfolding mostly at night.Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is a successful insurance salesman who happens to drop in on his clients, the Dietrichsons to discuss renewal of an automobile insurance policy. Mr. Dietrichson (Tom Powers) is not at home however, his wife Phyllis (Barbara Stanwyck) is. Neff is immediately attracted to her and puts the moves on her. She questions him about the benefits of life insurance but repels his advances while continuing to give him the come on.Neff leaves but is surprised later when there's a knock on his door and there stands Phyllis. Slowly she seduces Walter and they appear to fall in love. The lovers plot to have Dietrichson sign up for a large life insurance policy and the plan to murder him. Walter being an insurance expert plans the murder in such a way that not only will Phyllis collect double indemnity for an accidental death or his boss Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) will not become suspicious.After the murder things start to unravel. A witness, Mr. Jackson turns up in Keyes office and Keyes suspicions are aroused. At first he believes that the death was a suicide but later learns that Dietricson's daughter Lola's (Jean Heather) boyfriend Nino (Byron Barr) may be implicated in the murder. Neff becomes nervous and finds out that..............The principals all turn in classic performances. MacMurray, cast against type, as the lustful Neff is outstanding. Stanwyck in a blond wig is the ultimate femme fatale using all of the males to her own advantage. Robinson steals every scene he is in as the persistent claims manager.Director Billy Wilder gets the best out of his cast and gives us a classic film. Told in flashback from Walter Neff's point of view we know right away that something has gone horribly wrong but Wilder keeps the audience in suspense and glued to their seats as the Neff dictates his confession to Keyes into a Dictaphone.An absolute classic of this or any other genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent!!! A Noir masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot say enough good things about this film, it is perfect as far as movies go, it stands up perfectly after more than 60 years! This was the film that convinced me that older or "classic" films were not only watchable, but most of the best movies ever made were made decades ago. I remember watching this film on TV for the first time, years ago, and I could not stop watching it. It made no sense to me, the film was old, black and white, and they talked funny, yet I sat there stunned by it's brilliance. Looking back on it now, it makes sense that I enjoyed it so much (and still do) the story and acting are great, the direction and dialogue, although dated is excellent. The direction of the masterful Billy Wilder truly makes this film explode with taut, sexy, and dangerous energy. Fred MacMurray is surprisingly excellent as the insurance salesman, Walter Neff. He makes a house call to one of his customers, only to find him not at home. However what he does find is the dangerous and sexy Phyllis Dietrichson, played by Barbara Stanwyck. They fall for one another and hatch a plot that involves murder and insurance fraud. However when all is not as it seems Walter wants out, he suspects he may be just another sucker that is being used by the temptress Mrs. Dietrichson. However as Walter finds out, and as his friend and enemy Barton Keyes,(Edward G. Robinson) tells him, "committing murder is not like taking a trolley ride together where they can get off at different stops. They're stuck with each other and they've got to ride all the way to the end of the line and it's a one-way trip and the last stop is the cemetery." Walter tries to get off of that trolley but soon realizes that Keyes warning was prophetic.There are many suspenseful twists and turns that I will not divulge here, cause I want everyone who watches this film for the first time, to enjoy it as I did. However I will say that this is an excellent film, the very definition of film-noir. Wilder tells an amazing story in a very suspenseful manner, and the script and acting are very intelligent. This film crackles along with suspense, intrigue and romance. And it is a perfect time capsule of the period in which film-noir was born and achieved it's great success. Overall very entertaining and highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Match is Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Filmviewing is like most things in life: there are a few predefined roles among which it is convenient to pick. Once you define who you are in the world of cinema, it determines a lot of what you think about what you have just experienced. One of these roles is the type who by watching a film becomes part of its original audience, or rather a stylized nostalgic notion of what that audience was. Thus the film is a mere trigger, not necessarily important itself. There seem to be lots of these, people who consider this film as not only enjoyable, but the apogee of film noir, which itself is (in this view) the most movie-like of movies. Noir, romances and musicals attract these folks, as do legendary celebrities.You may be one of these types, but I am not. I expect the film to transport me to its own world, not the world of original viewers. As a noir classic, it fails for me. I do think the dictaphone framing is very effective, and the thumblighting of the matches. Also of historical note is the then odd perspective on the detective form: at the beginning you know who did it. You soon learn why. How isn't very interesting. The way the detective gets the scent is purely conventional, but the focus on the hapless perpetrator was relatively novel in its time. The game is one of following this hapless goof through his ensnarement in forces beyond his control. His strong (and we learn misplaced) cockiness, apparent through the aggressive banter is the stylistic spice that is supposed to carry the notion.But that device is pretty thin stuff. And except for the dictaphone bits, the dialog and acting are poor by conventional standards. Stanwyck isn't seductive or particularly deep. I fail to see how the lighting could be considered masterful, when so many other noir masters are around. `Touch of Evil' is excessive, but that's the point with noir -- at least noir that works today.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Double Indemnity is a 1944 film noir, directed by Billy Wilder, co-written by Wilder and Raymond Chandler, and produced by Buddy DeSylva and Joseph Sistrom. The screenplay was based on James M. Cain's 1943 novella of the same name, which originally appeared as an eight-part serial in Liberty magazine.The film stars Fred MacMurray as an insurance salesman, Barbara Stanwyck as a provocative housewife who wishes her husband were dead, and Edward G. Robinson as a claims adjuster whose job is to find phony claims. Double Indemnity was nominated for seven Academy Awards but did not win any. Widely regarded as a classic, it is often cited as a paradigmatic film noir and as having set the standard for the films that followed in that genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Yes, I killed him. I killed him for money - and a woman - and I didn't get the money and I didn't get the woman."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DOUBLE INDEMNITY is a movie in which the atmosphere, suspense and power of dialogue break new ground. The story is basically a cold, even in scenes of heated fake passion. Murder is mutual pleasure and greatest passion. Insurance salesman who embarks on a dangerous game of love with a femme fatale who persuades him to murder. The truth is quite the marketing savvy. Fiction is all too appropriate. Psychological game and fear of the truth is perhaps the most realistic described.Deception is the key word.The film is an example of the genre. The story is strong and interesting. The dialogues are so rich that it is simply cut into the memory. The script is special, and I think it's just one of the great elements in this film.Women incapable of emotion and love. Man created for the perfect crime. Maybe the other way around. Romance is certainly not convincing. I have a feeling that the main characters are poisoned with psychological tendencies and perfect moments. Love and money are only intermediaries. I've already stated what the real pleasure.Fred MacMurray as Walter Neff, his performance is very good. Narration through flashbacks is somewhat uncertain. I think he works too freely in the film. Such a person rarely falls under the charms of some beauty. He is capable of killing and planned murder. The stillness of his body is amazing. Changes in the tension, excitement or disappointment they feel in his voice. Barbara Stanwyck as Phyllis Dietrichson was really great. Phyllis is not a happy woman, nor ever can be. The destruction of everything around her mode of existence. What has led to such an emotional state? Here's a little characterization. Stanwyck is blonde !? I am unlike most positively surprised. Yes, ankles are sexy but still .... Edward G. Robinson as Barton Keyes acts a bit unreal. As it is always one step ahead. I'd copied dedication to his work. Difficult and irritable character with specific humor.Intriguing, brilliant and at times disturbing crime game. I'm thrilled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Wilder's Classic Film-Noir Opus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've finally watched this today for the first time, and I was really surprised by how flawless this classic noir was made. Talk about great acting and entertaining story-line - Billy Wilder was on the road to Hollywood greatness before making his Academy Award-winning The Lost Weekend (1945) a year later. Although the film was based on a novel, the film is told in flashbacks as a salesman falls for a mistress for which he becomes involved with murdering her husband and pretend if it he was killed in an accident. Barbara Stanwyck makes quite a beautiful impression while Fred MacMurray brilliantly portrays in a main dramatic role and Edward G. Robinson also joins in the mystery. There is lot of neatly-crafted camera-work and a memorable musical score to make it enough to be an instant masterpiece of the genre, and cannot ever forget to mention great mystery writer Raymond Chandler co-wrote the screenplay with Wilder as well. In other words overall, this is my new most favorite effort from Wilder after seeing some of his well-known works for over a decade now.My Rating: 5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WHAT CAN BE said about perfection? That is we are talking about what is a true prototype of the successful bit of Noir. All the elements required are carefully chosen, crafted and assembled; fitting neatly together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.THE PLAYERS FROM top to bottom are molded into a single minded, force with one purpose; that being tell the story. Do it with such a reckless abandon and infused with the scale and full range of emotion; heavily leaning on the dark-side, of course.IN ADDITION TO THE outstanding performances by Miss Barbara Stawick and Edward G. Robinson, the big news is of the third main player. Fred Mac Murray's portrayal of Walter Neff is brought out with out any noticeable flaw or weakness. He is at once strong yet spineless, loyal yet immoral (or perhaps amoral).IT IS AN interesting item to point out that of all the probably hundreds of roles that Mr. Mac Murray essayed, only three were of characters who were less than admirable. They are: Mr. Keifer in THE CAIN MUTINY, Mr. Sheldrake in THE APARTMENT and Walter Neff in DOUBLE INDEMNITY.THE CHARACTERIZATION WENT off so well that one would think that he'd done it all of his career; being a sort of Boris Karloff, Ralph Meeker or even a Rhondo Hatton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was another difficult film for me to review. Stylistically it is very strong. It is easy to see why it is regarded as a classic in its genre. The black-and-white filter makes the film dramatic and tense. I also really liked how the film is narrated by the protagonist. This added an energy to the film and made it engaging to watch. This notwithstanding, Double Indemnity wasn't perfect. The romance between the two lead characters felt forced and the film didn't engage me throughout. I was bored at times.

		<shortDescription>The best femme fatale movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Double Indemnity is a smart movie for most part. I say for most part because it somehow assumes that the public does not know about fingerprint identification or the fact that strangulation leaves marks on a victims neck. The murder in this movie is handled rather poorly from a technical perspective. Everything else around it is sharp and interesting. The movie is smart on an emotional level more than on a technical level.The main character dictates the story into a recorder, explaining what happened before each scene. He also explains straight from the start that he kills someone. You would think that this spoils the plot and any tension, but it does not, as the narrator only gives a brief description.In fact, the movie become quite tense towards the second half. At the beginning you are shown the situation of the main character being wounded and all the way until the end of the film you have a but a faint idea of how it may have happened. The story is quite good at keeping you sucked in.There are a couple of very good acting jobs here and a couple not so good ones. There is a gentleman, Richard Gaines, who plays the head of the insurance company. You do not see him for long but he had a very strange delivery of lines. Among the more well known actors is Edward Robinson (Little Caesar, Key Largo) as the claims adjuster and it is a delight to watch this sharp observant character. Barbara Stanwyck is the next strongest character as the main dame of the film, while the main male character played by Fred MacMurray is probably one of the weakest, with his typical film-noir delivery and saying "baby" all the time (quickly as if the word accidentally falls out of his mouth, like he is a Tourette's patient).There is nothing particularly outstanding about the music or visuals, other than it is all competent. The movie is well paced; the tension is good and the writing is fine as long as you do not mind a little bit of 40s stylization, like when the lady stares up at the guy with teary eyes and the screen is blurry as the dramatic violins play. I am not a big fan of that, but there is no denying that Double Indemnity is one of the strongest femme fatale movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a 1944 film noir, which was directed by Billy Wilder. It starrs Fred MacMurray (Walter Neff, insurance salesman) and Barbara Stanwyck (Phyllis Dietrichson, housewife).This was a very interesting film. Walter Neff is an insurance salesman is first introduced to Phyllis Dietrichson, when he makes a house call to remind Mr. Dietrichson that his insurance needs to be renewed. When he leaves the Dietrichson's house, he thinks to himself "Murder smells like Honeysuckle"...This is a great film. You have your typical house wife, who is greedy and wants her husbands money and will stop at nothing to get it. She smooches up to Neff, so show she is interested in him and loves him, however in the end that is not the case. They scheme up a plan to kill Mr. Dietrichson, by making it look like an accident. However so many people are suspicious of this. Mr. Dietrichson's daughter, Lola thinks her stepmother had something to do with her fathers death, as well as the death of her mother.The film did not end the way I thought it would, but the twist was rather interesting. You'll have to watch it to see for yourself.</fullReview>

Then after the murder, all the nice twists come crashing in one after another. The finale turns to be a nice job, and looks somewhat like a repentance. The acting is an okay overall. Barbara Stanwyck depicted the cunning seductress very well, acting out the phony emotions smoothly.

		<fullReview>Double Indemnity was a good film noir that is worth checking out. Like all film noir genres it had the basic aspect necessary to make it a true film noir. It had the man that is tricked by the fem-fatal into killing for her and making sure that she was going to benefit greatly from it. Instead of a detective like some film noires the trick man was an insurance sales man on a routine call. The fem-fatal was his clients wife who seduces him within their first encounter and tricks him into believing she will be with him if he just helps get rid of her husband. The come up with the idea of taking a life insurance policy out on her husband and then faking his accidental death to get double the money on a "Double Indemnity" clause in the policy and it is here that the get the name for the movie. Unfortunately everything goes as planned except on person feels their is foul play and that is the insurance sales mans co worker. The wife in the end shoots the insurance sales man in an act of true betrayal. He stumbles to his office after being shot and records his confession to his co-worker and plans to escape but dies before he can make it to the elevator.Bottom line it is a good movie that uses lighting to really set the mood and if you like film noir genre it is worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect film with great, snappy dialogue (Mild Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(NOTE: This review has mild spoilers, it doesn't spoiler everything, but I would possibly recommend watching the film first). I was left completely speechless. From the opening shot to the absolutely genius ending shot, this film drew me in. The film begins with Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), an insurance salesman who returns to his office building one night and begins to record a message for a colleague at his work, Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson). All we know from the start is that Walter has committed murder, we have no access to other details which gives the film a perfect setup to make the viewer be extremely curious as to what is going on. Afterwards, it begins to be told in flashback as Walter records his message which allows for narration that does not feel forced because well, he's recording a message. Right off the bat, I noticed how great the fast, snappy dialogue was as Walter meets and begins a conversation with Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). This fast dialogue is a huge advantage to the film because not only does it allow for smartly written lines and a well-paced film, it even allows for the occasional moment of comic relief because it never feels out of place. Walter and Phyllis eventually seem to like each other even though Phyllis is married, she hates her husband, he's always drunk, never talks to her, and sometimes even beats her. Walter is there to talk insurance but Phyllis' husband is not there, Walter decides to take the opportunity to flirt with Phyllis. She brushes him off at first but eventually meets him at his home. This meeting at Walter's home leads to the two deciding to kill Phyllis' husband and using the double indemnity clause for insurance to allow Phyllis' to get $100,000 rather than $50,000 by making it seem Walter's death was an accident. This is all only in maybe the first twenty minutes which displays how ingenious the film's dialogue is, it allows for a lot to get done in a short amount of time. The performances by the two leads are incredible, you can always see in the two leads eyes that something isn't right. Phyllis has a cold, sinister look in her eyes throughout. Walter has a look of confidence but eventual worry as the murder plays out. Easily one of the best aspects of the film is the amazing use of shadows which is a staple in the classic noir genre. Not only is it used as a piece of characterization, but it's used to give the film a beautiful, unique, stylistic look that could more than likely only be done in black and white. Throughout the film, Walter lights a match for Barton Keyes for his cigarettes and I was wondering throughout, "Why would they keep on showing that?" And on the final shot, I understood. It allowed for a genius parallel in what is probably one of my favorite final shots of a film ever due to its simplicity and use of said parallel. If anything, this is a definitive piece of cinema. Not only is it filled with some of the best twists in film with double crossing and smart writing, it is stuffed with genius camera work, perfect performances, and snappy dialogue that gives the film a unique touch and great pacing. Ultimately, this is a film that anyone who loves a good mystery should watch but most importantly, anybody who studies film, should give this one a watch. This is filmmaking perfection at it's finest.</fullReview>

This movie is one of the best film Noir has to offer, in my opinion. All the elements are there. Walter Neff, played by Fred MacMurray, is a slick salesmen who gets caught up with a femme fatale named Phyllis Dietrichson, played by Barbara Stanwyck. MacMurray makes the film with his concise and crisp acting style.The story is told as a flashback. We see Walter Neff making a confession and recalling the whole story. This adds a sense of excitement to the story as we know it does not end well for Walter and we are on the edge of our seat waiting for something to happen. This film will grab you from the start and keep you locked in for the ride. Great film Noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't really into this movie at first, but i liked it more and more as the story unfolded. Barbara Stanwyck was the perfect femme fatale. She was also great in "The Lady Eve" with the amazing Henry Fonda, directed Preston Sturges. Fred MacMurray was great as well. His voice was just right and the voice over narration really pulled the film together. Fred MacMurray who play's Keyes is another great actor who played a detective in Orson Welles' "The Stranger".I can defiantly see the director of the 2005 movie "Sin City" taking some of Double Indemnity's Film-Noir qualities and using them in his film. Dwight played by Clive Owen sounds a lot like Fred Macmurray's character Walter and it's the same style voice over narration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Femme fatale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was different in that it was a mystery/crime drama, yet you are shown who the killer is in the very beginning. At first I wondered what could be left of the movie without the looming suspense and mystery, but there was surprisingly a lot more to it to enjoy. The relationship and chemistry between Walter and Phyllis is attractive and perfect. Barton was my favorite character in the film, however. He was an entertaining person and his presence added a lot of tension to the storyline. The ending was already known and accepted by the audience throughout the entire film, yet the ending still had an element of surprise. I really thoroughly enjoyed this film; I have an affinity for femme fatales, but either way I think this movie was very well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is an insurance salesman. He falls is love with Mrs. Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). She talks him into having her husband sign an insurance policy that pays double indemnity--if he dies by accident. Naturally they're going to murder him and split the money. But everything goes wrong.Next to "Out of the Past" this is one of the best film noirs ever. The script is smart, the dialogue sharp, it moves quickly and is beautifully directed by Billy Wilder. However it's the acting that puts this over. MacMurray (who's mostly known for his wholesome Disney films) is just great as Neff. Stanwyck is perfect as the femme fatale. You can see her covering up the evil in herself. Edward G. Robinson plays Neff's boss Barton Keyes. He has the best dialogue and presents it in a very fast, hard-hitting way. Basically there's nothing wrong with this film except for one minor detail. MacMurray is supposed to be single but he's always wearing a wedding band! That small detail aside it's a perfect film noir. A 10 all the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wilder At His Best !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While a bewigged Barbara Stanwyck makes an unforgettable femme fatale in director Billy Wilder's hardboiled murder/mystery "Double Indemnity," Fred MacMurray making an equally persuasive patsy. A cigar-smoking Edward G. Robinson of "Little Caesar" is just as effective when they aren't on screen as the hero's superior of sorts. Robinson qualifies as the chief adversity because our hero and heroine are the conspirators in the murder case. Legendary whodunit novelist Raymond Chandler of Philip Marlowe fame adapted James Cain's gritty account about a murder most foul. The dialogue is juicy stuff with a pervasive sense of irony. Basically, a well-heeled insurance agent, Pacific Risk Insurance Agent Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray of "The Apartment"), and the glamorous young wife of a recent widower plot the death of her husband. Phyllis Dietrichson wants to do away with her husband because he cries foul each time she drops his money on her wardrobe. The indignant husband cannot understand why a woman in California would need a hat. Phyllis confides her lack of marital bliss in Walter during one of his visits at the Dietrichson residence and utters nothing positive about her husband and his daughter from his previous marriage. Matters get out of hand when Walter sells Phyllis a double indemnity policy on her husband without his knowledge. Walter fools him into signing what is a copy of his auto policy. The sizzling romance between the two premeditated killers and Stanwyck's rampant sexuality make "Double Indemnity" a memorable movie. Our misguided hero knows that he wants this devious dame from the moment he spots her anklet as she trots down the stairs. The only thing contrived about this outstanding epic is the way that Walter's apartment door opens out into the corridor instead of vice-versa. The door opening the wrong way is key to a scene when Phyllis tries to visit Walter after they have murdered her husband. Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) makes an unexpected appearance at Walter's apartment after Phyllis has told Walter that she is sneaking over to see him. Despite its flashback conceit with Walter Neff recording his murderous exploits on Keyes' Dictaphone, "Double Indemnity" is a slick, calculated thriller. Incredibly, nobody noticed until post-production that MacMurray was still wearing his wedding band. The character of Walter Neff is a single man who lives alone by himself. Wilder stages the death of the husband while the killers are transporting the husband to the train depot. Neff has concealed himself behind the front seat and waits patiently for the moment to throttle Mr. Dietrichson. When he kills the husband, Wilder keeps the camera aimed on the impassive Phyllis. "Double Indemnity" has several chilling moments. People turn up at the worst time imaginable when the killers show up at the train depot. Wilder plays things pretty seriously except for some of the smart aleck dialogue and a scene in the insurance owner's office when he makes a buffoon out of himself. Predictably, things unravel for everybody at the end. Cain was a popular crime novelist when "Double Indemnity" came out. He wrote what later became the Joan Crawford masterpiece "Mildred Pierce." He also penned the steamy, sordid novel "The Postman Always Rings Twice." All three are exceptional films, and "The Postman Always Rings Twice" is the best. Nevertheless, if you haven't seen "Double Indemnity, you've missed a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the indemnified person always rings twice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While watching Billy Wilder's "Double Indemnity", I quickly figured out that it has a plot similar to that of "The Postman Always Rings Twice" (which makes sense, since James M. Cain wrote both of them). But the similarity doesn't at all subtract from this story of an insurance salesman (Fred MacMurray) who conspires with an unhappy wife (Barbara Stanwyck) to murder her husband. The seedy environs of 1930s Los Angeles combine with Stanwyck's ability to practically breathe sexiness to make a perfect movie. Probably the most interesting role goes to Edward G. Robinson, playing a claims adjuster who looks for phony claims. I've been used to seeing him play gangsters, and here he's the character who just might throw a wrench into the main characters' plan.One of the most effective scenes is when Stanwyck's character first appears and then descends the staircase. The camera angle tells as much as words do. It's just one of many things that make this a perfect movie. All involved had every reason to be proud of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Kabbalistic Four Viewers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this is great and not in the way usually publicized. The second viewing unlocked for me. Of course! it's a film that begins with a storyteller phoning it in.Okay, so it's pretty great for all the obvious reasons; deceit and counter-deceit, sizzling chemistry between the players, sex all in the promise, crushing shadows everywhere. The rundown of traditional noir elements. It's The Maltese Falcon spinned in a different way, but more on that in a while.Now, like Huston, Wilder was a writer first, a talented one, and the film was usually finished on the page, then gears were brought around to illustrate a world. The story goes that Wilder was a big womanizer, and this made Raymond Chandler - co-writer on this - very uncomfortable.So one fundamental attribute that makes this so enjoyable is getting to note sex behind doors, for instance the cut from Phyllis in Walter's home crying on his shoulder to the shot, on the same couch, of Walter sprawled and enjoying a smoke while Phyllis looks a little flushed.The noir meat of the thing is so iconic it really warrants little mention. This type of film happens because the man desires, often some sort of investigator, and so a man tasked with watching, observing coldly and without emotion. Desire bends clear sight of the world and he finds himself embroiled in all kinds of mischief that transforms the visible reality. But see, the night is all in the mind, because desired that way.Now Falcon, arguably the first epochal film noir, was also about a man tasked with seeing clearly into a web of deceit, the catch was that no one including the viewer was really sure whether he does or not, the plot being a puzzle, because he strutted around like an actor blustering his way into the plot with a show he puts or stories he makes up on the spot. It was a joy to watch because nearly every one else was in on it, riffing together and enjoying the show. It was never about the bird, rather in turns weaving a story about it and commenting on how ridiculous.This is something else. Unlike Spade, none of the main participants is really master of his fate or the story. What sets them apart, is that only two are responsible for the story and the others about watching and commenting.The first is easy to spot. Neff and Phyllis go to work on setting up a plot that will anticipate the scrutiny of the man tasked with solving them. Keyes is our surrogate viewer, standing in for an audience experienced in this type of film. Of course we're seeing both ways, and spend most of the time waiting for this on-screen viewer to catch up.The other half of this equation is what is really marvellous. There is more than one viewer, at least four that I could count.Each of these four viewers is a distinct type of cinematic viewer. All four know something is wrong with the story. All four lack definitive proof. The company boss imagines a plot but imagines it wrong and really sets the case back. The daughter has seen a crucial bit that neither we nor the storymakers have, but has poor reasoning skills and confesses it to the wrong man - Neff of course takes her on a ride with another story. Keyes has superb reasoning skills and has really nailed the plot by the end but is thrown off by emotion that his partner of 11 years is the missing link.The fourth is the man with the cigar who was on the back of the train, the 'observation platform'. He has not seen a face but can plainly trust his eye to guide him. Not being embroiled in narratives, having a clear mind on the case, he is free to call things the way he saw them - the man was of so and so height, age, build..This makes for a superb essay on different modes of viewing, with imagination at the bottom and leading up to a true perception into the nature of things, past attachments and emotion-narratives of the mind. Put another way, every time you watch something and your imagination wanders, you get it wrong. Every time you watch with attachment, you also get it wrong. The only way is seeing-only.It makes for a perfect Buddhist parable. Wilder being Jewish, I am inclined to think that the more fitting connection is kabbalistic and mapping to the Four Worlds.Something to meditate upon.Noir Meter: 4/4 - pitch black</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If 'Citizen Kane' is the best film of the 40's, Double Indemnity is the most enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing this classic yet innovative noir, two thoughts hit me. The first is the typical reaction when you see excellent old movies: "Wow, they certainly don't make 'em like this anymore!". But then, something that sets Double Indemnity apart in the crowd, even among the top classics: "Wow, this movie has me nailed to the screen from the VERY BEGINNING and until the end!".For those of us growing up in the 80's and 90's, watching "old movies" (unfortunate term, sorry) can be a bore. Let's be honest: Our attention span sucks, and a lot of the classics simply moves in a tempo we're not used to. Add to that a plot that typically only gets interesting 45 minutes in, and it's not looking good.Double indemnity is different. Yes, you cannot get away from the "slowness" of old films, but damn - this movie gets going from the very first scene, it hooks you, and never lets go until the surprising ending! The insurance fraud story is dead simple to follow, yet complex enough to allow for unexpected turns, ? la Fargo.Cinematography reaches typical noir greatness. Music is subtle and doesn't take away your attention unlike some other classics. Acting is top notch, and has a subtle touch to it. Make no mistake about it: This movie holds up VERY WELL, even in 2011.Citizen Kane might be the 1940's greatest - hell, many consider it the best movie period. But that's largely because of its complex, ahead-of-its-time narrative structure and innovative cinematography.But as far as just watching a classic film that's surprising, funny, enjoyable and - let's not forget - incredibly suspenseful throughout - Double Indemnity might just be the best there is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this movie is the very definition of film-noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I think of just what film-noir is, I think of love triangles, a femme-fa tale, dimly lit sets. lights and shadows, slick operators looking to score and finally, some desperate crime born of their lust and depravity. Double Indemnity contains all these elements and defines this genre better than any movie I've ever seen. I have to give this movie a 10 and not because I like giving perfect scores but because of the towering performances of three of the all time great actors of American film as well the masterful directing and writing of Billy Wilder. I've been a big Billy Wilder fan for some years now and I believe this is his masterpiece.Wilder directed and co-wrote (with Raymond Chandler) Double Indemnity, and worked hard to convince the two stars, Barbara Stanwyck and Fred McMurray to overcome their hesitancy and join him in this endeavor. Both didn't like the idea of playing these shady characters, but because they did we end up with possibly the best acting trio (along with Edward G. Robinson) ever in one film. Bold statement yes, but I'm talking about PERFECT casting here...straight down the line.Stanwyck plays Phyllis Dietrichson, she's married to an older man who she detests and one day a wise-cracking insurance salesman named Walter Neff (McMurray) comes to the door and they begin talking...or should I say flirting. This marvelous introductory scene is the essence of film-noir, filled with fast lines with double meanings and it really captivates us right from the start. Phyllis asks about accident insurance for her husband and the banter continues and then Neff leaves. He leaves, but hes hooked (as are we), and later Phyllis stops by his apartment and they get closer and start plotting. Wouldn't it be nice if they could knock off her hubby and split the insurance payout?What a premise; this is the ultimate film-noir plot setup. They start meeting secretly and planning, meanwhile Neff tries to keep his prying (and extremely perceptive) boss Keyes (Robinson) at arms length. Edward G. Robinson, playing against type as an all-consumed, almost anal claims investigator, gives a performance that is truly the foundation of this film. Stanwyck, to me is maybe the most talented all-around actress in Hollywood history and the extremely under-rated McMurray (also cast against type) displays an easy charm that covers up his building anxiety, and they are both fantastic, but Robinson absolutely shines as the insurance scam expert who claims the "little man in my stomach" won't let him rest easy. There's a brilliant scene where Keyes shoots down his bosses' idea of the crime being a suicide by quoting statistics from actuary tables and you'd think at the time he was in on the plot with Neff (of course we know he isn't) because he is so convincing and compelling. I really think its one of the greatest supporting performances ever in film.We get some of the little plot twists that we'd expect in a film-noir, as Walter and Phyllis decide whether they should even contact each other until the heat dies down. Walter at times seems to be coming completely unglued while Phyllis' cold, conniving exterior is hiding secrets she hasn't told anyone. The great fun in watching Double Indemnity is just watching these incredible stars do their thing. There aren't any shoot-outs or big explosions or effects like you see in todays films, instead there is the charisma of three extremely talented actors who absolutely radiate their skills in the hands of one the best directors in history.So sit back and enjoy a masterpiece of film. This is what movies used to be about when acting, writing and directing were often honed to perfection.BTW..If you like this film and want some other Wilder films try; The Lost Weekend (Ray Milland) or Stalag 17 or Sunset Blvd (William Holden) or The Apartment (Jack Lemmon)...These are all critically acclaimed and all of these except Stalag 17 are on the AFI Top 100 list....but (to me) Double Indemnity is the best of them all, enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often times, if you want a good mystery, you have to go back to the 40's and 50's, rightfully known as The Golden Age of Hollywood. In today's world, which is filled with talentless tabloid kings and queens posing as actors, studios that are too afraid to do anything new, and directors who overdo camera tricks to adapt the story for the most inattentive viewer, good movies, especially thrillers, are hard to find. If you want a good thriller, then see "Double Indemnity."The film is told in flashback, with a wounded man confessing to his crime. That man is Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), an insurance salesman who falls for a put-upon housewife named Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). Together, they plan to kill Phyllis's husband (Tom Powers) and collect on a huge insurance claim. But as perfect as their plan seems to be, thing's don't go the way they thought they would.The acting is outstanding all around. I was surprised to learn from Robert Osborne's intro that Fred MacMurray was known for his romantic comedies. MacMurray is outstanding; he's perfect in a noir thriller (even rivaling, if not besting, Humphrey Bogart). Barbara Stanwyck is brilliant as the femme fatale, Phyllis Dietrichson. Actually, calling her that isn't exactly true. For the most part, she's just as nervous and desperate as Walter is, although there is more to her than Walter initially realizes. It's amazing that Stanwyck, who was by all accounts a kind and gentle person off-screen, could pull off a role like this. Edward G. Morrow nearly didn't accept the role because after recently securing leads, he didn't want to give the impression that his career was on the downturn by taking a supporting role. It's a good thing that he took it, because Morrow is pitch-perfect in the role of Barton Keyes, Walter's boss. Actually, after watching him in "Key Largo," I didn't think I'd be able to buy him as a sympathetic character. but Morrow pulls it off. When Walter says that Barton is a gruff man with a heart, we can really see it. Able support comes from Jean Heather, as Phyllis's step-daughter, Lola and Byron Barr, as Nino Zarchetti, Lola's boyfriend.During the period of the Hays Code, most of what happens had to be done through words, not action. Therefore, it might be a little disconcerting for viewers who are not used to films from this period to find that Walter and Phyllis fall for each other without sex of any kind, and only through words. Stanwyck and MacMurray pull it off, however.It helps that the script is a masterpiece of story construction, with dialogue that occasionally borders on brilliant. There's a fair bit of humor early on, particularly a scene between Walter and Phyllis that is a conversation about speeding tickets that serves as a series of sexual innuendos. The scene is quite clever and funny, though it does not inhibit the suspense that builds potently for the rest of the film. The story is highly inventive, with plenty of twists and turns, none of which are expected.This was the third Oscar nomination for writing that Billy Wilder received, but it was the first time his skills behind the camera were so honored (he didn't win either for this film, but the very next year he took home statues for both co-writing and directing "The Lost Weekend"). It's not hard to understand why he was nominated for both for "Double Indemnity." The film is told with the hand of a master. It's rarely confusing (the ending is slightly so), and Wilder's sleight of hand is so subtle that the twists are impossible to see coming. And the tension is constant and unceasing.If you want to see a good murder mystery with great acting and actual suspense, check out one of the best Golden Oldies, "Double Indemnity."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many good films by Billy Wilder - but none top this. This is film noir's finest hour (and forty seven). Double Indemnity is dark, moody, and tight as a drum. The cinematographers really pushed the limits with this one - scene after scene we have figures illuminated only by the slightest outline or slash of light. On top of that, the story is filled with great plot twists, and great characterization. And last, but not least, the acting is top notch, particularly by Edward G. Robinson (not playing a 'heavy' for once) who delivers rapid- fire dialog on a par with Bogie's best.Movies do not get any better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Character drives Fate?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just before this one, i watched Lang's 'Ministry of Fear'. Where Lang was a man getting out of a visual world to enter another one with similar visual effects, but used in a totally different way (and there lies Lang's difficulties to enter the new world) Billy Wilder was born cinematically in the context of the noir game, was one of the best in it, and made the best film in this first phase, to me. This is his first noir (only his fourth film). You can see where he is going, and to watch this is important if not else, to understand the roots of 'Sunset Blvd.', a masterpiece of cinematic storytelling.So, a common device is the narration where the main character around whom and on the back of whom the whole story develops, narrates the whole thing (in 'sunset...' we assumed we were hearing a dead man, here he tapes his own voice, before dying). That's good, it's effective in two ways. -First it tells us where the story ends, we know that somehow, something will happen to let the character as we see him at the beginning of the film and it limits the narrative in two points. The images we first get of the character after all happens, and the the first moment of the flashback he narrates. -Also it definitely tells us who the narrator is; we Know that everything we will see is from the eyes and point of view of Neff, and specially, what we don't see he also hasn't seen.The rest is common noir game, several characters fighting for power over the action, Neff, the blond 'femme', Zachetti; one woman who is a puppet to every puppeteer, Lola, and a 'detective' who in this case is not the center of the story, instead tries to figure things we, audience, already know, and serves as an obstacle to Neff (Robinson's character).It fails in some points. I think Stanwyck doesn't have the required magnetism, and even more when she shares the screen with the marvellous Jean Heather, who poses and acts in far more interesting ways. Her character could have been explored with much more depth, she is Lola(ita!). I suppose the codes and censorship wouldn't have allowed for something really interesting to be made with her character. Zachetti is supposed to be an unimportant character who turns out to be crucial. But the fact is he doesn't matter. And the conclusion to the game is weak because it is Neff who chooses his destiny, not the other way around... HE might simply had turn his back and get away with it if it wasn't for conscience problems. He should have ended tied up but the fate which moved him all along.My opinion: 3/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the very best film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)This is a terrific movie, beautifully directed by Billy Wilder, one of his better films, and he made some very good ones. Sunset Boulevard (1950); Stalag 17 (1953); Some Like It Hot (1959); The Apartment (1960) come to mind. Note the range: a psychological mystery, a prisoners of war movie, a comedy with song and dance, and a "sophisticated" comedy. He could make any kind of film. He had a knack for getting the best out of the players and he never forgot his audience.Double Indemnity is no exception. Fred MacMurray stars as Walter Neff, a morally-compromised insurance salesman who just couldn't resist the opportunity to outsmart the insurance business, and he was never better. Most people remember him from more light-hearted fare, e.g., The Shaggy Dog (1959); The Absent-Minded Professor (1961); and perhaps especially The Egg and I (1947) with Claudette Colbert. Barbara Stanwyck, whose career spanned six decades, was also excellent as the sociopathic Phyllis Dietrickson. Edward G. Robinson, who practically defined the Hollywood gangster from the thirties and forties, switches type and does an outstanding job as Barton Keyes, a sleuthful insurance claims manager.The script was adapted from James M. Cain's second novel, a follow-up to his enormously successful The Postman Always Rings Twice (1934). That too was made into a movie, in fact two movies, but neither one was anywhere near as good as this classic film noir. Wilder employs the convention of the voice-over (something he would use again very successfully in Sunset Boulevard) by having Walter Neff ("Walter Huff" in the novel) tell the story into a Dictaphone as a confessional memo addressed to his admired pal and mentor Keyes. He didn't get the girl and he didn't get the money, he says. Strange but we can see he didn't really want the girl or the money. What he wanted was the admiration of Keyes. At any rate that's the way Wilder played it, and it worked big time. If you read the book you'll discover that Wilder (along with Raymond Chandler, who co-wrote the script) changed a number of things from the way Cain had them, especially the ending--all to the better. In fact the movie is significantly better than the novel, which isn't usually the case.One of the things I was thinking while watching this was that it was actually as "perfect" a murder scheme as you'll see on the silver screen, although everything had to go just right. There was only one flaw, as Wilder saw it. He has Edward G. Robinson express it something like this: When a man buys an accidental death insurance policy and then dies an accidental death a few short weeks later, it ain't no accident.Don't miss this one, one of the all-time best film noir and a jewel in the crown of Billy Wilder, one of filmland's greatest directors. Would that we had another like him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This ultra classic film noir is one of the great pictures of all time. Absolutely spellbinding in its acting, direction, script, dialogue, photography and especially music by Miklos Rosza (the king of film scoring to me!). This is what movie making is all about. How on earth Macmurray and Robinson didn't receive oscar nominations at the time is completely unbelievable. Even more so considering that Bing Crosby won best actor that year(1944) for 'Going My Way'! Incredibly, they even nominated Barry Fitzgerald in both the Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor Category (which he fairly won). How ludicrous when great performances like those mentioned in 'Double Indemnity' were overlooked. The Academy should have been ashamed. At least Barbara Stanwyck was nominated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Double Indemnity is a film buff's dream motion picture. The script is outstanding, the story is riveting, the acting outstanding. A lot of credit must be given to Billy Wilder for his first rate direction. It will give you the feel of Sunset Boulevard but has its own special appeal. It is not predictable and will keep you guessing throughout. This is truly one of our greatest American movies. As a bonus, you will see several street scenes of Los Angeles in 1944. Get a load of those old stop signs. Don't miss this classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my God! What laughable writing and dialog!! Its like of a spoof of itself. The story is OK, but is totally ruined by the writing and over-the-top acting. From start to end, its nothing but silly, catchy phrases you'd expect in a spoof on 40's detective movies. The required IQ for understanding the dialog is 40 or more, so do not be worried about following things. I was also unimpressed with the lighting. Simply filing a scene in insufficient lighting does not truly add drama and interest. Overall, this film is very unbelievable, laughable, and inane. Thankfully, MacMurray's career wasn't ruined by this horribly stupid film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Static acting with an OK storyline.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps I have just watched my share of black and white movies that I can't really take them anymore. Or maybe the narrative was just that awful. Either way, I found this film pretty shallow to watch, though it was engaging at some parts, it otherwise felt like it was stalling along. (Also, my view probably reflects the generation I'm born in)I am pretty annoyed by Walter's narration. The film is narrated by him as he recounts the events of the past few weeks. I think I feel annoyed by his narration because his voice sounds so matter of fact and emotionless that it makes me not want to listen to him. MacMurray's acting too is quite static, matching well with his voice to produce a static and emotionless character. Stanwyck isn't much better, but does show that there is a little more depth to her character than is perceived. Robinson and Heather as supporting actors do their part well enough.The character of Phyllis, being the main female character in the film, can also be perceived as the film being misogynistic. First, she is introduced by objectification of her legs, and becoming the source of romantic interest to Walter. Then, she is depicted as the damsel in distress, needing to be saved from her terrible marriage. Then by the end she is seen as this chaotic, destructive woman. All of which are stereotypes of femininity, with the last seen as a punishment to women who resist the patriarchal order.The use of camera work and lighting plays a crucial part in the film, and does give the sense of Expressionism. With the dark matter at hand and dark mise-en-scene, it adds to the mood of the theme. However the editing style, to me, makes the film quite hectic and all over the place. It jumps from the present to the past without a strong coherent flow, and that is probably why I lost interest in the film. I imagined the film to be over multiple times until it eventually did end.However, the script was pretty engaging, with the conversations between Walter and Phyllis pretty entertaining. The flirtations between them are blatantly obvious and the metaphors used are a little cringe-worthy, but which made it fun to laugh at.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do you know anyone who lights matches with nothing but their fingers?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I started watching Double Indemnity I thought it was okay. It was an okay build-up, and I felt fairly interested in what was going to happen next. It seemed like an okay detective story.And just like the case was with Walter Neff, I got dragged further and further in. It just got more and more exciting! Such a story! Smooth, slick, cool Walter. Always keeping his mask, doing exactly what was needed all the way to keep suspicion out of his way. I know I would never have suspected Walter, the man who light matches with nothing but his fingers.But then you have Keyes. The genius with the incredible eye for details. Walter had him fooled for quite some time, but Keyes got closer and closer, and it was just a matter of time before it would all fall apart. And so it did.I won't spoil any more of this of the story, all I can say is that this is film-noir good as anything; it has the atmosphere, the characters, the thrill and so many clever twists in an excellent story. It is exciting, cool, smart and it doesn't let you go before the end. This leaves you wanting more at the end. (And when you do, try "The Apartment" with Fred MacMurray as the villain. Even better!)Recommended. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The difference between a film noir and a mystery is that in a mystery everyone wonders who did it; in a film noir, everyone knows. The difference between a film noir and a caper flick is that in a caper flick what commands our attention is the details of the crime; in a film noir, things don't get interesting until after the crime.Here in Double Indemnity two rotten people conspire to commit murder. "We're both rotten," she says. "You're a little more rotten," he replies. Not that it matters, which of them is worse. It is their fundamental character that moves them to plan the crime, and energizes them to go through with it. And, it is their lack of character which proves their undoing.The murder weighs on them as the investigation proceeds, and they live in fear of being found out. Not only are they being trailed by a canny insurance investigator, who slowly unravels the crime, but they cannot be together for fear of arousing suspicion. And, suspicion is exactly what gets aroused. Walter and Phyllis begin to suspect each other, begin to conspire to implicate each other, creating a different kind of insurance policy, one that would allow each to escape from the plot they had hatched, leaving the other to take the fall. Here .. here is where Double Indemnity earns its reputation as a masterpiece: we see the emotional consequences of a deed so terrible, neither guilty party can live with it, and we live inside their heads and hearts as their well-laid plans and dreams for happiness turn to dust at their feet. I don't remember any movie where the tormented inner psyche of two persons is more clearly seen than here.Finally, in the piece de resistance we learn just what Walter and Phyllis are really capable of in the best scene of the movie at the Dietrichson home, where Walter goes to tell Phyllis he's leaving. We see their fear, deceit, distrust, anxiety, and pain all come to the surface and explode in what is the ultimate solution in every noir predicament: gunfire. It's difficult in some respects to talk about this movie, because it is so tightly plotted. Unlike many noir masterpieces, like Out of the Past, for example, all the complex plot points tie together into a cohesive whole. I'm tempted to want to summarize those points, to show why Phyllis and Walter became so frightened, but watching their schemes come undone a point at a time is what creates this movie's tension, and it's something that should be experienced, not analyzed.I should close with a footnote about Barbara Stanwyck. She wears a wig throughout this picture that some think looks terrible. Billy Wilder himself said it looked terrible. Some people think she didn't have the looks to pull off a role as an alluring, manipulative femme fatale. She sold me. To take another quote from a completely different context: she had me at hello. I had no problem believing that men would kill for this woman.If you're reading this and have never seen Double Indemnity, see it and marvel at its many superiorities to movies of today. It is a masterpiece, and a solid 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I couldn't hear my own footsteps, it was the walk of a dead man."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At one point late in the film, Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) utters a line that could have been used to describe the movie, a 'crazy story with a crazy twist to it'. "Double Indemnity" is hugely successful despite the fact that it reveals the killer at the very beginning of the story. The suspense comes from the intertwining webs that Neff and Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) spin for each other while they're spinning out of control. With it's casting, the film was one of the first to effectively subvert the idea of who could be a murderer, even if ultimately, they didn't get away with it.Fortunately, director Billy Wilder finally managed to convince the movie's principals to take part in the project. MacMurray, Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson all initially turned it down, none of them wanted to do it. Not surprising for the first two, they would be seriously cast against type and didn't want to portray murderers on screen for what it might do to their careers. In Robinson's case, he was reluctant to take a supporting role, but his better judgment won out, convincing himself that it would be better to take parts with substance at this point in his career rather than take a starring role in a film of no consequence. Good decision.It's Robinson in fact that keeps the film's tension mounting with his unique 'man inside' observations of the crime at the center of the story. Escalating Mr. Dietrichson's (Tom Powers) demise from accident to suicide to murder would have been a stretch for anyone had it not been for Barton Keyes' (Robinson) deliberate method and cunning to smoke out the mystery. Even though he might have mis-stepped by fingering Zachetti, there was enough of a pause after stating "They'll be digging their own graves" when he takes a long look at Neff off screen to tempt the viewer into thinking that he in fact might suspect Neff as the killer. It would have been interesting to see the film go in that direction.By the time it was over, I couldn't help thinking that here was one mystery thriller that would have done justice to Alfred Hitchcock's repertoire; it even had a train. Aside from the murder and the cunning cross and double cross of Stanwyck's character, I was probably most intrigued by the thirty thousand dollar price tag Neff put on the Dietrichson home. Now that would have been some investment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My 2nd Fav Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I need to start by saying I love film noirs, probably more than almost any other film genre. Now I'm 19 I have just became a movie buff or movie freak in the last year or so, but I have come to love film noirs with a a passion. This movie is my 2nd favorite film noir, behind The Maltese Falcon. Now I just watched this one a few days ago, and I must say that it was suspenseful up to the end. Now this is a lot harder to do with this film, since they give the ending away at the beginning of the film, but it still manages to keep you intrigued to the end. The acting by both leads is superb, even though I thought it was a little annoying by the middle of the movie having to hear Fred MacMurray call Stanwyck "baby" every ten seconds. Stanwyck definitely deserved the Oscar nomination, but I think that MacMurray should have gotten at least a nod for the performance. The writing was excellent as well, as I said very suspenseful, and it makes me wonder just how much was taken from police reports or news stories from the crime in the late 20s that this story was supposedly based upon. Overall, I think that the story is what kept the movie flowing for me, and the performances just put it over the top. Kudos to Cain and Wilder though, superb script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again I find myself only able to second what so many have already said namely that this is one of the all-time GREAT movies. Not unexpected of course when you take into account that it was co-written by Raymond Chandler and Billy Wilder who also directed. Are we talking PEDIGREE here or what. I have a self-imposed rule that I only comment on films that I've seen recently by which I mean within hours or at most days of posting a comment. With new films this isn't a problem but like most serious film buffs I've seen thousands of movies but many several years ago which disqualifies me - according to my self-imposed rule - from commenting on them until they show up on TV or video/DVD which this one just has. I've probably seen it a good half dozen times but the last time was a good half dozen years ago before I was active on this site but nevertheless despite the fact that there is nothing new to say I still want to add my voice to the other raves assembled here. Like all movies you begin with the script and this is a triple-distilled gem; in terms of vivid narrative plus low-key dialogue they don't come any better than Ray Chandler and this entry finds him right on top of his game. Wilder wasn't exactly a slouch either if anyone asks you witness the dozens of films he wrote WITHOUT Chandler but together the two writers came up with a masterpiece. Throw in some first-rate acting from the three leads and supporting players, on-the-money camera-work, a standout score and we're talking Movie Hall of Fame and Top Ten WITHIN that Hall of Fame. Unmissable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, Wilder is somewhat of a hit-or-miss affair. I cannot get enough of SUNSET BOULEVARD (1950), truly a one-of-a-kind film, that seems to get richer with each passing year. LOST WEEKEND (1945) also holds up very well to this day-and-age, but few of his other films did. But this campy piece of murder, double-crossing and intrige by Wilder, I never cared for. The set-up? $50,000. Insurance policy. Double crossing. Adultery. Murder. Und so weiter, und so weiter... the usual noir ingredients. Watching this sixty years later, with Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck strutting their way through the now utterly familiar noir plot line, whispering seductive lines too each other, it's non-too-exciting anymore. Probably a victim of its own success, but anyone getting excited over the plot hasn't lived the last sixty years, so what is it that's still appealing? The dialog? Stanwyck? Edward G. Robinson? I never understood what the appeal of Barbara Stanwyck was. In THE LADY EVE (1941) I positively loathed her brooding persona, she had zero sex appeal. She just annoys the hell out of me, I can't help it. There's also something about MacMurray's continuous voice-over makes that makes me fall asleep each time I see this. It probably has something to do with the timbre in his voice. I never even managed to watch this in one stretch. Camera Obscura --- 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are discontinuities in quality, yet DOUBLE ? is fundamentally even, homogeneous?music, photography, performances. Some scenes (between MacMurray and Stanwyck) are bad; but the film's defining quality remains. By its mere and physical beauty, by its atmosphere, music, cast, cinematography, DOUBLE ? belongs naturally to any top 10 of _noirs. Some scenes could have been better written, and better played. But the sardonic, hallucinatory presentation of evil and decomposing, the caustic, merciless look at the emptiness, are marvelously served by Wilder's talent. Wilder's means are inferior to those of Hitchcock or the great cruel Italians or Bu?uel; yet they are considerable nonetheless and there is something deeply satisfying in his best movies. He was not an author; but he was better than most of the other Hollywoodian craftsmen. DOUBLE ? is trash turned into a small but imposing work of art. It has energy, drive, atmosphere; it lacks finesse; it is conventional and exhibits an impersonal ready?made cheap fatalism. The characters are unlikable?except for Robinson's ,which is more interesting and even intriguing, and original, than likable. Yesterday I was curious if DOUBLE ?,a thriller of the quadruple interest of being a MacMurray, a Stanwyck, a Robinson movie, and a film by Wilder, can also be seen as a love movie, as the film of a passion. DOUBLE ? is a hallmark example of style over content. It is able to show more than it really has what. There are good scenes?those not directly involving the MacMurray/Stanwyck couple as a lovers couple. The heinousness of the murder is Shakespeareian, in the sense that most things of worth are spontaneously Shakespeareian. MacMurray is as good as Mrs. Stanwyck?i.e., very. Robinson is the best?but then again, he was one of the best ever. The attraction supposedly torrid scenes do not work (in the sense that Nicholson made his scenes with Mrs. Lange work indeed). The two actors play, or seem to play other things that those in the script. When I have first seen DOUBLE ?,I was mainly impressed with its brutal content, the gloomy unnerving world, the fatalism and hopelessness ,the savageness of the events and the schematic nature of the psychologies?the quality of the portrayal of evil; and also with the unusually good performances. Seen for a second time, DOUBLE ? showed the clumsiness and impropriety of some scenes, its failure as a love movie, the lack of passion?in a word, the multiple flaws. (The films IS, succeeds in being what it sets itself up to be. My objection is with the trend, the general notion of the _noirs.) On the other hand, and in a strange keeping with these?the artistry, the visual qualities?the wonderfully somber score. There is a touch of surreal weirdness?on a par with the feverish, hallucinatory nature of MacMurray's report. The small (as dimensions and as length of the role as well) Robinson?a larger than life actor. His role is a small jewel. DOUBLE ? is also hugely atmospheric and suspenseful, and, seen as artistry, extremely palatable. Mrs. Stanwyck was too good for her role. (Her role is comparatively poorly written.)The world-view of all such _noirs, with their overstated popular fatalism and proletarian moralist drives and anger, is schematic and phony. They cherish a poor notion of the life and human relation?undoubtedly covered in reality, but not humanly relevant. This deprives the artistic representation of a true style, poetry and elegance. In the best hands (Rudolph Maté), this world-view is only a pretext. The fatalism can be disguised, or even downplayed or replaced my more relevant contents (such as in Welles' movies). The noir plays on this ambivalence :of being simultaneously a highly stylized (visually, psychologically) genre, highly artificial, and also of pretending to disclose the truest face of the reality and life. Its lack of axiology, in human terms, it's his most serious flaw. It pretends that there is nothing in life beside the facts shown. Or, this is patently untrue. It is a form of naturalism, nihilism, materialism and expressionism. It excludes frontally the meanings of the life. It bows down, though it pretends the contrary, to some hideous divinities of the fate. The sardonic and somehow amused, clinical and cynical featuring of the evil in DOUBLE ? is less convincing than the one displayed by Hitchcock?and surely inferior to the varieties seen in some Italian films. Here in DOUBLE ? the evil is finally conventional and indicative of a somewhat provincial understanding. This is the main issue with these movies?the rudimentary and bestial psychology, the fundamentally uninteresting characters. They are not only schematic?they are also deliberately base and low, frightfully insipid. Their failure is given into their very notion. They are as simple and narrow as requested by the script. The _noirs indulge in a world-view that restricts the possibilities. They remain genre flicks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've dared to watch a lot of classics recently, and some of them haven't hit me. A lot of action flicks have been made since North By Northwest. Special effects have improved since The Birds. I found Some Like It Hot to be so-so, and Citizen Kane is overly melodramatic. It's tough but with the passage of time some films just fade.But not Double Indemnity! I was so shocked to see Fred MacMurray, the guy who'd played campy roles like in The Absent Minded Professor and My Three Sons (TV) do something so serious. There's little action but it's definitely a thriller. The pressure is constant throughout. I have no idea how they do it, I guess it is the story and the acting. The narrative keeps us constantly informed of how close to the edge our protagonist is.Who should see this film:-- Everyone with an interest in classics or thrillers-- People like me who find most classics slow-paced or too arty. This one's safe, really timeless! And see Breakdown, too, which is similar in its relentless tension.I'll give Double Indemnity a stands-the-test-of-time 9 out of 10. I almost gave it an 8, it is in black and white after all, but couldn't bear to. It's that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unquestionably the greatest noir, and one of the greatest American movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Double Indemnity is the crown jewel of the entire film noir cycle, its black sapphire. The project started with the fervid plotting and prose of James M. Cain's shocker (one of his three novels, including Mildred Pierce and The Postman Always Rings Twice, which supplied material for three key films of the 1940s). Director Billy Wilder and the formidable Raymond Chandler (taking a well-remunerated break from his Philip Marlowe books) labored unhappily only to give birth to a hard and glittering masterpiece of a screenplay. Wilder then filmed it with breathtaking panache. The story's brew of adultery, murder and duplicity was a slap in the face to wartime audiences, content with supping upon optimistic, sentimental cinematic fare. Barbara Stanwyck abandoned women's weepers and screwball romps to don an anklet and create Phyllis Dietrichson, the coldest and deadliest of the cycle's femmes fatales; she delivers an unforgettable, sensational performance, never surpassed even by her later outings as Martha Ivers, Thelma Jordon and Mae Doyle D'Amato (in Clash by Night). As intrepid insurance investigator Barton Keyes, Edward G. Robinson is at his wry and crafty best, serving to puncture the unrelievedly heavy and suffocating textures of the film. The surprise is amiable, dull Fred MacMurray who is just perfect as the way-out-of-his-depth bachelor whose downfall is thinking with his zipper. Double Indemnity is one film noir whose vision is not compromised by parsimonious budgets, a recycled and warmed-over script, sub-par casting or by-the-numbers direction; for once, everything works right, and the upshot is one of the greatest, if darkest, movies ever made in America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TV Version VS Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Universal's 2-disc DVD release of Billy Wilder's 1944 classic film noir, DOUBLE INDEMNITY gives us a beautifully cleaned up pictorial elements that must rank close to the way it looked on theatre screens originally. This along with two interesting commentary tracks and an excellent documentary provides todays viewer with a great deal of insight into art of Billy Wilder. All of this is on disc one. It is disc two, with its sole offering of the 1973 made-for-television version that has brought criticism. Starring Richard Crenna, reprising the Fred MacMurray role, Samantha Eggar replacing Barbara Stanwyck and Lee J. Cobb instead of Edward G. Robinson, it uses a shortened version of the Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler screenplay to give us a 74 minute color edition of the 108 minute, black &amp; white original. It would be interesting to take a group of university film students who have not seen either film and divide them up into two separate groups. Show half of them the original and the other group the TV version -- then have them each write their responses in a paper. Then let each group see the opposite version. It should make for a lively discussion. Why does the color in the TV version not work? Could color create the right mood? Does Miklos Rozsa's score have a positive impact on the original? The actors in the TV telling are speaking much of the same dialog found in the 1944 film -- why doesn't it have the same impact? What role does the director have in making the screenplay come to life? You get the idea. Comparing the two would bring home the point that it takes more then making a film by the numbers to come up with a memorable film experience. This special edition DVD is still a must own set!</fullReview>

Basically smooth talking insurance agent Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is confessing his story to his best and suspecting friend, detective Barton Keyes (Little Caesar's Edward G. Robinson). Walter met attractive Phyllis Dietrichson (Oscar nominated Barbara Stanwyck) calling to renew the automobile policy for her husband, Mr. Dietrichson (Tom Powers). The pair become very close, and eventually they plot to kill the husband, who is tricked into signing a double indemnity accident policy (i.e. Phyllis gets cash if he dies), and they kill him to look like an accident. Barton doesn't believe it was an accident, and links the murder to Phyllis, and never to his best friend. Walter meanwhile believes Phyllis has dumped him for a younger man, and he ends up stabbing her in the end. Also starring Porter Hall as Mr. Jackson, Jean Heather as Lola Dietrichson and Byron Barr as Nino Zachetti. I can see why the critics gave it five stars, and it is definitely not one to miss, and Stanwyck's character is a true bitch, but it is one of those classics I don't want to see much, but it is very good. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Music for Miklós Rózsa, Best Sound, Best Writing, Screenplay and Best Picture. Phyllis Dietrichson was number 8 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, the film was number 84 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 24 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 38 on 100 Years, 100 Movies. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you like Wilder you'll probably like this...but I don't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Barbara Stanwyck and I love film noir, but I've never been able to understand why this film is considered a noir masterpiece, although I've tried it more than once. Maybe the problem is just that I don't like Billy Wilder. There's something remarkably unpleasant, something misanthropic, about his films. He likes female grotesques ("Sunset Blvd.," the drag queens, including Marilyn Monroe, in "Some Like It Hot"), and here he transforms the normally vibrant Stanwyck into one with that blonde helmet. She's not sexy (if you want to see Stanwyck sexy, go to Sturges's "The Lady Eve"), and I think that's the point. But then why should we believe in her relationship with Fred McMurray--and if we don't, why should we have any sympathy for the criminals, or care about what happens in the movie at all? But what I really can't get past is the dialogue, for which the movie is frequently lauded. It's absolutely terrible. It's not snappy at all; it's so convoluted and ornamented that Stanwyck and McMurray can't establish a natural (let alone fast-paced) rythmn between them. I'm not disturbed by the fact that "real people don't talk that way," but you find yourself paying more attention to the dialogue than the characters, and the dialogue bogs down the scenes instead of advancing the story--two marks of a bad dialogue writer. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so great a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is widely regarded as a great American classic because of its film noir atmosphere and sharp dialogue, but I don't think it holds up so well.It makes a big deal on solving a murder case plotted by Stanwyck and MacMurray. Actually the case is quite simple, I wonder why the police concludes it as accidental death, because the train was only running fifteen miles an hour when Barbara's husband presumably fell off by himself. If they just investigate the cause of death of the body and the fingerprints on his crutches, they'd easily find out the truth. There's no need for Robinson to use his brain so hard!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plays Very Dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie suffers from the same fate of a lot of pre-method acting films: staid dialouge and wooden acting. By modern standards this movie just doesn't hold up well, IMHO.At it's time it was ground-breaking b/c the subject matter was gruesome and the primary characters were mostly irredeemable. But today, planning a murder does not a movie make.It's beautifully lit and there are some great shots. But even the lighting benefits from the time b/c it's B&amp;W. It's much easier to light and to create a dramatic mood.I like many classic films, but this one while important in its own right, hasn't traveled well into the 21st Century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Double Standard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting how ideas and concepts in stories can quickly rot over the span of a few years or a few decades. No, I'm not talking about "flawed hero" and "femme fatales", those are everyday. I'm referring to narrative perspective. In this movie's case, it died by the mid-80s. By then, the neo-noir caught up with it and left it in the dust.This is your only spoiler warning...I saw this again over the weekend for the first time in many years. First I saw it as a high school freshman, then as a junior in college. In neither instance was I impressed by what I saw.Stanwyck has no sex appeal and it isn't because of that atrocious wig. Even Angela Lansbury in 'Manchurian' emits more emotion than this. In the case of shallow noir like this, the idea lives or dies on our acceptance of this character. I am repulsed and not by any degree of acting.I have a theory that movies acquired the right to be heard in stages. The Marx Brothers made dialog interesting. The 60s--Bernstein and Morricone in particular--changed music from pompous garbage like this to something attuned to the image. Finally, the 70s made the effects and miscellaneous sound elements worth hearing (no, 'Star Wars' isn't part of my "sonic elite"). In other words, watching this muted is beneficial to your health.Lastly, the script falls in the hands of the actors. MacMurray and Stanwyck are self-aware (complete with Stanwyck practicing her acting with Fred after the murder), but they take this hokum too seriously. Only Robinson plays this by constantly winking at us. He'd learned enough in the decade since 'Caesar'. He's the Sherlock Holmes of the story, running the second narrative rather than being the focus. I guess it's the novel "inside-out" aspect that made this unique in its day. In its day.Watch this with 'Wizard of Oz' to see when concepts die. Then watch 'Bill &amp; Ted 2' with 'Return to Oz' to see where revitalization comes at the expense of one's soul.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't think this film is a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry, but I have a problem taking the Absent Minded Professor/The Shaggy D.A. seriously. I think Fred is not a very good actor. I saw this in a film noir class, and I think that this was probably the least good of all the films we watched (though I would still give it an 8/10). There are many better noirs, especially The Maltese Falcon, Out of the Past, and Kiss Me Deadly. Plus, the novella on which this film is based is much, much more complex and just plain better. I read it before I saw the film. I was blown away by the novella, but only moderately impressed (mostly at Barbara Stanwyck) with the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting! Good story line!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie about 6 years after it was released. Never saw it again until February of 2008. I expect a lot from movies and I am quick to criticize. I thoroughly enjoyed this "old" classic! Fred Mcmurray &amp; Edward G. Robinson both played very different roles for this era. They were superb! If you've never seen the movie, it is worth a viewing. If it's been awhile since you've seen it, see it again. For me, it was as though I had never seen it. I knew the stars and I knew the plot, but that's about all I remembered. I would really like to see what the movie would be like if it were remade 2008 style! This is a black and white movie. No color is really needed. The stars make it all happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very dated film, though technically well-made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is perhaps the most dated film besides reefer madness I've ever seen. This IS film noir though, low-key lighting galore, characters caught between good and evil, and a femme fatale. However thing like the protagonists repeated iterations of phrases such as "Shut up and kiss me baby" and other things that would likely get one sued for sexual harassment nowadays seem more funny than anything. He actually says "baby" referring to the female lead 37 times if I counted correctly. The dialogue is horribly dated. Interesting from a film history standpoint but as a movie, it's far more likely to elicit unintentional laughter than shock, empathy, or thrills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Obsolete Machinery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This particular relic serves one purpose today: to show just how far we've advanced as viewers of movies in terms of our expectations. This may have been definitive film-noir in its day. Now the distance between this movie and the ubiquitous use of noir in our time is as distant as the dictaphone within is to today's digital recordings.Surely, it's hard to get much purer than "Double Indemnity". It announces in undiluted terms how it's all about the individual caught up in the machinery of uncaring Fates. The men are openly and piggishly sexist. The women are decorations...but there's no actual sexuality this deep in the Code period. Not a drop of irony anywhere. And so I think we expect a lot more than this now. At least I know I do. What I expect is a movie that visually plays the game with me, and is not just about a game perpetrated on the world of the movie's characters that we passively observe.This is obsolete. I'll go with any one of this movie's many descendants, starting with "Body Heat".</fullReview>
