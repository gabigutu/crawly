		<shortDescription>Riveting Like Watching a Train Wreck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance, the film seems to be about how a promising congressman from New York destroyed his political career because of inappropriate postings on the internet. It is to some extent, but it is also about how the media can build up someone in one moment and tear that same person down the next. The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival."Weiner" begins with archival footage of Anthony Weiner as the liberal firebrand on the floor of the House. Having not known much about Rep. Weiner before the scandal, this was eye-opening to me. Here you really see what he could have become had the scandal not occurred.From that point on, the film follows the subject from the initial scandal up until the aftermath of his New York mayoral run. As expected, the film shows numerous clips about Weiner during this critical time in his career and the media circus that ensued. However, what really makes the film compelling is the behind-the-scenes footage between Weiner, his campaign staff and his family. You really feel like a "fly on the wall" eavesdropping on some very personal discussions. The film was co-directed and shot by Josh Kriegman, who once served as Weiner's chief-of-staff. Kriegman and his co- director Elyse Steinberg, were given unprecedented access. What does go is so personal and intense that at one point in the film, Kriegman even asks Weiner why he is even allowing them to continue shooting."Weiner," while infuriating sometimes to watch, is a wild ride of a character-study filled with contradictions. On the one hand, Anthony Weiner seems to be fully aware of the damage he has inflicted to his career and his family, but at other times appears quite delusional. Seeing "Weiner" is like watching a slow moving train wreck. You know what is going to happen, but you watch it anyway to see how it happens. This film definitely falls into the category of "truth is stranger than fiction." It's hard to imagine another personality in recent history that is so unfiltered and self-absorbed in his quest for higher office, with the exception of a fellow named, Donald Trump. This is not just a film about Anthony Weiner, but a critique at how the mainstream media values style and sensationalism over substance. This is evidenced in a sequence that occurs toward the end of the film that must be seen to be believed. In short, "Weiner" is a fascinating character-study and must be considered an early awards favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What do we vote for these days?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a New Yorker who voted in the mayoral election that is depicted in this film.....ahhh, if I had only known better. Weiner is a politician who had a sex/porn/internet problem and it didn't disappear the minute he was publicly disgraced. Yet, he was an excellent politician, without a doubt a better candidate than the one I voted for. And yet, the story that was most in the news at the time (and shown in this film) was his poor judgement about his personal life, and negligible press about his competency as a champion for the middle class. Furthermore, the timeline of the Sydney Leathers relationship was hardly prominent. I hadn't realized it was over a year earlier. (Albeit better if it had been five years earlier though.)History is replete with great leaders who had amoral sex lives, not the least Harding who had an illegitimate child shortly before his election as our 29th president. We won't even discuss what happened in JFK's life, and yet the public forgives him. In no way do I think Weiner should be condoned for acting so inappropriately while being a public servant, but it would also be great if we could focus on POLITICAL competency instead of extramarital sexual blunders. As I see it, when Donald Trump is the GOP nominee with all his sexual improprieties, obviously it's all about the media. And to me, that is the true essence of this documentary. IT IS ALL ABOUT THE MEDIA. My takeaway, although cliché, is that it's the media's storyline, which panders to the readers' lowest common interest -- bringing serious consequences to our politics today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>more Huma, less Weiner please</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Normally I would have no interest in a movie with this title, but in this case, it's a chance to get a glimpse into the psychological make-up of a guy who obliterated his own political career ? by simply being unable to keep his privates private. The end result of the efforts from filmmakers Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg is nearly unrestricted access to a NYC mayor candidate's campaign, as well as a look at a politician that is at times tense, and other times funny (in a laughing AT you kind of way).In 2011, seven-term New York Congressman Anthony Weiner resigned in the aftermath of a sexting scandal made worse by (what else?) ? his lying and attempted cover-up. The film begins with a clip of one of Weiner's explosive speeches, meant to portray his expertise as a legislator and politician. This is quickly followed by the pun-filled headlines that exposed his sexting habit, seemingly leaving his political career in the dust.Picking up two years later, the film finds the disgraced former Congressman running a campaign for NYC mayor. We can't be too surprised as we have learned numerous times that many politicians are addicted to power and life in the public eye. What makes this an interesting subject is two-fold: how publicly humiliated Weiner had been, and the fact that his wife is Huma Abedin, long-time Hillary Clinton adviser and aide.We don't learn how it happened, but we do find Anthony and Huma are still married, are parents to a young child (she was pregnant when the first scandal hit), and that Huma fully supports his mayoral candidacy. As the campaign kicks off, Weiner is a frontrunner, proving that we are a forgiving lot. The cameras capture him in full candidate mode ? making calls to potential donors, giving speeches, dealing with staffers, and working the crowds at his energy-filled parades. Of course, it's all a façade ? or at least half of one.When the second sexting scandal hits and "Carlos Danger" makes headlines as Weiner's online pseudonym, the real trainwreck begins, and we find it impossible to turn away. It's at this point where our feelings are confirmed ? Huma is by far the more interesting of these two personality polar opposites. Where Weiner is two-faced ? bouncing between humbled and overly ambitious; Huma is cool, collected and (seemingly) smart.Weiner remains clueless about his chances, and the level of tension skyrockets in meetings and during spousal moments. It's impossible not to believe that the energies used towards the campaign would have been better spent in therapy ? both individual and as a couple. His stream of lies proved he had not changed his ways, and his periodic reflective and apologetic moments are diminished by his true color nastiness, which is more pervasive.The film gets unnecessarily sidetracked during a segment that features one of Weiner's phone sex relationships ? codenamed "Pineapple". Entirely too much time is spent on her pathetic publicity grab, and fortunately it all falls flat. It is a reminder that the media never misses a chance to film a frenzy ? even if they have to manipulate it. There is no room in a documentary for TWO trainwrecks! After the film and the irresistible draw of watching this ego-driven dude never once come to grips with why he is socially unacceptable as a leader, we realize there are unanswered questions. Why did Huma stick with her husband? Why was she onboard with him getting back in the game ? did she really miss the public eye? The filmmaker flat out asks Weiner "Why have you let me film this?" Perhaps the answer to that last question is somewhat explained when you know that Anthony Weiner made an appearance in "Sharknado 3". Some people just need the spotlight.The hecklers, the eye rolls, the angry outbursts all lead up to Lawrence O'Donnell asking Weiner "What's wrong with you?" I asked myself that same question after the movie when I realized that I was mesmerized the entire time. As for Huma ever allowing herself to be the subject of a documentary, we can only assume that she is too sagacious to allow such unfettered camera access to her work. I suppose her appearance in the next "Sharknado" is equally unlikely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eye opening film of a doomed and cursed man who lost it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody knows that politics and political figures are so common with scandal, corruption, and bribes, and you guessed it sex scandals! And the world again was rocked with one Anthony Weiner! This eye opening and interesting film called "Weiner" looks at how the media and scandal of texts and photos and nude pictures help bring down a former congressman and mayoral candidate. The news footage is nearly from every network and the interviews are a compelling saga and the way the camera follows around Anthony and wife Huma is so interesting as you the viewer can feel the tension and pain between the two as the scandals break, and the speak and words from the mouth of Weiner confirm that he is a destroyed and beaten man. Most of you who follow the news know the story in 2010 a hacker and media outlet had broke news that Anthony Weiner had texted and snapped pictures of his erect and hard penis thru his underwear and the incident would cause him to resign from congress and then later in 2013 when he got back in the game or his "New York Grove" the next scandal hit online on a website from a source a young girl named Sydney Leathers who's an attractive big breasted girl that exchanged text nude pictures and even admitted to phone sex with Anthony. And you guessed it this would destroy his mayoral campaign and political life, yet thru it all Huma would stand by her man. Overall near excellent film that shows how a vice when revealed and exposed can destroy your profession and bring you down in life never being the same as some like Anthony Weiner never learn as the habit is so hard to break!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a compelling documentary of a psychological train-wreck in slow motion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While watching Weiner (2016) it is easy to forget that this is a reality-based documentary not a fictional sit-com or tragi-drama. The film presents two possibilities: we either expect too much of politicians or the subject of this movie is a uniquely disturbed aberration of the political class. Either way, this compelling and well-produced documentary is essential viewing for anyone interested in professional politics and the impact it has on those who seek power.Using 'fly-on-the-wall' documentary style and archival footage, the film tells the story of Anthony Weiner whose name is now laughed at around the world. As a Democrat Congressman from 1999 to 2011 he gained national attention for his vocal advocacy for working-class Americans. His career was shortened when he texted sexually suggestive images of himself that, in conservative America, was enough finish him in politics forever. But Weiner's charisma and boundless energy saw him re- emerge in 2013 to campaign for Mayor of New York under a banner of mea culpa for past errors. He was well ahead in the polls and just as his redemption appeared secure there were further revelations that showed he was still a serial 'sexting' offender. His popularity immediately plummeted. The film documents the impact on his wife and campaign staff and the sense of betrayal by a public that had been warming to his revival but had now lost all faith. He was stuck with a reputation as a pathological liar, a sexual transgressor and an unfaithful husband. While the film is mainly focused on Weiner, the silent heroine of the film is his extraordinarily talented wife Huma Abedin, a senior aide to Hillary Clinton. The words "spousal abuse" are heard in this film but left unexplored.Why is it so fascinating to watch a psychological train-wreck in slow motion? Weiner represents a modern-day conundrum of public life. His transgressions are far less than those of former President Bill Clinton or many others and whatever he did wrong it involved him and his cell phone only. Being a noisy Jewish Democrat who fought tooth and nail for national health insurance made him an easy target for conservative media and the early success of his comeback campaign threatened many interests. Audiences will judge Weiner based on their own politics and sense of morality, but history is unlikely to be kind. This is a fascinating documentary that offers a unique glimpse into a dynamic but fatally flawed narcissist who is either a profoundly dishonest person or we, the people, need to be more forgiving about human weakness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disgraced politician lets it all hang out in this memorable documentary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I did a lot of things. But I did a lot of other things, too." Anthony WeinerThe tragicomic story of seven-term congressman from New York, Anthony Weiner, is almost too absurd to be true. After resigning from Congress over sexting, while waging a vigorous 2013 campaign for mayor of NYC, Weiner is disclosed to have texted again visions of his maleness to other women than his wife, Huma Abedin. The tragedy is that this aide to then Senator Hillary Clinton is an accomplished woman, totally undeserving the abject humiliation her husband's sexting has caused her.Filmmakers Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg in this fascinating doc called Weiner gained permission from him to film his most intimate moments of the campaign, especially with his wife while his tech-straying disgrace is made public. While for us commoners, such peccadilloes amount to little in a public forum (but much, of course, in the personal arena), these moments are heart-rending to see: This accomplished wife forces herself, with barely a smile, to support her husband.The ancient Greeks knew well the flaws and foibles of celebrities gone wild. In this revelation of hubris, an overweening pride that comes before the fall, even the tragedians might not have dared to show the Congressman sexting even after his initial exposure (so to speak). Yes, he sends photos of his masculinity to a 22 year old woman, who will complete his ignominy by revealing them to a press overjoyed at a second round.The despair is that he had seemingly come back into the good graces of the public, only to be outed again and lose that support and the mayoral primary to Bill DeBlasio. The documentary is there for the grand moments of revelation and shame, none more poignant than privately with his wife, who seems almost shell-shocked by the new revelation. Unfortunately, the quotes at the beginning of this review are the most insight we ever get, despite the filmmakers' intimacy, to help us understand why such a gifted populist should so carelessly toss away his position and reputation. Perhaps his wife's mute incredulity stands for our own.In the end we must conclude with a saying never more appropriate than here: "Who knows the secrets of the human heart?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Why did you let me film this?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Weiner" (2016 release; 96 min.) is a documentary about disgraced new York politician Anthony Weiner (pronounced: "wiener", not "whiner"). As the movie opens, we have Weiner in an interview chair, talking to the documentary makers. We then go back to 2011, when we get a thumbnail overview of how a sexting scandal led to his resignation from US Congress. We then shift to "May 13, 2013, two years after his resignation". Weiner is about to enter the race for New York Mayor, and along the way decided to give unlimited access to these documentary makers during his campaign. By then you are already nailed to your seat as you watch what is unfolding.Couple of comments: this is the first full-length documentary for co-writer and directors Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg. While the comeback attempt in and of itself would've made for riveting viewing, can you imagine how they felt when smack in the middle of the unfolding campaign, another controversy explodes? It doesn't get any better than this for documentaries (on the same level as "The Armstrong Lie" about Lance Armstrong and "I Am Trying To Break Your Heart" about Wilco). There are so many fine moments in this documentary, and I certainly don't want to spoil your viewing experience, but allow me to just point out two scenes: there is a very clever montage of Weiner's campaign taking a foothold and gaining track (to the point of leading the polls), set to the "Theme of S.W.A.T.", and it works beautifully. Even better is the scene between Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin when the second controversy explodes. Ah yes, the wife. Normal people like you and me immediately think: why on earth does she decide to stick by her man, time and again, humiliation upon humiliation? Then it dawns on me: these are not 'normal' people like you and me. Huma stays with Weiner the same reason Hillary stayed with Bill: it's all about the power! These career politicians know one thing, and one thing only: get the power, and stay in power, whatever means necessary, whatever personal sacrifice is needed along the way. When the final curtain comes down (Weiner obviously did not win the mayoral election), one of the directors asks Weiner "why did you let me film all this?". You'll just have to see for yourself how Weiner responds to this... Bottom line: if you like documentaries, you will absolutely love this riveting look at a disgraced politician whose narcissistic personality disorder is fully exposed here."Weiner" made a splash when it debuted at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, and I couldn't wait to see it. It finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Saturday matinée screening where I saw this at was attended poorly, to my surprise. Maybe strong word-of-mouth (which this movie surely generates) will lead to wider exposure down the road through VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. Meanwhile, "Weiner" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Defining Acts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's so easy to judge Anthony Weiner from reading text on social media, in the newspaper, and / or the news shows on TV. "Weiner" is a great documentary film and as others have written, riveting. I was fixated the entire 90 minutes; all the time asking myself, "Why would he let them document this?", all the while cringing for his wife, Huma Abedin.Where is the line drawn between loyalty and abuse? Although Huma is very clear on where she will and won't participate in the documentary, you wonder where and when does her loyalty to her husband become nothing more than emotional abuse? There are two types of obscene behavior, the indecent kind that brought Anthony Weiner down, and the disgusting kind that has little disregard for the rights of others. The documentary exposes the latter in a defining rarity: With only 4 - 5 % of the vote and dead last, the media chases Weiner all around like dogs in heat trying to squeeze every last tidbit out of the story.Who are we to judge? When we become persistent observers of misery or scandal...fascinated with the distressing sordid scandalous events of others, are we engaging in voyeurism? If you see the movie, please let me hear back from you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just saying the word 'Weiner' makes me laugh.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's funny. Damn funny. Just saying the word 'Weiner' makes me laugh. I know, I'm ten years old, but I laugh every time. I'm not the only one though, as you can listen to forty seconds of a radio show below to see well-respected and professional film critics laugh at the word. It might be ironic and even funnier when you say the word and imply the former politician Anthony Weiner from a few years ago, given what happened with that guy's political run and life. Luckily for us, a couple people made a documentary on Anthony Weiner's life in the thick of all the scandals, simply titled 'Weiner'.Filmmakers Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg were granted heavy access in Weiner's home and political campaign offices as Weiner himself was given a second chance in New York City to run for Mayor. If we back up a bit, and as this documentary shows in the first couple of minutes, is that Anthony Weiner was once the top of the democratic field with his amazing and boastful performance at the House of Representatives that made the news for quite a while. You couldn't talk about politics or social issues without bringing up Anthony Weiner and his courageous stand against the opposing view. It wasn't very long before Weiner became a joke, when an image of his weiner showed up in a sexual text message to someone other than his wife Huma Abedin, who was a former adviser for Hillary Clinton.Anthony lies to the people and media about it all, but then confessed. He resigned from his political office and tried to work on his marriage. This is where this 'Weiner' documentary picks up, with Anthony asking the people for a second chance and his run for mayor. We get glimpses of his home life, campaign rallies, and him riding a bike in New York. Things look on the up and up, but a new scandal hits again with new images taken recently of Weiner's weiner, this time fully exposed to a woman named Sydney Leathers.In the heart of him running for mayor, all of these images leak and his family and media jump all over it, and not necessarily in a good way. Anthony tries to talk politics on numerous television shows and interviews, but the only thing anyone wants to talk about is his weiner. It's funny and sad all at the same time, and this intimate documentary shows the awkward and sad moments that Huma had to endure at her husband's now public weiner. Anthony seems like a nice enough guy and he seemed to be on top of his game, but he just couldn't seem to keep it in his pants, at least on a text message.The real villain here is Sydney Leathers, who made everything public just to be famous and get money. She even tried to to show up to his campaign office on election night to make it awkward. That's poor form, but hey, she went on to do adult films. I don't know if Anthony Weiner can ever recover from this second scandal, but I hope the people of the USA can look past personal lives and focus on the political issues he stood for, because that's what it's all about, and not some naked photos online. The documentary does a good fly-on-the-wall type of approach and never gets in the way of any political issues here. It's just about the Weiner family's life in and out of a particularly embarrassing scandal.RECOMMENDED!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridicule</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some time ago I watched the terrific French film "Ridicule." The French aristocracy's main form of entertainment was to fool someone in the "lower class" into joining their parties and, at first, let them think that they have been invited to the parties because of their wit and charm -- only to be humiliated, mocked, and scorned. Ridiculing someone was their ultimate pleasure. There have always been bullies.This movie was well done, but I have no idea why Weiner would subject himself and his wife to this terrible humiliation. I blame him for wanting to do this. Maybe he thought it would help restore his political career. I fault myself for watching his fall from grace because I knew about his story already. It was morbid curiosity and I felt ashamed of myself. We Americans seem obsessed with famous people's personal lives.Humiliation is a terrible experience. His name will be associated with his indiscretions for a long time. His wife and son are collateral damage. I feel sorry for that family and hope they heal. This feels like his last chance and he needs to get psychiatric help with his seeming need to destroy himself. Anthony is not a bad man. He made his political career the center of who he was. He liked the fame. The fall was long and steep.</fullReview>

He is so human, it hurts to watch. Also, his poor wife... She looked half dead through most of that. I mean, what could you do in that situation? Stand still until the whole thing passes and try to retain your dignity through it all. I enjoyed getting a look into the political world. Even the day to day tasks like fund-raising.

		<shortDescription>Engrossing portrait of failed politician who eschews intimacy with women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anthony Weiner was a US representative from New York when he was forced to resign in 2011 due to a sexting scandal. Filmmakers Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg were given full access to Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin (a long-time top adviser to Hillary Clinton) during Weiner's campaign for mayor in 2013.Initially, after asking the voters to give him a second chance, Weiner's campaign appears to be going well as he's winning in the polls. But soon, news gets out that Weiner continued sexting a year after his resignation from Congress. Almost immediately, he began plummeting in the polls and despite wife Huma initially standing by his side, he refuses to withdraw and ends up with about 5% of the vote on election day.The documentary is supplemented by archival footage from notable television personalities including Jon Stewart, Steven Colbert, Lawrence O'Donnell and Howard Stern. Things can only get worse for Weiner when Stern urges one of his more recent sexting partners, Sydney Leathers, to confront the mayor wannabe outside his headquarters on election day.Weiner appears to be his own worst enemy by often losing his temper when confronted about his past indiscretions. After staff defections and constant internal discord, Huma no longer agrees to appear with her husband in political ads and is observed scowling in the background as Weiner's meltdown continues unabated.While Weiner comes off as being quite adroit regarding political issues, he appears to have little insight into his own behavior. As reported in the NY Times, prior to the initial scandal, Weiner was known for constantly screaming at staff members and he often faced high staff turnover. During the second scandal in the 2013 mayoral campaign, he's observed being perhaps a bit more circumspect with staff members, who ultimately express their disappointment in him, as the campaign falls apart.Ultimately, Weiner can be seen as someone who wanted to outdo his parents career-wise, both of whom were professional people (his father a lawyer and mother, a high school teacher). Weiner achieved that by becoming a U.S. representative. Pressure to over achieve sometimes comes from the parents but not always?in other cases, by achieving a position of power, the overachiever seeks to maintain a position of control over others.But Weiner's problem appears to be at a deeper level in the sexual realm ?despite being married to the very attractive Huma, he is unable to achieve a deeper level of intimacy with women (as evidenced by his desire to communicate superficially with strangers via sexting).In the end, Weiner should be considered a comic figure and not a tragic one. Just as an Archie Bunker lacks the self-insight to understand that his bigotry is wrong, the same applies to Weiner?except here it's a matter of a lack of desire for intimacy with women and a self-image based on an illusion of power.One further prediction if I may?when the 2016 election is over, I have no doubt that Huma will file for divorce and leave Anthony for good.</fullReview>

While the former are just like house-mold. Few countermeasures work as well as daylight and free-flowing air.That earlier-mentioned day may never come. Especially so in politics, where it might just be needed most of all. It certainly won't come easy. But it's just as certainly worth fighting for. If anything ever was. And Weiner, in all his disgusting, beautiful human glory - sure does his part. Whether he means to or not.Oh and *spoiler alert* is it just me or did Huma prove her humanness by defying Clinton here?

		<fullReview>"The heart has its reasons which reason knows nothing of." Blaise Pascal "Man, you're all full of **** anyway." Passerby on street"Huhuhuhuhuhuhuh Heheheheheheh Weiner..." Beavis &amp; Butt-head (probably)I feel like these three quotes kind of sum up a lot of what this movie, Weiner, a documentary that chronicles as a harrowing, cringe-inducing tragedy of politician Anthony Weiner's failed bid for the 2013 Mayoral race in New York city, is going for, but only part of it. You can look at what the filmmakers present from different angles - as a portrait of a media that, due to how it operates (especially in New York city with the Daily News and Post and everything under the sun) in reporting the 'news' of this or that or the other with Weiner's sexting as "Carlos Danger", and how this media obsession perpetuates things further and further (technology itself is part of it - imagine what would've happened if things were only 10 or 15 years before this), or of course as a portrait of a man and his marriage which we see glimpses of in quiet looks and stares and things that the (mostly) fly-on-the-wall filmmakers get.What you think about Weiner ahead of time may influence you going in. Or if you don't know much about him outside of the Daily Show and Colbert Report skits it may be educational in that way of recent/contemporary history. I think that the movie is fair in that it shows ALL the coverage - both the bytes in the various cable news coverage and things like Weiner's appearance on Lawrence O'Donnell where he was asked point blank "What's *wrong* with you?" - while showing Weiner in both the (semi good) early run-up when he started his campaign and, indeed, had a lead to start with, and then as he kept his composure much as he could while the second scandal blew up and wouldn't go away.Could it have gone away? No, probably (or definitely) not, and the question of should or shouldn't he have dropped out of the race comes to mind. But the coverage of it all in this film is uncanny. At times you'll wonder how they got a camera in such a place, or how, up until the moment the filmmakers are told to get out of a room, they stay there until told to leave (or on the flip-side the very funny moment when in a car the director happens to ask a particular touchy question and Weiner can't help but go off on the guy, like "Is THIS what you mean by 'fly on the wall?') A lot of the humor that does come up is in that pitch-black, uncomfortable way that goes far beyond anything you'd ever see on Louie or Curb Your Enthusiasm. And the cringing isn't always funny - sometimes it comes down to the look two people have with nothing being said out loud and everything being said in the eyes.One of the things that is hard to not come away with, whether by the end you feel some modicum of sympathy (or, hell, even empathy if that's possible) with Weiner from this period of time, is that he's not your average politician or, I should say, one that is the usual type we might think of as a politician. Usually they come off as stiff, bought and paid for or at the least handled to such a degree as to seem inhuman, or try to come off as "wholesome" and yet say the most monstrous things.Weiner was/is a liberal, but you get someone who can talk in reasoned tones except when, well, things p*** him off (his entree into the spotlight came in his time as Congressman when he exclaimed "I will NOT yield" during a debate on a 9/11 responders bill), or when he is confronted by someone. We see him not back down from people, whether it's hard questions at a City Island campaign stop or a heckler in a deli. The guy is tough, and yet there's also a self-deprecating humor at times. And he'll even watch things like the O'Donnell clip - extended version online, of course - just to get motivated to start his day. What a pair of... oh, nevermind.And yet at the same time what I love about the movie is that it shows that he can't escape, and really liked to be a part of, the whole 'game' of it, the act. When he does an ad for TV it feels like he's acting for the camera, and seeing the footage from this ad in its finished form intercut with his wife sitting by the side looking a mixture of bored and (maybe) frustrated is astonishing. It's difficult not to leave the movie with some judgment of him, and at the same time the trick of this is that it presents him in (as much as possible) the full, er, 'package' (sorry, puns are unavoidable, I tried). The point is if you like to see the nitty gritty political maneuvering and how a mind works in the midst of a scandal, this is a serious delight (both serious and delightful).PS: Recently Weiner's retracted how he feels in the documentary and wishes he hadn't made the movie and won't watch it. The latter is fair, while the former is... well, who knows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"But besides that Mrs. Lincoln, how was the show?" - may just be the single greatest line in the history of lines. Much less in this context. I really liked this one and hope that a day will come when we can be grown-up enough to own our flaws/addictions without the hypocrisy of these things being successfully used as trump cards against any and all our ideas. No matter how peripheral their relation. Because I don't care who you are - you too are stuck in the no man's land between your addictions and your superpowers. Whether you know/admit it or not. While the former are just like house-mold. Few countermeasures work as well as daylight and free-flowing air.That earlier-mentioned day may never come. Especially so in politics, where it might just be needed most of all. It certainly won't come easy. But it's just as certainly worth fighting for. If anything ever was. And Weiner, in all his disgusting, beautiful human glory - sure does his part. Whether he means to or not.Oh and *spoiler alert* is it just me or did Huma prove her humanness by defying Clinton here? I hope so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grimaced (both with amusement and embarrassment) throughout this tightly-edited portrait of an egomaniac. The filmmakers were allowed an amazing amount of access in to subjects lives, during which the viewer can't help but debate if we want to like or despise Anthony Weiner. I think that was also what his spouse, Huma Abedin was debating the whole time too. Weiner: A guy who literally could not keep his d**k in his pants. The question is raised during the film, to whether or not Anthony may have a mental illness or sex addition, which is never really addressed - more accepted. A highlight is when Weiner snaps at the filmmaker for daring to ask him a question. Great Film! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Name Game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(RATING: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;? out of 5) THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: An interesting behind-the-scenes look at a campaign and the destruction of a politician's career.GRADE: B-SYNOPSIS: The sex scandal of a once promising politician."The name of a man is a numbing blow from which he never recovers." Oh, how very true! That quote, attributed to Marshall McLuhan, begins this riveting documentary about a politician's fall from grace. Weiner is standard treatment of a compelling subject. Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg assemble interviews and archival footage to show the makings of a scandal and the undoing of a promising career. Their access to the politician and his campaign provides many insights into the election process and its toll on his family.Once the rising star of the Democratic Party and now just a shameful reminder of ego and sexual bravado, ex-U.S. Congressman Anthony Weiner suffered humiliation and defeat literally with his own hands (or other anatomical parts). A mix of intelligence and no common sense, the man remains a curiosity. His undoing: First by sexting his bulge (sorry, there's no other way around it), and sending it to another woman online (not his wife) and later texting salacious messages to another woman, Miss Sydney Lathers, a publicity seeker and porn-star, imploded his political career big time. His penis (thinly veiled) was seen around the world, under his code name Carlos Danger, making the entire situation even more absurd and constant laugh fodder for many pundits and late-night comedians.The filmmakers give us a front row seat to gawk at this emotional wreckage of the politician's failed bid during his New York City mayoral campaign. In viewing this debacle, one wonders about Weiner's unwise decision to allow filming this documentary which becomes a creepy time capsule of his life unraveling. We silently debate if this decision was his best judgment call, among many other poor personal choices throughout his career. Nevertheless, it sure makes for fascinating behind-the scenes journalism. The scandal is presented factually which proves uncomfortable for all involved, especially for his "good wife", Huma Abedin, the clear victim of her husband's destructive behavior. The tension between the couple is palpable. Her body language, glaring looks, and gestures fill in all the anguish and scorn of a betrayed lover. She becomes the human center of the film for this moviegoer.Weiner follows the scandal and lets the viewer determine if the cause is due to the congressman's sexual addiction or just his narcissistic impulses rearing its ugly head (no double entendre intended). Still one can only feel remorse for his loyal wife and family members during this self-inflected ordeal. The media has a feeding frenzy on the politician and leaves nothing in its path. Unfortunately, the bad outweigh all of Mr. Weiner's good, which eventually ended a highly productive career.The documentary depicts a man who shows more regret about his personal loss than about the hurt and humiliation he caused friends and family. At least he now has this film for repeated viewing to serve as a helpful reminder should he feel the need to stray once again. Let us hope the situation became a lesson learned and an even better reason for Mr. Weiner to accept his actions and move on with his life in a more positive way.

		<shortDescription>A view of politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was most curious of this film having only known what was in the papers and on TV. Anthony Weiner appears to have gotten over the initial scandal prior to deciding to run for governor of New York. He seemed sincere in his desires to help people have a better life and to do better for New York. Then a 23 yr old from Las Vegas releases the information that she had been sexting with him for quite awhile and his campaign and life are in deep trouble again. I do not have a good opinion of the young lady - not that she set out to destroy Weiner - but she appeared to want the spotlight for herself. The person who I feel the most sorry for is his wife - to have put one scandal behind her and then have it happen again - I'm sure her trust in him was shattered both times. As the movie goes on you notice her standing back and offering less advice/opinion. He strikes me as another narcissistic politician who felt he could do anything and get away with it. I am sure the facts were presented well - makes you wonder why on earth he agreed to have the videographers follow him for this campaign. A very interesting movie of our political people - not all are like him but we know there are more too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weiner - NY Congressman Anthony Weiner that is!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the closing statement of this in depth look at the raise and fall, and the raise and fall again, Weiner states "why did I let you document this"? Why in deed Mr. Weiner, why in deed! Directors Josh Kriegman and Elyse Sternberg become the proverbial fly-on-wall as Weiner attempts to emerge from the sex-texting scandal that forced him to resign, and placed his up and coming political wife Huma Agedin (Chairwomen for Hillary Clinton 2016 campaign for President and personal assistant) in a an uncomfortable position of standing by her man. One of the many sad beauties of this bio-documentary is Weiner's eagerness to be filmed while going through tough personal and public hardships. Luckily for the film viewer, this glimpse into their scandal (past and present) is pure inside politics magic. While so many things can be learned from this film (i.e. don't hold office and do what Weiner did), this film is also a look at how the media eats up scandals and delivers the results on a plate for all to devour, and how some people (Weiner) are so self- absorbed that they welcome the public to watch themselves go down with the ship. At films end, one doesn't fell sorry for the Weiner's, only shame that they opened their private doors for all to see. Because politics is a fickle business, I won't be surprised to see Anthony Weiner (the public figure and his private parts) again in the not so distant future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Trainwreck Unfolds Before Your Eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I doubt anyone that pays to see this doc will be unaware of the history of Anthony Weiner's prowess with a phone camera. The beginning of the movie covers his time in Congress and the resulting pictures and scandal that forced him to resign in well deserved shame.I wish that story had been explored more by the filmmaker since it makes his subsequent behavior so hard to imagine (though very believable). His initial scandal was not just the fact that he texted pictures of his underwear - he went out and attacked those that claimed he did it as liars and had some people believing him when he said his twitter account had been hacked. He refused to tell the truth and accept responsibility while he accused his critics, notably the late Andrew Breitbart, as dishonest partisans hoping to stop him from helping the American people.Part of this is shown in his fiery attacks on the floor of the House of Representatives against a bill funding health care for 9-11 first responders. (This has always puzzled me since I would bet my mortgage that the NY police and firemen have gold plated health care packages as part of their union contracts. Why did Congress have to give them more? Were police and firemen losing care because the city couldn't afford it? Did Weiner and others just want to have the federal taxpayers cover their health costs? This is never explained in the movie. Maybe if the film had explored this question it might not have reflected well on his image as a great crusader for the people).And that sets up the train wreck everyone in the theater knew was coming - the new texting scandal while Weiner is running for mayor of NYC and doing well enough to force a runoff if not win outright. Here's a guy that has gone through the humiliation of a sexting scandal once, rehabilitates his image enough to be compete for office in the only city that would even consider voting for him, and he knows there are other women he has sent pictures of his junk. PICTURES HE SENT AFTER HE HAD WEATHERED THE FIRST SCANDAL.Forget whether he used bad judgment or hurt his family. One has to wonder if he has an IQ above single digits to think these new pictures and messages won't come out. People actually supported him, volunteered for his campaign, signed on to work for his election and he did not have the intestinal fortitude to tell those closest to his campaign and his wife that there are probably more pictures that are going to come out. He just led his staff, supporters and family down the campaign trail knowing they were going to look like fools for believing he had repented. The film shows Weiner trying to salvage his quest and it goes as badly as one would expect. He could have held a news conference explaining he had discovered how to give everyone unicorns and rainbows and the only questions he gets are why he did it and how could he be so stupid. Making matters worse he somehow doesn't realize how bad he looks in a combative interview with Lawrence O'Donnell or with a voter at a bakery.As the election results roll in and it is clear that Weiner will be lucky to break 5%, the last crisis develops with how to get him in to his campaign's last event so he can thank his supporters and give the traditional speech a loser has to give. His texting compatriot and the one that revealed what Weiner had been doing (Pineapple as we learn the campaign had named her) was at the event hoping to confront Weiner and his wife. Of course they avoid her and still manage to screw up when he gives the finger to reporters and photographers as he leaves the event.One person I feel sorry for is his son who will grow up learning what a dumb a** he has for a father. I don't feel much pity for Huma though. After the first scandal and his subsequent decision to run for mayor, the first question I would ask is "do you have anything you want to tell me?" She has been with the Clintons through Bill's making a fool of his wife so she is not some naive waif bravely standing by her man. She went into this with her eyes wide open.In the end, Weiner is shown as just another politician that only has a talent for running for office and getting elected to an office so he can have taxpayers give him a paycheck. He couldn't run a business or actually produce a product that people would give him money for. His only skill consists of getting the government to spend money on things he wants. Had he stayed in Congress he probably would have been there for 40 years retiring a multi- millionaire despite never having a job that paid enough to do so. No doubt he admired the Clintons for being rich enough to be the top 1% of the 1% despite having never produced anything or running a business putting people to work (unless one considers the Clinton Foundation an actual business instead of a vehicle to enrich the Clintons themselves and give their friends a paycheck between campaigns.Anyone reading this review probably already knows all the details in the film and the only question is it worth watching? I would say yes, at least once. Watching a truly stupid politician squirm on a big screen is worth the $7 I paid but until it comes out on DVD I wouldn't see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chronicle of a Downward Spiral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only a full-blown narcissist would agree to let a camera crew follow him around for a year even if the end result would almost surely invite even further public scorn and disdain as Anthony Weiner did for the documentary, WEINER (2016). During this period, while he was embarking on a misguided, ill-fated run for Mayor of New York after a "sexting" scandal had derailed his congressional career, Weiner was continuing to engage in the behavior that got him into trouble in the first place. How could he not foresee this blowing up in his face a second time? Because he was so wrapped up in himself that he was completely unable to imagine how his actions would impact others, from those closest to him, like his wife and campaign staff, to the reporters covering his campaign and the New York citizens who would eventually have to choose whether to vote for him or not. After the second scandal disrupts his mayoral campaign, he is seen in shouting matches with TV interviewers and members of the public. He seems outraged that anyone would question his behavior. And then he sits and watches the negative coverage on TV and the web and asks how it looks. Perhaps a psychiatrist would be best equipped to review this documentary.I couldn't help but feel sympathy for Weiner's long-suffering wife, Huma Abedin, who comes off as a pleasant, reasonable person with the patience of a saint. But even her limits are reached in the film and it's extremely painful to watch her undergoing such visible anguish. I also felt for Barbara Morgan, Weiner's loyal communications director, a cute, petite blonde who handled his interviews and press relations and comes across in the film as a competent, serious professional who nonetheless wound up deferring to Weiner's judgment much too often. When he disagrees with her and insists on doing something his way, she's seen backing down in a "whatever you want" stance. I wish she'd been more forceful. I don't understand why these women put up with him. In the case of Abedin, I can guess why and I won't go into it, but in the case of Morgan, I don't understand why she didn't hitch her wagon to a political campaign that wasn't destined to go down in flames. Why isn't she working on one now? I googled her after seeing the film and all I could find was a steady stream of links to news articles from July 2013 reporting her profanity-laden tirade directed at a campaign intern, Olivia Nuzzi, who had just published a "tell-all" account in the New York Daily News of problems within the Weiner campaign. Morgan's outburst and her subsequent insistence that she thought it was "off the record," indicates maybe a lesser degree of professionalism than I was led to believe from the film. In any event, I was puzzled as to why there's no mention of the Nuzzi incident in the film, nor any trace of Nuzzi in any of the footage, even though it all happened while the filmmakers were meticulously documenting everything.Aside from that omission, I'm impressed with the way the filmmakers edited hundreds (thousands?) hours of footage into a coherent narrative that remains compelling throughout its 96-minute running time. There are lots of choice, telling moments in the film, my favorite being when the co-director, Josh Kriegman, operating the camera in the back seat and pointing it up at Weiner, asks him a question and Weiner responds with a supremely arrogant putdown, telling Kriegman that the proverbial "fly on the wall" is not supposed to speak. The film offers a dramatic illustration of the politics of self-destruction, but also a disturbing fable about the human condition. Weiner is a tragic, though fascinating figure, but I'm glad he's not in public life anymore. In fact, I wish the other narcissists parading across the contemporary political stage, including former, current and future national political figures--YOU know who they are, whether you'd like to admit it or not, and many of you have voted for them?would vacate the scene, voluntarily or not. I don't understand the public's fascination with these creatures. Or have our electoral cycles become so grueling that only those most driven to gain attention are able to succeed?</fullReview>
