		<shortDescription>Fake, real, some weird combo. It doesn't matter much, which is... unique</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exit Through the Gift Shop, the first film directed by reclusive street-art legend Banksy, is a little puzzle-box of a documentary. It's perfectly designed and pitched to be enjoyable on multiple levels: on one as an entertaining, illuminating mini-history of "street art" and on another - one entirely more convoluted and entertaining - as a light-hearted "up yours" to both street artists and their patrons.Ostensibly (to take the film's word for it) Banksy's film came about when he, as the premiere 21st Century graffiti art darling, was approached by Thierry Guetta, a French-born Los Angeleno. Guetta wanted to make a documentary about street art, and Banksy was the last major figure whose participation he felt he needed, as an affable personality, a love of video cameras and a chance relationship to Invader, a French street-art pioneer who networked with other artists like Shepard Fairey, had left Guetta with hundreds of hours of footage documenting the birth of the art.After tracking Banksy down and shooting him working, Guetta retired to the cutting room. He emerged months later and showed it to Banksy. He didn't like the film, a couple of minutes of which are excerpted and are plainly terrible, and offered to take over Guetta's doc while Guetta returned to Los Angeles to turn himself into a street art sensation, named "Mr. Brainwash" or MBW. Transforming overnight from an affable, helpful documentarian to a one-man hype-monster artiste, MBW's enormous spraypaint cans, TV monsters and Warhol-style send-ups captured the attention of the LA art crowd, who spent over a million bucks on his stuff, much to the chagrin of Fairey and Banksy. Guetta's film about Banksy changes into Banksy's film about Guetta and street art, and the rise of a new unfortunate talent.Except, as I and a lot of other folks believe, it's all made up. It's a hoax, it has to be, it's too hilariously perfect to be anything but. Banksy, as a street artist, has seen the perception of his works - by design temporary, and by design defacements - change from graffiti into art that needs preservation, that is cut out from walls and sold. Banksy, in making Exit Through the Gift Shop with Fairey and Guetta has found a way to deface, scrawl over and heap lighthearted disdain all over both himself and the people who snap up his art.It's spectacular, it's brilliant and all the more so in that it's still a documentary, still a record of events. It's not artificial, not a mockumentary in the way that Spinal Tap is. MBW exists, having been created by Guetta or Banksy or both, and the film documents his arrival. Exactly who it is that arrives is the film's mystery.Exit Through the Gift Shop captures the birth of a prank, an elaborate, entertaining gotcha that fits perfectly in Banksy's nose-tweaking, politically-aware, cheeky body of work. Moreover, the film doesn't rely on any rug-snapping-out to really work. It works if it's true, it works if it's not, because it's a construction that's above all entertaining. It's a glimpse, anyway, of a world that's built at night, by streetlight, one that's fascinating even if it is in the middle of pulling the wool over our eyes. It's genius, plain and (not so very much at all) simple.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Banksy's humour is as sharp as ever - but just who is the target?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took me a while to get a chance to see this film: anybody who was around Bristol last summer for Banksy's 'Homecoming' exhibition will be aware of the popularity of the city's most celebrated son, and therefore I shouldn't have been surprised that when the first three times I tried to see the film the cinema was sold out. However, I got there in the end.In my admittedly na?ve opinion, street art is one of the most significant art movement of the 21st century. Its attraction lies in the fact that it is one of the most democratic forms of visual art ? there is a conscious rejection of the safety net of critical censorship or gallery authority. Instead, the public are engaged with artists' work throughout the course of their daily lives, and it is up to them to conclude which side of the line this kind of work treads ? is it graffiti, a public menace and an eyesore, or is it a work of art that has a right to be displayed wherever the artist chooses? I'm rambling. However, I wanted to establish my feelings towards street art as a whole before engaging with Banksy's satirical and humorous representation of it within Exit Through the Gift Shop.To the film? Banksy's first foray into film-making drags his unique sweet and sour mix of humour and political satire kicking and screaming onto the silver screen. Anyone hoping for a revelation of his true identity is to be disappointed ? the film opens with a blacked-out figure of a man in a hood, and whilst the Bristol accent defies the voice alteration, it's clear that this film is not designed to be a personal unmasking. Rather, Banksy's humour has a very different kind of revelation in mind.The true hero (or perhaps anti-hero would be a better description) is the curiously care-free French shop-keeper/amateur filmmaker, whose interest in graffiti artists is borne out of a chance confrontation with the artist known as 'Space Invader'. The film follows Guetta's attempts to capture his encounters with various street artists, including the notorious Banksy, on camera, and in the process Banksy encourages Guetta to create a documentary out of the ridiculous amount of film that he has amassed over several years of his life.Unfortunately, Guetta, although a handy cameraman, is quite clearly not a filmmaker. Part of Banksy's skill in creating this film is that it makes us ask just who is the director in this haphazard process. One of the frequently-quoted lines of the film comes from Banksy himself, saying "it's basically the story of how one man set out to film the un-filmable. And failed." The character of Guetta that we see on screen is simply ridiculous, and yet we are attracted by his attitude of naivety. He is a hugely entertaining personality, and even more so because he appears to take himself so seriously. Even Banksy cannot quite know what to make of him. Is he a disguised genius, or a fool who got lucky? Either way, Banksy's portrayal of the way in which Guetta engages with the art world breathes new life into that clichéd question of what actually gives art both aesthetic and financial value. With the help of Rhys Ifans' superbly wry narration, the film conducts us through the emergence of the street art counterculture, and how perceptions of it have changed within the political, artistic and social establishment.There are so many things that could be said about this film, but it is dangerous to say more without ruining the sense of the unexpected that the film generates. That is a tribute to the intricacy of the documentary narrative, in which real life personalities generate the same thrill of the unknown as fictional plot lines. Suffice it to say, I left feeling lusciously confused ? who was I in the end laughing at or with? In the face of Banksy's teasingly ironic vision, no one is left unscathed. Not even us. Not even Banksy himself.James Gill Twitter @jg8608 More reviews at http://web.me.com/gilljames/Single_Admission</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>asks the tried and true question really: what is art, and who the hell can be an artist?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exit Through the Gift Shop is credited as "a film by Banksy", who is a notorious and perhaps the most popular and widely acclaimed (and the premiere provocateur) in the group of street artists from the past several years. Yet his credit as director is something of a lark; he's never directed before, and he claims at the end of the film that this will be the last time he helps someone make a documentary on street artists. The bulk of the footage shot was by another artist (or some would say 'so-called'), Theirry Guetta, a former clothing store owner who used to take super-cheap and mis-made clothes and sell them for rocket-high prices as if they were designer wear, who started taping everything one day, just whatever was around him. Then, when his cousin, nicknamed 'Space Invader', took him around to show him how he put up his stenciled artwork around town, Thierry became enamored and followed anyone who would let him around town with his camera.Soon, a documentary was looking like it was taking shape, but was it really? At one point, after years of filming and amassing such a large collection that it would make all OCD-ers cringe, he did try and make a documentary out of it called 'LIFE REMOTE CONTROL - THE MOVIE', which Banksy, upon watching it, didn't really know what to say, since he hated it and couldn't really put it in words. Thierry wasn't a filmmaker, and he wasn't an artist, but he went after doing both anyway, and it's him that Banksy makes the focus of, taking his masses of footage- most of it on street artists who remain anonymous (only a few, like Shepard Fairey who made the red and blue Obama poster so iconic, go unblurred on camera)- and telling this story of this... kind of nutty guy, and how somehow, by his determination and, indeed, some mental imbalance, he became "Mr. Brain-Wash", a self-created art phenomenon that is basically a huge collection of Andy Warhol rip-off screen prints of celebrities (how huge you might ask? Well, there's a reason I kept thinking of Howard Hughes during the film, and a Spruce Goose comparison isn't far off).Banksy says at the start he didn't want Thierry doing a documentary on him since he didn't think he was very interesting, and turned the camera on his original documentarian instead. I wonder though how much of this is really true, or perhaps just part of Banksy's own mystique; the guy is like The Shadow of street artists, with a touch of Tyler Durden. He pops up, does his thing, and leaves, trying to get by with his "gray-legal-area" artwork in Britain and elsewhere, and making waves with his real provocative pieces (i.e. the art on the Palestine wall, and especially the stunt at Disneyland, which is one of the most fascinating parts of the film). He remains a shadow unto himself on screen, becoming like one of his stencils in a silhouette form and a voice muffled by distortion. But then again, he knows that he can only be so self-indulgent - how can he keep up, for example, with a guy like Thierry Guetta.He is the real star of the film, and he really is one of a kind, a genuinely interesting "character" who sometimes, ala Howard Hughes, repeats things a bit too much, and like Michael Scott on the Office can seem to put himself in some awkward positions. He's also good in a crunch (such as the Disneyland incident), and his very first piece of art- his own self-portrait as a guy with shaggy hair and a hat and a camera- was put all over town by himself and it's a genuinely good piece. And his how he relates to others if interesting too; he takes some really long stretches of time from his family, and those he documents like Shepard Fairey don't know whether he's a genuinely good guy or just wacko, or both in a single bound. Certainly when he is finally let loose, by way of a gentle suggestion by Banksy, to create his own art it becomes like pushing a river-boat over a mountain: something huge that should be impossible, but there it is, and WTF? The reaction to his art, and how people see it in the film (frankly I never heard of the guy, unlike Banksy, though I'm assuming he's a big deal in elite art circles), is mixed really. A guy who just pours out hundreds of pieces of art and paintings right away instead of taking years for the craft? What separates him from Banksy, and it's most likely what makes this such a great documentary, is the method of hype. That really is what is the hook here (I can imagine this being a fantastic double feature, by the way, with My Kid Could Paint That), that this guy ended up being such a sensation by pimping himself out there, getting on the cover of a magazine, without building up street cred (forgive the pun) that most of the artists shown here need to get. As Banksy notes, there are no real rules in art, though MBW probably did break them... which he can't really condemn nor condone exactly. He is what he is, and his big bushy sideburns lead up to passionate eyes and a sense of life and art that is... um, influenced? This is the only documentary you need to see on street art, if there even are any others. Perhaps Banksy means for this to be *the* statement on it and leave it at that. It kept me contemplating long after it was over, and I'm sure to revisit it many times. That I have only a minimal interest in street art should go without saying; Guetta, Banksy, and everyone else make this a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An experience will ultimately become a diluted memory, unless the experience itself is documented in image or film, in which case it will last forever (or until it is deleted/destroyed...). 'Exit Through The Gift Shop' is a brilliant examination of the underground street art culture, and a poignant look at man's obsession with a culture he is increasingly drawn into throughout his life.Thierry Guetta (pronounced Te-ree), is a French immigrant living Los Angeles with his loving wife and children and a good honest job, but there is one object he will never leave the house without; his video camera. Guetta has been enticed into the everyday cinema verité movement of simply recording any, and everything that goes on in his life. From playing with his children, to his ultimate attraction of following other street artists around and documenting their work, Guetta loves to watch, document and admire from behind the lens. Guetta eventually earns the trust and respect of various artists around the globe including the elusive Banksy, his cousin Space Invader and Shepard Fairey, and provides the audience with an up close and personal view of a culture (or industry) which has been projected into the limelight over the past five years.Narrated by Rhys Ifans, 'Exit' has been acknowledged as not having a registered director, instead it is a smoothly edited combination of Guetta's extensive and various filmed sequences from over the years (the film shows his EXTENSIVE physical collection of tapes from more than decade of film-making) and interviews with various leading figures in the industry. For example Banksy is interviewed at length over his involvement with Guetta and comes across as a very down-to-earth, humble and at times, incredibly funny person. While everybody, including Guetta, are extremely brazen and don't hold back when speaking about each other, their profession or how the street art culture has developed over time into a somewhat monopolistic environment (which can be viewed by the fact that the rich and famous turned out in droves for Banksy's first exhibition in the United States).This isn't a film about 'graffiti' though, as some may simply see it as on the surface, aside from the exploration of a fast growing community it is also a deep, scary and heart-warming look at Thierry Guetta's life over a decade onwards as he constantly leaves behind his family and his job to follow various artists around the globe. Mentally unstable, or one of the greatest French minds of the last twenty years, nobody is quite sure what Thierry Guetta (also known as Mr Brainwash) is, but what everybody does acknowledge is that he is a man with a passion and while he may not follow the same ideology as everybody else, his heart is still in the right place. 'Exit Through The Gift Shop' is a fascinating documentary focusing on a rising culture that many people may not have much knowledge about, except for knowing the name of the elusive, and as I have mentioned, surprisingly hilarious Banksy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not that I felt the same thrill Thierry must have gotten while roaming the streets with street artists, I however admit to downloading the movie via torrent (yes its illegal), and so watched it in my own living room for anyone interested in the circumstances of the review.Viewers should be reminded that Exit Through the Gift Shop is a documentary rather than a movie, but at the same time plays out more like an adventure movie than an educational one about street artists. Albeit being more down to earth, a fitting comparison could be Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.Thierry Guetta is our main character and camera guy at the same time. While lurking behind the camera he tells us his intriguing story when his life took a sudden and distinct turn. He had became known as "the guy with the camera" - developing some kind of compulsive disorder after his mother passed. His argument that everything should be recorded or else abruptly might get lost at any point in life seems reasonable but his thousands of tapes, that nobody would ever watch, piled up in his basement confirms the maladaptive nature of his behavior. His compulsive filming became a useful tool first when he met a street artist that he began to follow - filming every event of the artists creative process. He sank deeper and deeper into the world of street artists and that became sort of an addiction to Thierry. He seemed to almost forget about his wife and kids. Exit Through the Gift Shop tells us as much about street artisting as it does about Thierry himself. Despite being, as he himself points out, "a ghost behind the camera", his character truly steals the show. This is by no means a problem but rather enrich the story with a greater purpose. Thierrys meeting with Banksy and the following episodes poses a lot of interesting questions about what art really is, what it means to humans, what talent is made of and even about complex group behavior. Despite being directed by a street artist and evidently put together from thousands of different tapes, Exit Through the Gift Shop is amazingly well directed. It doesn't feel hyped, it doesn't seem to lie or exaggerate the happenings and the fact that an interesting, motivated and special character gets to portrait everything from an outside view is fascinating to watch. My text is hardly enough to summarize it so the only tip i can give you is WATCH IT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fast-paced and highly entertaining film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exit Through the Gift Shop may be all smoke and mirrors but it is a highly provocative mirror we look into, one that raises many questions about the commercialization of art and even about the authenticity of the documentary form itself. Ostensibly directed by the mysterious British graffiti artist Banksy, the film, shot with a not too steady hand-held camera, describes the attempts by Los Angeles clothing store owner Thierry Guetta to capture on film the world of street artists, previously hidden from public view. Banksy, who has developed quite an underground reputation for outrageousness after posting his own paintings in the Met and other museums, is shown hooded, in shadows, and with his voice distorted.He begins the film by explaining that the movie was supposed to be about him but when Guetta's attempt at film-making proved to be unwatchable, he took over the making of the film and it became a documentary about Guetta, and how he was transformed into the street artist known as "Mr. Brainwash". Narrated by Welsh actor Rhys Ifans (slotted to play Edward de Vere in the upcoming Roland Emmerich film Anonymous), Guetta is an garrulous and outgoing Frenchman who carries his video camera with him wherever he goes, filling up tape after tape. After meeting with his cousin known as Space Invader, a graffiti artist famous for mosaics showing characters from the Space Invader video game, he is introduced to Shepard Fairey, the man responsible for the Obama "hope" campaign in 2008 as well as street artists Monsieur André, Swoon, Sweet Toof, Borf, and many others.Shepard and Thierry become partners in the clandestine world of graffiti-making and, even though Shepard feels that that there is something not quite right about Guetta, he is happy to have him around as a "security guard" who is willing to climb tall buildings to locate the most lucrative spots. Eventually, Thierry realizes that, in order for his film to be successful, he must find a way to find the reclusive Banksy. He finds Banksy, however, almost impossible to track down. The power of intention works wonders though, for on a trip to Los Angeles, Banksy himself contacts Thierry to ask for his help in finding the best places to post in L.A. The end result is an ongoing relationship and a Banksy art show called "Barely Legal" that does extremely well financially. As far as its artistic merits, I will leave that to others to decode.After Banksy tells Guetta to leave his tapes with him and go put on his own show, Thierry does just that, renting an old CBS Studio and transforming it into a factory where he endeavors mightily to put on his own show "Life is Beautiful" under the name "Mr. Brainwash". The 2008 show, aided by an L.A. Weekly cover story, earns Thierry over one million dollars and catapults the Frenchman into the ranks of the world's most popular street artists. Exit Through the Gift Shop may be the real deal or it may be a tongue-in-cheek spoof of the gullibility of the public and the crass commercialism of the art world but only Banksy really knows. It does, however, provide a fast-paced and highly entertaining glimpse into a world that has, heretofore, eluded the camera because of its secretive nature and dubious legality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd heard of the film but must admit to watching it with no expectation whatsoever, so there's no point in me saying I wasn't disappointed as I had no expectation BUT I was immediately enchanted and absolutely hypnotised by this fantastic tale that weaves fact with fiction.Banksy blurred and blacked-out next to a monkey head with no eyes under glass...superb! A yuppie pop attack that given half a chance a yuppie would probably buy as art or media...AND then Banksy's effected voice...oh my giddy aunt...I almost poohed my pants with laughter...AND WHAT DOES HE DO? He proceeds to play slightly dumb and remote allowing those that he is having a poke at to continue BEING dumb and remote. You, Banksy mate (not that it matters to you) gained my respect straight away! HERE is a genuine film that IS 'STREET ART'.But the real star of the piece --- as created by Banksy --- is Thierry Guetta...F**king Genius! A superb caricature for the modern age...not only is he a Warhol baby BUT he seems to be the actual mistake that Warhol made during a dodgy can of soup in HIS fifteen minutes of madness! If he's really like he is portrayed then he's a passionate groupie at best without any artistic ability whatsoever...unless art has become project management (...AND to be honest I'm not sure whether Banksy is really making THAT point BUT hey I'm one measly member of the stupid masses...) Hell, it doesn't matter as Guetta does a good deal of his talking whilst overlooked by a portrait of the Laughing Cavalier...whose heady hairstyles he seems to emulate...so consciously or subconsciously he is laughing at us whilst laughing at the character he creates...everything is so manufactured that it is almost stencilled in a way that STREET ART never was BUT in a way that the mass market bullsh*t IS! What can I say but this is a portrayal of a distorted art market and the plain meaninglessness of pop-art? Now that everyone can have their fifteen minutes of fame I guess the thing to de-construct is fame itself...and that's what Banksy does here...and has been doing since he marked his first wall...I could go on but it'd waste your time with my idiocy and isn't that what this film is about?! Take a leaf out of Banksy's Beckett-like debut (not only has he Waited for Godot HE stencilled him)--- Think for yourself and create your own reality! Definite must watch for everyone in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is Either The Most Believable Mockumentary In Film History, Or The Most Disingenuous Documentary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film where the less you know about it beforehand, the better. Directed by the mysterious street artist Banksy, the ostensible story follows a French immigrant to Los Angeles named Thierry Guetta who made his living operating a second hand clothing shop.As a hobby, Guetta began videotaping the nighttime antics of various local street artists like Shepard Fairey (who created the famous HOPE poster of Barack Obama) as they plastered their guerrilla art on empty billboards, highway overpasses and the blank sides of buildings often times just a few steps ahead of the vigilant, but unappreciative L.A. police department.Virtually any street artist who was anyone, including the elusive Banksy, sooner or later got videotaped by Guetta, which led to hundreds of hours of raw footage being stored in unmarked boxes that no one would ever see. Like a collection of dictionaries on a shelf, while they may have all the words necessary to tell a great story, until someone did the actual work of putting them into a coherent order, there would be no way to separate the signal from the noise.Several attempts to bring order to this chaos were less than successful, finally, Thierry Guetta got tired of just documenting these street artists, hey, if they could be artists by just doing it, so could he. So, blatantly stealing these street artists style, methods and madness, Thierry Guetta declared himself an artist and began to create work on his own. Yes, just like that.Exit Through The Gift Shop finally takes us to the madcap opening of Thierry Guetta's first one-man show in a gallery created from an unused TV Studio. It is a huge success and becomes the "happening" place to be seen for a while. In fact, Thierry Guetta has probably made more money and generated more press than some of the street artists he used to film and who are still on the streets as it were, much to their annoyance.Exit Through The Gift Shop is a thrilling and original film that grabs you from the first and won't let go; the only problem with all of this is it may just be a prank. The clues to that are the fact that Banksy, the nominal director is a notorious prankster and not too many people seemed to have heard about this Thierry Guetta until this film was made. One other thing, actor Rhys Ifans (Notting Hill, Greenberg, Pirate Radio) provides the narration for the film and unless I am very mistaken, also seems to be the disguised voice of Banksy, who we see interviewed in heavy silhouette to hide his face. It also seems odd that all of this could have been happening in the very public L.A. art community without more people on the outside hearing about it. Either way, this is a fast paced and exciting film that will tickle you, astound you and fascinate you, even if you know nothing about street art. Which makes Exit Through The Gift Shop either the most believable mockumentary in film history, or the most disingenuous documentary. Exit Through The Gift Shop celebrates the subversive excitement many artists feel as they skewer the pieties of the pop culture that spawned them and not so subtly reminds us that on occasion, even the tamest of artists will bite the hand that feeds them. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gotta Getta a Guetta</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the very nature of the underground street art movement "Exit Through the Gift Shop" feels fresh and almost subversive. It doesn't matter to me if it is a conceptualized mockumentary, or a genuine attempt to record the outsider reality experienced by brilliant street artists like Shepard Fairey, Invader, and the infamous Banksy. "Exit Through The Gift Shop" is mischievous and immediate in the same way that street art is.Mainly we watch the evolution of Thierry Guetta from an obsessive-compulsive videographer to a successful popular artist whose street credibility is quickly parlayed into the show of shows. Guetta takes contemporary icons and gives them Warholian emphasis, so we see a reinvention of Madonna, who once reinvented herself in a Marilyn-like way, and who we later learn commissions Mister Brainwash (Guetta) to design her cover art. Guetta's point-of-view is absolutely authentic in the way it synthesizes and skewers popular culture. Or is it Banksy's point-of-view? It doesn't matter. It's brilliant, provocative, charming, and completely entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent whether you think it's a hoax or 100% truth!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many who will swear this film is 100% truth. However, there are also those who believe it to be a complete farce- concocted by Shepard Fairy (the Obama poster guy) and everyone's favorite guerilla stenciler, Banksy. Regardless of the film's true history, it is a statement about street art and, more importantly, an examination of the true values which motivate it. The film opens in 1999 with Thierry Guetta, a clothing mogul and amateur filmmaker. Guetta is a bumbling, stumbling and nearly incoherent Frenchman who accidentally discovers his cousin's role in the rapidly growing street art community. This chance occurrence sends Guetta on a 10 year, global journey to document prominent members of the fledgling art movement- from its grimy, urban roots on street corners and the sides of buildings, to its rise into galleries, auction houses and the homes of wealthy collectors. The odd, quirky and moving art in the film plays as much of a role as Guetta, Banksy and the other artists. Guetta represents the unknowing public who is forced to view this street art created by individuals who are fueled by cynicism and disgust for the modern, commercial and censored world we live in. And, naturally, he wants to be a part of it. Without giving too much away, 'Exit through the Gift Shop' is first an intimate look into the world of street art and how mainstream consumerism is destroying it- the same way it did coffee houses, acoustic music, and, well, art in general. And then it is one man's odyssey into the street art world. He is overcome by one of the last great outlets of independent social criticism and some of the movement's greatest contributors. Then, he attempts to become one of them and really makes a mess. 'Exit through the Gift Shop' is a documentary in the way that 'Borat' was a documentary. It's farce which forces its viewers to look deeper into the subject. Rhys Ifan provides narration for the film, which only adds to the humor and overall dry wit. In a perfect synthesis, 'Exit' combines great art, a few nail biting and anxiety inducing moments and a clever and hilarious story which is both too far-fetched to be fully believable but also simply be written off as a complete hoax.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exit Through the Gift Shop or How a Moron Can Be a Well Known Artist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all we have to make clear that this film is not about Banksy (although it contains some very rare and interesting footage of him "working"). Better than that this film is MADE BY Banksy himself! So be prepared for something really fresh. Second of all, this film is not even about street artists in general. It's about a man that tried too hard to be one. So be prepared for something entertaining. Best of all, this particular "artist" is actually an idiot so be prepared for something funny as hell. This movie is following a guy who accidentally got himself into the world of street art, not as an artist (he can't even draw a single line), but as a watcher. During the finale you will find out how an outsider moron, without working at all, can be a well known artist pissing all over the street art. I don't know if this is a vendetta for Banksy or he was just wanted to restore street art's "honor" from guys like Mr BrainWash (my God...).

		<shortDescription>Banksy: the joke is the message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The infamously elusive street artist Banksy's directorial debut, Exit Through the Giftshop, has baffled critics once again after being nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Documentary category. Reviewers and moviegoers alike have been unsure about the film's authenticity; speculation over whether it's a hoax is rife. So have the Oscar judges been fooled?Exit Through the Giftshop tells the story of Thierry Guetta, an eccentric French shopkeeper and amateur filmmaker in California who decides to film street artists at work. Some of the world's most famous street artists agree to participate, including Banksy, who, in the interest of preserving his closely guarded anonymity, demands to be blacked out in the footage.But in reality, Guetta has no intention of editing his footage together into a documentary. Banksy realises this and halfway through the film he takes over. He decides to make his own movie about Thierry's project and convinces the Frenchman to become a street artist himself. Banksy teaches him all the tricks of the trade. Thierry ends up adopting the name MBW, an acronym for 'Mr Brainwash'.Banksy is widely accepted to be the director of Exit Through the Giftshop, though he is not formally credited as such in the film. His point is to expose how empty and easy commercial street art has apparently become.The film is effectively a joke on two counts. Firstly, it exposes 'the joke' that is contemporary street art, which, Banksy signals, has become so vacuous that anyone could do it. Second, by blurring the lines between fact and fiction and still presenting the whole thing as a documentary, Banksy has delivered a test for the art critics themselves, who have had to decide whether or not to call his bluff. As they are dared either to love it or hate it, Exit Through the Gift Shop has led to a chronic case of fence-sitting among reputable critics. This is for fear, not only of being exposed as not getting the joke, but also as not getting Banksy himself.Commentators basically risk slotting themselves into one of two polarised camps. The accepting viewer becomes a clued-up subscriber of Banksy's trendy, but in my opinion arrogant, worldview. The rejecting viewer, however, is widely deemed to be an ignorant zombie, moving about the world without any care or understanding for the injustices Banksy purports to be exposing.Whatever you make of Banksy's Big Messages (I'm not a fan), Exit Through the Gift Shop is indeed a captivating story. Yet it seems the Oscar jury has tried to put itself in the cool, Banksy-fan camp just by nominating the film, which doesn't strictly qualify as a documentary. Or does it?Regardless, there is clearly a message here. So let's go back to the film to see what it's all about.The underground world of graffiti artists is opened up to us through Thierry Guetta's befriending of street artists who accept him into 'the movement'. One, Shepard Fairey, says of street art that 'the more important it seems? the more people wanna know what it is?and it gains real power from perceived power'.So the aim is to get people noticing, wondering about and discussing your graffiti. The more you see an image repeated across a city, the logic goes, the more valid it will seem. Just think of the rats that Banksy has spraypainted around London as a reminder that we're all apparently slaves to the rat race.Such repeated 'tags' become trademark symbols, serving to legitimise a street artist as a notable presence in a city landscape. But what does it say of the art itself if it needs to be judged simply by how much it is being talked about, and if the way to achieve this is by being repeated ad nauseum? In fact, Banksy's joke about modern art's (ir)relevance is answered in the film by proclaiming that it derives its legitimacy from recognition.Banksy, the most prolific and well-known artist of the movement that Thierry Guetta sets out to document, has built a successful career in providing new icons and narratives for artists to discuss. His graffiti has attempted to rewrite the presumptions of the galleries and dealers who make up the art establishment. And as a social commentator, Banksy has sought to rewrite the story of how we view everything from the surveillance society and consumerism to the Israel-Palestine conflict. His insistence on anonymity is meant to help signal that this alternative narrative that he tries to promote is all around us if you just look hard enough because he supposedly exposes a deeper truth.When put into the context of Banksy's wider work and graffiti activism, it becomes clear that Exit Through The Gift Shop is also an attempt to rewrite the story of 'the movement'. If he who makes the recognisable icons also truly has the power to set the agenda, then the temptation to play a trick on the cultural establishment ? and maybe embarrass his critics in the process - was too strong for Banksy to resist.As for whether or not the film is a good documentary, the pedants who want to disqualify it from the Oscar race miss the point. All documentaries are scripted movies and playing with the truth has more and more become part of the documentary filmmaker's remit, as, for instance, Catfish has shown.When The Cove won the Oscar for Best Documentary last year, it was not due to being a high-quality film. Instead it was The Message wot won it. Likewise, if Exit Through The Gift Shop wins this year, it will say more about the jury's social leanings than about the film's cinematic worth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing film - unreproducible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen a movie detail in a clearer way the difference between art and imitation. This film is a pitch perfect example of how general public ignorance kills real art and replaces it with cheap copies of itself. -particularly ironic for street artists, whose entire medium is based on making cheap copies. How banksy could make this all so completely lucid and simple, how he begins by turning a documentary that was suppose to be about him on the amateur documentarian himself, seems a working example of the principles of street art ? looking at wasted urban environments as a launching pad for art is just like looking at neglected urban people as the most interesting place for a story to begin. And what a story. This is better than fiction: the film takes you from the documentarian's compulsion with filming everyone and everything, a seemingly pure pleasure, to his compulsion and luck with filming street artists. It makes you truly love him for his irrational passion in his new subjects and their growing trust in him as the only true documentarian of their work. Then it shows how this same passion drives him towards becoming a street artist himself. It seems a perfect fit - you don't need a pedigree - just passion. But he capitalizes on it, copying not only the work, but the hype machine that propelled Banksy, Obey and all others, until he's essentially a kind of grotesque gambler - a monster imitator desiring to now replicate and beat the art and artists he once loved innocently capturing. The public is none the wiser. They mistake his work for that of his influences. His style for that of those he ripped off.In focusing on the little person and watching him grow into a monster imitator, a malignant force that capsizes the movement - you see how hype, press and capitalism corrupt passion, or are the logical extreme of it: passion taken to its final conclusion when left unchecked. You see how love for art is based on desire: a need to hold onto something so tightly you become it, how idolizing someone is one step away from tearing him down to replace him with your own untrained, envious persona. By the end, Banksy's need to remain anonymous, his FBI styled black face, voice altered interview, takes on a much different meaning. It's not just to avoid recrimination for his illegal art, it's to avoid self-hype, celebrity, corrupting greed - the very kind that his imitator revels in. It's to make art with no drive to exploit himself, to keep it coming from an honest place, the only place it should come from, whether the public can tell the difference or not. His final thoughts on the man who imitates him, while negative, don't feel biased, even given Banksy's somewhat losing role in their relationship. He was never in the public hype game to begin with, not as a recognizable human being, so from the very start, he avoided the final weakness that all rising artists - real or imitators - succumb to: the reproduction and sale of their own image.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remarkable character study capturing the life of a rather eccentric man. Banksy's direction is inspired.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How is it until now I'd never seen this gem of a movie? The film is directed by notorious, and equally mysterious English street artist, Banksy. It uses many, many pieces of stock footage from a French shop keeper named Thierry Guetta (A man who would later be known as Mr. Brainwash), who follows many street artists all over the world, capturing their art on film before it is taken down. He soon comes across the man himself, capturing his art, and even attempts to make a documentary centered around the art, and the artists (Even though he has never made a film before). But Banksy decides to turn the tables, and instead focuses his own documentary on the life of Guetta. Why? As Banksy himself puts it, "He's a more interesting person than I am." An inspired decision on his part. Theirry Guetta really is a fascinating person, a man obsessed with taking a video camera everywhere he goes, and capturing these artists at work, having strong senses of passion for both. He is also a witty person, sometimes the things he says feel a little too odd to be true, but believe it. The film's portrait of the man is rather eccentric, and energetic.A lot of this is to the credit of film editors Tom Fulford, and Chris King, whose editing and pacing is pitch perfect, always leaving proper delivery for some rather humorous things to occur, and never straying away from giving the world of art its own adequate time in the spotlight. The film really is a thought provoker, sometimes the life of the man can make you question "Is this for real?" I guess the whole film is really summed up by one phrase: "Time will tell whether I'm a rabbit, or a turtle." Sounds silly now, but once you hear it, the gears in your head start right up. It's a passionately crafted movie of a man with nothing but passion for what he does.Exit Through the Gift Shop is a diamond in the rough, one that I give **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if there is any definitive proof out there to suggest that this in fact a "mockumentary" or a "prankumentary", or whatever else it has been coined by critics for that matter - but - hoax or not, I thought it was well worth the watch! I personally believe it is fake. Straight from the off I began to to question aspects of the story; the validity of the storyline, the authenticity of the characters, and in particular, who was doing the filming when it was the film-maker in shot!? Anyway, that aside, Banksy does make a pretty convincing movie, and after surfing the web for just a few minutes, my findings have proved that many (dupes?) still firmly believe the material is 100% authentic.For me, this takes little away from my enjoyment in watching the film. Towards the end, I did feel a little cheated, as documentaries have traditionally been based on reality, and therefore a non fiction documentary does seem a little pointless. But like I said before, it is still worth watching.Admiring the many pieces of street art, alone, make the film worth a watch for me. Don't expect to be blown away, because this after all is just a documentary, (and lets face it, no documentaries are that exciting!) but it certainly does enough to maintain my interest throughout.I doubt this is ever going to exist as somebody's 'favourite movie ever', I think I can say that with conviction, however, it is one of those films that I recommend you watch - If only once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exit Through the Gift Shop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, a misconception has been clarified, it's a documentary made by Banksy instead of a documentary about Banksy, the protagonist is a French guy lived in USA, named Thierry Guetta, who is a fanatical street art lover and amateur filmmaker, later he dubs himself as "Mr. Brainwash", when he engages himself into his own path as an artist, and eventually he succeeded in turning his debut solo exhibition as an unforeseen knockout.Conspicuously I am not such a documentary enthusiast, the last-seen documentary I could recall is Werner Herzog's ENCOUNTERS AT THE END OF THE WORLD (2007). And the single reason why I feel compulsive to watch this film is BANKSY, then, due to the opening statement, it is a nonevent for me. But the film has its very rational depiction of the current ill-directed contemporary art market where self-seeking and over-hyped works are dominating, which are strangling the creativity of aesthetics for a booming generation, with which is the noblest and the most quintessential liability endows every qualified artist.Whether or not the entire sensation is a hoax, the film has cunningly skipped most of Mr. Brainwash's activity concerning doing art, there comes a staggering shock all of a sudden he has created so many paintings and other art works, while we have not been witnessed anything about how these astronomical farragoes being produced, which I consider a big loophole here, or maybe it is a planned maneuver, only it boomerangs. Thierry's broken English is another nuisance for me, most of his interviews are badly written and don't contain any substantial meaning, even no wisecracks, and the film has wasted too much screen time on him rather than on his and other graffiti artists' works, and what's more vexing, he is not an even interesting character! After all, I tend to believe it is another prank Banksy has brewed, to expose the shallowness and aimlessness of the sickeningly frivolous art world we are trapped in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low art &amp; high commerce.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Widely speculated to be an elaborate prank by the world's foremost "street" artists, Banksy, this ultimately engaging film examines the line between artistry, con artistry and commerce. The movie plays like a reality TV show with footage shot by Frenchman (although the silliness of his accent makes one wonder) Thierry Guetta interspersed with confessional interviews with the principals including Banksy, well-known since the Obama election Shepard Fairey and Guetta himself. Ultimately, Guetta dominates the story but it is the Banksy interviews which serve as the prime entertainment in the film. Banksy's Geico Gekko accent, Sahara-dry wit ("so I realized Thierry wasn't a documentary filmmaker but just a man with mental problems...and a camera") leave the impression of someone who could fake an entire documentary for fun and profit. However, Guetta may be the puppet master given that he cons Banksy, Fairey and "Space Invader", another Frenchman, into teaching him the trade, rips off their work and ultimately bamboozles the world's art-buying public into forking over several million dollars for crap he created on the fly (to which Banksy deadpans: "I use to encourage everyone I met to create art, I don't do that so much anymore"). Fans of "The Usual Suspects", "Basic Instinct" or just of ambiguity generally will appreciate the film and puzzling over what differentiates art from grift, con from sucker and selling out from keeping it real.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A key insight for me is what I amusingly call Ted's law. In this, when we layer abstractions in art, the "distance" between layers is equal. This is a great example.The idea builds on the notion that humans alone are capable of seeing themselves in the world as they see the world. It is how we define consciousness.Shakespeare started the notion of folding in art, where we add another layer: we have us as audience, a state both we and the play (in this case the play) acknowledge. In the play, we have people in the same state, an audience of sorts for the world of the movie. Since Shakespeare, we elaborate these folds because of the greater narrative palette it affords, but the basic dynamics are analogic layers, folds.Ted's law holds that the relationship of abstraction established between the audience and the play is the same as that between the audience and the play (or whatever) within.Banksy is an artist who works with this idea. His art almost always consists of two elements. One is chaotic, sloppy, copying (or adopting existing) graffiti, the vandalism sort. Superimposed on that is an observer rendered in a different style. These are made from stencils but originate in and reference photographs. These are on the street, so an observer can see the people looking at the art, the character within the art, and some random "art" designated from previously would have been equivalent to trash.Frankly, this is a trivial idea because it is "small art." Small art is art designed to be consumed in the moment between the flipping of pages in a magazine, or during commercials. It has to be attractive and easy to "read." On reflection, it has to have a simple explanation. Part of this is the supposition that it is art of the people, real, visceral art. For me, it is background noise. It cannot help me, shape me or destroy me. That's a job for big, long form art.Okay, now the film. The idea is the same: we have the street art. We add another layer: the story of the artists. We add yet another layer, the story of the filmmaker covering the story of the artists, making the "observer art" that is superimposed on graffiti, which in turn is linked to us as passers by. I do not suppose that this was designed by Banksy as a project beforehand, because that assumes less spontaneity than he advertises. I suppose instead that the story is much as it is presented: he fell into an opportunity and exploited it in the way he works.The thing that has captured the imagination of the film public (and the Academy) is the tantalizing prospect that some part is a hoax. This clearly is engineered, because a similar joke is behind his street art. But even that is small art.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

When he visits his native country, France, and finds a cousin who is a street artist named Invader, his blood takes him on a tour where he meets other unorthodox graffiti painters on their controversial rounds, mostly at night, in order to avoid the law.Guetta meets the most notorious guerrilla artist of them all, a Brit who uses the name Banksy. They become good friends and the underground Englishman has managed to keep is identity a secret, even after becoming a financial success. So far, so good. The problem comes up when Guetta starts painting and somehow, with no apparent talent, becomes the toast of the Los Angeles art community with a show, followed by fame and fortune. The man is an insufferable ass****. By the end of the documentary, I hated the guy. Stay away from this pretentious bull****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew nothing of this film. When I received a email from the Sundance Institute. Stating a surprise Documentary to be screened at Sundance. I jumped at the opportunity. And what I discovered was brilliant.Sundance announced the surprise documentary was to be "Exit through the gift shop". Now I still knew nothing at this point. Then I overheard many conversations about this Bansky fellow. So, I felt the need to find out a bit. Not too much. Wanted to go into this feeling surprised. And I was.The documentary starts off with Terry Guetta a France native living in L.A. Terry filmed everything. I mean everything. Then on a trip back to France he followed his cousin "Invader" a well known street artist. Terry found the rush of street art addicting. So, once back in L.A. Terry filmed another famous street artist Shepard Fairey. Now Terry was now looking to film the greatest street artist ever. Banksy! After Banksy and Terry finally met. Their friendship blossomed. Allowing Terry to film the mysterious Banksy. As the film progresses Terry's film making subsides. And he has the "Bug" to become a street artist himself. Now as Banksy turns the camera on Terry. The film changes direction and reveals some interesting facts and faults.I will leave the storyline there. I wouldn't want to give away the whole documentary. The artwork and the story is engaging. The documentary is thought provoking and honest. A must see for all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Banksy directs a documentary about Thierry Guetta who immigrated from France in 1999. He opened a trendy vintage clothing shop in L.A. He is constantly filming with his video camera. He discovers his cousin is street artist Space Invader which turns into a more in-depth obsession with other street artists. Invader connects him with Shepard Fairey which leads to other artists. He gets intrigued with the secretive Banksy. He films Banksy and then Banksy turns the camera on him.There is a fun energy about this. It feels guerrilla secretive outsider work. Then the question becomes whether this is real or fake or semi-real. It colors the movie for me. In the end, this is another form of street art. It doesn't have to follow any demands of a documentary. I took the whole movie with a grain of salt. It doesn't mean it's bad. I just wish this is a more definitive solid movie about Banksy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Are the things around you real? Are they really what they seem? These questions are not entirely new, and usually the movies that pretend to answer them feature people in leather and latex and bullet dodging. But can you recall a single documentary that makes you ask the same questions without even actually trying to do it? I certainly don't. And this is just one of the things that Exit Through the Gift Shop does in a fresh and innovative way.It's actually hard to describe what this film is without being either banal or cryptic. On the surface, this is a documentary about street art, people who do it and a particular person with a camera, who started as just a spectator from aside and ended up an overnight sensation in the art world himself.But again, that's just the surface, and is everything what it seems? May it be a contrived attempt to show the true nature of modern art, a brilliant satire about the "true" value of it and a clear demonstration that in today's postmodernist world the only things that matter are promotion and hype?Anyway, no matter if this film is a true chronicle of the street art and the people who make it or some sort of mockumentary prank made by Banksy to promote himself or have a laugh at the whole world for our own money, it's still a very thought provoking film and a great opportunity to see street art beyond simple graffiti. At least i finally got to see some of Banksy's works, and i have to admit that what he and some other guys do is far from plain vandalism authorities try to make it look like.Still, Exit Through the Gift Shop is about more than just the counterculture art. It's also about the contemporary art as a whole, about the way it's perceived by people and what makes the difference between art and kitschy rubbish. This topic had already been raised before, but what makes this film unique is that it's not a fiction, and those guys who took some retard's sick fantasies at face value were not hired actors but regular people. And no matter if Banksy is an authentic artist or a project aimed at monetary gain, it takes a degree of brilliance to show so clearly in what screwed up world we're living today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great On-the-Spot Documentary That's Hampered by a Bland Third Act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Banksy and friends must have mined for ages to extract the glistening artifacts that form the backbone of this documentary. Tracing the roots of street art through the constant eye of amateur filmographer Thierry Guetta, it's a legit, vivid encapsulation of the thoughts that formed a global movement's shared ideals. Guetta, whose branching connections to the scene are nothing short of amazing, captured years' worth of footage, then filed it away with no sense of categorization or even basic labeling. The resultant greatest hits reel makes for some rich viewing material, but I certainly don't envy the amount of whittling it took to get there. At some point those tapes must have run dry, though, because the focus suddenly shifts from the notorious exploits of Space Invader, Shepard Fairey and Banksy to Guetta's own farcical artistic aspirations. Whether intentional or not, (and I'm fairly certain it was) that jolting misdirection changes the tone from a fresh, adventurous documentary to a thick, bitter dissertation on art-for-profit and the redundant question of what defines the terms 'artist' and 'artwork'. It's an abrupt, unnecessary final word that seems tacked on to give the story some sort of sought-after greater message, which is a shame because the film was trucking along nicely enough without it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, what a great documentary. Having said that, hilarious, disturbing, brilliant, where to begin with this one? The story of street art which took a serious turn from straight up graffiti somewhere along the way to becoming the new hottest thing, but this story has a twist.The John Belushi looking Thierry who is crazy, and was obsessed with filming street artists, having fooled many to believe he was a documentary filmmaker, when in reality he was just a French guy with a camera. Became obsessed with meeting the brilliant, elusive street artist Banksy and one day does. Banksy, who is everything Thierry is not, being humble, low key, a true artist, not looking for fame. Imagine that? Actually attempting to avoid the spotlight. Or is Banksy not what you would think and just brilliant at creating a mystique, like Batman who everyone wants to know his true identity, who doesn't want recognition and operates at night in the cover of darkness in order to create that scarcity many artists desire in order to sell for more money? that is up to you to decide. I feel that Banksy is the real deal, a true artist, not in it for the money and a true genius.Banksy, who is the Michael Jordan of street artists encountered Theirry In L.A. and warmed up to him after he took a metaphorical bullet for him at Disneyland in a hilarious post 9/11 scare, encouraged Thierry to go back to L.A. and put on a show after he realized the horror that was his attempt at a documentary film. With Banksy's endorsement, Thierry became a million dollar art seller on his first show.This film is as much a commentary on the creative movement of street art as it is the death of the movement. Innovators come along, do something new, than it becomes mainstream because some hack imitates the originators and sucks all the air out of the movement. Same old story...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Exit Through The Gift Shop, is, first and foremost, very entertaining. It has fast editing, great music, and it is constantly telling new and interesting things to show us. And what is really great about it is that it is not just showing 'real footage', but also showing what can be the destruction of any type of real passion behind any work or project. I thought throughout the first half that this film was about Thierry and him just showing what real expression many people find in street art. I also thought it was about him finding his true passion in something different, like filmmaking. It was a great first half, but the film also steers in some very intriguing directions. In a way, it plays out like the best type of self-destruction films there are, even when there was no real unfortunate events at the end for who the film is really about. It also contains a tone that is never really taking all of this 'art' business seriously. Even before the real 'life revelation' that Thierry has, it is all actually revealing itself to be more of a satire.I have also seen that there has been speculation if it is real or not. And it doesn't matter... simply because the film has made it's ideas come out of the film strong and simple. There are very interesting people. Also to NOTE- what irony that both Banksy and Thierry ended up changing roles? One of the best films of 2010, and probably the most challenging documentary in a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this film and, I must admit, I was baffled with the many inconsistencies, or should I say, the plot holes in the film.I wanted to believe, but I kept going back to the obvious gaps. For example, Guetta had been filming every moment of his life (even flushing the toilet), but his family videos seemed frozen in time. There was little progression in the filming of his family life--we never saw his children grow. But, he has all of this footage of his excursions with street artists that must have taken place over years. Very perplexing.This movie is satire. It is a critique of the contemporary art world.I think back to this ridiculous piece of "art" I saw at MOMA in June of 2009. It was literally a piece of purple yarn thumb-tacked to the wall and floor in the shape of a trapezoid. Nothing else--just string and tacks. And MOMA proudly announced they had just acquired the piece for thousands of dollars. If I remember correctly, it was in the neighborhood of $75,000 (I am not sure of the exact figure because I was so outraged that this was considered a piece of art and what they paid for it, I lost all sensibility and reason). It was not art. Or maybe it was; true art is supposed to elicit a reaction, even anger. Maybe the act of proclaiming it art and advertising how much it cost made it art. But, my initial feeling was (and still is) that it was not worth a major payout and a place in MOMA.I think this is the point of Exit Through the Gift Shop. True art is so hard to create in our current overexposed media culture that even the art gatekeepers can't decipher what is brilliant and what isn't.Whomever made this film made the point of the ridiculousness of what constitutes art. And they did a brilliant job of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bizarre Piece of Filmed Art About Bizarre Pop Street Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much better reviews than I could hope to write have been written, so I will keep my remarks short. I have no background knowledge in street art, beyond having heard of Banksy, to really judge this film on the breadth or depth of its coverage.What I found interesting about this film is not so much the film itself (although it is quite good), but the controversy surrounding it, which is an extension of the actual film to a point. Some have said that Banksy, who is the film's director and also a big part of the film, has created Mr. Brainwash and that the entire film is a scam.I think just the opposite. I think the film is completely real, but Banksy is pushing the idea that it is just a scam to create buzz for it. Which, I think, has worked. By taking a good film and then turning it into a piece of art with multiple dimensions: is there a scam or not, and if so, what is it? That is genius.I also appreciate the inclusion of Shepard Fairey, who I did not know before this film. I had seen his "obey" stuff and the Andre the Giant stuff, and of course the Obama poster. But i did not know who made it or that these were all the same guy. That was a nice revelation for me, and it was great to put a face to the work -- here is a street artist at work since 1989 that has risen to something more. Banksy may be a millionaire street artist, but a street artist just the same. Fairey is commercial, whether that is good or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1999, a man with a camera discovered that a cousin of his was a noteworthy member of a growing movement that would shake the art world to its foundation, make us question what art is and see the world of art change in as radical a way as Warhol and Picasso. He'd document these formative years for almost a decade, becoming the unofficial scribe for the next big wave in art.Unfortunately, he was a bit of a nutter.A film that shows that, indeed, destiny seems to snatch people and play merry hell with them, Exit Through The Gift Shop is obstinately a film about the (in)famous street artist Banksy, known for his striking counter-culture style. It has even been called a case of the documented turning the camera around on the filmmaker. But none of these can truly describe the surreal experience that this documentary becomes. The best I can do is to say that the film is about a man by the name of Thierry Guetta, who through chance and circumstance, becomes the man who captures on film the birth of a movement, is swallowed up by it and then--perhaps quite accidentally--hijacks it for himself.Thierry was on vacation in his native France in 1999, when he discovered that his cousin just happens to be the street artist "Invader", one of a number of people at the forefront of the provocative and thought-provoking street art movement of the late 90's and early to mid-aughts. Thierry also happened to have a compulsion to film every aspect of his every day life. From there, Thierry finds himself becoming part of that movement. Be it a desire to be a part of it, or simply piggybacking on the fame of others, Thierry became the cameraman for a number of street artists. Eventually, his desire to film street artists at work reached its zenith: he wanted to film Banksy.Banksy, who to this day keeps his identity a secret, is the most recognizable name in the street art movement. Indeed, his name is a by-word for the art form in the same way that Picasso is a by-word for cubism. Be it fate, coincidence or sheer chance, Thierry and Banksy's paths crossed, and Banksy found himself under Thierry's lens. As time went on, Banksy confides in Thierry, opening up to him and his camera a part of his world that many have since wished they could have been a part of. But through innocent encouragement, Banksy and his comrades in the street art movement find themselves creating a monster, as Thierry puts his camera down and picks up a stencil and the moniker "Mr. Brainwash."Whereas most documentaries are thought-provoking, or moving, or fill us with a sense of wonder, "Exit Through The Gift Shop" is a laugh riot. We are treated to watch as hapless street artists who invited Thierry into their reclusive world find themselves caught in the riptide that is the almost demented whim of their cameraman. While it shows the birth of the street art movement in fascinating detail, the true focus of the documentary throughout is the man behind the camera. The closest one can come to a comparison is if "Grey Gardens" suddenly had the Maysles put their cameras down and become residents of the dilapidated mansion themselves. We watch the steady transition of a man from an observer to an active participant, laughing and cringing the entire way. One has to admire the sheer enthusiasm that Thierry approaches his newfound subject of obsession, which leaves even the men who began the art movement baffled. The entire time, the man behind street art's most recognizable images displays the wit he's most famous for, giving the film an air of satire that makes it simply surreal.Do yourself a favor. Sit back and watch this documentary with slack-jawed wide-eyed awe. It's an experience that anyone with even a basic interest in street art, documentary filmmaking and, hell, life in general should experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Where else but the streets?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether or not Exit Through the Gift Shop is an authentic documentary, showcasing real-life events without a hint of fabrication or mockumentary-esque sentiment, I cannot say and I'm not prepared to wrap my brain around the multitude of justifications and possibilities. What I am prepared to do, however, is talk about what a visceral and entertaining experience Exit Through the Gift Shop is, and how its effective use and depiction of street art and the politics of street artists is something that deserves your attention. In a film that predicates itself off of portraying and capturing "art terrorists" in the action, and the limitless creative ways they can express themselves, this documentary works to be both an unabashed plunge inside an underground community, as well as a beautiful iteration of something many of us probably took for granted or didn't quite look at so deeply before.Shot by an English street artist who goes by the name of "Banksy," and also assisted by Shepard Fairey, another street artist who is responsible for creating Barack Obama's animated, red/blue campaign image for his 2008 election campaign, Exit Through the Gift Shop chronicles the life of Thierry Guetta, a quirky Frenchmen living in Los Angeles who, since he can remember, shot and recorded everything that occurred in his life. No matter where he went or what he did, Thierry was always armed with a camera and collected thousands of tapes with unique footage stored on them. One thing Theirry was always fascinated with was street art, and learned that one of Los Angeles's most prolific street artists, a man named "Space Invader," who goes around tagging images around town of characters and sprites from video games, is one of his cousins.This sparks a sudden interest in Thierry to begin documenting street artists in Los Angeles. Street artists are known as people that go around town illegally spray-painting, posting, or sticking images in public places. Often times it's taking traditional graffiti and vandalism to the next level by having enormous thirty-feet by forty-feet prints of quirky images plastered on the sides of brick buildings, drawing a countless number of eyes onto your work. Thierry winds up getting in touch with both Fairey and Banksy, and before long, after tirelessly following them around and capturing their process, gets the urge to make his own art under the name "Mr. Brainwash" (MBW), a name he gets from having the desire to infest the minds of who sees his work with his elaborate art involving everything from exaggerated images of celebrities, Warhol-style interpretations and manipulations of popular culture, to images made up of barcodes that distort and render the image into a series of parallel lines if you observe them from a close distance.Through intense marketing by inspiring word of mouth through the Los Angeles area, and requested promotions via Banksy and Fairey, Guetta goes from an underground oddity to a mainstream sensation almost overnight, so much so that he begins crafting an art show so he can sell some of his own works. His inspiration to host a show comes after Banksy creates a storm of positive reception and sales by selling his eclectic street-art at a wild, unconventional art show of his own. This is where the politics of street art begin to conflict. Can one really say that Guetta and Banksy's work, at that point, adheres to the basic principles of underground, illegal art? When something becomes commercialized or licensed, often the authenticity and the roots of the work is compromised, and through Guetta's strives towards fame and acceptance, the concept of boasting "real" street art is almost entirely lost on him.Banksy and crew present this progression so subtly that you might miss it. For example, when the film concluded, I felt a sort of malice and anger towards Guetta for reasons I couldn't adequately summarize. Most films or documentaries that make you detest a person leave you with the ability to summarize that person pretty cogently upon finishing the film, but with Guetta, who is so fundamentally interesting and layered, it took me a significant amount of time to pinpoint what exactly about him and his ways infuriated me. With contemplation, I realize I didn't necessarily hate or dislike him, but seriously pitied him.Here was a person with such a passion and love for what he did, shooting countless hours of video and following around street artists, that he got so invested he wound up exploiting both for monetary and societal gain, in turn, losing the core thesis of what those ideas, particularly the latter, usher in for people and a neglected subculture.What we're left with is Exit Through the Gift Shop, a film with a pulse and a sense of urgency. A film that reminds us of the fluidity and nonlinear capabilities of art, while showing us that it retains an inherent purity unless it is wrongfully utilized or manipulated by people. By having a clear emphasis on the eclectic and the silenced, and helmed by three truly unique and revolutionary artists, who take their voices to the streets to risk it all, real or not, authentic or fabricated, Exit Through the Gift Shop bears ideas that make it almost impossible to ignore. How many potentially fabricated documentaries can you say that about? Directed by: Banksy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't care, if this documentary is a hoax or not. I just care, that it was somewhat entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once, nominated for Best Documentary in the 2011 Academy Awards. This documentary is one of the strangest documentaries, I watch, in a long time. It's surprising that this film got even made. The film's editors had to sit through over 10,000 hours of tapes just to get a few minutes' worth of usable footage. While, the movie says, it was filmed by mysterious graffiti artist, Banksy; most of the filming seem to come from an eccentric French shop keeper and amateur film maker, named Thierry Guetta who transform himself, from an Average Joe into a semi well-known street artist named Mr. Brainwash, in which, this movie covers. However, there has been much speculation, in Thierry's quick artistic metamorphosis evolution that a lot of people, doubt the particularly with regards to authorship and authenticity within the art of this film. Many people believe, that this film was just an elaborate ruse on Banksy's part to cover up that Thierry Guetta is not the artist of his own work, but it was the director that did it, all. It could be, true. After all, Mr. Brainwash's works seem to carbon copy emulate the styles and concepts of Banksy. Plus, there has been some strong speculated that Mr. Brainwash is just another pseudonym outlet for Banksy who remain, very much hidden from the public eye. It has been stated that the reason for this secrecy is that graffiti is a still a crime. Also, since, America has a bigger art market than United Kingdom, but has harsher laws; he would make sense, that Banksy would use, an elaborate public surrogate, just in case, if things go bad, over there. Some suggest, that famous artists, Shepard Fairey and Banksy have been artificially inflating the sales of Mr. Brainwash's work for their own gain. According to some critics, Mr. Brainwash's work hasn't sold as well on independent forums, and I do somewhat believe them. Who knows, if any of this, things are true or not. In the end, it doesn't really matter, to me, because, in my opinion, 'Exit through the Gift Shop' is still entertaining enough, not to care. However, I do believe that the film, portrays Thierry Guetta such a negative light, that it's kinda damaging to the point that many people couldn't take him seriously. He's portray as a mental unbalance comical tool here, rather than a creative artist. I know, Guetta's unhealthy obsession of filming everything is a bit disturbing, but his 2006's short film, Life Remote Control isn't that horrible. Don't get me wrong, it's bad, but it at least, isn't as bad, as the street artists, make it out to be. In my opinion, Guetta still, has some semi-good creatively ideas, when it came to art. Guetta's uniformly subversive pop-art style isn't that amateurism as it looks. So, it was a bit mean-spirited for other street artists to think, they're so much superior to him, and lampoon him, like that. That's one thing, I hate about this film. Everybody in the film acts so pretentious and snobby, when it comes to art. It's such a turn off. However, for the most part, the movie paint the graffiti artists in a good light. Still, I wish, the movie tackle, more of the bad side of graffiti artists as well, as a couther argument. Not all graffiti artist paint their art on abandoned buildings or obvious bland-looking public structure like the movie does for safety reasons. Some, do publicity deface, public property, such as corporate &amp; government building, as a way to promote anarchy and chaos. These acts, can be seem, as disrupted, from the social norms. Others, really go out of their way to vandal, public place used as memorials or worship, as a way to promote hate and discrimination. Other do it, as a way to troll, the public audience, by showcasing hateful or too vulgar or distasteful. Me, personally, I have a love/hate relationship when it comes to those type of graffiti. I do understand, how all graffiti can be represent as art. I can understand, how this type of art, could be misinterpreted and misrepresented by the mainstream media, as gang tagging, or offensive defacement, but there are some truly some artwork isn't that appealing to the eyes, nor wanted. These are it! This can barely be, represented as art. I think, anybody who is a respected graffiti artist can understand, why certain places shouldn't be defacement, by art. After all, I really doubt, that they're willing to have, their own house, graffiti by somebody else. It's way too expensive to clean. I do have to say, I really didn't like that part of the film. Another is the scene where Banksy puts a mannequin dressed like a Guantanamo Bay detainee in the middle of Disneyland. Honestly, what does Disneyland's Big Thunder Mountain Railroad have to with a Guantanamo Bay detainee? I really don't get that message. How is that art? I would, really be mad, if I was, riding that ride, and they close the park, because of that stupid publicity stunt. I would ask, Banksy to repay me for the time, lose. Overall: Graffiti is seen as art to some people and as vandalism to others. It is all based on perspective. As a film, the movie was very interesting. Lots of twist and turns, make this film, a great watch. The future of graffiti looks bright even with all the negative influences it has on it. This film is worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This whole mockumentary or whatever you want to call it is just Banksy's huge slap in the face to modern art and the stupid people who fall for it. Especially in a certain part of our country. Fake people buy into fake things. The image that is created around an object is more important than the object itself. These are some of the messages Banksy portrays in this film. He's giving everyone the middle finger while he's laughing all the way to the bank. Most of what you think is "art" these days is really just clever graphic design then repackaged to look like "art". A lot of what you think is "street art" or underground street companies that started from nothing are really hugely financed business tactics. It takes money to make money. If you market enough the sheeple will follow. Art is dead. This was all so well done and clever I just had to give my respect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary is entertainment on a new level.It knows how to be comedic and cleaver at the same time which some documentaries fail to success at however with Exit Through The Gift Shop it hits all the right notes and glues the watcher to the screen. Looking at the ever fascinating world of street art it shows a look to to the artists from a view no one has seen before and shows how influential art is. It also gives you the opinions and reasons why the artists create there art and shows how most street artists don't care about the 'hype' or money aspects of this newly formed art. If you haven't seen this yet i strongly recommend this documentary even if you go into the movie with no knowledge of Banksy or street art because it is comedic and interesting and shows a different look on the the new revolution of street art and how it all started.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Exit Through The Gift Shop is the Inception of the documentary genre. Like Inception, which dealt with a dream-within-a-dream plot and posed questions about what was real and what wasn't, Exit Through The Gift Shop does the same thing. It's like a documentary within a documentary and it's never quite clear if the whole thing is just one big hoax or if it's all real. I'm not really sure what else to say about this truly original documentary. It's not often I'm at a lose for words after I finish a movie, but that was the case with Exit Through The Gift Shop. For those that are unfamiliar with the plot, I will try to take a crack at it. Thierry Guetta is an amateur filmmaker who stumbles into the underground world of street art. While traveling around the world documenting some of the most talented street artists, Thierry decides to take the footage and make a documentary. The only problem is that he has no idea what to do with the literally hundreds of hours of footage. Once Thierry finally sits down to edit the film, he produces a long, almost unwatchable series of images that made no sense whatsoever. Guetta soon shows the finished product to Banksy, who is considered one of best and enigmatic artists on the underground scene, and he very kindly lets Thierry know that it's garbage and it doesn't show the true artistic expression of street art. Banksy tells Thierry to leave him the footage so he can put something together. With the film out of his hands, a funny thing happened to Theirry. Instead of just documenting street artists, he becomes one himself. The rest of the film chronicles Guetta as he builds his art business, selling some of this "street art" for thousands of dollars. Guetta took street art, something that he fell in love with, and turned it into a commercial enterprise. But by doing so, he essentially loses the spirit of the art. Street art isn't about fame or fortune, it's about expressing yourself and this is where Guetta fails to become a true artist. Or does he? Maybe the whole film is one big hoax to show how subjective art is and a commentary on what should or shouldn't be considered art. If you are a fan of documentaries, Exit Through The Gift Shop should be your first stop. I have zero interest in the world of street art and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. Learning about street art was very informative, but the true star of the film is Guetta. A captivating and enthralling person if there ever was one. Real or fake, Exit Through The Gift Shop is a great film. So much for not knowing what to say, huh?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exit through the Gift Shop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Street art, or more accurately street graffiti has become an elaborate phenomenon, and part of the public consciousness because of the controversial but highly valuable works of the anonymous Banksy, and I was really looking forward to watching a film made by the man himself. This documentary directed by England-based graffiti artist Banksy is not specifically about himself, his political activism and his art, but how another street artist came to meet him and make his name. Eccentric French shop keeper Thierry Guetta was originally an amateur filmmaker, who carried a camera everywhere he went and filmed absolutely everything, storing all footage on hundreds of unwatched tapes, and with no explanation. But then he had a purpose for filming when he spotted street art happening right in front of him, and fascinated he decided to follow the various artists, many using pseudonyms, and film them in work making their conceptual and most intriguing spray paint and sticker based art works around city and town buildings. Artists he followed, that have become famous for their works, included Space Invader, Seizer, Neck Face, Sweet Toof, Cyclops, Ron English, Dotmasters, Swoon, Azil, Borf and Buffmonster, but the one artist he was desperate to meet, having become famous globally for his thought-provoking and most recognisable artworks was Banksy. Guetta tried in a few ways to get hold of him, but it looked hopeless, but then he got a phone call wanting his help for a new art piece, and he rushed straight to his aid, and they worked together many times afterwards. In their time together he assisted Bansky with an art gallery where the public could view various conceptual pieces indoors, included a controversial painted living elephant, but also they almost got arrested when putting a dummy dressed as a dangerous criminal from Guantanimo Bay in Disneyland. It is when Guetta decided to become a street artist himself that he found a way to make a name for himself, and he created many of his own artworks under the pseudonym Mr. Brainwash, and of course creating his own gallery for the public, and he has since gone on to tremendous success, including the brilliant design of Madonna's Greatest Hits album Celebration (which I have). Narrated by Rhys Ifans, with contributions from Debora Guetta (Thierry's wife) and the various artists and art critics. It is a fascinating story of how a man could go from filming with no purpose or reason, finding something meaningful to film, and then of course going on to fame and fortune. This film is brilliant for displaying the other various street artists I may otherwise have not known about, the many works or Banksy and Mr. Brainwash that feature are wonderful pieces, I don't like all graffiti, but when you look at these works they are magnificent and absolutely deserve recognition as valuable art, it is perhaps questionable as to how much of this film is true and how much is made for artistic effects, but it is a fantastic documentary. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really good commentary which is funny, engaging and very well constructed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary is hard to explain in a sentence because even to do so doesn't really do justice to what it is actually about. As everyone knows, the one liner is that a man sets out to make a film about street- artist Banksy but finds himself being the subject of the film instead, which, as I say, really tells you something and nothing all at once. The real content of the film is in its commentary because while the film depicts a man "with a serious mental illness who happens to have a camera" obsessively becoming an artist overnight by aping others and riding hype to success, it is really putting this in front of us as something to think about.Mr Brainwash's art does indeed look like "proper" street art, so why is it not? Why did I automatically writer proper in inverted commas? What is the value of all this soulless mass-produced work and is that value set by the huge amount of money that people are willing to pay. It is all very interesting stuff and it works even better because these questions come onto you as you sit and watch a film that is already engaging before you start getting to this side of it. The story behind the commentary side is engaging as we follow street-artists doing their work, get deeper into the community and also have commentary from Banksy and others along the way. I cannot tell you if it is real or fake ? indeed whether MBH is an ongoing cultural joke by Banksy or not is hard to say, but if it is staged it s very well done and has been planed and delivered over years. To me it both works too well to be faked but at the same time is too perfect a commentary to have just happened by chance, so I really have no idea.It works though, and this is the main thing. "Real" or acted, the structure is good and produces an engaging and intriguing plot, while the bigger picture is thought-provoking and enjoyably wry. I wasn't sure what to expect when I sat to watch the film and, to be honest, am still not sure what I saw, but it works and works well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Originally this movie was conceived as a project that was supposed to show the life and work of street-artists from the inside. But in the end this film is perceived as a comedy about contemporary art.Parts of the movie, which were dedicated to Banksy's works, are really interesting. You become a witness of the process in which the art was born. The film is interesting in a sense that you can better understand works of street-artists, not only can you see the result of their work, but you can also feel sharp social motives encouraging them to create their paintings.However, the storyline is turning an ordinary American man of French descent, Terry, into a "popular" contemporary artist. He can't draw, doesn't have clearly defined social or other reasons for creativity, he just wants to be popular, wants to be part of this creative community. Why did I call the movie a comedy about contemporary art? Because the main purpose of this latter-day "creator", in my opinion, is self-PR, enrichment at the expense of popular art direction. I would call Terry a generator of ideas . But as a street-artist he is still a fake. He pays people to realize his ideas into life and calls it his own art? I don't agree with this course of things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An enchanting collision between two worlds; a man obsessed with his video camera, and the elusive life of the street artist.&nbsp; Exit Through the Gift Shop is viewed through the lens of the hyper but lovable Thierry Andre (or so we're lead to believe) who is never without his camera and becomes driven to follow his street art idols, day and night, through the streets of London, Los Angeles, and New York.&nbsp; Thierry is sweet, self effacing,&nbsp; totally eccentric (some might say, bonkers) and one can't help but like the little chap.&nbsp; His energy levels are so astounding it begs the question&nbsp; - is he on drugs and if so, where can I get some?!&nbsp; He is able to pursue his passion mainly, it appears, because of his really understanding wife&nbsp; who seems to do ALL the child care, housework, cooking, maintenance etc&nbsp; with minimal complaint, while he scampers off to film everything in his line of vision.&nbsp; A chance encounter with the famous but secretive British street artist, Banksy, excites Thierry enormously and leads him to follow the man, with his video camera, everywhere he goes.&nbsp; Banksy, despite usually insisting on a high degree of anonymity, warms to the little Frenchman and allows him into his secretive world. &nbsp;What is so charming about this film is that one has no sense of where it's going, no sense of how long it will go on, no sense of a plot and no sense of how it will end; it is just a delightful, non stop tour of two men's passions and how they collide, switch places, and live every moment of their lives pursuing their dreams to the hilt with not a worry or care.&nbsp; This is living! (unlike the boring, humdrum, grinding drudgery that the rest of us pitiful rat racers go through).&nbsp; That's the magic of this film - energy and passion and the drive to go with it and run.&nbsp; I was genuinely amused, entertained, educated, invigorated, captivated and impressed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to be a street artist and a filmmaker when I grow up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie with a friend of mine when it first came out. We saw it in a darkened room in back of a bar and it felt deliciously illegal as tho we were one of the privileged few to see it since we were personally invited, even tho we paid $3.Exit Through the Gift Shop blew our minds.Controversial scuttlebutt abounds on whether it is a mocumentary. Or, is it real and is Thierry Guetta, the French filmmaker turned graffiti artist, the real subject of the film.Either way - it is a brilliant film.If it is real, Thierry is a great subject and a remarkable turn of events happen to him. If it is a mocumentary it is brilliant and the best documentary to come along in years.I believe Banksy is behind it all like the man behind the curtain in Wizard of Oz.Making faux documentaries are not new.In 1967, Jim McBride made an independent film, David Holzman's Diary, , which was about him following his girlfriend around with a 16mm film camera where he documented his "break up" with her in cinema verite style. People booed at a festival when they found out it was written by Jim McBride.And of course, there are the Christopher Guest mocumentaries like Spinal Tap, Best of Show and others, which bares close resemblance to documentary but is fully scripted.And of course, The Room, a great spoof on movies, and billed as the worst movie every made, starring Tommy Wiseau. He offers even funnier answers to q&amp;A after the movie.After seeing Exit a third time, I am convinced that Banksy orchestrated every scene and brilliantly so. Yet questions arise. How did he get early footage of Thierry and family. What about the box of tapes, and video of Thierry putting up posters like he is the Man with a Movie Camera. The fact that Thierry is called Mr. Brainwash, is a clue Banksy drops behind like pigeon droppings for us to follow. Suppose Thierry had film footage of his family, as already as many of us do, and Banksy discovered the footage and created a new character: Mr. Brainwash. The tapes may be real or fake label, doesn't matter. Thierry may be real, but Banksy made him a character.Some answers are seen in the DVD extras. If you look at the art of Banksy, a lot is playful, funny, and provides social comments on artists. Like the huge spray can of Tomato Spray, the huge TV monster that is a comment on Nam June Paik, abandoned shopping carts in a Monet painting, trees growing out of cars, and a plethora of mocu art. There is some very funny stuff but you will have to use the pause control on the remote to appreciate the art. Remember many artist and art critics take art far to seriously. Read an art critic on modern art. They are like Realtors and say anything to sell the art. Example: "Notice how the red wavy line is nicely juxtapositioned against the modularity of anomalies in the sectional construct of the yellow adjacent lines." signed, typical art critic.Some attribute such early art shenanigans to Duchamp and his upside down urinal titled R.MUTT.But the Exit story arch of wanna be filmmaker to wanna be graffiti artist at the expense of Banksy is really original. Banksy spoofed us and himself again, and we are really lucky to have a chance to view his film and his art. The opening of the Barely Legal art show shows Banksy art not Mr. Brainwash art.In a way, Thierry is Banksy's avatar. In one DVD extra a hooded. pixeled figure is helping Thierry hang a stencil of a bar code. Banksy is very into stencils and I believe he was helping out Mr. Brainwash.Who better to make fun of the annotated giants of art like Warhol and others, than Banksy. Jean Cocteau once said, it is the job of the artist to spoof the avant garde not the bourgeois. I think Warhol was an early Banksy as he really enjoyed putting on news people, art critics and the general public. And Banksy is heir to the throne and continues to carry the torch of modern art into the next century. Banksy is a lot like Andy Kaufman whose genius comedy transgressed reality, creating confusion as to what is real and what is constructed. Banksy is the art wold's Andy Kaufman, for Banksy also blurs the line of art/life/reality. Exit is a spoof, or is it? The truth is somewhere in the Twilight Zone.Long live Banksy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Exit Through the Gift Shop - This was pretty entertaining. The movie starts out as a documentary of Street Artists. The stuff these guys were doing was pretty cool and I would have happily watched 90 minutes worth of that. At some point in the film there was a switch and instead of following around the street artists, we started following around the original documentarian (Thierry Guetta).If you haven't seen this, and plan to, stop reading now! I started to get a little suspicious around the time of this twist. First, when Thierry turned in his first cut of the documentary. They played it off as a completely unwatchable - to me it looked like someone with talent trying to make something unwatchable. Seemed a little odd. The second was when Thierry allegedly got detained at DisneyLand. There was no footage of that. We had to totally take is word about being grilled for hours - and the Disney police examining his video camera.This suspicion did not, for one moment, lessen my enjoyment of the movie. It may have even made me more interested! As Thierry turned into Mr. Brainwash, it was fun to watch. The show he put on was pretty insane and I found myself doing some research on the web to see if it really happened. I did have to question if one person could really put out all that work in such a short amount of time. I know he didn't do the work - but even coming up with that many ideas would take a lot of time.I could keeping going on about this flick. It was something else and I highly recommend a viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bringing to light from the underground</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film hits home on a topic that is not normally addressed in every day life, the underground world of street art. We are impacted every day by the things we hear and see throughout our lives and one of the things that we do not tend to think much about is the occasional train, building, or billboard that is "tagged" by a graffiti artist. Graffiti is one of those taboos in culture that everyone sees and enjoys but do not attempt to try out for themselves because of the legality of said art form. This documentary focuses on those that are not torn away from the underground world of street art because of legality issues but rather submerge themselves within with every ounce of mind, body, and soul.Before seeing this documentary i believed that it would be a film that focused on the life of Banksy and his struggle as a street artist. But lone behold after a while you realize the focus isn't just on the street artists but rather the man behind the camera. Thierry Guetta also known as Mister Brainwash who can be seen as; either a genius who successfully blends works from different street artists and works of pop culture to create originals or just a madman who follows street artists around with a camera just looking to film anything and everything.Through this documentary we are able to catch a glimpse of the life we all wish we could live, hopping from town to town making an impact on every single person who walks by your creation. The film is filled with a constant sense of danger and the excitement that comes along with it. This is a documentary that needed to be made for the world to see what we ignorantly close our eyes to throughout our daily lives.Although he is not a director per say, Banksy does an amazing job putting this film together. He was able to take what Thierry mindlessly filmed and created something great from it. An exposé into his world, the underground world that he thought he would never let anyone see. After giving up his convictions and coming to a realization that this footage could not go to waste, he created something beautiful that teaches us one important lesson about the life of an artist; The life of an artist is a difficult one, however the life of a street artist is damn near impossible without a little bit of company.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film starts out as a straight forward documentary on the street art scene in L.A. and London. Along the way one is forced to confront issues related to the art world. What is art? Is something art because the artist says so? Is something painted on a wall art or vandalism, and can it be a crime to decorate something with art? But then everything takes an unusual turn. Banksy suggests to his friend Thierry to try his hand at street art. Thierry then becomes the Ed Wood Jr. (or Frankenstein's Monster) of the art world, not letting a lack of training or talent keep him from enthusiastically pursuing his muse. The question becomes: If somebody calls himself an artist and everybody believes him, does that make it true? By the time the film is over, one is thinking back over it, and wondering just where it turned into a black joke by the subversive and clever Banksy. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>weirdly fascinating movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic idea of this movie is some weird guy spends years filming street artists and eventually tries art himself, leaving the video footage in the hands of famed street artist Banksy,who decides to make a film not about street artists but about the weird guy.First off, regardless of how it is billed, the largest part of the movie really is a documentary about street artists, and a pretty interesting one. But it does eventually shift to the weird guy's story, which turns in such an unlikely way that many people have claimed the whole movie is a hoax, or perhaps that the real events the movie portrays are a hoax. (There's a good article in the L.A. Times that tries to figure it out, with some success.)Regardless of how the events came about, what it films really did happen, and it's pretty fascinating. The movie is absorbing and witty, and gets more and more interesting as it progresses. Well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exit Through The Sift Shop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an entertaining and at times fascinating insight into street art and the obsessive nature of those who produce it and those who pursue it.Part of the fun is in sifting through the content and sorting out the documentary truth from the 'mockumentary' spoof. However, it is very obvious that the film moves from the credible to the incredible (in a bad way) at around the halfway point.Guetta is a genuine camera obsessive.The mass of filmed material clearly covers a period of years, not months, as he and his family visibly age. Although his obsession is eccentric, it is entirely credible, as is the back story explaining how he got into following street artists via his cousin.It therefore follows that he did befriend Banksy and became a trusted part of the secretive street art world. I also believe he did intend to make a documentary but lacked the skill or time to do so.This is when the film moves into the realms of unconvincing fiction.The brief skilfully manic documentary credited to him was conceived and made by Bansky et al from the original footage.This allows for the idea of Banksy making a film about Theirry, again using a mix of the original footage and staged scenes whereby we are lead to believe that Guetta suddenly develops an artistic genius remarkably similar to that of Bansky himself.Here the film falls apart as it becomes increasingly, irritatingly obvious that none of the ideas are those of Guetta. The artwork conceived ostensibly by the Frenchman are heavily influenced by iconic British and American images! Virtually no reference is made to French culture and politics other than a picture of the Mona Lisa wearing an eye patch in typical Bansky style. There installations including one of a 1970's'Hot Wheels' toy car which only Banksy could have conceived, being British and of that era. Other obvious giveaways are the numerous Winston Churchill images, those heavily influenced by Warhol, the style, the humour, everything about every piece in 'Mr Brianwash's' exhibition has Bansky's fingerprints and DNA all over it.So, what the conspirators behind the film have done is taken a fascinating story about the art and the people and tried to subvert it by claiming that a new genius artist suddenly arrived on the scene after 'selling everything he had, re-mortgaging his home' to finance HIS exhibition. This is clearly absurd as there is no way that the genuine Guetta with a genuine family would jeopardise their entire financial stability.In any case, the cost of producing an exhibition of that size and scope would be immense and a couple of hundred grand wouldn't go near it, especially with all the work needed over such a short space of time (allegedly). What we actually have is artwork produced and conceived by Banksy himself along with his usual team of assistants. They were all merely working on a a Banksy exhibition but under the silly ruse that it was a 'Mr Brainwash' aka Guetta exhibition.So during the latter part of the film we see Guetta move from telling his true story to acting his fictional story. Bansky also departs from the true story of his friendship with the French cameraman in order to feign indignation that Guetta had made it to the top of the street art world in one giant leap.It appears that Guetta did genuinely break a bone in his foot during the making of the 'mockumentary' part of the film and that fortuitously helped divert attention away from the fictional Mr Brainwash, but it was still very obvious that some scenes were staged, such as the part where an assistant tries to draw him away from an interview because he is needed inside the building to project his genius! This is of course nonsense because Banksy and probably Fairey were happily able to get on with setting up THEIR exhibition and allow'Mr Brainwash'to soak up the media hype. What better way to divert attention away from the true protagonists behind the exhibition and the art? And of course, not only did this help Banksy to retain his low profile for the exhibition, it also facilitated the joke that he tries to play on us regarding the credibility of Guetta's 'art'. At the end he couldn't even wield a can of red spray paint convincingly when supposedly painting the slogan for his exhibition on a wall that was about to be demolished. They had to film this scene close up and from the side to try and disguise the fact that it wasn't the same wall or the same paint or the same hand that did paint the slogan....for that also had Bansky's name all over it.So, it amazes me that very few if any reviewers have seen the seismic split between truth and reality in this film. For those still wondering if it is all hoax or all true, then there is fun to be had in the not knowing, but when you realise during viewing (and to me it's clear cut), that takes the edge off it as it doesn't leave me feeling as intrigued, impressed or entertained as I could.There is much to like and admire, both in the people and the art, but the film unfortunately fails to some extent being neither an entirely honest documentary or an entirely convincing spoof. The old phrase about fooling some of the people some of the time springs to mind. Sometimes people want the truth, sometimes they want credible fiction. But this mixture of filmic water and oil didn't settle on the canvas of its 90 minute framework. The obviously disingenuous turn from truth to fiction allowed it to drip somewhat disappointingly onto the floor of my intellect during the end credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in to watch Exit Through Gift Shop for Banksy and came out in love with Thierry Guetta (aka Mister Brainwash). I don't care whether he is for real or not, it's been a while since I have seen such a compelling character.. the Don Quixote of 21st century.The film is full of irreverent humor, much like Banksy's graffiti, but with one difference - the joke's on him.. or us.. or, as Banksy's former spokesman Steve Lazarides says in the film - 'I don't even know if there is a joke.'There is. Marketing can create art. That's the joke. Either that or marketing itself is art. But don't bother with that debate, just go and watch Mister Brainwash (MBW) as he teaches you how to live life with ferocious passion. It doesn't matter if the passion is misdirected.Like Steve Jobs said, 'stay foolish'. Like Quixote declared, 'A knight must not complain of his wounds, though his bowels be dropping out.' Couldn't help but think of that line when I saw MBW with a fractured leg preparing for his Big Show while being dragged in a cart.www.AbhishekBhatt.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, very funny, yet important film. Is it real? That's part of the fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Funny, sharply satiric documentary about the modern art world, especially that of the street/graffiti artists who now command hundreds of thousands for their work. The film started out as a documentary about street artists like Banksy, being made by a very eccentric unknown amateur French film-maker, without much obvious talent. But somewhere along the way, the tables turned, and Banksy took over and made the film about the film- maker, who himself finds success (still not showing much talent) as a street artist. Endearingly weird, perhaps partly a set-up or a put on (who could know?) this is almost like an Andy Kaufman performance piece. But along with the laughs, it has something serious to say about "what is art" and the awful interaction between art and commerce that can drain all the art from "art".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never start a new experience, twice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched Exit Through The Gift Shop. What a great documentary. This documentary displays a great example of a man who finds his purpose in life serendipitously. It all started out when Mr. Brainwash (MBW), Thierry Guetta, was mysteriously taken away from his father after the sudden death of his mother, and Thierry realized that he didn't want any moment to be taken away from him ever again. So Thierry decided to record the rest of his life, literally. He soon got a fascination for street art, and became the right hand of controversial street artists like Shepard Fairey and Banksy, assisting them to tightrope-walk the thin line over the gray area of law valley. As wary as these artists were at first, they were also pleased that Thierry offered a sort of safe escape hatch to release their work after years of keeping it under wraps. Ironically, it was not until the first time Thierry turned the camera around that it started to dawn on him; Thierry was an artist himself. Violating all art rules - the ones that don't exist - he held his first exposition soon, and put himself worldwide on the map as an artist, selling his work for prices many established artists can only dream of. Moral of the story - in my point of view - if everybody tells you something is impossible because it has never been done before, or because it goes against all conventional rules, take that as encouragement to do just that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Art is such a mystery. What makes art, art? What makes an artist reputable? Is it the ground swelling support of admirers, the copy-cat wannabe's that shoulder a new influence? Or is everything art and everyone an artist? After watching "Exit Through the Gift Shop", questions like these remain very much questions unanswered, but more importantly those very questions start to become irrelevant labels and constructs, ripe for satire or multi layered irony.Whatever post ironic label fits, this film always keeps the viewer entertained. Even when the prime narrative is changed and starts becoming focused on the film maker and no longer the artist being courted, it's a welcome and unbelievable switch, perhaps a prank, calling into question all that is previously believed about art and artists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable documentary from Banksy about Thierry Guetta...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film by street artist Banksy tells the story of Thierry Guetta. As a young man Thierry would film anything, it was an obsession with him. He is a Frenchman who lives in L.A. and one day, on a visit to France, his cousin is making some street art. This fascinates Thierry and he begins to follow all kinds of street artists around L.A., Paris, anywhere he can find them, cataloguing their work and even helping out from time to time. And as he gets more and more into it, he becomes aware of an artist called Banksy, but Banksy is very elusive. Eventually they meet and Banksy lets Thierry film him at work, something those close to him are not too happy about. He is supposed to be making a documentary about street art, but, if the truth be known, he's just filming? There is more to tell, but I don't want to give too much away here.Quite a fascinating film with Thierry as the central character. He does eventually become a street artist and more, but I'll leave you to find out how that happens (assuming you're inspired to watch the film after reading this). The majority of the footage was shot by Thierry on video, which gives a kind of grainy look to it, which I like. I was quite intrigued at the beginning and some of the art on show is quite extraordinary, but towards the end of the film I felt it was more about what Thierry did than about the art. Having said that, as a whole I quite enjoyed it. Banksy is from my home town so it's always good to see a home-town boy come good. If you like street art, Banksy, or even if you're just intrigued, it's a worth-while watch? Recommended.My Score: 7.5/10.IMDb Score: 8.1/10 (based on 15,132 votes when this review was written).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 96/100 (based on 101 reviews counted when this review was written).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know what to expect from this film, it was a documentary about 'street art' which many people view as vandalism graffiti. Many people question the validity of the film, thinking it's more of a mockumentary. In either event, the film is entertaining as hell and worth a watch.Documentaries have the hard task of being informative and entertaining at the same time. Too much info will bore your audience. Michael Moore is probably the most famous documentary filmmakers, scoring two big hits with Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit 9/11. This film centres on a man who decides to follow street artists. He films all of them doing what they do best, saying he is making a movie. He really wasn't. He was just filming because he loves to film. He hears about this street artist who calls himself Banksy. He's creative and also a bit of a reclusive. No one knows who he is for sure. Somehow Banksy and Thierry become friends and we are now following Banksy. Banksy tells Thierry it's finally time to edit the film and the result of hundreds of hours of footage edited by this man is quite strange. The best way to describe it was to quote Banksy himself. "Uhmmm... You know... it was at that point that I realized that maybe Thierry wasn't actually a film maker, and he was maybe just someone with mental problems who happened to have a camera"So Banksy took over filmmaking duties, editing a new film, one that followed Thierry and also showcased street art. What we have is the film Exit Through The Gift Shop. Again, a lot of people debate over what is real or not, I don't care. The film is good and should be seen. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ah the mystery of Banksy and friends.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Has there ever been a documentary so pleasant and pleasing as "Exit through the Gift Shop?" It's a surprising, shocking and exhilarating documentary cloaked in the mystery of the question everyone wants to know--who is Banksy? My opinion would be that Banksy is a name for a small, exclusive group of artists more than one person, but this documentary doesn't touch on that particular fact. He's portrayed as one person. Now, back to the review--Exit through the Gift Shop is an example of how documentaries should be. Quite often a documentary director starts out with one vision and ends with another. When Banksy was compiling the footage, he went from primarily setting out to show the world street art exists to being fascinated with Thierry Guetta and deciding a narrative involving him would best tell the story and it does. Obsessed with sporting a camera at all times from the day he laid hands on one, Guetta just happened upon the world of street art via his cousin, and so the journey of Exit Through The Gift Shop began. From a bumbling, but genuine camera-obsessed every-man to an overnight millionaire artist, the story of Thierry Guetta, Banksy and their travels in the world of street art will stick with you long after its short running time ceases to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lesson learned from the street art market</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exit Through The Gift Shop - note, this is a Banksy film not a film about Banksy. The film is actually about Theirry, a french weirdo living in LA who films everything (very Peeping Tom if you ask me) until he encounters street art through his cousin - and thus his obsessive documenting of the street art movement begins. He films a bunch of artists and, eventually, the elusive Banksy. Banksy comes across as very down to earth, earnest and quite funny in this as he comments on his experiences with Theirry. It's Theirry, how art changed Theirry's life and how Theirry's life changed art that's the crux of the film. With no artistic credentials whatsoever, no imagination and a shed-load of money he went and made a mint from selling his own street art under the moniker MBW (Mr Brainwash) - and even that is essentially pilfered from the ideas of the prolific "Obey" artist. Every artist in the film seems to regret having met and even helped Theirry, and they all abhor his market success and what it means for street art. Is there a moral? Even Banksy doesn't know, and as he says: "It's not Gone With The Wind". All i took from it is that street art belongs in the street, not in auction houses, for free, for all and open at all times to public criticism rather than locked in a 'valuable' collection. It's perhaps the definitive street art disaster movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The irony of "Exit" is that Banksy's claim that an artist needs time to hone his craft is totally debunked by his Academy Award nomination and Indie Spirit award win for his first film. Thierry has been filming all of his life and is still unable to put together a film that works. Banksy's jealousy of Mr. Brainwash's instant success is unwarranted due to his own meteoric rise as a filmmaker.Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Thierry tapped into the Warhol movement and put his own spin on it. When art and commerce meet, marketing is what prevails. As far as Warhol's influence on MBW's work is concerned, Blek le Rat influenced Banksy. The role reversal in this movie is brilliant. Banksy proved that an artist is an artist and can triumph in multiple art forms. And Thierry proved that his quick hit artistic approach is better suited for individual "frames" as opposed to trying to convey a story using multiple frames in succession.</fullReview>

He certainly seemed to have mental problems.But, upon watching the film, I was amazed at the bizarre world of street art and the characters therein.Characters like Shepard Fairey, who did the iconic Obama poster, and, of course, the elusive Banksy. However, Thierry turns out to be the most bizarre and fascinating character in the film.Filled with some fantastic art and fantastic artists, this is a clear favorite for an Academy Award tonight.</fullReview>

At some point in the movie, the street artist and the filmmaker switch roles, with the street artist becoming the filmmaker and the filmmaker becoming the street artist. It's all very mind-blowing and Pirandellian, to say the least, but it sure makes for one hell of a clever and fascinating film. A bit too clever, perhaps, for there are those who've accused the film of being a hoax, of being just an elaborate work of "street art" in its own right.Thierry Guetta is a French émigré living in Los Angeles who has apparently recorded virtually every single moment of his adult life on videotape and film. A few years into this obsession, Thierry began filming a number of underground "street artists" from various cities, as, under the cloak of darkness, they secretly created their works. These included such well-known figures as Shepherd Fairey (he of the ubiquitous Obama poster) and Bansky, a British artist who had already established quite a reputation for himself in London. But not only did Thierry film them doing their art, he frequently joined them in the process, often at great risk to his own freedom and safety.It is with Bansky that the movie begins to get truly mind-bending and complicated, for it is he who directed "Exit Through the Gift Shop," not Thierry, yet he uses Thierry's footage. So who is the actual maker of the film? Who can say? And what does that say about the fluidity of the creative process? About blurring the line between art and its subject? (To hide his identity, Bansky appears only in silhouette as he films himself giving interviews for the audience). Then about halfway through the movie, we discover that Thierry has become a street artist (going by the appellation Mr. Brainwash) himself, sponsoring elaborate gallery shows displaying his own work.And as Thierry begins to achieve fame, fortune and international acclaim as the "new Wharhol," we can't help noting the irony that an art form that originally sprang up as a subversive reaction against the Establishment has now gone full-board mainstream itself, earning millions for its pieces and high-profile celebrity for its artists. No more furtive forays into the dead-of-night for this dude at least.If you're confused by all this, don't worry. Even after seeing the film, I still cannot say I understand everything that takes place within it. But that's just what makes "Exit Through the Gift Shop" such a unique and trippy experience. And besides, it offers a rare glimpse into a scene few of us have any real familiarity with, so whether the thing is real or fake doesn't really matter all that much in the end. The "experience" is what counts with "Exit Through the Gift Shop," and that, I guarantee you, will be unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique documentary that will never be replicated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Exit Through the Gift Shop" might be the only documentary where the documentarian is more fascinating than the film ? and the film is quite fascinating. A documentary about street art and the shadowy enigmatic figures that create it sounds interesting; a documentary about street art made by one of those shadowy figures sounds captivating.British street artist Banksy, whose work has become world-renowned (and expensive) in the last 5-10 years, has composed this documentary using hours upon hours of footage taken by a man named Thierry Guetta, a French-born American who beginning in 1999 began to follow several of the world's most prolific street artists, including Shepard Fairey (the Obama "Hope" poster) and Banksy, with the idea of making his own street art documentary. When Guetta finally finished his documentary, Banksy determined it was crap and took the reigns from Guetta, pushing him to follow his own artistic passion. In the film, this is when Banksy turns the camera on Guetta, who builds his own street art identity, Mr. Brain-Wash, from basically nothing.The result is a sort of two-sided documentary and one that many believe to be partially fabricated. Considering Banksy is one of the most elusive and mysterious artists in the world, it's hard not to consider that his documentary might be just that ? art. To explain, when Thierry Guetta starts to work on his own Mr. Brain-Wash art, he hires an extensive team of artists, graphic designers, sculptors and more to help bring his vision to life, so basically he buys his talent. Then, he uses his connections with Fairey and Banksy to score major endorsements and hype his show and his reputation as the next big thing. When his show becomes a runaway hit, we're left wondering: what really constitutes an artist?As such, the theory lingers out there as to whether Banksy, Fairey and Guetta were all collaborators on the aptly named "Mr. Brain-Wash" in order to shed a new light on the public perception of art and street art in particular. Doing so would boost the profile of the art form while also making people think twice about what they value as art both internally and with their wallets. However, if Banksy's film contains no contrivances, it nevertheless gives more credence to him and Fairey as true artists.Either way, the events could not be staged, especially all of Guetta's footage in the first portion of the film. As for the second part, if Guetta truly created this persona with the genuine purpose of making his own art, people still flocked to see and buy his celebrity- themed Andy Warhol knock-offs, which turns out to be the take-home point of this part of the film. If anything, you could consider it a bit of a social experiment, just one where we as viewers are not allowed on the other side of the glass.The film succeeds as both street art documentary and a character study on Guetta, though a distinct feeling that certain things worthy of explanation are left out pervades the film. Just that faint notion of viewer deception prevents "Gift Shop" from being an truly elite documentary. Because Banksy directed, you never get a sense of who is really behind the camera conducting interviews with him, Fairey and Guetta toward the end of the film. Traditional documentary filmmakers have that kind of "presence" in their films that legitimize the work they're doing because we clearly sense the intention, but Banksy being the figure he is, clouds up our sight of his intention. Fascinating, yes, but the film leaves you confused in several places."Exit Through the Gift Shop" pushes the boundaries for what a documentary is and can be, which makes it one of the most unique films ever made. The lack of clarity and the question of authenticity, as distracting and bothersome as it may be, makes the film all the more intriguing. In the end, Banksy's core question of who can be an artist and what constitutes an artist or art, rings loud and clear. That conversation will always be inextricably tied to all art forms forever.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this a hoax, or not a hoax? That is the question!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first question in my mind is not whether 'Exit Through the Gift Shop' is a hoax, an elaborately staged mockumentary about a French expatriate living in L.A., Thierry Guetta, an amateur filmmaker turned street artist turned Wahol-like pop artist. No, my question is whether the film's creator, 'Banksy', the so-called legendary street artist, is actually a real person. Actually I had never heard of him before this film but then again I don't live in the UK. There's an elaborate biography of him on Wikipedia but who knows whether any of that is true. I've also found articles about him dating back to 2005 but then again, who knows if those articles are fakes also? I'd be more inclined to believe this is the work of prankster Sacha Baron Cohen, famous for his Ali G, Borat and Bruno parodies. If you take a look at the Wikipedia biography, so much of it seems like one joke after another. For example, there's an illustration (supposedly by Banksy) of a naked man on the wall of a sexual health clinic. But here's the kicker?they say that the 'city council' (wherever that may be), "allowed it to remain". There's also a footnote that claims that the source of that information is UK/Magazine/Faces of the Week from BBC news from 15 September 2006. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5346822.stm. Retrieved 12 April 2010. If all the footnotes we find in the Wikipedia article are made up, that's one hell of an elaborate hoax!!!As for Thierry Guetta himself, is he actually a Frenchman in L.A., who owned a vintage clothing store and who from an early age began videotaping every aspect of his life? I've met a guy who videotapes incessantly and has a collection of videotapes that rival what we see in 'The Gift Shop'. So I know there are people like that. It's possible that the creators here found Guetta, who in fact had a large collection of videotapes that he had shot prior to the creation of 'The Gift Shop', and he agreed to be in on the spoof. Whether at a certain point in his life, he hooked up with his cousin, the graffiti artist in the film, 'Space Invader', who introduced him to other street artists, remains to be seen. I suspect all that footage, including the supposed long association with the real graffiti artist, Shepard Fairey (responsible for the Obama 'Hope' poster) is fake.The entire way in which Thierry Guetta finally hooks up with the elusive Banksy seems like one big joke (we see Thierry racing over to meet Banksy and he comments how he just has no idea why he wasn't stopped for speeding!). The whole bit about how Banksy and Thierry plant the Guantanamo Bay Detainee doll at Disneyland and how Disney security questioned Thierry for four hours and then let him go, is so absurd that one cannot believe it actually happened. Even more absurd is the idea that suddenly Thierry channels his hidden 'street artist', stops his videotaping and becomes a street artist himself.Finally, there's the scenario of Thierry morphing into an Andy Warhol type artist and organizing his own art exhibition in Los Angeles. Did it actually happen? Again, the pranksters could have actually gone to great lengths to make the exhibition a success by arranging interviews with the local media and promoting it through street art. Or they could have made it look like it was a success through clever editing. Who knows? There's also a claim that subsequently Thierry designed an album cover for a Madonna greatest hits album. Did that actually happen or is that also part of the hoax? Or was Madonna actually taken in by Banksy pranksters? One thing I'm convinced of?Thierry did not actually create the album (if in fact it actually exists). As it was made clear during the film, the pop art was actually created by people who were hired by either Thierry or Banksy pranksters.As a mockumentary, 'Exit through the gift shop' may be compared to the iconic 'Spinal Tap'--what 'Tap' did for rock music, 'Gift' has now done for street art. The best one can say for this clever parody, is that it's fun. The worst one can say is, that it doesn't mean that much in the grand scheme of things. I'm more on the side of, 'if it's clever and fun', then it's definitely worthwhile seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Banksy has created his Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨Do you know that tonight the streets are ours? And these lights in our eyes, they tell no lies.¨ Exit Through The Gift Shop is the best documentary I have seen in a long time. The film completely hooked my attention from the beginning and introduced me to a world I wasn't familiar with: Street Art. Before this film I thought graffiti's were simply senseless paintings on walls, but thanks to this movie I know there is much more to it now. For many it has become an art form. This film has divided viewers completely. Some believe it is a real documentary and others claim it is all a big hoax and Mr. Brainwash was just a made up character for the movie. In my opinion this documentary is a very well developed hoax and the main character in this film is just acting. He is hilarious and we never see him actually painting or doing much. I think Banksy is behind this entire hoax and he helped Mr. Brainwash's character come to life. Banksy is one of the most famous street artist around and his true identity has never been revealed. He directs this documentary with a big hood over his head and has his voice altered as well. His character is just intriguing and after the film was over I wanted to learn more about him. He is mostly known for his stenciling technique and has done numerous jobs throughout the world. His political and social commentaries can be seen throughout his art. Banksy is a complete mystery. The documentary is narrated by Rhys Ifans (Notting Hill) and he gives the film a comedic touch as does the main character, Thierry Guetta.Banksy begins the documentary by introducing us to Thierry Guetta, a French immigrant in LA who owns a vintage shop. Thierry lives a good life with his wife and two kids, but he has an obsession about carrying around his camera and recording everything. One day he travels to Paris and discovers his cousin is a street artist who goes by the name of Space Invader. Thierry becomes obsessed with street art and when he arrives back in LA he begins following around several street artists who allow him to film their work. Space Invader introduces Thierry to Shepard Fairey (the guy who came up with the poster for Obama's campaign), one of the best known street artists in LA. Fairey teaches Thierry a thing or two about his craft and introduces him to many other artists. Thierry documents hundreds of hours of film since everyone seems to let him film their work with the excuse that he's making a documentary about their craft. Once Thierry learns more about the street art culture he becomes interested in meeting this Banksy character who's identity has never been confirmed. Thierry finally gets his break and meets Banksy when he shows up at LA. Banksy allows Thierry to document his work, but when Banksy realizes that Thierry is not actually a real film maker he decides to gather the hundreds of hours of footage and make the movie himself. Banksy encourages Thierry to become a street artist and he decides to do so by becoming Mr. Brainwash. Mr. Brainwash becomes an overnight sensation and therefore Banksy decides to make the documentary about him.It doesn't really matter whether the film is true or not, it still makes for a great documentary (or mocumentary). If you ask me there is no doubt in my mind that the film is a hoax and Banksy is actually making this film as a critique toward commercialism. He introduced us to a funny character named Thierry Guetta who is not actually a very bright guy and by the time he becomes Mr. Brainwash and decides to make a big art show he becomes an overnight sensation. Everyone wants to buy his art pieces. He doesn't even make any of the pieces, he just hires a bunch of guys to do things for him and gives them a general idea about everything, but people are still willing to spend thousands of dollars for his work. There is not much Thierry even does. Banksy proves he is more than a street artist; he has made one of the best documentaries of the decade as a film maker. Thierry Guetta begins as an amateur film maker in this documentary and ends up becoming a successful street artist, while Banksy a well known street artist becomes a successful director. The film has been nominated for Best Documentary at the Oscars and it would be fun to see who shows up to the ceremony (it would be even greater if the film won, and we got to see the actual Banksy reveal his true identity). This Guetta guy is extremely funny in this movie and Exit Through The Gift Shop is one of my top 5 films of the year. Banksy has made his masterpiece.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Exit through the gift shop is a fascinating look into not only the world of street art but just how so called art lovers will believe the hype in an artist when they are told so , even if he isn't. Originally meant to be a film about British artist banksy and he's fellow street painters it is cleverly turned on it's head by it's subject and quickly becomes a film about the man behind the camera , Thierry Guetta. Whether you think Guetta is a genius or not , that is not really the point of the film . it's more a movie about how puzzling art can be , even to people like Banksy. I enjoyed this documentary and it gave me a big insight into the street art scene and the suckers in LA who follow like sheep with their big fat wallets hanging out of their back pockets. Oscar Nominated , Exit Through The Gift Shop is well worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Artist that WILL Be Remembered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The real reason to see this film is that it highlights the work of Banksy, who I believe is actually a great artist and not just a graffiti prankster. The movie itself may well be a prank--I don't believe Thierry Guetta created all the pieces he sold in his massive art show, and the fact he picks "Mr. Brainwash" as his alias is pretty obviously a poke at the people who bought the pieces. The movie is obviously a creation of Banksy, and Thierry Guetta--or Mr. Brainwash anyway--may very well be a creation of Banksy as well--perhaps Guetta is just some dude with some acting talent and an interest in street art who conspired with Banksy on this project. It's humorous and fun, but perhaps too modest. Banksy deserves a full-length documentary. The DVD I got from Netflix also includes a short documentary on Banksy and between the two, you get a sense of the artist's work, if you weren't already familiar with it. His images are striking, his juxtapositions ironic, subversive, political, provocative, comic and tragic. For millenia art has been purchased and owned by rich people and by governments and Banksy creates art that by appearing everywhere,for free, without government approval, belongs to the people. Of course eventually he did sell his work but all this means is that some of it will be preserved. There is a wide span of merit in the graffiti art world and in my opinion, Banksy is at the top.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fascinating look into the bizarre world of street art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fascinating and brilliant. The best two words to describe Exit Through the Gift Shop with. This film is a documentary about the strange world of street art and the eccentric and secretive characters that do it. The director of the film is one of the most renowned of these artists, and he his the elusive Banksy, who keeps his true identity kept very secret throughout the film. Exit Through the Gift Shop is an odd film because it is in a way a "making of" of itself. The film follows the story of Thierry Guetta, an eccentric and possibly insane man who set out to make his own street art documentary years ago. During the filming he meets all sorts of big names in the street art world, one of which being Bansky. When his project ultimately amounted to nothing Banksy decided he would "have a go at it." Thierry's story continued to be documented as he became a street artist himself, and Bansky compiled it all into this film which is now nominated for an Oscar for best Documentary Feature.It seems the best documentaries are always about the things we never hear about it on a day to day basis. This film accomplishes just that. Street art is such a secretive and underground organization that isn't actually any kind of organized establishment. It's paradoxical to look at the way street art is portrayed as incredible contemporary art, and then to look at how illegal it is and how shunned it is from the public scope, despite its being all around us. Exit Through the Gift Shop opens our eyes to this world and provides a fascinating look into this world. It doesn't matter what anybody says, this really is art. We see some incredible works of modern art in this film and all the ideas surrounding the elusive "industry" are perplexing.Now as a movie, Exit Through the Gift Shop is fantastic. But as it seems to be the case with all great documentaries, there is more to it than meets the eye. Or is there? Some claim this film to be an elaborate hoax all orchestrated by Banksy. There are accusations that Thierry Guetta isn't a real person and that his story was fabricated in order to put together a social satire/mockumentary of the street art world and the pretentious snobs who inhabit its onlookers. If all this is true then Exit Through the Gift Shop still succeeds. If it isn't true then the movie is just a really fascinating documentary. Either way this is a great film with some interesting mythos behind it.You don't get many opportunities to peer into the world of street art through such a personal eye as this. Anybody with an interest in art should love this film, and those who aren't as interested should at least be entertained by the odd stories and characters this film has to offer. It is hard to understand the overall purpose of this film when there is so much mystery behind the authenticity of it. But maybe that's what makes it so much fun. Either way this is an unforgettable documentary that gives us a look into such a different kind of world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films that wins over the viewer no matter if you've understood it or not. The depth of the story, the details, the action and development are phenomenal. At the end you are sitting in your chair and taking in a big breath of air telling your self - wow, this is huge. You've sat down for an hour and a half and lived somewhere else for that time. Even as I wrote the previous sentence i thought the film was at least two hours long - then i checked and it turned out to be 87min. This is how good it is. It's as if you are playing an intense video game, you are in a different time frame, different reality till you see the credits. So, you are there looking at the names go by the screen, taking a big gasp for air, extremely proud of what you saw. You are thinking of all the details. Suddenly i decide to look up the main character just out of curiosity of how he is able to pay for the things he did in the film... and then: Nuclear blast... Heat wave... Cosmic collision... - this film turns out to be a mockumentary. Brilliant! Amazing! In the moment that you are telling your self how much you've loved this and you are wondering - could it have been any better - it becomes bigger than you could have even thought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Talk about a social commentary! Banksy achieves a triumph with Exit Through the Gift Shop. I rank this movie and Banksy's ongoing profit, to be paired with the historically based BBC documentary, "The Centuary of Self." This film is one of the best documentaries to expose the times we are in. It has it all; passion, genius, madness, the anthropology of pop culture and post modernism. Without giving anything away, be prepared to be taken on an edge of your seat ride. If Sophia (not a diva), is not left behind, you will come to an amazing realization, which makes it all the more brilliant and telling, that this is just one more sign, that we are in the end-times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tbe film established this new idea of Banksy creating the street graffiti art, but that is a little misguided. But misguided or not, Exit Through the Gift Shop gives an entertaining look on modern art. We used to think that art is boring and perhaps useless, but the film proposes the idea of anyone can be an artist and succeed. The subject, Thierry, was originally a film maker turned into creating art. Most of the art is just photoshop work and Thierry just gave the idea, he did not make the art. Even though Thierry didn't make the art, he still is the famous one after the show. And throughout the film, you see that there's something wrong with this guy! But by the end of the day, he is the one with the money. And that brings up a very interesting question. How the hell did that happen? Exit Through The Gift Shop is entertaining, engrossing, and phenomenally executed. The movie turns art into a very interesting subject to debate about.

		<fullReview>I just hate when I don't understand weather a movie is a hoax, but in this case it did not matter. It is purely genius, straight forward and sarcastic just on the right places. Like a 90 minute Banksy graffiti. One of the few movies you expect a lot from and that is exactly what you get. Shows the logical point of view about modern art and at the same time it is presented by a great artist. There is everything you expect from a movie: storyline, excitement, action and most importantly if you care about art in a genuine way you somehow relate to it. The things that make modern movies annoying are missing and it is pure pleasure from the beginning to the end. The whole story is very shocking and weather reality or just a Banksy it is a pure masterpiece.To talk about the movie is very hard though, it is like Angelina Jolly says "talking about love is like dancing on architecture", well talking about Exit Through the Gift Shop is like, well just pointless?. So watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. I loved it on many levels because of many things. First of all, it's a comedy as much as it's a documentary. Secondly, it's one of the first documentaries that I've seen from the 2000s that actually DOCUMENTS something. I mean, I enjoy works from Michael Moore and other muckrakers, but this is totally different, just because of the fact that it tells a story by following what people DO, rather than presenting information and opinions. It's like a Barbra Kopple or D.A. Pannebaker movie.I also loved the way that the movie morphs halfway through from a movie Thiery Guetta, the eccentric Frenchman videographer, makes about Banksy to a movie Banksy makes about Thierry Guetta. Banksy criticizes Thiery Guetta for not making a movie that appropriately shows the history of street art, so he tells Thiery Guetta to make some art of his own while Banksy creates his own movie from Guetta's hours and hours of tape. Thiery Guetta hits the big time overnight and every street artist friend of his hates him for it, including Banksy.This shows the nature of many artists. They claim they do not care about the money, but when a friend of their's begins making more money than they do, they immediately criticize them. But I believe Banksy is aware of this even as he does it to Guetta, and I think that is why so many people may believe this film to be a hoax. I believe it to be true just because of so many events in the movie that actually occurred in recent history, and if it is true, well, it's absolutely my favorite documentary now(sorry Harlan County U.S.A.).And as a side note, if you happen to be in the Austin area I would recommend seeing Exit Through the Gift shop at the Alamo Drafthouse on South Lamar, because the supplementary material they show before the film is also excellent.</fullReview>

It starts out first being filmed by a street artist himself, Asteroid, and than changes hands.In Exit we follow the trend of Street Art. It's a rush to watch people wajor them selves against the law for art. It's also interesting to see how secretive their community is. The art is amazing as you watch it's own creature grow into something unpredictable.I don't want to give anymore away. Go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Man's Art Is Another Man's Pile of $@@!*&amp;</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fiercely entertaining movie about one man's crusade to make a film record of the underground street art world that becomes more about the man himself than it does about the art.Banksy, the legendary street artist and director of the documentary, tells the story of Thierry, an amateur filmmaker who makes friends with the street art community and records them at work. They like him, mostly because he's documenting for the world what they do. The ultimate catch is getting a chance to meet and record Banksy himself, which Thierry does. This seems to be what the movie is about and takes us to about the mid-way point. But then the focus shifts -- Thierry decides he wants to be an overnight street art sensation himself and stages a huge and hugely successful exhibit of his work. Never mind that most of the work was actually done by a team of hired graphic artists and carpenters and that Thierry spends more time aggressively promoting himself than he does creating any art.At the heart of "Exit Through the Gift Shop" are some compelling questions about the legitimacy of art. The public buys into the hype and embraces Thierry as the Next Big Thing -- are they dupes or trend setters? When does art become art? When it's put on a wall or when the public endorses it? You can feel the bitterness and most probably jealousy of Banksy and the other street artists in the film practically seeping off the screen. After all, here's some anonymous guy that throws a lot of money behind a stunt that gets him instantly to a place that took them years to get to (if they get there at all).It's hard to know how to feel about Thierry. You want to dislike him for many of the same reasons that the street artists clearly feel some animosity toward him, but at the same time it's hard to resist his infectious enthusiasm, and it's not his fault that the general public is basically pretty stupid. If he can recognize that and capitalize off of it, why shouldn't he? It's a right that belongs to all of us.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Generally what makes a documentary "great" is when a director sets out to make a point and what they capture on film while making the documentary goes beyond their wildest expectation for furthering that point. This is the case with "Exit Through the Gift Shop".Banksy's intention was to take the footage Thierry collected and make a documentary that commented on the sudden hypocritical commercialism of the emerging street art scene. As Banksy and his hired staff were putting the film together, what happens to Thierry's career as a street artist not only validates that social commentary, it hilariously puts the exclamation point on Banksy's intent!I would suggest to not get caught up in the "eloborate hoax" discussions on this film. They go nowhere and they're not necessary. The film stands on it's own either as a straight documentary OR as a hoax. Either way, it makes the same point. I would watch the film and take it at face value. Mr. Brainwash, whomever that may be, is a legitimate success--whether he was originally a work of fiction or not. And therein lies Banksy's simple, hilarious and cutting point on what is real art, and what makes a real artist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exit Through the Gift Shop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm hardly the first to suggest it, but Banksy's street art documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop would make for a great double bill with Orson Welles' F for Fake; both films challenge the commercialization of art, both films achieve this by subverting our presupposed faith in the documentary form, and both films are amazing works regardless of whether they're "true" or not.As a pure documentation of street artists in action, this film is a testament to how engaging and entertaining documentary cinema can be: the camera-work, attributed to Thierry Guetta/Mr. Brainwash, is all the more immersive for its acknowledgment of the camera. But as Banky crafts this narrative and takes ownership of the film in its editing, we are treated to a fascinating metacommentary on how authorship, authenticity, and hype affect art as a commercial product--and, of course, whether art has any business being commercial to begin with.Like the hundreds of Las Angelas art enthusiasts pranked in the film, we may have trouble discerning what's authentic in this work: I suspect that Mr. Brainwash is a constructed character, though the over-hyped reaction to his work is clearly genuine. Ultimately, it's a waste of time to try and discern what's real and what is not; like the rest of Banky's work, you're better off just taking it in. -TK 9/13/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"More interesting than his work"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those familiar with the work of notorious graffiti artist Banksy would be correct in assuming that a film by him would be just as unconventional and mockingly elusive as his other work. Indeed, Exit Through the Gift Shop forgoes the implied documentary on Banksy to question the overlap between "real" art and commercial dross, the moral grounds of both graffiti and film and the interplay between fiction and reality, all guided by a twinkling sense of humour and cheerful cynicism. While its tagline "the world's first street art disaster movie" may be a mild misnomer, it is telling of the fundamentally unique nature of Banksy's film, unequivocally one of the most fresh, smart and fun films to hit cinemas in years. Banksy cleverly utilizes kinetic editing, frank interviews with many prominent street artists (including enigmatic filmmaker turned artist Mr. Brainwash whose story takes a sardonically amusing turn of its own), a pounding soundtrack and the chortling narration of Rhys Ifans to keep the tone frisky and compelling throughout. Exit Through the Gift Shop is bound to leave viewers reeling, both in laughter and deep thought, questioning the intrinsic value of art, whether the film is one big joke on the viewer's behalf, and whether it even matters. And, despite the film's intent allegedly shifting away from informational documentary, one even ends up learning a fair amount about Banksy and street art in general. Never before has such a slippery film been so reliably stellar. -10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Warhol repeated iconic images until they became meaningless, but there was still something iconic about them. Thierry really makes them meaningless." BanskyA short film called "Folk Art Found Me" introduced me to the colorful world of kitschy but lovely local art work and enhanced what I had suspected to be valuable expressions of non-art-school sensibility. Now Exit through the Gift Shop illuminates the sometimes absurd world of street art with its infamous avatars like Bansky and Thierry. Gift Shop is as good an introduction as you will find to an Andy- Warhol world of wacko "artists" who provoke the average bloke into art rhapsody while suspecting the artists are phonies and we willing accomplices in the corruption of art.Thierry Guetta is a mutton-chopped vintage clothes retailer who videos every moment of his day and decides to document graffiti artists at work, the apex being the elusive Bansky. But Bansky takes over the unedited ramblings and fashions a superb documentary that not only chronicles his own late night expeditions but also the rise of Thierry to a major artist on the strength of an LA Weekly article and a spectacular "art" show.No use trying to decide for sure if Warhol-like Campbell soup cans made into spray containers are art at all; it's the juiced populous that decides by buying millions of dollars in prints and collages from new-artist Thierry. No use even trying to decide if it's promotion or art because it's both with a heavy emphasis on promotion.Graffiti artists Shepherd Fairey and The Invader don't exactly praise Theirry, nor does Bansky, who ultimately says, "I used to encourage everyone I knew to make art; I don't do that so much anymore." If you're not sure if it's art or pretense, then gently exit through the gift shop and enjoy the memory of art as an expression of . . . Oh, I don't know either. I do know it's fun."There's no one like Thierry, even though his art looks like everyone else's." Bansky</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So goes one of the people interviewed in this edgy documentary film by controversial street artist Banksy. After watching "Exit Through the Gift Shop," you would not really know.The structure of the film is divided into two. At the beginning, we are watching a documentary about the evolution of street art, which is glorified graffiti. This was seen through the eye of amateur film maker Thierry Guetta, who risked life and limb to follow around and film these street artists who usually ply their trade in the dark of night. This obsession hits a peak when he meets and films his biggest "prize", Banksy himself.Then, there is the second half. The film becomes a tongue-in-cheek discourse about Theirry himself and his own art as "Mr. Brainwash". He produces himself a huge collection of derivative "art" and mounts his own big one-man show. At this point, I got the impression that the documentary becomes an indictment of the current art world. Could it be that Banksy is laughing at the pretentiousness and gullibility of the art connoisseurs of today?I honestly do not care much about this topic. In fact, I do not like graffiti in general, nor do I really appreciate pop art. The documentary though is interesting and makes you want to watch to the end. There is controversy whether this film is a true-blue documentary or a "mock"-umentary in the spirit of Banksy's street art. I guess that is why it is generating the attention it is getting now. As shown in the movie, it is all in the publicity. You watch it and judge for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exit in a state of amused bafflement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting film, speckled with humour, Exit Through The Gift Shop is an insightful look into a sub-culture of graffiti artists. The first half of the film is very watchable, and is mostly driven by the mystery of Banksy and his often witty and provocative artworks. Other artists are profiled, such as a chap called Invader who creates mosaics of characters from early 1980's video games and sticks them high up on buildings etc? Not sure what the point of all that is really, but it's quirky and colourful and preferable to another artist who simply stands by a passing train spraying truck after truck with a continuous stream of spray paint.However, when the focus shifts exclusively to Thierry ("Terry") Guetta, who until this point has largely been the man behind the camera doing the filming, the film remains watchable, but was less engrossing. On the advice of Bansky, Guetta is encouraged to hold a one-man show. He then goes into creative overdrive, with a set up much like Andy Warhol's Factory, producing masses of artwork often based on works of Warhol. There is an uncertainty as to the authenticity of Guetta, and it seems the film might be a blend of fact and fiction. The audience are shown childhood photos of the Frenchman Guetta and told tales of his formative years which explain why he has had to document everything on film ever since. Yet I felt the filmmaker was spinning a yarn here to create a background to a character, and I didn't quite buy it. So when the emphasis of the film turns exclusively to Guetta and his art show I lacked empathy and identification with him. Guetta is an anomaly, he has fallen into the art world by chance, not by talent or drive. This may well be the whole point of the film: he's a real-life artist because the film says so, and therefore it raises the question what constitutes Art, and does it become Art just because we're told it's Art and it sells for thousands of dollars?People I saw this film with were mostly baffled or just plain annoyed they hadn't seen something else instead. Without doubt it is worth seeing if there is an interest in Banksy, street art, or maybe the art world in general, but it is an acquired taste. It seems the appeal of Bansky to the masses (such as the hundreds of thousands who queued for up to six hours at a time to see his recent show in Bristol, UK) is that his work is like a witty one-liner, and the audience can quickly "get it" and smile at how clever the work is. Much like a maths student with scant regard for most art, but with an M.C. Escher or a Dali poster on their wall. Instantly they can "get it" and recognise that it's clever. And that is largely how I felt about this film. It is intelligent and well made, and although it didn't particularly engage my emotions, it raised a few smiles, and I left in a state of amused bafflement looking forward to what Bansky will do next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smug faux documentary - don't believe the hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whatever else I think about these self-reflexive mockumentary pranks like Casey Affleck's I'm Still Here and now, inappropriately nominated for an Academy Award for best Documentary Film, Banksy's Exit Through the Gift Shop, I have to admit they reflect their times in ways that real documentaries can't.How can I not admire filmmakers who create the reality they're documenting? Banksy's film goes steps farther by manufacturing the target demographic, as well. Pretty slick.Upon hearing initially about the "political" street artist's film, I tweeted something along these lines: If street artist Banksy really walked the walk he'd release his film for free under a Creative Commons license like Sita Sings the Blues.I said that because I hadn't seen it. Now that I've seen it and get the joke, I'm glad to confront its politics: Few films could be farther from the generosity and artistry of Nina Paley's film.I've never trusted the sincerity of Banksy's anonymous persona or the literal sincerity of his "politics." I thought his painting of the Gaza wall was glib self-promotion, at best. Now, after having watched this film, I have my doubts that a real, single person called "Banksy" even exists.Regardless, even if he did, I wouldn't believe a word he said.Exit Through the Gift Shop will probably win its Award, though, if my judgment of the American cultural milieu holds true.As an antidote, watch Ceský sen. It's just as mischievous and honestly political. I can't think of another film in which young artists wrestle with their generation's need for irony. You won't find that sort of self-awareness in Banksy's film.P.S. I've always found smug the art of Shepard Fairey so he certainly belongs in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Documenary Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By far my most favorite documentary. I probably saw it 10 times already and every of my friends who haven't, I force to watch it with me.This movie gives a perfect view behind the artist and art scene, not only regarding street art but in general. It shows what it needs to be a successful artist today and how art gets commercialized through media and crazy people who only want to be 'in' and therefore try to follow the crowds as much in front as possible.It also shows how much real artists suffer under the hype they unchain themselves because people need heroes and so put the artist on top of their art, while the real artist wants his art to be recognized but not himself.Who wants to get a picture of the different personalities artists can have, this is an excellent example as well. While some want to stay in the shadow, others are narcissists and feel well in the spot lights. But at the end the audience may understand that the guys in the spot lights are the great pretenders (as was Andy Warhol for example), while the real artists prefer to stay unknown (as Banksy).However - since I saw this movie the first time, I changed the way to walk through a city, opening my eyes and finding many interesting things I would have simply overlooked before. So I can say - this movie brought some new value into my life - Thank you guys!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are you sure that the subject of this documentary isn't Rob Schneider?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thierry Guetta is described as a French film maker living in LA who said he wanted to do a documentary about Banksy and other artists of the graffiti art world. However, in a bizarre twist, when the illusive Banksy (whose exact likeness is unknown) is eventually met by Guetta, Banksy decides that his life isn't nearly as interesting as Guetta's--and so Banksy decides to do a documentary about Thierry Guetta as he supposedly makes a documentary about Banksy and his world!! Truly this is weird and unique--and a wonderful example of how a street artist and a performance artist might actually be one and the same! Much of the film simply was an explanation of the street art movement--and it was pretty interesting. While some might hate this and see it as vandalism, the cleverness cannot be denied--and it blurs the line as to what is and is not art. While I hate the idea of these guys running amok with paint, much of their work is brilliant and artistic. I also liked this aspect of the film because now I understand some of the odd stencil drawings I have seen in New York, Philadelphia, London and other cities. Now I know why there are these little stenciled pictures on the roadway, walls, etc.! I thought it was just the product of some cult! ;-) What I also liked about this film is the longer Thierry Guetta followed Banksy (and vice-versa), the more the graffiti world rubbed off on Thierry--as he, too, began making his own stenciled art on public spaces! Eventually, this takes over Thierry's life until he ultimately holds a HUGE art event in LA of his work--at which point is sure seems obvious that the entire film and Thierry is a very brilliant and elaborate hoax--though many still believe he and his story are true.Amazingly, aside from Banksy, you actually get to see who many of these previously faceless artists were...and hear from them as well. Overall, one of the most creative and unique films I have ever seen--and because of that I think it clearly deserves a 10--and I hope that it wins on Oscar night!One final question. Is it just me or did Thierry look like Rob Schneider with a crazy mustache?! Surely I can't be the only one who saw him and thought that! In fact, he also had a strong likeness to Andy Kaufman's performance art creation, 'Tony Clifton'! As a result, the film has you wonder if Thierry might actually be Banksy! All I know is that you can never be sure who is who and what the film is about...and I liked this vagueness quite a bit. It's like a wonderful practical joke in which no one was sure of the punchline!Also, while it was totally illegal, I LOVED the Princess Di money segment--truly a bizarre case of performance art merging with graffiti artists. I just wish they'd try that sometime--but I totally understood why they haven't!UPDATE: This film did not win. I cannot comment on whether or not it should have, as "Exit Through the Gift Shop" was the only entry in the category I have seen. I sure hope that the film makers try some other projects in the future--"Exit" was a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This story is the truth whether it is grounded in reality or not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truth --- without any taking sides on the hoax issue directly.Thierry was clearly OCD and desperate in his pursuit of fame as he demonstrated through his pursuit of capturing celebrities on film (even before his entry into documenting street art). He acted out of compulsion without any true understanding of the movement, as evidenced by his use of his own image as his "signature." No street artist would have done that and it shocked me when I saw him doing it. At that moment, a new movement had begun. Just as Henri Rousseau was an outsider to the Impressionist movement, without any understanding, formal training or intention he was instrumental in the reactive movement to it: Post Impressionism. Make no mistake, whereas Theirry's friends in the Street Art movement had mixed emotions as to whether he was an artist or not, I believe he IS an artist with a key position in the reactionary movement he unintentionally created.Reaction and revolution in art, as history has proved, is not always based on a manifesto. It is often personal and embedded in the psyches of those reactionaries. This can certainly be evidenced by van Gogh, whose illness was more instrumental to his work than any intention to rebel against the establishment. In this case, Thierry's compulsion to create, his desire to emulate without understanding, and his obsession for recognition and fame paved the road to Hell for the Street Artists and their movement. Thierry was literally the fox in the hen house, if the fox had been raised by the chickens. Hoax or not, there is an underlying truth in this story about art and the artists themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>spectacularly original, ironically funny, defiantly independent and effortlessly cool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When is a piece of art not a piece of art? Does an image have to be committed to canvas before it is beautiful or meaningful? Need an artist be professionally trained, or can a hoodlum with a stocking on his head create something worthwhile? For years, the world of street-art has existed all around us; disenfranchised individuals taking to the cities, using spray cans, stencils, stickers ? whatever they could ? as a means to express themselves wherever they could. But the question still exists: are they creating art? Exit Through The Gift Shop is the documentary with the opportunity to answer that question, as well as to showcase some of the most talented individuals in an industry flourishing just outside the law. Like the very best pieces of street-art, the film is spectacularly original, ironically funny, defiantly independent and effortlessly cool, and the fact that the whole thing might be nothing more than an elaborate prank by the world's most renowned street-art not only makes the movie that much more interesting, but also reflects better than anything the elusive and rebellious art form that it supposedly documents.The story begins when we are introduced to amateur filmmaker Thierry Guetta. And when I say amateur, I mean really amateur. A short, bearded, easily excited Frenchman living in Los Angeles, Thierry makes his living as the owner of a successful clothing boutique, but his true passion is capturing on video every single thing that he sees, from the mundane to the downright tedious. Content just to film his day to day interactions, the idea of turning his compulsion into an actual documentary doesn't come until a family trip to France, where Thierry discovers that his cousin also goes by the name "Invader", and is in fact one of the burgeoning stars of the explosive world of street-art. Joining Invader on his night time expeditions through the urban jungles of Paris and later LA, Thierry begins to encounter other up-and-coming figures in the graffiti industry, learning their stories and observing their craft. And all the while, his camera continues to role.But the documentary really takes off when Thierry encounters and befriends the world's most famous street-artist: the secretive Englishman known only as "Banksy", a man whose works have sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars, but whose identity remains a mystery. At first Thierry served simply as the foreigners chauffeur while he is visiting LA, but the artists natural talent for subversion soon lead to a bizarre reversal of the films subject matter, as Banksy takes hold of the camera and begins to document Thierry's own evolution from filmmaker to accomplice to street-artist himself. A barely competent home movie while under the control of Thierry, in the hands of Banksy the narrative suddenly shift into a bizarre examination into the nature, validity and limitations of art, be it a painting, graffiti tag or even documentary film.Or does it? Adding yet another layer of intrigue to this film are the widespread rumours that it is nothing but a hoax, a prank being played on audiences and critics alike by the world's most dissident artist. The possibility that Thierry may simply be an invention of Banksy is never raised in the film itself, but the very idea makes a reading of the movie all the more fascinating. The true author or meaning of this film may never be known ? how do we even know the hooded figure claiming to be Banksy is who he says he is? Ironically and quite possibly intentionally, Exit Through The Gift Shop is to documentaries what street-art is to art ? an anarchistic version of the medium; a counter culture film studying a counter culture movement, and it would almost be fitting if the whole thing was nothing but an elaborate ruse.For the record however, I like to believe that this film is accurate. They say that truth is often stranger than fiction, and in this case it is difficult to believe that a character like Thierry Guetta could be anything other than real. Eccentric, oblivious and brashly confident, Thierry is everything street-art is not, and would be an easy figure to ridicule, especially for someone as savvy and talented as Banksy. Yet even when Thierry's behavior invites scorn, this film is never cruel, and some of the films funniest moments come when Banksy, Shepard Fairey or other street-artists find themselves perplexed by Thierry's success, unable to figure out exactly how it happened or what it all means. In the words of one baffled interviewee: "I don't know who the joke is on. I don't even know if there is a joke." Exit Through The Gift Shop is many things. It is a cautionary tale of the dangers of celebrity. It is an enchanting behind the scenes look at the world of street-artists, of a hip-hop inspired culture of rebels and visual stylists. It is an art exhibit put to celluloid, showcasing some of the most interesting and excited pieces to be created this side of the 20th century. Best of all, it is a fascinating and oftentimes hilarious examination of the very nature of art, one that asks many important questions, only to shrug its shoulders and say "who the hell knows". While I began this review by asking "when is a piece of art not a piece of art", I must conclude not only by not answering that question, but by asking an additional one: "when is a documentary not a documentary". If street-art pushes the boundaries of the medium, so too does this film, and whether it is fake or not, it is still a hell of a piece of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Documentary: Real or Not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exit Through the Gift Shop (2010)**** (out of 4) Simple documentary about a man who enjoys filming stuff so he finds himself in the underground painting scene of L.A. where he tries to track down a hard-to-find painter who is considered a genius. There's been so much hype, anger and outright mayhem aimed at this movie that it probably comes rather shocking that someone who follows movies pretty well was blind to all of it. I had heard about this documentary but the only thing I had heard was that it was a great film. Having now viewed the film and did some more reading on it I must say that I feel a lot of the hype is just pointless because in the end it really doesn't matter if Banksy and Thierry Guetta are a hoax or not. I'm really not sure if I would have viewed the film any differently had I known about the controversy but to me the film's main goal should be to entertain and this one certainly did that without any issues. I really found the film to be quite memorizing simply because it so perfectly draws you into this street art world. The early portions of the film were extremely exciting as Guetta goes out with these artists and captures these men and women at work creating a certain type of art that wouldn't be appreciated for many years to come. Seeing how these people work and how much effort actually went into their creations was something that was very fun to watch. It also doesn't hurt that the majority of the artists shown have a wonderful personality that makes you want to know more about them. The same is true of Guetta because he's just so entertaining that you want to know more about him as well as see everything you can. The second portion of the film really starts to make one question what is great art and what is just hype built up for no reason other than hype itself. As someone who watches countless movies I always find it funny when a horrible movie begins to get a small group of people who enjoy it and before long it becomes a cool thing to enjoy said movie. TROLL 2 is a good example of a film no one paying attention to but one person found it cool, passed the coolness to ten other people who then passed it around to more people where today the film is a cult favorite playing to sold out crowds and it even got a documentary of its own. I'm not certain if the "art" in EXIT THROUGH THE GIFT SHOP is the same thing or if the filmmakers were wanting to look at it the same way but I do find it fascinating how one item can build up to something special whereas something perhaps more important or deserving gets overlooked or lost in the shuffle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Street art, what is it and how can you make $$Millions?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that is hard to characterize, and one that every viewer is certain to get something different out of it. As I compose my thoughts to write these comments, I am struck by the virtual randomness of life, at least the life of Thierry Guetta.He is a Frenchman who immigrated to the USA and with his wife and kids lives in the Los Angeles area. He has (or had??) an addiction, a video camera. A small one, that uses small tape cassettes, and it seems he takes it with him everywhere, filming everything. And as we find out watching this film, most tapes were never viewed, just placed in boxes, sometimes without even the most basic information written on them to identify the date or subject.Thierry is a man without a mission, just aimlessly filming with no end in mind.But then quite by chance gets exposed to street art, often called by the rest of us 'graffitti', and becomes compelled to film that, then seeking out the most famous street artists, like the Brit known as 'Banksy.' Still, Thierry is aimless, while the artists think he is filming what will become a documentary, he still is basically aimless. When he finally does put together a film, it is described as 'unwatchable.' There is a highly edited 15-minute version on the DVD and yes, it is mostly unwatchable.But through all this the most amazing thing happens, Banksy suggests that Theirry might get into his own creation of street art, and he does, but he bypasses all the usual beginnings, he jumps straight to a very large, overblown art show in L.A. With no real plan, no budget, he mortgages everything and throws himself in, hiring other artists to make his over-sized creations come to fruition, and against all odds has a wildly successful show, expanded from a planned 5 days to 2 months, and selling artwork of over $Million.So here this aimless videotaper, quite by accident gets turned towards street art, and suddenly (in the truest sense of that word) becomes a modern art icon.A fascinating film, for the absurdity of it all, and being able to catch a glimpse of this highly unlikely sequence of events over about an 8 year period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'EXIT THROUGH THE GIFT SHOP': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The same year that brought us 'I'M STILL HERE' we get another crazy and original documentary / mockumentary that could be a sincere and true documentary or it could be an elaborately staged hoax. The creators of the film based on actor Joaquin Phoenix's transition from acting to rapping (Phoenix and Casey Affleck) have admitted that the whole thing was staged. The director of this film (world famous street artist Banksy) nor his subject (French shop owner and amateur filmmaker turned graffiti artist Thierry Guetta) have indicated that the film is anything but a fact based documentary. Many critics and fans have serious speculations that the film is in fact a 'BORAT' style prank documentary (like 'I'M STILL HERE') but as of this writing no one knows for sure.The film centers on Guetta, a French immigrant in LA who made a living running a clothing shop and filmed everything everywhere he went. After finding out that he's cousins with the famous street artist 'Space Invader' Thierry meets with him and begins documenting (with his camera) Invader's (and his buddies, fellow street artists 'Monsieur Andre' and 'Zevs') graffiti exploits. Through Invader he meets Shepard Fairey, another famous street artist, and carries on his passion for filming street art (telling Fairey and other street artists that he plans on making a documentary of the footage even though he has no plans to do anything with the video). He then learns of possibly the most famous graffiti artist of all, Banksy, and through a chance encounter meets him. He quickly earns his trust and after Banksy's "Barely Legal" show is a big hit and Banksy becomes an overnight sensation he puts Guetta to the test and tells him to go make his movie. Thierry has no idea how to do this and comes back with a barely watchable (although surprisingly well edited) 90 minute video (almost like a 90 minute music video). Banksy thinks it's horrible but convinces Thierry to pursue his own street art career and leave him the footage (so Banksy can secretly make his own movie). Guetta really takes his assignment to heart though and stages a full blown show under the name 'MBW' or 'Mr. Brainwash'. The show becomes the surprising conclusion to the documentary.The film is extremely amusing and funny and like many have already said "does it really matter if it's real or not, it's still an entertaining and fascinating film", that's not an exact quote but I've read stuff like that and I agree. The movie is a blast to watch especially as it progresses through the second and third act. Banksy kind of narrates the film (although Thierry does as well) in shadow and with voice distortion, to protect his identity from criminal prosecution, and he's hilarious. His final words make you realize what the entire film was about, real or staged (personally I think it was all staged but I could be wrong). Regardless the film is a well made and effective piece of art in it's own right and has you wondering what makes true art good and what is over hyped garbage. I've read other people say something like that as well but I had the same idea after watching it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ucFFzQlT1c</fullReview>

His art is beyond reproach and his transition into film is as playful and questioning as his earlier work. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves playful character driven documentaries. This films gives insight into a distinct period of art and culture that had rarely been documented and gives insight into the human spirit. Loved it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doco or Moco? We may never know...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Banksy. Love him or Hate him. Artist or vandal? Well, that's something to discuss at another time as this film isn't really about Bansky, but more about a man called Thierry Guetta and Banksy's involvement with him.Guetta is a Frenchman living in the USA. Using a videocamera, he films everything. EVERYTHING! He begins to film and hang out with various street artists, on the basis on making a doco. He not only films them, but he helps them. This leads to a eventual meeting with Banksy: Hidden under obscured face and altered voice, we never see the real Banksy, but see him talk about his experience with Guetta. The time spent with Bansky leads to he notion that Guetta should do his own street art. And this he does with relish. First he starts with small stickers, before increasing the size of his work. But then things take a different turn. Guetta decides to host an art show. On a massive scale. Held in a huge abandoned building, the show comprises hundreds of pieces. But Guetta doesn't really to the hard work himself, instead hiring a massive staff to produce the works and organize the show. Thanks to some good 'quotes' and a large press article, the opening night is a huge success: Over 7000 people attend and allegedlly selling millions worth of art. The show looks impessive, some of the work looks amazing and the guests seem to be going mad for it all. But there is criticism, including it seems from Banksy himself. Is any of this show or this work new or original? Hasn't it been done before? Perhaps.Guetta provides many laughs in this film. He struggles talking on camera, never properly finishing sentences or being reptitive. He seems abit uncouth as well, almost nerdy, perhaps annoyingly so. Interviews with various artists seem to give the general consensus that hes an idiot. I fund him both entertaining and highly irritating. the following of the artists is fascinating, seeing the work go up in an instant and the various styles and ideas. I struggled with Guetta's work though, perhaps because I was amazed that an unknown artist was producing work that wasn't that original and was making money from it. But this is where the film itself plays a role. Is this a documentary or a mockumentary? There are many discussions about the realness of this film. Is it an elaborate hoax, put together by Banksy? Or is it in fact a real story about one persons success and the art worlds desire for something? It's a difficult one to judge, there are many pointers for both cases. As a film itself, it works wonderfully, because despite Guetta's annoyance he makes for an interesting subject. Plus you also have the elements of seeing various artists, including Banksy at work, which provides some fascinating stuff. It is up to the individual to decide on the reality of the film. Perhaps one day, we will find out whether we have all been taking for a ride. All be it a good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wild style turns ironic, manic, and political</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two things are clear about 'Exit Through the Gift Shop:' its exact origins are mysterious but even if it's a hoax, it's one of the year's best documentaries.This starts out as a film made by Thierry Guetta, a successful French L.A. vintage clothing dealer turned compulsive videographer who documents street artists. Later the mysterious and world-famous street artist Banksy takes over and shoots a film about Thierry instead, when he becomes an artist himself -- or just a successful charlatan.After videoing everything around him, apparently out of an emotional deformation due to an early bereavement, Thierry finds a subject. A cousin is a street artist in France called Invader who does little paste-on tile abstractions he attaches to buildings. Invader introduces Thierry to the dangerous and exciting world of making art in illegal places at night. Back in LA, he soon latches onto an energetic street artist called Shepard Fairey -- later famous for his Barack Obama Hope poster -- and becomes Fairey's assistant and friend. Soon he's videoing many LA artists who use stencils, Kinko Copy blowups, painting, spray cans, and objects and risk arrest to create art temporarily in highly visible (and often dangerous-to-reach) public spaces. They welcome Thierry's filming because their art is fugitive.Thierry talks about his life and his reckless new career -- he shares the risks of the artists he films -- for which he leaves his wife and kids to fend for themselves for long stretches. We learn about the provocative and notoriously invisible British street artist Banksy, whose projects are seen all over the world, while he is never spotted. These include provocative paintings on the notorious Apartheid/AKA /Security wall Israel has built to separate off the Palestinians. Observing and filming Banksy becomes Thierry's dream. He is the most famous and least accessible of his breed.Banksy comes to L.A. one day and, through Shepard Fairey, contacts Thierry to get logistic support and find the best spaces to work with. Banksy befriends Thierry and takes him to visit his studio in England, shows him how he's printed a million pounds in fake money but can't use it because he'd go to jail.Banksy (his face and voice disguised) now takes over the film. He tells (and shows) us that, first, Thierry never edited or even looked at the reams of videos he'd made, and, second, when he, Thierry, finally did put together a "film" editing together his videos of street art and its creation, the result (which we glimpse) was meaningless visual gibberish. "So I had to take over," Banksy says. He claims he sent Thierry back to LA and told him to put down his camera and play around with art. Later he regrets this, but he wants to make a good movie out of Thierry's material on his own.Then follows the story of how Thierry Guetta becomes a street artist himself, known as Mr. Brainwash (MBW). After a short career of putting up Warhol-like images on the usual dangerously high-perched walls, Guetta very quickly -- way too quickly -- jumps into the project of mounting his own giant art show, much the way Banksy himself did his show, "Barely Legal," earlier in a rented L.A. warehouse.Who did this work for Thierry's MBW show, how it got huge publicity (initially via LA Weekly), and how much Thierry's filming all along was really his, or who edited it, is a cloudy issue. For a while it comes to seem possible Thierry's career as an artist is a hoax of Banksy's to show the gullibility of the public -- the way publicity generates art and attaches value to it that it would not otherwise have. And the way once-dignified but now greedy big art museums produce blockbuster shows visitors must "exit through the gift shop" -- to maximize profits. But Banksy may have created a monster he never intended by encouraging Thierry to put down his camera and turn to art-making. MBW's work is just a mishmash of the styles of every artist he's documented. "Mr. Brainwash is a force of nature, he's a phenomenon. And I don't mean that in a good way," Banksy declared. The film is amusing, but the pill it delivers is bitter.Not entirely, though. It also embodies a joyous, madcap enthusiasm for the excitement of art by Banksy and other street artists who take major intellectual risks as well as physical and legal ones -- risks Thierry himself tasted: he was held and interrogated for four hours after he was caught filming Banksy's inflated-doll Gitmo prisoner in a park at Disneyland, but managed to cover up the fact that he was in cahoots with Banksy on the piece by deleting his film while being questioned. So he says, anyway.The film shows the evolution of street art from the 70's and 80's graffiti art into much more complicated productions, like the traditional red London phone booth Banksy's people steal, take to a workshop, chop in half, and reshape into a sharp-angled object they later dump on a street corner.There are two positive highs in the film: the high of Thierry' passionate following of street art in LA, and the high of Thierry's manic transformation into Mr. Brainwash. The rift between the two highs comes when Banksy steps in and overtly takes over. To some extent the fun of the film spoils some of the real potential documentary value here, because the street artists filmed at the beginning really are interesting in themselves, especially Banksy. However, the hoax-like, foggy nature of this film is appropriate, because one of the main topics of street art is how public imagery is manipulated and falsified. 'Exit Through the Gift Shop' is in an established tradition of art about forgery that is itself half-forged.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pretty much the best movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of open questions about how one should read this movie.First, I'm convinced Bansky is responsible for Mr. Brainwash's art. It's hard to imagine the film getting put together in the way it claims to have been -- Bansky couldn't have looked through all of the tapes, and the tapes that Brainwash supposedly shot probably couldn't have been used to create the film we saw.Second, there are tons of references to Warhol in this picture, and the art is really pop and accessible in ways that are very much like Warhol's work. But in a sense, Bansky is the anti-Warhol. He doesn't want to be famous, he won't even show his face. I don't know what happened with his show, but he seems to be dug in against cashing in on his success.Andy Kauffman used a character named Tony Clifton to do certain things that Kauffman didn't want to do as himself. I think that's what Bansky is doing here. He's offloading the fame and the success and the grubby stuff that goes along with it to Mr. Brainwash.I'm not an art person, and so I don't really know what I'm talking about here. But a lot of serious contemporary art is hard for the average person to connect with. It's complicated, and the context isn't available to the average person. Or at least it's not readily available to me. I'm talking about stuff at the Whitney Biennial, or MoMA's PS1, or whatever.Banksky's art is different. It's out on the street, and it's for the people who walk by on the street. It's democratic, in that sense.But Bansky as a person is sort of an anti-star. He's not trying to be famous. I know that there is the legal stuff, but he's so dug in on secrecy that I think there's more to it than that.That's the interesting thing. Bansky seems to want to do pop art, but he really, really doesn't want to be a pop star. And the thing is, the pop star is really the main problem with pop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A behind the scenes look at one of the most interesting cultural shifts to take place in the art industry -- the rise of street/pop art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to lie. I don't know a thing about street art, graffiti, or the extremely talented artists sticking countless buildings in the Los Angeles and UK cityscapes. What I do know is that Exit Through the Gift Shop is a hip, ultra modern documentary that exposes us to the secret world of the Sheperd Fairys, the Banksys, and the Alien Invaders, arguably some of the most creative, unique, and talented artists of the 21st century. Haven't heard of these dudes? Don't worry. Neither had I.Banksy is a British graffiti artist whose identity is to this day, unconfirmed. His pieces can be seen all over the UK where he's been known to break apart British telephone booths, paint elephants completely pink, and create stencils and illustrations that don't so much destroy the cityscape around them, rather than enhance them. Shepard Fairey is an American artist, graphic designer, and illustrator who's been an active graffiti artist in Los Angeles for the last ten years.While Exit Through the Gift Shop was originally supposed to be a film about Banksy and Fairey, a strange thing happened. The director, Thierry Guetta, a french filmmaker who had spent the better part of his life documenting every single minute of these two men on a camera went from being the one filming to the one being filmed. His life combined not only the secrets of the two most popular graffiti artists, but also a behind the scenes look at how he, Thierry Guetta, went from a father, to a filmmaker, to world-renown artists, arguably on the same scale as Banksy and Fairy, all within the course of a few short years.The film documents a ton of illegal street art activity. This isn't only fun to watch, it's extremely eye opening to see that this world actually exists. There's individuals out there, running the streets at 3:00 in the morning all in pursuit of a passion. On top of this, we're exposed to a behind the scenes look at one of the most interesting cultural shifts to take place in the last century- the rise of the street art show and its increasing importance within the overall art industry. We have these individuals who practically look homeless, yet they make millions of dollars for one piece of art. It's truly a unique experience that one must see to believe.Exit Through the Gift shop has received nothing but praise since its premier at Cannes earlier this year. Much like the artists and the art it chronicles, it turns the traditional confines of an art documentary piece into an action-oriented thrill ride that documents one of the craziest cultural art trends taking place throughout the world. Once you start this film, regardless of your interest in art, I guarantee you won't be let down.Michael Buffa Editor, Popcorn Jury http://www.popcornjury.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deceptively light-hearted tour of the rise of street art to high art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It turns out that Banksy can tell a story well, too. This is a super, era-defining 'documentary'. Although it's almost impossible to separate fact from faux, it hardly matters. The Keyser Söze figure of Banksy himself allows the focus of the film to slip off him onto relatively peripheral characters like Shepard Fairey and a number of European street artists. At the centre is the only truly fictional character, Thierry, who is 'responsible' for the guerrilla footage of the artists at work and then gets sucked into the production of the art himself. It's a cunning Man Bites Dog-style, 'gone native' reversal which only serves to confirm the elusiveness of the true filmmaker.As I say, the film documents the rise of real urban art: how the internet has allowed the temporary nature of graffiti to achieve a wide audience and some sort of permanence. It also dusts down perennial discussions about the value of art. All this is unfussy though, couched in a mad story which trips along well. Naturally, a lot of the footage is after dark and, with the style always cleaving towards realist, the images are sometimes a bit rubbish. I'm just pleased it wasn't an hour and a half of rough cuts of being chased by the police. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was one of the lucky few to get a ticket to see the screening of Exit through the gift shop at Lambeth Palace (a secret makeshift cinema in the graffiti tunnel @ Waterloo). The setting was fantastic and I especially loved the sound of trains passing overhead whilst watching the film which really added to the effect.Exit through the gift shop kept me in suspense throughout - it was all about the journeys of Thierry Guetta, a quirky Frenchman who went from being a random guy with a camera to 'Mr Brainwash' street artist! He began filming his cousin the 'Invader', a street artist responsible for pasting Space Invader characters on random buildings around the world.Thierry's cheeky nature and all the pokes at art world hype made me laugh throughout.For an exclusive insight into my trip to Lambeth Palace please visit my new blog www.FatLDN.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And while this is a common question you would expect a woman to hear, in this case the question goes out to this documentary ... or is it "mockumentary"? And furthermore: Does it matter? Would you think less of the movie if it wasn't "real"? Though an internet search seems to provide facts, that the guy we are seeing here is real (and I'm not talking about Banksy, whose identity remains hidden) ... but is he really? These are all questions that I cannot answer and even if some users here claim to know, I would second guess them. Could this be the most elaborate prank ever? As you can see the movie does leave you with many questions and it starts off as a normal documentary, which seems to be aiming to show us street artists. And who has a bigger name right now then Banksy (search him if you don't know who that is). He even says a few things here and there (although it is very probable, that it isn't him ... but then again who is him? And how would we know if it is him? Or if he even made the movie?).This movie is really out there (it really gets outrageous towards the end) ... so out there, that I can only deem it as one of the best documentaries I have seen. It is a real gem, that goes deep into questions about art and how we perceive it, how media sells it and many more questions. But it also can only be seen as a very funny documentary. Either way (and no matter how you feel about it), you won't be able not to talk about it. And yes I know it's a double negative and I used it, because I meant ... or did I?</fullReview>

It shows that in this age of visual eye-candy and ridiculously high budgets a film can be made and succeed. I feel half the fun of this film is wondering if such a strange mix of obsession, art, and humor can be real. Life is all of the above and that is real. If we make a documentary does it have to be heavy and serious? I have watched numerous documentaries and features, more than I would have liked, this was worth it.

		<shortDescription>Exit Through the Gift Shop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exit Through the Gift Shop is a documentary film, but done in such a way that in some ways it is unlike most documentaries we have seen before. The film is directed by famous graffiti artist Banksy and follows a man named Thierry Guetta, who owns a couple of successful clothing stores. One thing we get to know quickly about Thierry, is that he loves to film. He carries a camera around with him constantly and saves the tapes, but does not really plan on watching them at a later time. After coming into contact with some famous street and graffiti artists, Thierry becomes fascinated with their work and in a sense almost befriends them. He wants to help them out by filming them doing their various styles of art and later release the ultimate street art documentary. Thierry soon has a lot of the biggest names in his film, but one he hopes to get is the mysterious Banksy. They do eventually meet and Thierry helps Banksy by filming him as well. One day Banksy gives Thierry an idea. An idea which results in the more humorous and message laden final part of the film to do with art. Banksy tells Thierry that he should start doing his own art, which Theirry soon does and even opens up an exhibition, but if you are producing and doing millions of pieces of art that copies the street artists you have befriended as well as borrowing from some of the biggest pop art icons around such as Andy Warhol, the question remains. Is it art? Exit Through the Gift Shop is like a masterpiece painting for anyone interesting in current art and pop culture. It brilliantly uses a story, that is truly stranger than fiction and asks us the viewer to decide, what is art? Is it art if you blatantly rip the idea off of someone else? And what do the average consumers who buy art, what exactly are they really looking for? Is it something that is beautiful, haunting, or even thought provoking? Or is it perhaps whatever is the big thing at the time, whether it is garbage, or not. I personally found the film fascinating to watch as Thierry Guetta was such an interesting person and yes he had a lot of ambition, even if it really was not going anywhere. The escapades of Thierry making his films and also his debut into the art world is hilarious to watch because of everything that goes on and I know that I am being brief, but you really do need to see the film for yourself. Banksy brilliantly makes a film not only about Thierry, but in some ways also about himself, the other street artists and then gets into the million dollar hot question about what really is art. I personally think Banksy is a genius with what he has given us here and having now seen some of his work on screen and in books and the internet, I would definitely have to say that I am a fan. Thierry on the other hand seems to have some kind of passion, but is it really to be creative, or to make money and have all the fame that goes with it? All of this is explored here in this truly fascinating, brilliant and humorous film. Even though the film is a documentary, I would still say that it is one of the funniest, if not the funniest film I have seen this year and the film as a whole is one of the most entertaining and thought provoking documentaries I have ever seen and I would also label it as one of the best. This definitely needs to be up for a Best Documentary Film Oscar next year because I absolutely loved it to pieces and I would put it in my top 5 films of 2010 so far along with The Social Network, Mao's Last Dancer, I Am Love and The Kids Are All Right. Love art? Want to have a lengthy discussion about it with someone? Then see Exit Through the Gift Shop.</fullReview>

Saddens me that it's notion is now not only proved to be true but also translates to all aspects of society; politics, religion and even family. Makes me happy that I still can laugh about it and that there are sensitive and intelligent people (the creators) with means and ways that have enthusiasm and optimism enough to share themselves commercially! The results of this experiment will probably never have any impact on the art establishment, nor society, since its mechanisms are quite "human" and we're not so fond of diminishing ourselves. Anyone with intentions to keep his integrity intact should consequently stay away from mass-spectacles of any kind, they could be contagious :) The question I ask myself is: How could this fact (brainwash, mass-hype) be reversed, used to our common benefit? Well, Utopia can not exist so I think I've drifted away already? Unless you guys can make another piece, proving me wrong?! Maybe "Enter and just stick around" ?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you got to see (Untitled)a year,or two ago in it's brief release,you will get big laughs on this one. The film concerns the very real realm of street art (some call it graffiti),featuring the likes of Banksy,Space Invader,Shepard Fairey &amp; Swoon (they do sport some colourful names,don't they?). The film was supposed to be a portrait of the street artist,Banksy,by a French transplanted video artist by the name of Thierry Guetta,but Banksy,fearing persecution by the police,decided to turn the camera on Thierry instead. Guetta,for what ever unknown reasons decides to become a street artist (only after Thierry finally edits hours &amp; hours of footage of street artists into a totally unwatchable mess that just screams "pretentous"). We see Thierry turn what has to be some of the most laughable Andy Warhol wannabe (so called) art into gold,selling his "art" to gullible Los Angelas trendoids. Is this film real,or just hype? (that's for you,the viewer to decide). Banksy directs,and occasionally appears (face always covered in a black hoodie sweatshirt &amp; voice electronically distorted)in this film that is being called "the first street art disaster movie", with camera work by Thierry Guetta,Jerry Henry &amp; Todd Mazer,with editing by Tom Fulford &amp; Chris King. Also featuring the likes of Thierry Guetta,Space Invader,Swoon,and others,with narration by Rhys Ifans. Spoken(mostly)in English,and French with English subtitles.

If so, this film is a piece of art itself and we can easily compare it with Duchamp's Fountain. If not, if it's just wrong speculation, the film is almost perfect, but not Perfect.

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Hoax or real? Documentary or Mockumentary? Fiction or Stranger than Fiction? Sorry, but I can't answer these questions. A quick Google gives the appearance that the characters and story are true - or at least real. I guess the main argument I would make is that, true or not, the film is entertaining and enlightening either way.It certainly makes a statement regarding the commercialization of art. This includes fads and the power of hype and marketing. I can't really offer up much commentary on the content of the film other than to say Thierry Gueta is a fascinating character, though I have absolutely no interest in owning his "art". I did love Banksky's line about Thierry being more interesting than his work. Couldn't agree more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Banksy film a triumph of storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know quite where to start, I sit here at Euston Station in awe of my evening at Lambeth Palace. I have never seen, and I never will see, a film quite like that, in a setting such as that, ever again!I shall start with the setting. Imagine yourself in a dimly lit, slightly damp, disused tube tunnel. Sounds grim I know but hear me out. This tunnel is filled to bursting with beautifully lit original artwork in the form of paintings and installations. There is a bar, but no ordinary bar - drinks are served from a burnt out ice cream van. There are popcorn vendors selling to you from the furniture of a North American diner and countless red leather sofas scattered around, some of which gather round a huge canvas bonfire burning recognisable Renaissance classics. All these aspects are nothing new to Banksy fans however, although there is new art in a new location it has become expected of Banksy to display his work differently, the reason people were here was for once not to see paintings or installations but cinema.Eventually, a little later than scheduled due to the lure of a beer round the fire, what everyone had been waiting for began - and what an extraordinary piece of cinema it was.Without wanting to ruin it for anybody the story is about a French eccentric who's strange obsessions lead him to be involved with one of the most elusive groups of people in history...street artists. This inevitably leads him to Banksy and what happens to these two men when they meet is hilarious, disastrous, brilliant and astonishing all at once. Filmed almost entirely on poor quality hand-held cameras this film illustrates perfectly that the key to a brilliant movie is a strong story with engaging characters, not how clever the 3D effects are or the amount of money spent on special effects. I refer of course to Avatar which I saw last night - the first five minutes of which are interesting because 3D is a clever formula but after that you are left desperate for plot line, half decent acting and a hero to engage with. Banksy's film is so brilliant for exactly the reasons Avatar isn't. Charming, funny and insightful, I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this evening and I totally recommend Exit Through The Gift Shop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit that me and my two-month long-time lesbian companion and our six preteen children watched this mesmerizing DVD in bits and pieces, frequently pausing, rewinding, fast-forwarding and such so that the film felt more coherent. As a first rate scholar and teacher of film who hobnobs regularly with the Hollywood "in-crowd," watching this movie was not the first time I was able to sneak in to a fabulous after-party.I'll be honest and up front - I found the film wanting. Missing most was a sense of in-your-face nudity and graphic sexual acts which truly belong front and center, up close and personal, in the public eye. Enormous pictorial or sculptural representations of Boobs and Cocks, such as a true impresario like Koons would have done. I even called to ask Jeff who was too busy for comment.The film is also thoroughly, very - and very annoyingly - American. There are no people of color in the whole movie, unless you count a passing glimpse of Muhammad Ali in the far distance, portrayed delivering a sorely watered-down punch. I even asked his beautiful daughter for a romantic evening out. She agreed. And yes, no matter what you may have heard from the 1970's, black is beautiful.Boredom is Banksy's middle name. Not only does he whitewash post-modern suburbia with his pseudo-Bohemian stencils and a bourgeois point of view, he does so with a flaming and flamboyant flair that only RuPaul or perhaps Truman Capote could aspire to. Banksy comes across as a man in drag who is ninety-percent transitioned. Watch out, female artists! Speaking of which, this film doesn't feature any (unless you count Banksy). Is the message perchance that we women are subordinate? Need we wear a hoodie and climb walls and spread our ejaculate all over everything to prove we exist? Those, my friends, are the elephants in the room. Otherwise, the flick is immensely pleasurable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Exit Through the Gift Shop," directed by UK graffiti and urban installation artist Banksy, isn't a documentary I had much inherent interest in?Maybe because I burned out on the street art scene at the tender age of nine.It was a sepia-toned 1996 when, unsupervised, a neighbor's son and I spray-painted our names on the face of the barn behind his family's house. Upon discovery hours later, we were severely reprimanded, yet our sloppy signatures remained up for years afterward.My conception of the street art movement, and certainly my participation in it, never blossomed beyond that hasty experiment. Over the subsequent decade and a half, I've often admired the work of anonymous graffiti artists from afar, but I hadn't given the culture or cultivation of the form a second thought. And it turns out that's pretty much the perfect place to come into "Exit Through the Gift Shop," which begins as a rose-tinted overview of the medium, including interviews with some of its key players, including "Space Invader," who pastes mosaics of Atari video game sprites in Paris and throughout the world, and Shepard Fairey, who made a huge name for himself during the 2008 US presidential campaign for his now iconic portrait of Barack Obama.But behind the somewhat plodding framework of the first thirty minutes, Banksy, who cloaks himself in a black, underlit hoodie and speaks with voice mask on camera, lays the foundation for the real protagonist, and consequently, the real film that "Exit Through the Gift Shop" becomes. "The film is the story of what happened when this guy tried to make a documentary about me, but he was actually a lot more interesting than I am," he explains.That guy is Thierry Guetta, cousin to the aforementioned "Space Invader." Thierry is a compulsive videographer, and through his cousin, develops a romance with the world of street art that becomes a natural engine for the documentary, with some fascinating and unexpected developments later on. I absolutely don't want to spoil where it goes, suffice it to say that the story becomes at once more intimate and simultaneously more involving, while the intellectual scope funnels out into a broader examination of art itself.The latter forty-five minutes are so good that I'm inclined to forgive the former its lack of innovation, but especially by comparison, the beginning feels a little overly-plump. Banksy is spot-on in his assertion that Thierry is an interesting subject, and perhaps the greatest flaw of the film is that he's behind the camera for too much of it. His footage is hemmed together with interview segments and archival snippets, compiled with a decidedly DYI attitude that lends the film an unobtrusive authenticity.There are a hundred self-serving documentaries released each year that may be internally enjoyed by a specific demographic, and only a couple that manage to extrapolate an esoteric topic into something universal, and "Gift Shop" is the rare exception as a terrific and often very funny look at the human perception of art?That is, once the formality of defining and contextualizing the movement is out of the way.So you don't need any inherent interest in graffiti or street art to appreciate Banksy's film, but you do need to be willing to consider the possibility that beyond the legal ramifications of defacing public property, there is a potential for beauty. The film is as much a love-letter to the lifestyle as it is a discourse on creativity and commerce, and your personal definition of art will weigh heavily on your interpretation of the lingering questions the director leaves you with.But above all, the upbeat pace and vivid protagonist are the reasons "Exit Through the Gift Shop" is such a satisfying experience. Forget art, it's fun.</fullReview>
