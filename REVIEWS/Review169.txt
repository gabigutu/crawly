		<shortDescription>A great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw a sneak peek of Warrior. All I can saw is WOW! Great film. Great performances. The characters are deep and believable and the story will probably have you leaving the theater in tears.The fight scenes were done really well. I've been cage side at hundreds of MMA fights as a photographer and believe me when I say this is some of the most realistically portrayed MMA action I've seen to date on film. Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton, Jennifer Morrison and Nick Nolte all give good performances and I think Nick Nolte had a couple of moments in the film that should be considered Oscar worthy.I know a lot of people won't agree with me on this and I can understand, but Warrior has bumped Rocky out of my top 5 favorite movies of all time. IMHO (which some of you will consider worthless) I think it's that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderfully, well written story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is truly, truly OUTSTANDING! I am in complete shock over the performances in this film. Nick Nolte, as usual, gives a gritty, gut wrenching, emotional performance that left me buckling at the knees. One of my all time favorite movies of Mr. Nolte was Rich Man, Poor Man, absolutely a god given talent! The performances of Mr. Hardy and Mr. Edgeron were academy award winning, I would love to see more of them by far! I cried throughout the movie, and when it was over, I could not wait to tell everyone about it. A terrific ensemble cast and movie that certainly should be up for Best Picture!! A definitive Oscar nod for Nick Nolte, and if it were up to me, Mr. Hardy and Mr. Edgeron would walk away with one as well! If you have not seen this movie, drop what you are doing, run to your nearest theater. This movie is truly what being a performer is all about! My hat is off to you all!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just for fight fans...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My girlfriend took me to an advance screening of Warrior because I'm an MMA enthusiast. She told me she did not expect much. She ended up leaving the theater in tears.The fighting in the movie is almost an after thought. What the movie is really about is a broken family trying to get on with their lives. You have a recently sober father trying to earn the forgiveness of his sons for destroying his family years earlier, one son trying to provide for his wife and children, and the other son trying to earn money for the family of his friend and fellow Marine who died overseas. All of it comes together seamlessly and provides for a truly gripping movie.It's emotional without being sappy. It's funny without being goofy. It's inspirational without going over the top. It's hard to say anything bad about it. Even if you have no interest in martial arts, you will get something out of this movie.I highly recommend this movie for men AND women, fight fans and average Joes alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotions on par with The Fighter, one of the top combat sport movies since Rocky, one of the best of 2011</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every so often you'll come across a combat sport movie that manages to find just the right balance of drama and action ? that is, more drama than action. When fights are justified with backstories full of crushing emotion, they become all the more intense and gratifying. Warrior brings to the table the world of mixed martial arts, where punches, kicks, holds, and everything else goes. The inception of new international tournament "Sparta" puts on a collision course Paddy (Nick Nolte), Brendan (Joel Edgerton), and Tom Conlon (Tom Hardy), all part of an estranged family torn apart in the past by abuse, favoritism, and abandonment. Tom resurfaces in society to enlist the help of his formerly alcoholic father Paddy to train him for the tournament, while at the same time Brendan revisits his UFC training in hopes to win the $5 million purse for his struggling family. The two underdogs face some of the toughest MMA fighters on the planet, but the true struggle appears to lie within them. Paddy battles for forgiveness against the resentment of his sons, Tom fights to prove to himself that he is strong, and Brendan struggles to come to terms with his older family while trying to support one of his own.The fantastic thing here is two protagonists entering the same tournament. Each brother has his own respectable reasons for fighting, a fact that is sure to divide the audience when it comes time to choose which one to root for. The story truly is gut-wrenchingly powerful and presented in an engaging fashion. Little by little through the film's dialogue, we are allowed a glimpse into the past hardships of the Conlon family, and the characters' motivations for retaining such hatred are revealed gradually. Through the incredible acting talents of Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton, and Nick Nolte, this confused and passionate chemistry really comes alive. All three actors put up some of the most convincing and heartbreaking performances of their careers; and seeing as how The Fighter garnered so many Oscar nominations, I can't see why Warrior will not do the same. My only beef with the movie is its clichéd climax and rather bleak inconclusive ending, though it still does good to the emotional schism the movie intended to create. Warrior is one of those sports films with a magical mixture of emotional and physical battle. It's a wonderful story showing how sometimes the world's strongest forces are insignificant in comparison to the troubles of a scarred family. Warrior is without a doubt worth a visit to the theater. One of the best of 2011! And whether you're an MMA fan or not, the adrenaline-pumping fights will have you up and cheering and applauding.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Fighting Movie Since Rocky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the pleasure of seeing Warrior at 2011 CinemaCon, walking in not knowing a thing about the movie, other than it was a movie about 'fighting.' And though a MMA movie (Mixed Martial Arts), not boxing, per se, for the genre, fighting, Warrior delivers a much better story than The Fighter, and is on par with Clint Eastwood's Oscar winner, Million Dollar Baby.Expect a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nod in 2012 for Nick Nolte. And superstar status for Tom Hardy.Warrior, though a work of fiction, plays out like a true story; two brothers at odds with each other and their father, in the town of Pittsburgh, who resort to prize fighting, one for the money, the other to prove himself a man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, Lets talk about the the big pink elephant in the room first. Yes, the movie has a similar storyline from movies of the past. And yes, it may be, to some, "just another fight movie. However, Warrior has the audacity to challenge the cliché's and still manages to stand out from the rest. Bottom line, Warrior is a well written and directed emotional roller coaster that will have you at the edge of your seat. With a star studded cast and top notch acting, the performances were solid and believable. Nick Nolte in particular did a fantastic job with his role and will have you nearly in tears. As the movie progresses you will be torn on what you would like to see happen for the climax of this entertaining thrill ride. Movies with this much emotional power connected to the characters only come around every once in a while. Go see this movie to finish off the summer or forever regret not supporting what is sure to be a classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the pleasure of watching this movie last night. I went since its a "guy" movie my husband was the one excited about it more than I was. I must say I was more than impressed with the leading men in this film. It has been a long time since a movie has had me on the edge of my seat, biting my nails as this movie did during the fighting scenes. If you are looking for great acting, family drama, awesome fighting scenes than this is the movie for you. After we left the theater we couldn't stop talking about it. I will definitely go see it again when it comes out. We really enjoyed it! Nick Nolte was amazing, and even my husband I think cried in a few scenes, (last time that happened was during Marley and Me) so I must say this movie is a MUST SEE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Sports Movie this year. One of the greatest fighting movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the past few years we've been receiving quite a lump sum of MMA movies due to the rise of the sport. But movies like Never back down, and fighting just doesn't cut it with their cliché man against man rivalry, with their over the top inaccurate MMA-like action. Then there came Warrior. Was it just another MMA movie with over the top hardcore action? Well lets find out.What pulled me into the movie at first was the trailer. The trailer didn't have hardcore rock or scenes of "You're not the best around here you can't beat me" shenanigans. It had the sense of two brothers trying to solve their own problems while trying to deal with each other and their former alcoholic father through the use of a huge MMA tournament named Sparta. In which revealed in the trailer they eventually have to face each other.The story of Warrior although is very MMA suited, you will see about more drama than there is action. Not that there is a problem with that, but it's always great to see how everything unfolds. A former MMA fighter now Physics teacher Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) faces financial problems with his house and is slowly getting back into the mix by competing in underground fights. But the education system finds out about his antics, thus for he is suspended without pay. So he uses this to train full time, and compete in Sparta. Whereas former Marine Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) a war hero who is suffering through PTSD, decides he wants to fight in Sparta to give the prize money to the family of his fallen friend. Then there is the father Paddy (Nick Nolte) a former alcoholic who is trying to reach out for his sons for forgiveness of being a family wreck. Who in return is being used as Tommy's trainer, bet is being neglected by him as well. Then Brendan although neglecting him as well, is trying to deal with his own problems and has no time for him.As for the fight scenes of the movie, I can say I am an experienced Martial artist I've trained in several styles. Although I am not a pro MMA fighter yet, I've watched enough fights to actually comprehend how MMA fights are like and the rules and whatnot. Warrior has put in really great choreography of an authentic MMA fight. It was as if I was watching real fights on the big screen. Although there were some over the top moves here and there, most of the techniques portrayed in Warrior are applicable in a real life combat situation.The performance and screenplay, all were simply amazing. Tom Hardy's performance was astounding, as so was Nick Nolte's. The appearances of Nate Marquardt (UFC), Anthony Johnson(UFC), Erik Apple(Strikeforce), Roan Carneiro(Freelance) and Kurt Angle(TNA) did a really good job being actors of the movie while being able to retain their athletic ability of being professional athletes in combat sports.The movie had a unique way making you feel absorbed into the movie, getting to know the characters and feeling attached to them emotionally. Warrior is an emotional roller coaster that will make you laugh, really tense, and even leaving the theater in tears. Whether you are the MMA athlete, fan, trainer, enthusiast or an average movie goer, This movie is for you. Definitely one of the best movies I've seen this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The official trailer itself is a little bit of a spoiler. I didn't even have an IMDb account and made one just to rate this movie. One of the best iv ever seen. First movie iv ever cried during, and i cried twice lol. Whether your a guy who likes fighting movies or a girl who doesn't know what MMA stands for, this movie will blow you away. Seriously, I don't know how anyone could watch this and think it wasn't at the very least, a Very Good movie. It kept me on the edge of my seat, and its also more realistic the most fighting movies. Watching rocky and most box office fighting films, there tends to be over-dramatized punching noises and the boxers seem to fight without attempting to guard themselves. Aside from the realistic fight however, is a very emotional drama which is sure to move anyone who pays attention to the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What You Fight For</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Warrior" may be one of the best movies of the year that no one sees. That in itself is puzzling. Mixed martial arts and UFC are in the cultural mainstream; in fact MMA is more popular than professional boxing. Director and writer Gavin O'Connor did the amazing "Miracle" a few years back about the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team. So he has the touch for inspirational sports stories. In "Warrior" estranged brothers Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) and Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) fight each other in the finals of the winner take all mixed martial arts tournament Sparta in Atlantic City. "Warrior" is an inspired story of family, honor, and redemption. I applauded at the end of the movie along with the rest of the audience."Warrior" is a paradox of styles as inspired by its leads. Tommy (Hardy) is the AWOL Marine war hero from Afghanistan. He literally tore off a submerged tank door, saving those inside. Tommy plows through opponents with sheer rage and power. He is explosive technique. We witness this as he savagely dismantles world middle weight contender "Mad Dog" Grimes (cocky Erik Apple) with kicks, punches, and throws in an impromptu sparring session. Tommy mysteriously appears at his Dad's door step in Pittsburgh. He blames Paddy (powerful and sublime Nick Nolte) for the death of his mother. Brendan (Edgerton) is the high school physics teacher and former UFC fighter. He and his wife Tess (strong Jennifer Morrison) work several jobs to pay their upside down mortgage. Brendan gets an entry into Sparta to save his family home. He is smart and willing to take punishment to leverage his opponent's mistakes?getting a tap out. Brendan like Tommy has no love for their recovered drunk Dad (Nolte).At the narrative arc Brendan says to Tommy, "I love you!" And neither will back down. I think O'Connor and writers Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman at times overstate the family dysfunction. "Warrior" could have been leaner, as strange as that sounds. The mixed martial arts fighting are world class and many of the fighters are MMA stars. Former professional wrestling champion Kurt Angle is fierce and dominating as Russian champ Koba. His match with Brendan is vicious and amazing. "Warrior" authentically gets the brutality and precision of mixed martial arts. Hardy and Edgerton are awesome. I read that Hardy trained intensely gaining 30 pounds of muscle. He broke ribs and fingers. Edgerton tore his knee out during the shoot."Warrior" has a gritty atmosphere that is all about character and adversity. O'Connor seamlessly captures this in the simple camera shots and intimate dialog. He generates amazing performances. Edgerton is the delicate balance of compassion and focus. His Brendan is a good and decent man. Hardy has an electrifying enigmatic presence. He provokes a painful sadness and rage in Tommy, for whom honor and family are everything. Nick Nolte poignantly plays their broken father, who is pivotal in the redemption of his sons. Ultimately, "Warrior" is about forgiveness and love. It is one of the year's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine sports/fight movie with great performances that deserves a wide audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to catch Warrior at Empire's Big Screen at the O2 in London last week as one of their secret screenings and I have to say it was a very pleasant surprise. It seems it wasn't just me either, eves-dropping on rest of the audience as we left revealed there was an all round endorsement by the crowd. Funnily many of the conversations would begin 'I wouldn't usually go and see a film like that but?' which I can certainly second. I will also avoid spoilers here as I went into this completely unaware and certainly benefited from it.The film follows two fighters and their families as they enter the big bucks mixed martial arts (MMA) competition, Sparta. It has the usual balance of down on his luck good guy doing it for the family (Joel Edgerton) and a seemingly brutal fighter who is looking for a payday (the suddenly ubiquitous Tom Hardy). Throw in Nick Nolte as a sad, reformed drunk of a father and we have the basic elements of another run of the mill sporting movie. Or at least that's how it starts. It doesn't particularly throw any curve balls to be honest but it does unfold interestingly and we are not given the whole story on a plate which was refreshing. It examines family relationships and regret and faces the terrible truths when some wounds just cannot be healed by forgiveness once it is too late.It's not all family drama though and unsurprisingly it does have a hellova lot of fighting in so even though I think it is enjoyable for most if you can't stomach the violence then don't bother with it. However the fighting is well balanced within the narrative, excellently shot and excitingly edited so we do not get the cliché slow-mo or the epic hour long battle even for the big finale. Some of the fights are brutally quick and even those that go the distance are edited down very well indeed while maintaining that punishing feeling - they certainly had the audience ooomph'ing and wincing along with every slam and punch. There will be blood along with some horrible curdling crunches too.Aside form the action Rocky (1976) and The Wrestler (2008) seemed to be more about the individual and their demons and while there are elements of that here it really focuses on the (dysfunctional) family drama. Of course it is going to get the obvious comparisons to The Fighter (2010) but I don't think it's a bad thing and that should really be taken as a compliment. I would not be surprised to see it picking up a few awards along the way too. Even if one was to compare the two I think Warrior stands up very well and having the film follow two fighters marks it apart. Like the fighter though the two leads are outstanding and worthy of all the attention they will receive for them. Performances are impressive across the board in fact and it's wonderful to see Nick Nolte back in the frame with a delightful role that he seems to slip perfectly into. (A sorry ex-drunk with a history of violence - apologies Nick!) As well as their acting performances the two main characters are to be complimented on their believable appearance as fighters with some impressive physique on display. Both of our fighters here are easily as believable as the muscled yet high pitched and whiny Wahlberg and certainly must have done a fair bit of training for the role too. Although that wouldn't really be a surprise for anyone that has seen Hardy in Bronson (2008) most will know him from his turn in Inception (2010) which is something completely different. Joel Edgerton too looks different from the roles I remember him in ? Kinky Boots (2005) and Animal Kingdom (2010) - as well as his Uncle Owen turn mean this is another impressive transformation.As much as I love this film there are a few gripes as there always has to be (sorry I've yet to find a 10/10 film!). Props to director Gavin O'Connor who also wrote the story and starred but the direction could have been a bit tighter and its not a movie where every scene is trimmed with a few wasted shots or lazy and obvious camera work. Although performances were all good some of the characters seemed to lack depth and I felt the wife (Jennifer Morrison) was a little underused as I thought Nick's role also seemed to be forgotten about in the final third. These are very minor quibbles but unfortunately the main one is that it's a product of its self - it's difficult for any film like this to avoid the cliché or cheesy ending. A film focusing on two main fighters in the same competition was always limited on outcomes and although Warrior does it's best I'm afraid the ending could have been handled a bit better.Very enjoyable movie that I hope gets the audience it deserves. Give it a try even if it's not your usual cuppa tea.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Emotional Homerun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a teenager, I'm definitely inexperienced in the world of MMA. But this movie is not about MMA, and that is set very clear from the start. Right from the start of the 2 minute trailer. So naturally I was ecstatic to take my seat in the theater.Tom Hardy (Tommy Conlon) delivers a moving and emotional performance of a man who has suffered greatly from the ones he loves, and from the field of battle, an all to real reality for people of today. While the younger Tommy suffered the loss of his mother firsthand, his older brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton)has put together a life that a man dreams of, yet is still haunted daily by his past. Only to have it threatened to be destroyed by the bank. Nick Nolte the alcoholic father of the two, has suffered years of remorse and regret from the abuse of alcohol and the neglect of his wife and children is trying to forge a bond but is meeting a stone wall with both of his sons.The fighting, though it is very well acted and shot, is not about fighting. It is the physical representation of the struggle between the three men, the struggle to forget and forgive and to move on. The demons that possess all three of these men are of such great proportion, the only way they can be relinquished is for them to come together.It hits home on such a high level on so many different subjects, that you will be floored into your seat as the credits roll in.An ABSOLUTE MUST SEE :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different interpretation of the ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please don't read this if you don't want the ending given away.I've noticed a lot of people complaining that the ending spoils the film and is clichéd because the underdog and not the better fighter wins.I'm not suggesting that my interpretation is the right one but my view is somewhat different than the one some people hold. It is perfectly logical to point out that Brendan had hard fights to get to the final and that he would probably have been exhausted and that Tommy has had a much easier route.However, the point is that he made that route easier because of his rage. Tommy is only the more destructive force because of that. His demons are driving him on because he is lost. He cannot or will not reach out to connect with his father or brother. The point is that the dam is broken when he sees his father in the hotel room raging against Ahab. This is deeply symbolic. I think you are meant to draw the connection with Ahab who was driven by his own rage with the rage of the father which destroyed his family to the rage which Tommy now feels. Even though he is drunk it is no coincidence that his father refers to Tommy as Ahab and bellows at him to stop the ship. At the point that Tommy takes him in his arms and holds him he begins the healing process but loses what makes him such a formidable fighter. Thus he is simply unable to blow his brother away in the way that he has done to every other opponent.The other crucial point (and you would have to be a younger brother to fully get this one) is that Tommy doesn't really want to beat his brother at that point. He needs to know that his brother loves him and perhaps that he regrets not reaching out to him when they were younger. The fact that he taps out only at the point when Brendan says he loves him is significant as is the fact that he breaks down in the corner before the final round. Had he still been carrying his rage he would surely rather have been rendered unconscious than submit.In other words, for me it was the perfect ending and the more you think about the film the more profound it seems.All in my view of course. Which could be a load of old rubbish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clichéd sports movie with some good points</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very cliché sports story, with so many corny moments that you'll have seen in six dozen other films that it becomes ludicrous long before its end. Yet, in some ways, it's pretty well done, and it nearly overcomes those clichés. Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy play two brothers who parted ways way back when they were teenagers. Hardy went away with his mother and later joined the Marines after she passed away. Now he has returned to his father (Nick Nolte), a former drunk who drove his family apart. Edgerton didn't like his father much, either, but chose not to go with his brother and mother because he was in love with the woman he would eventually marry (Jennifer Morrison). Both brothers are skilled fighters and have their eyes set on the big prize in a mixed martial arts tournament. The film somewhat succeeds because it's very low-key. Most of the time, it's hard to notice how melodramatic and predictable the story is. The performances help, too (Joel Edgerton was my favorite of the three big characters). After a while, though, we get stuff like a wife who refuses to watch the fight impatiently pacing behind her cell phone, on a table in the foreground, waiting for a call to tell her her husband has won a match. And Hardy's story is beyond ridiculous - he gets invited to the tournament after beating up a trained MMA champion in a local gym - never mind that Hardy, at best, was just a trained wrestler many years ago in high school. Being in the Marines does not give you superpowers. That's just the start of the ridiculousness that ends up, obviously, with the two brothers fighting in the ring (with Edgerton's wife, at this point, of course watching from ringside). I should probably call Gavin O'Connor one of the best directors of the year, because, as over-the-top as all this stuff is (and, believe me, I barely scratched the surface - the movie runs for 2 hours and 20 minutes), it generally doesn't feel that way. If one doesn't look too closely at it, I could imagine it seeming great. But it's not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated classical American feelgood movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off - great camera-work, hence the 2. Now for the core of the movie - brother vs brother is a fun plot that can be twisted every which way. However as soon as some obviously fake Russian character is introduced with the completely out of place Visotski song playing in the background... the pieces start falling in place. This is a classical American tearjerker feelgood movie. The idea alone of a classic underdog has been made into film 100 times better in Rocky, where not the selfish victory but "all-in" attempt at it is what really counts. A battle that could not be won, yet one does not give up. This is the opposite. What could have been a very dramatic (and believable! and almost heartbreaking!) plot of two brothers pitted against each other is washed down the tubes. For someone who has a moderate interest in MMA it is clear the the ending was completely unrealistic and would have never taken place. This is not 1900's, today people are not beaten to within an inch of their life in the ring. To contrast this to any VanDamme flick - think of this movie being a much better attempt at a fighter movie, minus actual fighters who have no acting skills, but add to it American superiority complex and you have the "warrior". Overrated, and sad to say this "warrior" won in the ring but lost to idealism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>well if this isn't the American Nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, actually this is a decent sports drama, and I would rate it 6.5-7 if it wasn't for an utterly horrifying plot element that seems to have escaped most people: The main hero of the story is forced into foreclosure of his home by an arrogant banker who weaseled him into his loan in the first place, and now refuses to extend it. His only way out is to participate in a no-holds-barred fight tournament organized and financed by - an arrogant Wall Street banker! Just how sick is that? The people who force ordinary Americans into bankruptcy get the additional kick of watching said Americans get their heads bashed in - and be grateful for the wads of cash they may receive if they make it. Exactly like 'Hunger Games', only there it's criticized and in a SciFi setting, whereas 'Warrior' glorifies this state of things and is set in the present day! Almost as if the US today were some sort of Ancient Rome, where the impoverished should be thankful for their chance to prove their merit in the arena like the gladiators of yore.Other reasons for me to dislike the film were various plot gaps wider than the Grand Canyon: if a soldier goes AWOL in Iraq - how can he resurface in the US under a different name? Are we supposed to believe that US immigration turns a blind eye on disgruntled young men? Besides the fact that the feat, for which he is so celebrated in the film, is physically impossible (body submerged in water = no leverage).Then there's the 'Rocky' thing: below-than-average fighter trains for a big tournament and makes it against all odds. In 'Rocky', however, the whole story is about getting there, how to overcome the shortcomings of the body by willpower, and the final fight is a draw, not a victory - because in that film, the emphasis is on keeping it real, and that's what makes it a classic. 'Warrior', however, features totally unbalanced fight sequences; the only difference to wrestling would be the missing name calling, and that it presents itself as a real deal, where in fact anybody who's ever done a bit of martial arts can only shake his head and go WTF.On the plus side, there's Nick Nolte's great presence in a, however, highly cliché role. But aforementioned plot element, which I perceive as an assault on common sense and civil rights, prompts me to condemn this film completely. If there's anyone in this film who'd deserve a good thrashing, it's the organizer of the Sparta tournament!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8.3 rating on this movie? how?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this movie absolutely sucks! the whole plot, the clichés! I just do not understand how this movie got such a high rating! The movie has such a dumb storyline! I am wondering if people are giving it a high rating because of the popularity of MMA? The whole movie is just so full of unrealistic possibilities. From the AWAL Marine who becomes a hero on his way out from IRAQ,who all of a sudden becomes an MMA killer? to the moonlighting Teacher who beats down an undefeated MMA fighter? or How about the two brothers fighting each other for the finale? what are the odds of that happening? I am usually not such a hard critic but the unrealistic high rating made me post this. Please people please rate this movie correctly and not just on MMA Scenes. I would never watch this movie again! I think people should re rate this movie once they clearly see how boring and unrealistic this movie is!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay so I'm also one of those people who "only registered to comment on this movie" and I see a lot of people here being either "OMG! BEST. MOVIE. EVER." or "omg how can this even be classified as a movie.Well in my opinion this movie is worth a watch, far from the best or even one of the greater movies I've seen but it was watchable till' the end, it didn't at least feel like a 2 hour movie. What follows are my problems with the film and I think you should see the movie before continuing reading. I'm going to talk about the drama, not how this is a rocky ripoff, fight-scenes, the incredible improbability that these two guys would end up in a tournament like this etc.SPOILER LINE OF DOOM - DO NOT PROCEED Okay so I gave this film a 6 out of 10 and I don't feel it deserves anything more, and nothing less. I'm really baffled to see how so many people see this as fantastic or great drama, the only dram that i felt had any impact on me was the relationship Tommy had with his father because they actually shared scenes with each other and you really could feel Tommys' anger with his father... unlike the relationship with his brother... which is the climax of the movie.To me it feels like they just throw a lot of negative events into everyones lives and expect me to instantly feel for them and apparently it works on some people but personally i need more than bad news to care for a person. Brendan has money issues, and he's angry with his father for being a drunk and spending more time with his brother than him, Brendan has one scene where he actually talks to his father. One. You can't expect me to feel anything about this come on.Tommy. His friend dies, goes AWOL, angry with his brother for leaving, angry with his father for being a drunk and he's an ex-marine. Whoa they really just threw everything and anything into this guy to make him likable. He has one scene with his brother where he says that he's mad because Brendan left. That's it. And this is gonna be sufficient for the finale? It ain't. What, all he ever wanted was for his brother to say he loves him and that would make it all okay? I really just didn't get why they ended this film like they did, I've seen some reviews here from people claiming they cried, personally I was in an emotional what the.. statement. Oh yeah, Tommy is fighting because he made a promise to his dead friends wife that he'd take care of them, we know this from 1 scene where he made a phone call and never speak of this again. I mean... what the hell is with this movie throwing so much in it and not developing anything.The thing I think the movie got right was the relationship Tommy had with his father Paddy. Nick Nolte does a great performance and I really sympathize with him and it was emotional seeing Tommy finally forgiving him, kind of, maybe he just felt guilty I really don't know they just kind of jumped to the climax from there. Anyway it was nice seeing some closure between them.Okay first review and it got pretty long, at least I feel I got what I wanted out and think they should have left some parts out and developed other more and for that, it's worth a 5-6. Not the best I've seen, nor the worst, just something watchable in the middle. If this will be the best drama you have seen, like some people on this site claim it is, guess what? There's so many other movies for you to watch than this one, better ones.</fullReview>

It is impossible for an amateur and an old fighter to win this competition. I was expecting a much realistic scenario in which the characters should be responsible for they decisions. It is another thing to give us a happy ending and another to give us a fairy tale.

All this film needs is a girlfriend recovering from heroin addiction, and the pathos of that, and her illegitimate child who needs an operation no one can afford.... The hero will go in the proving ground and battle for the blah blah blah.The women ogle pectoral definition and the men clench their fists and swing their shoulders. Really, this film just rehashes all those old 1970s buttons and levers to try to make us root for the fighter and his noble cause. There's nothing new here and in a year or so it will have slipped from the top 250 to a more reasonable middle-of-the-pack seat on the list.Most sports movies have a set pattern to some extent and almost invariably involve an underdog, a villain, and a subplot of some family issue. We expect it and it's the variations on these themes that make or break a movie. This is all cliché stapled to a newish sport.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is not that Warrior is not a good film;in fact, from a point on it grabs you in continuous commitment with your heart pumping fast and helplessly.The truth is that at the start it looks like it wants to be something more than another fighting movie, with the roles of Nolte and Hardy, and the reading of Mobby Dick, some kind of elegy.And it could succeed at it, as the Hardy character-in one of Hardy's best performances-is built masterfully;yet, the other characters of the film gradually become banal, and whats worst-please do not read further if you have not seen the movie-at the end there is the most conservative choice one could imagine, as the winner is the family man who fights in order to pay for the home of his family, whereas the heroic-and anti heroic-veteran, looses everything.One could argue that the end is about reconciliation and the return to the unity of the family;in my opinion, it is a total fiasco that let me down and made me really angry. There should be some other way to discourage violence without letting down the most interesting character of the movie.His defeat is the failure of the film to be anything more than a family fighting movie to watch at home.Yet, for Hardy alone, I would very much like to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will start off by saying that I am by no means a fan of MMA or any fighting sport for that matter but this film is outstanding, its about so much more than just fighting. This is about disjointed family who have not seen each other for years, they all have past or present problems that they need to put behind them and to forgive each other and move on.We see a lot of character development in the first hour or so which allows us to root for them as we get to the fighting stage, we know how much it means to them and therefore we care. It really is such an emotional ride.Excellent acting throughout especially from Tom Hardy who is absolutely incredible. My only fault with the film is that I would have liked an extra 5/10 minutes at the end of the film to see what happened to the characters after the final fight. But overall and excellent film.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old Genre / New Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>www.eattheblinds.comThe sports genre has become as much of a cliché as the many clichés it has spawned: Rocky's Theme, Eye of the Tiger, etc. At this stage of the game, breathing new life into this old genre and sucking in an audience while surprising them along the way, is next to a near impossible feat. Somehow, writer/director Gavin O'Connor has pulled it off with the MMA masterpiece Warrior. Despite its complete checklist of boxing film / sports movie clichés, Warrior reaches so far beyond these clichés it practically redefines them. While respectful to reference (the original) Rocky, O'Connor legitimizes Warrior as a serious film, crafting it with visual and thematic nods to Michael Cimino's grand epic The Deer Hunter. Simply put, this isn't a sports film for meatheads (not that it won't please them), this is a sports film for audiences hungry for stark cinematic realism.Burgeoning superstar Tom Hardy (once again) mesmerizes as the tortured lead Tommy Conlon, who -- along with Nick Nolte and Joel Edgerton -- make up a three headed beast with lethal acting chops. For a film I expected to detest, Warrior proved itself to be as big of an underdog champion as the unorthodox heroes it portrays.</fullReview>

Really, I think this film is in top 10, no top 5, worst sport-drama movies in last decade. Do not waste your time. Do not waste your time and money on this film. It is absolute mystery how Warrior reached 8.3 on IMDb. It should be in best case 5, so that people know that they cannot expect any intellectual challenge. So, I guess this is a movie for Ultimate fight fans, because that is the only that it can offer, fight scenes (pumped and not realistic). And believe, this has nothing with a fact that I am a female. I watched Warrior with my brother and husband, both of them shared my opinion. Nothing new, full of stereotypes. OK, I will admit one bright spot. Hotel scene with drunk Nick Nolte character and Tom Hardy character is 3 bright minutes in 140 min of nothing.</fullReview>

But how come not single person mentioning this here?! All you Hollywood junkies...get out there and watch some real deal before calling THIS the best boxing movie ever..... Tom Hardy was good...nick was awesome....but the movie was very slow at times and kind of predictable since the very beginning...it was a movie about throwing punches that lacks the PUNCH itself....on the other hand, two rookies suddenly starting to beat up world's top ranked MMA fighters is just too much to digest, and kind of an insult to the sport itself! and i'm not even talking about the plot- holes...watch "Crying Fist"instead and you'll see how characters can be built.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warrior is on a Warpath! What an awesome movie! It was a knockout!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This amazing family drama movie from 2011 made megastars out of then-unknown actors, Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy. Both really put great performances in and out of the ring. Both really took a beaten, to make the cage fighting seem real. Edgerton suffer from a torn MCL, while Tom Hardy suffered a broken toe, broken ribs, and a broken finger. It takes a lot of guts just to do that. Not only does Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy, make very brutality and believable gritty fights, but I love how both were able to touch the heart-strings as well. The intensity from both of them, made this movie, very entertaining. Directed by Gavin O'Connor, the movie tells the stories of two estranged brothers, Troubled Iraq vet, Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) &amp; unemployed and indebt teacher, Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) who enter a Mixed Martial Arts tournament to compete with each other, for their own good moral reasons. Who is going to win? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I love the fact, that the movie doesn't make, a bad seed out of Tommy or Brendan. Both characters have their faults, and their good side. However, I do believe that their one-dimensional fighting styles, don't really match up with their personality. Don't get me wrong, it's cool to see, Tom Hardy all buff out and knocking people out, with his striking ability, but it makes little to no sense in the context of the character's history. After all, wasn't this man once a former wrestling prodigy? Wouldn't he be, doing more takes down, and arm holds than his brother, Brendan!? I don't get it! Another problem with the film is the huge gaps in logic within the story structure. A good example is how Tommy even got back to the US, if he supposedly went AWOL in Iraq. You would think, that wouldn't be easy. Another problem with the film is how the film, has no epilogue, so we never see the repercussions of Tommy's desertion nor find out what becomes of the family he promised to support. What happen to them!? Brendan's story arch isn't any better. Brendan being forced into fighting by economic reasons, to supplement his income is bit of a joke. It doesn't make any sense, since most amateur fighters make little to no money at all. Most of them, pursuit this dangerous career, because it's their dream job. Brendan had no reason to go back into fighting; after all, he was a physic teacher! Colleges would pay, good money for his teaching ability. Brendan's main flaw is his pride. His absolute refusal to file for bankruptcy or move to a smaller house, even though his wife, Tess (Jennifer Morrison) would rather take that option than watch him risk his life in the ring is be too selfish than inspiring to watch. I know, that Brendan Conlon was based off, real-life math teacher turn UFC fighter, Rich Franklin, but unlike Brendan in the film, Franklin went from teaching math to fighting, because his love for the sport, not economic reason. In my opinion, it would make more sense that Brendan went back into fighting, because that's what he wanted to do; not because he had to. Another thing that seem a bit illogically in the film is how both men whom seem, a bit amateurism in their fighting records, were able to get into the Sparta winner-takes-all competition at all. You would think, that a high-profile, winner-takes-all competition with a $5 million purse would be fill with more season trained fighters than amateur fighters. The mixer of amateurs with mostly unsanctioned fighting records with pro-fighters seem a bit too jarring to be taken seriously. It's like if Daniel LaRusso from 1984's Karate Kid was against Martial Arts Master, Bruce Lee. It's kinda unbelievable to see that ever happening in real life. Although the competition action sequences takes itself pretty realistically; there were too many terrible calls from the ref and judges to make any the fights in this film, seem 100% realistic in real fighting accuracy. I give the movie, more like 75% in that. Still, the idea that a MMA sport event is a brutal blood sport where competitors are able to continue to fight with a broken arm is also a highly doubtful probability. I know that it was played up for dramatic effect, but in reality, getting your arm broken would result in an immediate stoppage, no matter how much you want to continue fighting. While, I have to say, the performances in the ring were really great, despite some flaws, I have to say, that the performances out of the ring, were a little better. Most of the best parts in the film, are the interactions between the family members. The movie deals with some weighty mature content that most people might find, a little too uneasily, to watch. The conflicted relationship between fathers and sons, the estrangement of brothers, PTSD, alcoholism, inferiority, abandonment issues and family debts are all melodrama clichés used at its best. Nick Nolte as the boys' father, Paddy, a retired, recovering alcoholic boxer is outstanding. I was really glad, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, for this role, that year. His recovery and his will to redeem himself, made for a very inspiring side story. Another great part of this film is the soundtrack by Mark Isham. The track 'Listening to the Beethoven', is amazing. Not only that, but the music that came along with it, such as the band, the Natural's song 'About Today" was gripping to hear. Overall: This underdog emotional fighting story was a major hit for me. Tons of manly tears from me. A great inspiring punch, to knock some sense in you, if you're feeling out of the fight. A must-watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense and inspirational - a real winner of a sports drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I've probably mentioned before in the handful of reviews I've done for sports movies, I'm not the biggest fan of sports or sports movies in general. Still, I know a good film when I see one and WARRIOR is more than that: it's excellent. Befitting a film that deals with MMA and despite the PG-13 rating, it doesn't pull its punches physically or emotionally. This is probably one of the most intense movies I've seen from a visceral standpoint and on an emotional level. Without getting into too many specifics, the story is about two brothers who have been separated and on the outs for quite a long time. Due to personal circumstances, they both (inadvertently) enter the same MMA tournament and deal with relationship issues that have gone long unaddressed. The two leads, Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton, both do an awesome job with the dramatic material while also bringing a believable physicality to their fight scenes. Although they are filmed and edited in a rather chaotic style, I thought that it worked here even if it came with the slight loss of comprehensibility. For the most part, however, you get to see all of the punches, throws and takedowns from a variety of perspectives. Also lending some dramatic heft to the film was veteran actor Nick Nolte, who plays the brothers' father, also on bad terms with his sons for a variety of reasons. He was as fleshed out as were the two siblings and even gets a couple moments that seemed Oscar-worthy. In general, this wasn't some mindless story with a bunch of fight scenes strung together. Every fight had a purpose for the overall story, and there was plenty of back story for each main character to get you fully invested. So much so, that by the time the end comes around you don't know who to root for because they both have such strong motivations. It's like the Sophie's Choice of fight films. My only complaint, which is minor at best, is that once it does come around to the conclusion it lays on the melodrama a bit thick, and the final moment in the ring which was backed by an acoustic song had me rolling my eyes a little bit. Still, this was a powerful drama with incredibly brutal fight scenes that actually meant something. Even if you don't normally go for sports movies, this is one of the few that transcends that genre's limitations and manages to be inspirational without pandering. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

Both sons have their own reason to fight, and they both want to win with all costs seized.Tommy, despite his hate towards his father, needs him train himself and the real father/son drama starts just after. And the drama triples in the ring, when two brothers become rivals. By the way, for the role-play, Tommy and Dad were just remarkable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Must Watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warrior is by far one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. Not only because it contains martial arts, but it contains something I find way more important; A well developed story. The character's in this movie gets a really nice introducing meanwhile you are watching the movie. Making it way easier for you as a viewer to put yourself in their position to get more attached to the movie. This left me crying after watching until the end, the amazing filming and editing in the fight scenes and the music playing makes it even more intense when dramatics scenes get played as well.Give it a try, you have nothing to lose, only a lot to win. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies I've seen in a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not even an MMA fan but I was totally engrossed in this and even moved to tears more than once. Heartbreaking and compelling, I guess you could say the story is also somewhat predictable (we've seen similar done in other sports themed movies before) its even far fetched, especially when it comes to the schoolteachers storyline, but the thing is, it just doesn't matter because it's such a great movie.And the acting, wow, its downright amazing. Nick Nolte's character is heartbreaking, but on that note (except for one slip up) we don't get to see him when he was a practising alcoholic either and from the state of his broken, shutdown boys you know he must have been a really, really bad man. I liked how this was left vague.Yeah his sons; Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy, so many layers to these guys especially Hardy who is captivating. He plays the youngest son who returns home and enlists the help of his remorseful (recovering) alcoholic father -and former coach- to train him for an MMA tournament awarding the biggest purse in the history of the sport. Meanwhile his older brother is on the verge of losing his house and also returns to the ring which sets the estranged brothers on a collision course for the title.The fight scenes are gripping and intense and had me peeking through my fingers "arm bar for the tap out." In the end, I mean you do want the brothers to come together and face off in the ring but jeez... that final round rips your heart out. A big hit and instant classic for me. 10/10/14</fullReview>

It's just a sadly weak infusion, it doesn't keep you on the tip of your chair, instead you fight you're own battle against the boredom that's kicking in...better sleep it off and hope you will quickly forget what you just saw.

		<fullReview>Last night, my friends and I got together to watch a movie. We chose "Warrior 2011" because of its high IMDb rating. Was that a mistake? Absolutely YES!GOD! You cannot believe how boring a movie can be. A typical rocky-style story. Everyone can guess what will happen, from the beginning to the end. Watching the movie, we were looking forward something to put the story out of its misery, maybe a better acting or at least a different ending. Surprisingly, nothing special happened! Only a miracle could save the movie. What a waste of time. Did we feel amused? NO! Did we learned something new? NO! Do we recommend it to others? NO! I don't know how it could gain such a high rating.Whatever you do, stay away from "Warrior"!</fullReview>

The second half is a brilliant well shot action packed fighting film. All performances in this film are outstanding. I had a tear in my eye at the end. Every scene is well acted and the fighting scenes are realistic and superbly performed. I would recommend this film to anyone, not just action or Tom hardy fans! There is a good story line and is not just about gratuitous violence. The fight scenes are gritty but not too bloody for the faint hearted! A must see for any keen movie watcher !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adding to the List of "Great Fighting Movies" is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warrior is directed by Gavin O'Connor and is the story of two brothers (Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton) that come from a disconnected background, and became MMA fighters. Their father (Nick Nolte) is a former alcoholic that is trying to get back in touch with his sons, but is seeming to fail. The two brothers both enter the same fighting arena, and must both learn once again how to be fighters, and, more importantly, brothers.Being a Tom Hardy fanboy, I was pumped for Warrior. I also love Nick Nolte, and respect Joel Edgerton as an actor as well, so this movie had me hooked. I thought the movie was going to be great, and I was right. Warrior is a great movie all around, with great action, and a lot of heart to it, to the point of tears. Warrior also features some great acting, from all three actors mentioned above, and more.In fact, the acting is the best thing about Warrior. Tom Hardy plays an amazing young man who doesn't like people, and just needs an output for his anger, which is mixed martial arts. Joel Edgerton also does really good. His character, Brendan, is a thirty- something year old that is in a bit of an unstable situation with his home and family. He plays this character very nicely, and adds a lot to this film. Nolte delivers yet another great performance, and plays this done-with-alcohol old man near perfectly. His chemistry with the actors that play his sons is what really carries this movie, and the acting is great.The direction, particularly during the fights, is great. O'Connor is pretty nice with the camera, and films all of the action smoothly. Rather than a shaky cam orgy, all of the cuts are paced well, and the camera near to never shakes. The script, also by Gavin O'Connor, is great. His combined skills with the camera and the pen add for some very heartfelt and tension packed scenes between the two men and their father.The only problem I had with Warrior was the back and forth element in the first hour or so. To summarize, the first hour or so is more intent on explaining the backstory between the disrupted family, and also focuses on getting all three of the main characters to the MMA tournament. Within this time period, the story will show part of Tommy's (Hardy's) life, and then some of Brendan's (Edgerton's). For this time, Tommy is being trained by his father, so those two characters are together, but the story bouncing back and forth between the two brothers is a bit distracting. Right when one side sucks in the viewer, the other takes over the film, and pulls you right out of the experience. Luckily, after the first hour or so, this stopped, and the rest of Warrior flowed evenly.In conclusion, Warrior is an amazing movie. With the combined acting, camera work, and tear inducing story, Warrior is another movie to add on the list of "great fighting movies," along with other giants, such as Rocky (1976).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warrior: A Knock Out or Knocked Out?What is arguably the best sports film made to this date, may possibly go down as one of the most underrated movies in film history. Gavin O'Connor's unrealistic yet attention grabbing film, Warrior is an action packed, drama-filled, and heartwarming story. This film - often being compared to the 2010 picture The Fighter directed by David O. Russel - throws a KO punch to the film cited above. Somebody tell Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale to watch their backs, because we have two new fighters in the film industry, and they're itching for a victory.Tommy Riordan (Tom Hardy) and Brendan Conlan (Joel Edgerton) are two brothers with two very different lifestyles. Tommy is an AWOL soldier with anger in his eyes and little concern for others; Brendan is a UFC retiree who continues his life as an average high school Physics teacher. The predictably written script is a game changer for a lot of viewers, yet others seem to find that it's what makes the film so great. Generally in sports movies you always know the outcome. They give you one side to root for, one team to cheer for, or one player to watch grow. Although predictable, Warrior is special in its own way, giving you the option to choose who you want to root for. Tommy and Brendan both have reasons to be fighting in the Sparta competition. however as the movie progresses, you will be sure to figure out the outcome,But hold on to the Octagon, because there is more than just fighting in this 140 minute long film. With two brothers separated by a life impacting decision that meet up in a championship fight, how could there not be more? With the screenplay by co-writers Gavin O'Connor, the director himself, Cliff Dorfman, and Anthony Tambakis, it does seem that even with three minds, they couldn't come up with more originality for their production. But due to their lack of creative talent, we are able to more closely relate to the story and understand easily how the characters would be feeling in their situations.If you think you know action filled drama films, then you must know that great acting is necessary. Tom Hardy and Nick Nolte (Paddy) both do an exceptional job. Nolte was nominated for 12 awards -including an Oscar- for best supporting actor in his role as a recovering alcoholic father; and Hardy was nominated 4 times for best actor in a motion picture. The movie was well made, even the music by Mark Isham. The music playing in the last fight scene does a great job in portraying the love and relationship that the two brothers grow to develop once again. His use of the historical composer Ludwig Van Beethoven helped make the anticipation of Brendan's improvement in his ability to fight much more exciting.Hey, wouldn't one think anything that has to do with violence wouldn't make someone cry out of heartwarming sentimentality? The brilliant plot throws together the two brothers' stories like when a chef whips up a double chocolate cake. All we do is wait in anticipation for when we can have just a taste of the final product. Not only does it make you grow to love the Conlan brothers, it makes it hard for you to choose a side when it all comes to it. This chocolate cake of a movie will have you trapped in the plot.The not-so-believable movie plot had a great surprise ending that caught most of the audience off guard. Tommy and Brendan were able to form that bond that they once had as children. A family had become a family once more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrealistic, overrated, still an enjoyable film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Warrior" is a decent sports drama that for some reason gets a massive amount of undeserved credit for things it actually fails at. And seeing how it's getting 9 and 10 out of 10 left and right, I feel like I need to show a different point of view. Since we're all taught to state the positive things first when reviewing something I'd like to start out saying that the acting is done quite fantastic. Nick Nolte more than deserved his academy award nomination, but the main cast in general does a great job, with Tom Hardy being my personal favorite. While the backstory of the family trio of a father and his two estranged sons is pretty thin in my opinion, the film manages to grip you and affect you emotionally and the cast is obviously the main reason for that. Also, the pacing is done very well and the 140 minutes feel quite short lived. It always feels like there is something important going on and the scenes aren't just adding up or stretching out for no specific reason. The cinematography and general look of the picture are both done well and to conclude let me say that all in all this is a good manufactured and very well acted film up to this point.BUT THEN there are its flaws and trust me when I say that they are pretty enormous. I can't understand how they are so badly overlooked by other reviewers, especially if you know anything about MMA at all.I have to start by saying that I really thought the film was great until they really got into the fighting scenes. The first ones at the beginning were too quick to really judge the quality of the MMA presentation, but when they got into the tournament that takes up the most time in the second half, it brought my mood down significantly. The fights are, at least at some point, outright ridiculous. It's mind-boggling to me how they portrayed a "realistic" MMA fight here, especially, or unfortunately, with me being a huge fan of the sport. With the amount of spectacular throws, knockout and submission finishes, not to mention the takedowns (christ, the takedowns!), the fights have more in common with a professional wrestling match than they have with MMA bouts. Ridiculous! I don't want to spoil the matches, but let me just strengthen my argument with mentioning that Kurt Angle's character even outright powerbombs (!) a guy in his first fight. In fact, since I'm also an avid fan of pro wrestling, I have seen shoot fights which were only faking an MMA bout that gave us a more realistic MMA fight than "Warrior". What annoyed me the most about the fights were the unrealistic amount of punishment taken by the competitors. In any MMA promotion around the world several fights would have been stopped way earlier and seeing how someone competes in a fight with a separated shoulder or gets taken down and beaten at for minutes until the round ends is just complete BS. To me, it makes the sport look bad, because it shows clichés that MMA had to fight against for years and still hasn't completely defeated to this day. But in "Warrior", you can say that MMA is portrayed as the same brutal no rules cage fight nightmare cliché that it hasn't been since the late 90s all over again. You can see that this really upset me. But then again, I can see if you don't recognize the mentioned problems or if you just don't bother. I also see that you need to exaggerate a little bit to keep it interesting for the average viewer and it probably shouldn't impact my scoring as much, because the fighting of both brothers is supposed to be a metaphor rather than the focal point of the film's intention. Still, if you already had UFC fighter Anthony Johnson as a minor part of the cast, couldn't you just have asked him for some quick advice for how you could present the fight he's in a little bit more realistic? Aside from that, I also have problems with the generic backstory and the lack of proper explanation. Although the film already takes up so much time, I still feel that they should have gone into detail a little bit more, especially concerning what really led to the twist between the brothers and why Joel Edgerton's character is where he is now. It's hard to go into detail without spoiling, so I won't go into it any further. Let's just say that the backstory is pretty generic and makes it harder to feel for the characters since you don't really know why they have the problems with each other they are mainly dealing with. So at the end of my review let me say that despite all the negative I would still call "Warrior" a pretty good film. It's horrifyingly overrated and I have no idea how you can give this a 9 or even 10 out of 10, so let me recommend you to not listen to the ones praising this as an all time great. It's a good sports drama that in some parts lacks story substance and especially realism of its sports portrayal, but if you're not an MMA fan you won't be bothered. All in all I would recommend it, but I don't have to see it again and it would rate it 6.5 out of 10. And since IMDb only rates in full points, it's more a 6 than a 7 for me, so there you go, I liked it more than my rating might say.I hope you enjoyed my review, please blame my German heritage for grammar mistakes. Goodbye and Auf Wiedersehen, your konbri :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fight movie that has heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warrior begins when Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte) comes home to find his long lost son Tommy (Tom Hardy) in front of his door. Paddy doesn't have anybody in his life because he was an alcoholic. Tommy doesn't understand his fathers path and he doesn't care, he only wants to fight.Then there is Paddy's other son Brendan (Joel Edgerton), who is a school teacher and will do anything for his wife and two daughters, even fight for his life. Brendan has also no interest in his fathers life. This is the start of the movie and it's a simple story with simple characters.It's funny when you have looked so many movies in your life and then this movie comes in front of you. The way that the movie tells you the chemistry with the characters is beautiful. Gavin O'Connor has made a movie about family with violence in it, but when you look at the movie the violence doesen't matter. The violence doesn't have a place in the movie. It's pure drama, with a family which doesn't work.Warrior is a movie for viewers who looks movies with heart. These movies a very rare and aren't for anybody. You will have to look at some scenes that aren't enjoyable, but in the end you will think about the movie and realize that the movie has it's heart in the right place.</fullReview>

Just like almost everybody else, it had tears trickling down my face on a couple of occasions and a roller-coaster of emotions in other scenes. It's simply a master piece of story telling through the acting and directing. You get so emotionally involved and absorbed by the characters and feel like you've been in their shoes when i haven't ever really. This is the mark of a great movie.Other movies have greatly entertained me but very few have had me care so much about the story on screen and the characters.

		<shortDescription>A gripping sports movie with great emotional power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sports genre isn't exactly the best genre around. There are some classics like Rocky and Raging Bull but most modern ones seem to have the same problems. They reuse the same clichés, they barely feel original at all, and most of them are predictable from the very start. But every now and then, a good sports movie comes out. Million Dollar Baby was an inspirational movie with a shocking and heartbreaking finale and 42 was well-acted, well-written, and pretty original in terms of clichés. Then there's Warrior.After ex-marine Tommy Conlon returns home, his father trains him to enlist for SPARTA, the biggest wrestling event in martial arts history. But he finds out that he has to go up against his brother.This movie contains a simple plot which may not seem too impressive but the way its emotional power moves you is how impressive it is. Both brothers are damaged in their own way and we witness how they cope with their problems throughout the movie. At the end, they finally confront and face off in an unforgettable climax which will blow you away.This movie is made better by its terrific acting. Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy both give terrific performances. Their performances are emotionally powerful and they engage the viewer to the movie's plot. Hardy may be known for playing Bane but he plays his performance in this movie much better. It's a shame that this isn't the movie which got him famous.As for the music, the score is really nothing special as it consists mostly of tunes we've already heard of but the soundtrack is the shining part to it. It contains a huge range of note and chords and it perfectly sets the mood for certain scenes. Some scenes like the ending wouldn't be as good without its soundtrack.As much as I'd like to call this movie a masterpiece, there is only one thing I didn't like about it. I didn't really feel that the military aspect was necessary for 1 reason. It wasn't really necessary for a sports movie given what was going on in it. It felt kind of out of place and it could've been left out. It served kind of as a distraction from the main plot also.So in conclusion, this is an amazing sports movie which shows that while the sports genre isn't as amazing as it once was, it's not completely long gone. This is an amazing movie. It could've been a masterpiece without the military aspect but it's still definitely worth a watch because of how well-written it is.</fullReview>

A former wrestling prodigy, Tommy blazes a path toward the championship while his brother, Brendan (Edgerton), an ex-fighter-turned teacher, returns to the ring in a desperate bid to save his family from financial ruin. But when Brendan's unlikely, underdog rise sets him on a collision course with the unstoppable Tommy, the two brothers must finally confront each other and the forces that pulled them apart, facing off in the most soaring, soul stirring, and unforgettable climax that must be seen to be believed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a 40-something movie addict, I've been waiting the best part of my life to watch a fight film that could trade blows with what I considered to be the best of them, that being Rocky - the first one that is, don't get me started on the rest.To be totally honest, I didn't expect to find a challenger in Warrior - I hadn't even heard of it until a few days ago and despite the high praise it has received here at IMDb, I was still extremely cynical. The benchmark set in Rocky is so high, that every other fight film I sit down to watch is almost doomed before I press play, and invariably they fall down.Finally I can say that there is a new champion, and Warrior is it. I won't go into lengthy detail, suffice to say it has everything that Rocky has but just that little bit more on each and every level. Emotionally, technically and acting wise Warrior does not relent, and the 2hr 20m runtime literally flies by, leaving the viewer completely shell-shocked, exhausted and begging for another hour - the mark of a true gem.A genuine tour-de-force that will have you screaming at the screen, the hair standing on the back of your neck and your pulse racing - regardless of whether or not you like sports films. I'll be watching this again, back-to-back with the newly deposed Rocky very soon - and you should too.The king is dead - long live the Warrior. 9.1 / 10</fullReview>

Tom Hardy got a lot of recognition for this, but Nick Nolte and our other main character are as good in this. We have two people who will engage each other, having a common issue. It's not a spoiler to write it, you'll find out soon enough (or guess it), but I'll let you do that for yourself.We established this is very nicely acted, but it's the story that matters. The past that is still haunting the present and holds some people down, so they're not able to continue to explore the "future". Shackles can be metaphorical too. And in this case it seems almost impossible to get rid of them. A drama that also has some fine action scenes in it ... More than worth a look</fullReview>

The most brilliant thing about this movie was the amount of emotion it was able to convey with the simplest of actions. Tommy lying with his drunk dad. A nod that Paddy gives to Brendan.

		<fullReview>Warrior depicted a great view on the every day lives of two brothers. The fact that they were both raised in a bad environment together really adds to the emotional feeling while i watched this movie. Brendan a man in his early forty's interpreted a struggling man with financial problems with a family to worry about. Tommy, the youngest brother, went A-Wall in the military and has been hiding out in his home town. Tommy had promised a friend that if anything happened to him, Tommy would take care of his friends family. With each brother having a need for a big pay day, the Sparta Tournament drew the brothers together. Their father, a former drunk, tries desperately to communicate with Brendan. Brendan wants nothing to do with the old man due to problems in the past. The boy's father ends up training Tommy for the Sparta Tourney. Both determined to win the tournament, the brothers end up in the finals, fighting each other for the prize money. The emotional spectrum of this event just overwhelms any person/persons watching this movie. Brendan desperately tries to get Tommy to tap out, but Tommy pushes on, determined to win. Brendan puts both of Tommy's arms out of their socket. After crippling his brother, Brendan finally becomes victorious...leading his brother out of the cage....even though Tommy is to be taken into custody by military personnel. The overall feeling that the brothers are finally back together after years of fighting and not talking..it is just outstanding!!! This movie shoots over my expectations for a MMA movie!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful cinematic experience!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not being a huge fan of mixed martial art movies I was not too interested in seeing this movie. There is really only one reason I went and saw it, Tom Hardy. Since his amazing performance in Bronson in 2008 he has been on my radar and I was interested in seeing more of him. Warrior turned out to be a sports that I was surprised by and thoroughly enjoyed.The movie itself sees ex-marine Tommy Riordan (Tom Hardy), return to his hometown of Pittsburgh and enlist his father (Nick Nolte), a recovering alcoholic to train him for an worldwide MMA tournament 'Sparta'. As Tommy blazes a violent path towards the title prize, his brother, Brendan (Joel Edgerton), a former MMA fighter unable to make ends meet as a school teacher returns to the ring to provide for his family. The two brothers eventually collide in the final of the tournament and battle out who will be the winner.The acting from the three main performers were outstanding. Nick Nolte stars as a supporting actor, but through his emotions and style of acting steals every scene that he is present in. Both Hardy and Edgerton have bulked up for their roles, and they portray emotional characters that you do not usually see them present, which was an unusual surprise. The film has two protagonists, and with both getting equal screen time the viewers are able to chose in who they want to win. Structurally the film offers a similar path to 'The Fighter' released in 2009, however the twist from this is that the two brothers end up fighting each other and for the same prize. The film is building up and up to the tournament, but the film is greatly drawn on the journey, as so the destination.The greatness of Warrior doesn't stop here, the soundtrack to the movie, by Mark Isham proves to be quite fitting and it suites the films action style; With included tracks by The Nationals the films ending is built up well and allows you to leave you the cinema knowing that you have just seen a good film. The actual fights of the movie, in the Sparta tournaments was the highlight of the film. They were shot with such direction that you feel in the middle of the action, you feel for the characters, you feel part of the crowd, and it makes you want to cheer with them. There is no sight of those silly camera angles and quick shots to hid the actual fighting and make it look real, the technique used shows all and does it expertly. This film contains a blend of action, emotion and fighting, which is a full package for an enjoyable movie. You will be grabbed by the very first scene to the ending of the movie. Don't miss a chance to see Warrior! .. it stands at the top of the fighting movies among the ranks of Rocky.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Fight Movie You'll Ever See... I Doubt It.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've given the movie 8-stars because it is top quality entertainment, no doubt about that, but I do have a few minor criticisms.A movie should never sow doubts of credibility in your mind. When this happens you lose the illusion that you're there, that it's really happening, the immersion factor, which is what happened to me.I'm not a huge fan of MMA or UFC simply because I don't have regular access to it, but I do watch three or four fights from time to time. So where was the blood? Sometimes there can be pools of the stuff. My biggest criticism though was the three arm lock victories IN A ROW. Do you think it's easy to win by an arm lock tap-out victory? Sure, one quick punch, or flurry of punches can end a fight quickly, but not three arm locks against three different opponents. Also, the final, where Conlan (the arm lock expert) breaks his brother's arm to effectively win the tournament, was a little too much one trick pony for me. OK, it's perfectly feasible to win an MMA fight with an arm lock tap-out, but that third victory was the spell-breaking moment of the film.Normally when I'm thrown out of my believability zone so heavily, I downgrade my review to a six or seven, but up until then this was 9.5 material. I'm disappointed because this could have become a repeat watching experience, growing in stature each time, instead of being a good film, worth the entry fee, but ultimately flawed.With heavy heart, this film sinks into the pack of decent fight films, but nothing more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you seek the movie that leaves a lump in your throat? Do you seek a movie with emotional depth because you yearn to 'feel' something more than the mundanity of your world? Do you seek a genre-defining movie? If the answer is 'yes' to any of these questions, you've found that movie. This isn't Rocky, although I understand comparisons because it's a 'fighting movie' firmly rooted in drama. It's better than Rocky. Much better. Don;t be fooled, this isn't a film about fighting in a physical sense. It's a film about fighting in the spiritual sense. Two brothers provide the core of something very special. Just watch it.

They play brothers in a broken down family. They get into the world of Mixed Maritial Arts, and end up facing each other.The action is good. The fighting is fine. But it's the acting and the brotherhood/family dysfunction that is the real stand out.

		<shortDescription>Great surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The script is very solid, and the implacable articulation of the different elements of the story is totally captivating.What's important in that plot isn't so much the tournament itself which is more of a support, nor the final outcome which becomes quickly predictable, but rather the path to get to it and the background of this torn apart family.The MMA universe has been well transcribed and for the fans, there are a few well-known faces such as Anthony Johnson or the referee Josh Rosenthal. However, Gavin O'Connor relied on a few easy and not very realistic points: for example, the tournament format (2 fights/day over 2 days) would have been more credible 20 years ago because you don't see that type of event anymore these days; or the fact that the intensity of the fights and the use of certain techniques were exaggerated. Yet, the intention is laudable because this was to dynamize the script, but it had to be said.As for the direction, it is very good, dynamic and powerful, whether for the fights or more dramatic scenes.And what about the Edgerton-Hardy-Nolte trio, who was spot-on and excellent from end to end.Truly a great surprise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is good, but I must admit that I am very disappointed with the course of this movie.I don't care for happy end,I really get upset when i saw that the teacher who wasn't fought for several years win this competition.When opponents hits him,it is like they hitting a rock.When Tommy Conlon and Koba(professional fighter) fight with other opponents they falls after only one punch,but when they fight with the Brendan Conlon they punched him a hundred times in the head,but he looks like he is just got up,and ready for work.It is impossible to down him.Maybe if they had drown some bulldozer in the cage they would have knocked him down,but I doubt.Common men,give me some reality here.I'm really start to thinking to train boxing next two months and challenge Klitschko,it is a very ''real'' for me to win that match.I just want reality in some parts.Only for that I gave this movie a lousy mark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit this film, Warrior by Gavin O'Connor (2011), caught me off-guard. My expectations for it wasn't that high, and I just assumed this would be another run of the mill action flick that would only be entertaining at best. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of emotional weight that became present in the opening scenes and then persisted throughout the remainder of the film. As the story began to unfolded I realized that the Mixed Martial Arts element would only serve as a common interest of the characters and not what the story was all about. The real drama in Warrior revolves around a family torn apart by abuse and alcoholism. Tommy Riordan (Tom Hardy) was a troubled ex- Marine that comes home to Pittsburg to train for a mma tournament, after leaving many years earlier with his mother to escape the abuses of his alcoholic father Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte). Tommy asks father, Paddy, to be his trainer, but makes it clear that training was the only thing his father was ever good at, and being home had no sentiment. Meanwhile Tommy's brother Brendon Conlon (Joel Edgerton) also begins to train for the mma tournament as a means to provide for his family. Brendon and Tommy, however, had not seen one another since Tommy left years earlier and would not meet again until the tournament.If there was a single word that could sum up the theme of Warrior, it would be "struggle." The performances of Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton, and Nick Nolte were all Oscar worthy and as the movie progresses the viewer will learn about the struggles each member of this family. There is so much pain to be felt from each of these characters that I would become torn, feeling deep sympathy for Tommy, Brendon, and even their father Paddy. During the tournament it became increasingly difficult to choose a favorite as I wanted Tommy and Brendon both to win.My overall opinion of this film is that it is a must see, even if you are not a mma fan. Although the fighting scenes were excellent, the amount emotion in this film is what is unforgettable. I think that the amount of passion in Warrior is unmatched by any film that I can remember watching recently and it has the ability to bring tears to even the most hardened souls. This movie is very powerful and is one of my favorites, some might say that it is similar to the original Rocky movie, but I think it goes well beyond what Rocky accomplished, in that, all aspects of this film is well done. Warrior has a very real feel to it and connects very well with its audience. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm just going to put spoiler just to be safe because I hate it when anything is given away in movies..I'm just going to start off this review with the best part of the movie and the acting was pretty damn good. The music.Whoever did the music for this movie is a true genius. My face was completely glued to the TV screen and the music just made my heart beat much faster. Especially during the tournament, every fight that the brothers were in felt as if they were saving the world. My body was shaking because of that movie and I felt so compelled to the screen. BUT, the music isn't the only thing. I think the father and Tommy were played by the perfect actors. Especially the father. His emotions and when he gets drunk again is impressively done. Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if he wasn't acting, they just caught him while he was hammered. Tommy to me felt as if 'nothing matters anymore.' And he played that damn well. When they find out who he really is, he acts calm and not surprised. I can't say much bad about this movie only that i want 6 more of them to be made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MMA - Oh Yes!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An ex-Marine haunted by a tragic past, Tommy Riordan (Tom Hardy) returns to his hometown of Pittsburgh and enlists his father, a recovered alcoholic and his former coach, to train him for an MMA tournament awarding the biggest purse in the history of the sport. This film is about MMA. If your not a fan then hit the road. What makes it even more unique is that there is not one antagonist. It's about family, loss and the struggles of survival. Tom Hardy's Tommy is just outstanding, the level of intensity showcased is unbelievably scary and the shape of his body muscle for this role shows him as a true contender. His opposition - well his brother played by Joel Edgerton is alright but just not strong enough for Hardy, in my opinion. But estranged father Nick Nolte's performance blows the movie into another level - a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. It's high impact, entertaining, sexy and just totally my cup of tea. Bring on more MMA Movies?..(Starring Tom Hardy of course :) )</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Sports Movies Ever Made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A powerhouse of strong emotions, rousing action &amp; gut-wrenching drama, Warrior is an ingeniously crafted &amp; expertly balanced tale that bears every genre-cliché in its plot, has a predictable storyline and yet it manages to leave most of its viewers emotionally drained &amp; immensely satisfied in the end. The dark horse of its year that came out of nowhere to surprise &amp; stun almost everyone, this underrated masterpiece is in my opinion one of the greatest sports films ever made.The story concerns two estranged brothers who enter the MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) tournament &amp; covers their struggling relationship with each other as well as their father. Dealing with the themes of redemption, forgiveness &amp; indomitable will of the human spirit in a thoughtful manner, Warrior is heavy on the emotional side of the drama that makes us really care for its deftly scripted characters which in turn makes its action segments all the more intense, gripping &amp; compelling.Written &amp; directed by Gavin O'Connor, the movie is brilliantly directed with O'Connor perfectly weighing the emotional drama with brutal fight sequences both in the script &amp; its execution on the film canvas. Cinematography is another plus as it makes excellent use of camera angles, focus &amp; tracking shots to immerse us into its story while editing paces the whole film in a vigilant manner. And I've got nothing but praise for Mark Isham's remarkable score that keeps the emotions, tension &amp; excitement alive from start to finish.Coming to the performances, Warrior features a reliable cast in Joel Edgerton, Tom Hardy &amp; Nick Nolte and all three have done a fabulous job in their given roles. Although Edgerton is the most stable of the three just like his character in the film, Tom Hardy is absolutely sensational, brutal &amp; unstoppable in his role while Nick Nolte packs in with an intensely emotional performance as their father. Add to that, the MMA fight scenes are pretty accurate in its depiction, the ring-side commentary is even better &amp; the entire tournament makes us cheer like our favourite sport does in real life.Above anything else, I think the best thing about Warrior is its overall treatment &amp; the sincere manner in which it explores its themes. The first half of the story beautifully lays down the groundwork for the next half by placing significant emphasis on its characters &amp; their lives. Each characters' emotions, motivation &amp; decision has a genuine feel to it and so when it all inevitably explodes during the tournament, the knockout punch is strongly felt and in the end, it becomes all the more difficult to choose a side as we don't want either to lose.On an overall scale, Warrior should be used as a template for anyone looking to make a sports film. It takes its drama seriously, it deals with its sport segments in an authentic manner &amp; it explores its themes without stuffing it in your face. Superbly directed, deftly written, skilfully photographed, tightly edited, magnificently scored &amp; packed with vibrant performances, Warrior is one of the best films of its year, one of the prime examples of its genre &amp; one of the most rewarding cinematic payoffs in recent memory. Strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acting is phenomenal!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even if MMA is not your thing, the acting is especially good. Some have reviewed that the depth of the characters was insufficient, but the characters give enough depth to their characters played to keep the entire film gripping. Nick Nolte excels himself as a former drunk father, conflicted and looking for forgiveness. The dialogue in the living room scene between Tom Hardy and Nick Nolte was so intense and raw when he talks about running away from dad and how his mum lived with poor health with no insurance, you feel uncomfortable just listening to it!! Very touching. This is a movie you will watch time and time again, and with every viewing appreciate more and more the exceptional acting and superb directing. My only slight quibble is some lazy camera work with the fight scenes where the camera drifts onto other angles other than the fight which we all want to see, missing out on prime action. This is particularly true when Tom fights mad dog for the first time in the gym. Also a extended conclusion would of been nice to see the brothers progress to a more resolved setting with their father and each other. But by wanting more it shows how involving the film is. A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breaking through typical MMA fight movies; the real fight is outside the cage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gavin O'Connor, the director of Warrior, does a fabulous job of making a long movie feel short by grabbing the audience in early scenes while still building suspense along the story line. While other movies follow the cliché 'sport/fight movie' protocol, Warrior puts its own twist on the fighting movie stereotype with extremely powerful acting and revelations of deep inner truths and demons within the characters. Most, if not all, sports films have the same goal; to win. Warrior is no different, it is the quest for a MMA title, but that goal almost comes second hand to other such goals in the movie.Brothers Tom and Brendan Conlon (Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton) and their father, Paddy (Nick Nolte) are the main characters in this movie; where these three men act in a way that make it seem nothing less than real footage of a true event. In the movie, these men have much deeper problems than what they aspire to do in the cage. Tommy Conlon, a taciturn marine, came home to Philadelphia wanting to train and fight for a MMA tournament called Sparta. He faces the struggle to put aside his coldness and abandonment towards his father so his father can train him for the tournament. His acting couldn't have done a better job portraying the anger and subtle brokenness he feels from his childhood. The two brother's father is coming up on one thousand days sober. Across Philly, Brenden Conlon is facing life problems of similar importance. Fighting in the parking lots of strip clubs, Brenden is in desperate need of money to save his home from foreclosure, which would ultimately put him, his wife, and his daughter in an extremely unfortunate position. Being suspended from his mediocre teaching job for fighting, he pursues the victory in the Sparta tournament as the ultimate underdog.At this point in the movie, one would have to be not watching the movie to realize that Tommy and Brenden would be fighting in the final together. But the fighting aspect of this movie is much more than just fighting. It is so much more than who gets the five million prize at the end of the tournament. It's about facing demons from their childhood; redeeming and reconciling relationships. Most typical fight movies establish a good guy/ bad guy fight. Where the good guy, usually the underdog, needs to overcome and win the fight over the bad guy. Warrior is an exception from this. The two brothers are both, ultimately well rounded characters, so either outcome will most likely be a satisfying outcome. Warrior establishes an outcome where both brothers are winners, in one way or another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underwhelming fighting drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't a great film at all. The problem is that the guy who wrote and directed it, Gavin O'Connor, doesn't really have much idea of how to craft a screenplay and his final effort is unpolished; it's overlong and the pacing is off. The first hour has tons of underwhelming character drama while the last hour has too many similar-looking fights crammed into the narrative. Both elements needed to be more mixed throughout.Of course, it doesn't help that the similar THE FIGHTER came out around the same time, and was much better for it. That film was based on a true story, had more pathos and a great turn from Christian Bale to fix it. This one features Tom Hardy in full-on thug mode and the unknown Joel Edgerton, who was equally forgettable in THE THING remake. Nick Nolte is good value, yes, but only to see how his lifestyle's aged him. Neither Hardy nor Edgerton are sympathetic and I was quite uninterested in the developing storyline.This is not to say that WARRIOR is a bad film. There are a lot worse, and as a sports-fighting movie it's fairly realistic. It also builds to a decent climax, featuring a ferocious bout and an unexpectedly moving finale, it's just a shame it took so long to get there. The fights are as brutal as you can get for a PG-13 film and don't disappoint, but then I didn't expect them to. This is not a film I'd come back to, however.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an intelligent and must watch sports drama. It is very much along the lines of Rocky but with a better script in my opinion. Two estranged brothers are fighting for the title of ultimate spartan amidst the pain of a family feud. The film concentrates on their preparation and reasons for fighting whilst interweaving their family estrangement.It could have been a corny film but instead this is an excellently directed and acted drama that can be enjoyed by everyone. The acting is extremely good from all participants though I was particularly taken with the performances of Nick Nolte (not an actor I was previously fond of) and Tom Hardy as the younger brother. Both were excellent in this though good support was in rich supply with Joel Edgerton as the elder more sensible brother and Frank Grillo as his trainer also doing great jobs. This is a crowd pleasing film and you could pick holes in it but it's so well done and so enjoyable that only the churlish would complain. For me this is one of the finest of all sports drama's combining an intelligent script with great and believable action. This film is highly recommended for all ages. A true modern classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite many clichés we have come to see in sports movies, I can't help but love this movie, Warrior. I find this film to be a tad better than 2010's The Fighter, another great movie. I find it a crime that this movie was overlooked by moviegoers and the Academy. Why it did so poor at the box office is beyond me. I saw this film knowing what it was and I was rewarded with a tense sports drama that features many important themes on family and hard work.Gavin O'Connor's film is about two brothers who haven't spoken to each other in years because of family issues and they both sign up to fight in the MMA tournament. Will these brothers make up or will they be out to hurt one another. They also have to deal with their father who is a recovering alcoholic.The acting is very good in the film. Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton are great actors despite them only being B-list stars. They were really good, Edgerton more than Hardy. Nick Nolte fits the role of the alcoholic father just perfectly as we see him play another gritty role with his trademark growling.Overall, this is a very powerful film that is more about brotherhood than the fighting itself. However, the fights were perfectly executed and gleefully violent. I understand that this movie has almost every cliché that have been used in the past and is very predictable, but I find that if these clichés are executed properly, it doesn't matter. I rate this film 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To the low raters citing so called American clichés or holes in the plot as reasons to justify a weak rating...folks, it's a movie about Ultimate Fighting? What were you expecting - Shakespeare? That's like saying the English Patient was a terrible effort b/c it left you sad on the way out of the theatre! I'm not even a UFC fan and I still found this to be a great ride.This movie executes perfectly on what it's trying to be - a great sports movie. Think about the comparables - Any Given Sunday - star power that tries to distract you from the fact that they're not actually playing football or the Rocky movies that use distant camera angles to hide the fact that Sly doesn't like to get hit. This movie tells its story without slowing down. There are great characters and good writing in that there really aren't any missing links. There also some great acting beyond Nick Nolte but above all, there are great realistic action scenes. It's real on almost every level. It's hard to ask for much more given the theme - tons of entertainment value here folks.And for you disappointed people who were looking for a dramatic cinematic experience based on the failing human condition without the violence...here's a suggestion...look at the cover next time!</fullReview>

Like seriously, every one of the teacher's fights ends up the same. Gets his ass kicked for first 4 rounds. Starts bleeding and s--t. Gets some f---ing inspiration that he pulls out of his ass. And then somehow wins the f---ing fight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warrior is one of the best sports films I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor Spoilers ahead!Warrior is a fighting film, that mixes its stimulating fighting action with a engrossing story and comes out being one of the best movies of 2011.I have never been a huge Rocky fan. I watched it allot when I was little and revisited it about two years ago, but it didn't grab me. Then The Fighter came out in 2010 and I was absolutely blown away. All three of these films are about underdogs and their journeys to become the best fighter of their craft. In my opinion The Fighter is the best of the three with Warrior coming in second. I just don't find Rocking as moving or gripping as these two. With that being said, I'll continue with Warrior.Warrior is a drama, more than any other set genre. The screenplay was superb and it was only intensified by the acting. The cast was perfect all around. Tom Hardy did great as Tommy the big, hulking, silent type. He was one of the most interesting character to me. He was unpredictable and a really sympathetic and misunderstood character. Joel Edgerton played Brendan the older brother who seems to have everything put together, but we soon find out that because of a lack of finances, he decides to get back in the ring. Only ending in a suspension from his job as a teacher. Joel does a great job, but he is still not as memorable as Tom Hardy or the Academy Award Nominated performance by Nick Nolte. Nick Nolte plays the father of the two fighters. He is a recovered alcoholic who has been sober for 1000 days during the time of the film. Two of my favorite scenes in the film happened with confrontations between him and his sons. These two scenes are both nominee worthy and lets just say I teared up a few times throughout the movie.Besides the story the camera work fit the films structure. It was mostly Shoulder Mount and very up close and personal. The camera went a little crazy during the fights but I still managed to hang on and focus on everything that happened. I thought it was a wonderful choice by director writer Gavin O'Connor.Warrior is a superb cinematic experience and i loved every minute of it. It has become one of my favorite dramas in a while. Warrior is one of the best sports films I have ever seen. I give it my highest recommendation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What happens when you have two separate underdogs fight each other in a winner-take-all competition? You end up hoping neither one of them will lose. That's the situation in this thoroughly engrossing mixed martial arts film. Something I never thought I'd say after teen-filled drama Never Back Down released in 2008 that used unlicensed MMA bouts as a backdrop.Brendan Conlon (played by Joel Edgerton) is a man who gave up fighting professionally for his wife Tess (played by Jennifer Morrison) with whom he now has two daughters. Tommy Riordan (played by Tom Hardy) left home with his mother to escape his father's abuse and joined the Marines after she passed. Brendan (Edgerton) is now staring at a debt he can't overcome thanks to his mortgage and goes back to professional fighting in the form of parking lot bouts with inexperienced opponents. And when a video of one of these bouts on the internet is seen by his boss (Kevin Dunn), the principal of the high school where he teaches science, the winner-take-all event is his only hope to avoid foreclosure and relocation. Tommy (Hardy), on the other hand, made a promise to the family of a fallen comrade and intends to keep it no matter what that might mean for his competitors. That includes Brendan who is only revealed to be Tommy's brother well into the film.I'm not really a fan of MMA. I had a passing interest in boxing at one time, watching it that is, but it passed. That said, a well-made film can make any sport, with the exception of curling, seem interesting. And while some may see the release of this film as being too soon after the critically-acclaimed 2010 Mark Wahlberg film The Fighter, or as some sort of Rocky rip-off, I see a well-made, well-acted, realistic film about two men determined to fulfill their obligations the best way they know how. In the ring. Not to mention the sympathetic performances put forth by Nick Nolte as the father of the two competitors and Jennifer Morrison as the suffering wife.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Movies of 2011</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somehow I missed this movie in 2011. Recently while browsing IMDb Top 250, this movie grabbed my attention. Boy, it was something. This is one of the best movies I've seen in recent times. It holds you from start to end. The punching &amp; fighting scenes are bang on. Star-Cast for the movie has done a great job. Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton go neck to neck. Where Tom plays an angry-raging character, Joel plays the sensible family fighter. Tom has way less shots in ring as compared to Joel, but they are solid. Jennifer Morrison also justifies to her role and looks appealing &amp; attractive in the movie. For WWE fans, Kurt Angle provides some entertainment with his ring tactics.Direction &amp; Screenplay of Gavior O'Connor stands out in the movie. This surely goes as the biggest movie of his career. This movie deserves to be in Top List of All Time Boxing hits with Rocky Series, Cindrella Man, Million Dollar Baby etc.There is hardly any part of the movie which you feel like skipping and grabbing a beer. If you are watching this, make sure you have all the Beers, Cold Drinks, Nachos, Pop Corns etc. handy before the start. Trust me, you will not feel like breaking the flow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unexpectedly Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walked in the theater wanting to just see a fighting movie for entertainment and it was the cinema where only a few people went in to so i could get a good seat. And god was this film more than amazing! I couldn't see any weakness in it whatsoever as some fighting movies tend to just exaggerate the fighting scenes coupled with shallow acting. In this movie however, the acting was really really great. From Nick Nolte, Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton and even Jennifer Morrison! Nick Nolte could very well be nominated for an Oscar. That's how great the acting was. And as a guy was I surprised it made me cry. Character development is so amazing too. Everything about this film is amazing, I was wondering at the end why only a few people had watched it. Those other people don't know what they are missing. It is my first review here in IMDb since I made this account and this movie very well deserve to be rated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Instant Classic That Is More Effective Than Rocky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warrior is a sports drama that features Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton, and Nick Nolte. It tells the story of two estranged brothers entering a mixed martial arts (MMA) tournament and deals with the brothers' struggling relationship with each other and with their father. The film was directed by Gavin O'Connor.Haunted by a tragic past, ex-Marine Tommy Conlon returns home for the first time in fourteen years to enlist the help of his father to train for SPARTA, the biggest winner-takes-all event in mixed martial arts history. A former wrestling prodigy, Tommy blazes a path toward the championship while his brother, Brendan, an ex-fighter-turned teacher, returns to the ring in a desperate bid to save his family from financial ruin. But when Brendan's unlikely, underdog rise sets him on a collision course with the unstoppable Tommy, the two brothers must finally confront each other and the forces that pulled them apart, facing off in the most soaring, soul stirring, and unforgettable climax that must be seen to be believed.Warrior is one of the year's best films that has everything audiences are looking for in a sports movie experience. Visually exciting fight sequences are matched by an emotionally complex story with believable characters full of conviction.In addition to that,it is an instant classic that manages to surpass even the original Rocky in terms of effectiveness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two brothers making a name for themselves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie "Warrior" is a tale of two brothers who chose to take separate paths to escape the burden of their alcoholic father. However, both decide to take up fighting to help with their family's finances. Brendan (Joel Edgerton), a teacher, fights in strip club parking lots to make a little extra money to prevent his family from filing for bankruptcy. Tommy (Tom Hardy), Brendan's brother, is a Marine but runs away from that life after his best friend is killed in combat. When Tommy returns back home, he becomes homeless and seeks refuge at his father's house. To fulfill a promise to his fallen comrade's family, he begins fighting for money at the local gym. While the brothers train for their upcoming fights, they see an ad for a UFC tournament in which the winner takes home one million dollars. After seeing this ad, the brothers decide that they will embark on a journey to fight until the end.For the critical intention of the movie "Warrior", one may conclude that family will stick together no matter what differences may arise. For example, the characters Tommy and Brendan did not get along for majority of the storyline, yet in the end they set aside their personal differences to show that they still love and care for each other. In conclusion to this a family through all the rough times and heartbreak, a family will always love each other and always be there.I believe this movie was phenomenal. The storyline of the heartbreak and betrayal turning into forgiveness and bringing a long lost family back together once again will capture anyone's heart. The actors played an outstanding performance in the film and made me feel like I was right there with them. It will leave everyone feeling triumphant in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't with a straight face say this is a classic, nor with a beat-up (or even a drunk) face. However, it's definitely good. Earns **** out of ***** from me and I was impressed by Nolte's performance. The two brothers are fine, too, though. Acting is solid in Warrior, except for, IMO, most notably the kids and the blonde, but those are minor roles.Probably the best fighting film since Rocky (1976), but there are not that many good fighting films, I think. I mean, it used to be a guilty pleasure of me to watch some crappy fighting movies when I was a lot younger, but just for fun.Anyway, I think some shots or scenes were too shallow. It's also a bit predictable. It engaged me, though. No worries.Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotional, long, but very good sports drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who will win the fight? Bane or the guy who fought The Thing? Seriously now, the acting in this movie was way above the genre of this film. I know it was a sports fighting movie and I expected things on par with van Damme Asian tournament films. Boy, was I wrong!The first thing to note about the movie is that it is long. It spans two hours and twenty minutes. The first half sets up the characters and how their dysfunctional family got them to where they are. I expected the second half to be filled with fighting action and it was, but only half. The makers of the film realised it was more important to show the mindset and state of spirit of the characters, let them develop rather than show only fights. And so they got a beautiful film.Bottom line: for this genre, the movie is clearly amongst the best. It doesn't uselessly inspire the audience to take up fighting or hate or love one of the characters. Much better, they give us two characters to love and the decision, up to the final fight, is the viewer's: how would you like this fight to end? That question, that situation in which you get to think and choose for yourself is almost unprecedented in a sports movie and more appropriate to more philosophical high brow films and makes the end result irrelevant. Good job!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong Performances Push Familiar Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warrior (2011) *** (out of 4) At first you think WARRIOR is just going to be your typical ROCKY-style drama and for the most part it is but there's one major difference here. The story is about an older brother (Joel Edgerton) and a younger brother (Tom Hardy) both of whom are in rough spots in their lives. The older one, a school teacher, is about to lose his house and the younger brother is holding some dark secrets about his time in the war. The two begin training for a MMA tournament while their father, a former drunk (Nick Nolte) tries to reconnect with both of them. I must admit that this film really took me by surprise. Most boxing, karate or other type of fighting movies usually deliver a good guy you root for a bad guy who you want to see destroyed. That's not the case here because when the final fight comes you want to see both men win and it's hard to pick which one you want to see standing at the end. I thought the entire film was just one predictable scene after another but I will admit that it's so well acted that you can't help but get drawn into the story. There's really no twist that happens that you don't see coming from a mile away and this includes various "secrets" that come out about the younger brother and of course the older one has various financial issues as well as a conflict going on with his wife. There's no question that all of this backstory is just melodrama but a lot of it works. Even though it doesn't work 100% of the time I still give the filmmakers credit for trying to do something than just one fight scene after another. Both Edgerton and Hardy are very believable in their roles. Both roles are so different that it really gives both actors a chance at building the characters and making the viewer care for them in different ways. Nolte gives his strongest performance in years and there's a crying sequence that will certainly move even the hardest soul. The one major problem with the movie is that director Gavin O'Connor goes way overboard with the camera shots. This is certainly a case where less would have been much more because the style often messes up what the actors are doing with their characters.</fullReview>

Main flaws: Brandon was tired like hell, he got beat up in his previous matches, suddenly he Wins against COBA the Russian! OK that's fine!I believe you!the guy never lost, and then a physics teacher knock him out!!! Other side, Tommy fought just for 10 seconds in total, before the final!Final match: 2 brothers against each other... one is exhausted, one is fresh like a new day vegetable! How the hell Tommy didn't finish him up like the others??? I just Don't get it. It was a joke to me my friends. This whole movie is based on a "brother killing" philosophy!but only one of the brothers has this philosophy!it's a very bad movie! I cant understand why everyone is so happy with this! it's full of flaws! not in the directing and acting of course,but a lot in the screen play!!!!even the fight scenes are very bad! and I can't find out why is it on the top 250! thanks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie about two months after a friend of mine lent me the DVD. I sat there, and I had full intentions of watching it, but never did... Until recently....Two completely different brothers end up fighting mixed martial arts. I'm not going to give away too much of the story line, but let me tell you it makes for a spectacular and powerful movie. It's heart-wrenching. Just to be clear, I'm not into MMA fighting, or UFC, or boxing. That may be the main reason the movie sat so long before I put it on. You don't have to enjoy these sports to love this movie. It has the power of Rocky, with a brotherly story line to boot.Please watch this movie. You won't be disappointed!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grabs your attention from the first scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of those top dramas that will be remembered for a long time.From the first moment you meet the brothers and their father your asking questions. As the writers try and answer those questions they leave you with more.Learning about the brother personal stories makes you fall in love with each of them more and more. You'll want to see them both go all the way. Tommy is harder to love from the get go but you feel sad for him and just want to see him happy. Brendan is much easier character to love. He takes his family very serious, loves his wife unconditionally, and will sacrifice everything he has worked for in order to provide for his family. The fathers history with the boys is given right off the bat but his full story remains a mystery till the end.The action in movie really picks up as the fighting begins. You'll learn about why Tommy is the way he is and what he's really fighting for. Plus you get to see him kick some huge dicks ass twice. Even though he goes against the norm you still find yourself rooting for him in the end. His heart was always in the right place but never could show it until a scene that will absolutely make you cry. Brendan is always the underdog from the get go. Every one loves an underdog so its easy to just start cheering for him. He fights all the way through till the end. You can see that he truly loves his brother and just wants to be with him again.I won't tell you how it ends, you'll just have to watch it to find out! The end, however, is going to be the only reason that I don't give this movie a 10 out of 10. After you fall in love with these characters and see them battle against unbelievable odds to fight for what they love, the movie just ends. It just leaves you hanging there... I wasn't hoping for some fairytale happy ending I just would have like to seen more of the brothers together and not fighting.In the end I can't praise this movie enough. Its got the action for every guy on the face of the Earth and has the drama that will make your wife, fiancé, or girlfriend sit right there and watch it with you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before people comment "it's just a movie" listen to my point. What ruined the movie for me is the fact that each fighter in the Championship fight, Tommy and Brenden Conlon, each had three fights prior to the Championship. Tommy never had a fight past 30 seconds never mind going into the second round, Brenden on the other hand goes to the third round and gets pummeled in almost every fight prior to the one against Tommy. Brenden would barely be able to stand let alone win, the Russian literally suplexed Brenden twice, yes WWE style. Other than the ending it was a great film, I just cant get over Tommy losing that fight, it's just not possible, even on film, but what was very realistic were all the gay Marine tribal tattoos Tommy had on his arms.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film starts off great, a young man (Tom Hardy) returning home to see his dad after 14 years and we want to know where he's been and why he left so we are instantly hooked; turns out his dad was a drunk and Tom Hardy wants nothing to do with him as does Joel Edgerton.Tom Hardy then joins a local gym, as a child he was an junior Olympic champion 6 years on the run and hadn't lost a match. He decimates the gyms best fighter in about 20 seconds and becomes an internet sensation.Tom Hardy then gets entered for the'Sparta' tournament where fighters all over the world gathered to fight to see who was the best middleweight in the world with the prize fund of 5million dollars for the winner. The other character Joel Edgerton is a physics teacher at a high school and a retired outcast UFC fighter, his daughter had heart problems and the medical bills put him in debt so he enters the competition to win the money otherwise he will lose his home. He is Tom Hardy's brother.The first fight starts with the showing of Tom Hardy being an internet sensation and then a marine recognizing him as the marine who saved a group of Marines lives by heroically ripping the door off a tank. When the fight begins Tom Hardy knocks the first fighter out with one punch and the proceeds to do near enough the same in every fight he's in. Joel has a different approach he gets battered to a pulp for 3 rounds and then submits his opponent and wins. Joel beats the Russian undefeated fighter Koba by doing this. Koba had the same approach as Tom did as he too knocked fighters out very quicklyNon-surprisingly the final fight is between the two brothers Tom and Joel. Tom beats him to a pulp; who had been knocking everyone out in merely a combination of punches fails to do it here for some unbeknown reason and I bet you know what happened next without me telling you, Joel put Tom in a submission and ripped his shoulder muscle, broke his shoulder or dislocated his shoulder; it is not specified. In real life the referee would have stopped the fight as you can't fight with such a significant injury but this film chose to ignore that and the referee acts oblivious to the fact that the once bull in a china shop Tom is now fighting with one arm. Tom is then taken to the ground by the UFC outcast with a head kick and chocked out. An emotional song plays in the background and Joel whilst chocking his brother screams 'I love you' and its all very lovely. They then walk out in each other's arms and it ends.The film is cheesy, unimaginative and predictable; I could of told you the plot about half an hour in to the film without having to seen it. It's also unrealistic; in UFC you can't come out of retirement after being an 'unmemorable' fighter as the commentator in the film puts it and then become the middle weight champion after a few weeks training. As he does this in less than 90 days because in the film Joel goes to the bank and the banker says his home will be repossessed in 90 days if he does not come up with the money. So I'm going to go down my local gym and you can expect me to be knocking out Cain Velasquez (UFC heavyweight champion) in less than 90 days I assure you. It made me cringe to watch it was embarrassing filmography and I would certainly not recommend it; as much as I love Tom Hardy as an actor and fighting films, it angered me to watch. The silver lining to this very dark gray cloud is that the fight scenes are good to watch</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't really do anything new but it does it right for the most part.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a few years of silence from the sports genre post-Million Dollar Baby, there's been a run of successful films that follow the typical formula (albiet of varying quality) with the popular The Wrestler, The Blind Side, The Fighter and Moneyball. Warrior belongs among them, and is one of the most successful with audiences, if not at the box office, but magazine critics and the people who saw it fell in love with it, and it currently resides in a comfortable position in IMDb's top 250 films. Piling on that formula, it features dual comeback stories happening simultaneously, bonded by blood that will later inevitably collide.The stakes are set high, one fighting for a home for his family and the other fighting for supporting a widow of a fallen war comrade, and the promise of brother vs. brother is a compelling idea, given that only one shall possibly win, if not a particularly special idea. Unfortunately, it stays far too close to formula and clichés, and within the formula hints only more formula and clichés in the backstory, where the wounds run deep. Fortunately, it's delivered with a sincerity which avoids cheese or cringe for the most part. It does focus on the heart rather than the cheap punch and effectively dodges sentiment, if not obligation, as the predictable beat by predictable beat severely blunts the impact. It has some rather commendable attributes. Particularly as the film follows a very well developed character in Brendan Conlon, played admirably by Joel Edgerton, a man who you truly can believe to clip into the role of passionate teacher and caring father and then a tactful and persistent fighter. Nick Nolte gives a great and worthy performance as Brendan and Tommy's father, Paddy, truly deserving of his Oscar nomination. We don't know what he did but we feel an urge for his true redemption. A particularly heartbreaking scene is where he sees his granddaughters for the first time in 3 years but is barely acknowledged. Unfortunately, Tom Hardy's character, Tommy, while established immediately as a focus is thrown to the wayside, and becomes a one-note character where his inner workings are assumed rather than hinted. A talent neglected by the writing.While Warrior may not be particularly special and amounts to things we've all seen before, it's certainly done the right way throughout, hitting all the essential key points nicely if not boldly. It is nice to see mainstream films today with the gritty grain of 1970s crime era cinematography rather than the polish of other blockbusters. However, overall, it is one of those typical films of male emotion expressed through fists which is never as cathartic as it wants to be as it lacks all tension and thoughtfulness to tap into that universal feeling. It relies on building a network of characters to witness the events to be excited about them to create these feelings for the audience.It's an idea I've never truly connected to and have always felt that it's rarely been fully fleshed out to be worthy. After nearly two and a half hours it finally arrives at its selling point - brother vs brother in the final moments. It's been too long of a journey to justify the time spent exploring this dynamic (particularly after an expositional reunion that just confused matters rather than explained them) but the final moments are incredibly powerful and it rightfully ends on its highest note and not a moment later as the brothers embrace after the final fight regardless of who wins. It's a really good film though I'm not sure why its rated so highly. Though maybe that's what competence deserves nowadays.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely not on par with "The Fighter"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Warrior" is an alright film, let's get this straight right from the get-go, but it is no "The Fighter." Last year's multi-nominated film about boxing was good enough to make even those who hated the sport get sucked into the film."Warrior" is not even close to being able to claim the same thing.Set in the barbaric world of mixed martial arts, "Warrior" is yet another film about estranged brothers fighting, literally and figuratively, while dealing with having grown up with an alcoholic father. I will admit, there were moments in this film that did almost bring me to tears and had me rooting for the underdog, but for the most part, at two hours and twenty minutes, I was looking at the clock. The story is simple enough to have not needed nearly as long a running time, and thus this film's editor failed big time. The performances are strong enough, and I will admit, I think I even agree with Nick Nolte's Oscar nomination for his role of the alcoholic father, especially in light of Nolte's own personal trials and tribulations, but where this film fails miserably is making a cohesive story that grabs its viewers and sucks them in, truly feeling empathy for their situation and truly supporting their idiotic decision to get involved with a sport that is so horrifying while being inexplicably popular.Tom Hardy, as the idiotic brother Tommy, a hard-drinking guy whom never once makes you feel sorry for him, gives another strong performance on the heels of "Inception" and "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," but never taps into the side of his character that would make the viewer feel for him. Joel Edgerton's Brendan is far more convincing as a man who is financially desperate and thus, taking clocks to the head seems to be his only alternative.But again, despite somewhat strong performances, the lack of character development over the incredibly-too-long runtime of two hours and twenty minutes led this film to be somewhat of a chore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst ending ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the worst ending to a movie ever that guy did not deserve to win, Tom hardy deserved to win because he was gonna give the money to a women who's husband was dead. He doesn't care about anything he just wants to fight the other guy needs to sit down and deal with his shitty life choices and man up and declare bankruptcy and shut up. I am so mad. I love you Tom hardy Why does this need ten lines I am done I have nothing else to say goodbye this is the most stupid rule I've ever heard of all I wanted to do was express my anger and regret for watching this movie I only watched it because I of Tom hardy I saw legend the other night and it was really good you should go see that instead of watching this because it's so much better and doesn't have a terrible stupid ending like this movie does</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way over-rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have several gripes about this film. The characters are shallow. The dialogue is bland. The score is boring and derivative. The editing effects are undramatic. The plot manages to be predictable.I just don't get the high rating, unless the average viewer is over- stimulated by gratuitous violence. To be fair, I am not a fan of mainstream fighting sports. I have more respect for oriental martial arts like Wing Chun.As they say with cooking - if the ingredients are good, it'll taste good. So conversely this film tastes like unsweetened gruel.I have tried to see this film through several times, but it just doesn't manage to keep my interest enough to stop me bailing out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Could this Movie get a High Rating on IMDb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Warrior" was pretty good, not badly filmed and not badly acted. But that is it. That also describes many films that got less then 7.0 ratings at IMDb. I'm not sure why in the heck people are rating this as high as it is. Either a bunch of studio people got on here and posted ratings or a bunch of numb skulls who simply rate any fighting movie high did. Don't simply rate a movie high because you like the subject. Thats not really the point of the rating system. As others suggested this movie never did develop the three main characters much. There did not appear to be a deep enough reason for all the animosity that took place between the characters. Most of the movie was taken up by fight scenes. The creators of this movie needed to watch "Rocky" better as it had the formula correct for this type of movie. It was also kind of stupid that Tommy was still fighting with one arm in the end. The film was a little degraded due to that. Lets have votes from people who know all kinds of movies and not just action films.</fullReview>

Just because he is motivated can win MMA is impossible.Even the background story is not properly covered and confusing.Better watch a million dollar baby. I can't believe that it got a rating of 8.3.It is real time waste of 2.5 hrs. A better fighting movie is undisputed redemption 3. the fight in it looks real and fighters look real.

		<fullReview>So basically - this is a proper movie. If you really like contact sports (which I do), Tom Hardy as character-actor (which I do as well), Joel Edgerton (which I do, too) and cute Jennifer Morrison (which I definitely do). But.To like this movie, you also have to like movies such as Armageddon and Independence Day (Which I don't). You have to be OK with ultimate predictability and really lame stereotypes, such as "perfect-do-everything-for-family"-husband, drunk and hardball fighting-coach father, a rebel, wild, bitter - but conveniently war-hero - younger brother, supporting, against violence wife, who nevertheless got her chills out of the tournament (loyality, I guess), and bunch of loyal students + headmaster (which I'm personally definitely not). You have to accept everything heading towards some kind of balanced ending, judgment day. And you should love really loud music all the way, to get every last tear out of you. Well, I don't. So I would of rated this movie exactly the same as I rated Armageddon and Independence Day - with 1. But Tom Hardys superior effort to make his character really alive was standing out from this movie, there for it got 5 from me. 1 to the movie and 4 to Hardy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One dimensional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know 3D does not really take of, but does a movie have to be as one dimensional as this one? The moment the viewers were told the two brothers were going to fight in the same tournament, the outcome was foreseeable. I must admit that the sweat, the blood, the atrocity was all filmed very impressively, also thanks to the sound design, but the story is really very, very shallow. The good brother versus the bad brother. The wife opposing the fight, but turning like a leaf. The school principal opposing the fight, but turning like a leaf. The outsider, bound to win. The uncongenial favorite, who doesn't stand a chance against the hero. The no-good father, but still a rough diamond. The American fairy tale that, no matter how violent, the hero deserves our sympathy. I could go on, however, the only scene I anticipated, but to my surprise was not there, is the famous daddy-daddy scene; you know, the scene where the children run over a fresh green field to their victorious father, crying out "Daddy, daddy!" So, all in all, it could even have been worse...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****spooooooooooooooooooooooilers!!!!!!!!!!!!*********this movie is the biggest insult in the history of film making. at first they start the moving showing Tommy as the obvious protagonist. in the first 10 minutes you fill in all of the blanks of his history and immediately understand where he's coming from, having to bury his mother and leave his selfish brother. he spends every waking moment, training and fighting his way to be the best of the best to win the tournament and fulfill the promise he made to his comrades wife. Brendan walks in with his perfect life, beautiful wife, beautiful kids, stable job that he clearly loves aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand then the film even has the audacity to have him give a birthday present to his daughter that is clearly out of their families means. granted one of his daughter did have heart problems and the medical bills were piling up, he and his wife couldn't face the facts and just live within their means. instead after Tommy instantly dominates every single opponent he has ever faced in this movie, he falls short to the man who got his ass kicked outside of a strip club... so at the very end of the movie when the entire crowd is cheering Tommy's name right before he gets his ass kicked, i'm just supposed to lay back and be satisfied with him and his brother hugging it out?????????????? and not to mention right before he gets taken away for fleeing the military because he has no other option. i can't believe this filth passes as a film with the quality to make it into the IMDb top 250. what this world views as deserving and just literally makes me sick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton and Frank Grillo. These are 3 actors, I love. The latter 2 being way underrated I think, but they are amazing. Their intensity in front of the camera, is "Pound for Pound for Pound". However, though this film, at many points; got me cheering, involved and engaged, it also got me to that point right before being close to tears, and then, it dropped me.As the film progressed, I found myself backing Brendan Conlon, but not fully, because Tommy also had his own baggage eating away at him. Sadly though, Tommy, Brendan and their father Paddy's back stories weren't quite fleshed out enough for us to understand their inability to forgive.Sure, Paddy beat on their mother, and Brendan chose to stay with Paddy, because he fell in love with Tess, thus Tommy is angry at Paddy and Brendan... I get the tragedy of that, but, the anger Tommy felt, seemed more deep seeded. OK, maybe that's because of Iraq. But still, his story is not told well enough, for you to empathize, it's only told well enough for you to sympathize, to a point. Reason being, because of Brendan's maturity and struggle, Tommy starts to seem like a baby, without a cause, and because of that... The story, kept dropping and catching, and dropping me.Honestly, you only feel for Tommy because of Hardy's impressive portrayal, not because of Tommy's actual story. I mean, he even turns his back to his niece's, while his hurting brother, pleaded with him.Warrior gave hints at back stories, and perhaps told them at points, but, it didn't bring them to life, and for that, it loses me, because I don't think Warrior was a Sport Movie... I think it was meant to be a Drama with a sport backdrop.It's a... Hit, with the fans, I see that... But, I can't give it an 8. It was a potential 8, that for me, turned into a very well fought for, 6.I realized all the points of absolution. Brendan with Paddy. Tommy with Paddy. And at the end, Tommy with Brendan... But still, those points came about based on the necessity of a happy ending... They didn't arise from tackling what it was that was tearing them apart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every time I watch this movie I cry and I have seen the movie more than a couple of times. It is not just a simple sports/fight/hard work &amp; dedication movie. It is more than that---it subtly involves the audience into the tumultuous relation in a family, but how they in their heart love each other. The younger brother wants to fight to prove his point while elder fights to take care of his family and the father is a parent supporting both his sons in his heart and cheering for them. I will not tell you what the story is, I would request you to watch the movie and know how parents and children have an unspoken bond which cannot be broken even if parents hurt us children or we hurt our parents...The last scene where the elder brother has to hit his injured little brother breaks my heart but the love the elder brother shows, oh it will move you to the extent that you might put a call through to your sibling with whom you have not spoken for a long time---I speak from personal experience and hope you all will also feel what I felt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warrior</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All I knew about this film was the leading British actor, and that it was something to do with fighting, I didn't know if it was boxing or wrestling, turned out to be something sort of in-between the two, I was looking forward to watching it anyway. Basically Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) is a former U.S. Marine haunted by a tragic past, he returns to his hometown in Pittsburgh, he has never fully forgiven his father Paddy Conlon (Oscar nominated Nick Nolte) for his alcohol-driven abuse, Paddy has now returned to being Catholic. Paddy was formerly Tommy's coach, he enlists his father to train him for a winner-takes-all MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) tournament called Sparta, awarding $5,000,000, the biggest prize in the history of the sport, but Tommy does want Paddy to attempt to reconcile their relationship. Tommy trains hard and blazes a violent path towards the title prize, his brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton) is struggling to make ends meet as a public school teacher, he is a former MMA fighter, he decides to return to the ring at an amateur level to provide for his family. Years may have passed, but recriminations and betrayals in the past have kept Brendan bitterly estranged from both his brother Tommy and his father Paddy, but Brendan's unlikely rise as an underdog draws them closer together. The brothers are set on a collision course to confront each other, Tommy and Brendan must face their demons that tore them apart, and eventually of course comes the final intense battle, it is unclear who will win in the fight between the brothers, but after it is all over they do reconcile as their father looks on smiling. Also starring Jennifer Morrison as Tess Conlon, The Grey's Frank Grillo as Frank Campana, Small Soldiers' Kevin Dunn as Principal Zito, Bryan Callen as Bryan Callen, Kurt Angle as Koba and The Truman Show's Noah Emmerich as Dan Taylor. Hardy definitely makes a great impression as the aggressive fighter who tries to separate himself from his family, Edgerton is as compelling as his tough brother and eventually competitor, and I can see why Nolte was nominated the Oscar for his performance. Mixed martial arts has increased in popularity and really rivals boxing and professional wrestling, this is probably the first film I've seen that really covers it, the fighting sequences certainly grab your attention with their brutality, besides that it works well as a story of a broken family slowly coming back together through, all in all it is a most watchable sports drama. Very good!</fullReview>

Watch some MMA fights on YouTube instead, drink a beer with your BFF, let your anger out.This movie is made for introspect, self awareness, self exploration etc. - and perhaps some of the women who are perplexed about the men in their life, could learn something about the (at times)toxic mix of emotions and testosterone.Do yourself a favor, watch this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated fight movie with great acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of boxing/fighting movies as they tend to always have the same key plot points : an underdog fighter with personal/family issues must find a trainer, preferably one with unorthodox methods, in order to compete against the top contestant. He usually wins at the end of an exhausting fight, and in the process, makes peace with his past and proves that believing in yourself accomplishes miracles. We've seen it dozens of times, from the originals that started it all : Rocky and Raging Bull, to Million Dollar Baby, Cinderella Man and the more recent Southpaw and Creed. And yet, judging by the box office results and the number of Oscar nominations, it seems we and the industry can't get enough of it! What makes a great fighting movie then ? What makes it stand out ? As we've seen, it's certainly not the story; it's not even the fight scenes themselves. It's how realistically the fighter goes from underdog to champion while working on his personal issues. The physical transformation must parallel an emotional journey. In short, it's the acting, which explains why these films are usually nominated for best performance awards.Warrior is a great example of that. On top of great performances by Edgerton, Hardy and especially Nolte, the film introduces a few differences from the genre that will make it stick in your memory : instead of the usual boxer/trainer dynamics, we follow the rise of two estranged brothers and their father (yes, two outsiders is better than one !). And the combat sport is mixed martial arts, which is a nice change of pace and will probably help make MMA and the UFC more visible. Real UFC fights can be really violent and bloody, but Warrior doesn't suffer from its PG-13 rating, as it manages to portray the sheer brutality of the fights in a convincing way.All in all, Warrior is a great surprise : even if, like me, combat sports are not your cup of tea, it will still move you! Warrior truly is an underrated movie that deserves its spot in IMDb's Top 250. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tommy Riordan (Tom Hardy) is a Marine and former MMA fighter who returns to the sport to support the widow of a friend and veteran. His father Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte), is a recovering alcoholic who reconnected with his Catholic faith, helps train and corner Tommy. Footage of a sparring session where Tommy knocks out prospect Pete "Mad Dog" Grimes (former MMA fighter Erik Apple)leaks and goes viral. Tommy finds out about an MMA tournament called Sparta, where the winner will be awarded a $5 million purse and decides to enter. Tommy's decision to have Paddy train him is partly due to the fact that no one could give the kind of specialized attention his father did.Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgeton), Tommy's older brother, is a high school physics teacher. His daughter needs open heart surgery, leading to Brendan mortgaging his home to pay her bills. Brendan also returns to MMA as a secondary income. The superintendent learns about Brendan's fighting career and promptly suspends him without pay. Brendan reaches out to his old trainer Frank Campana (Frank Grillo) and enters Sparta as an injury replacement at Frank's urging. Paddy attempts to reconcile with Brendan, telling him about Tommy, but is coolly rebuffed and told to call or write a letter if he wants a chance to see his grandchildren.Tommy and Brendan are placed at opposite ends of the Sparta tournament. Tommy and Brendan speak to each other during a break, revealing the underlying tension between them was due to Brendan having eloped with his wife Tess and seemingly leaving behind their terminally ill mother along with Tommy. Their seeds in the tournament lead to an inevitable clash.This is a satisfying sports drama, with very good performances especially from Tom Hardy and Nick Nolte. The recovering addict role suits Nolte for obvious reasons. Tom Hardy's performance as the embittered ex-Marine is spot on. It's worth Googling the training videos of Tom Hardy just bulking up for the role, the physical transformation into the squat powerful build he shows off during the movie is amazing. Joel Edgerton is also very good as the struggling father, husband and provider but is somewhat overshadowed by Nolte and Hardy. This is superior to Redbelt, another sports drama with different revolving subplots since it doesn't have the ridiculous take on the MMA tournament format that Redbelt did. Warrior definitely has a Rocky feel, especially given Brendan's perspective since he's the film's main underdog.</fullReview>

Just crazy, It was so believable the acting was perfect and the fact that this movie is based on a true story makes it even better, I love movies that are based on true stories.. it makes u wonder and it def has u feeling some of the emotions the actors are feeling.

		<shortDescription>The Excellent MMA Fights Aren't The Primary Reason To Watch This Movie, The Powerful Acting Is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a little late getting this review up, the movie has been out since 2011. I'm putting up this review so far past it's release because this might be the best movie I've seen that's come out in this decade.I still remember walking into the theatre being open but having low expectations, with no idea such a skillfully made and emotionally gripping movie lay ahead.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The movie starts out in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte) returning to his home after attending a meeting at his church (listening to Moby Dick on a tape which comes up later). To his surprise, on his porch is his son Tommy Riordan (Tom Hardy). He's surprised to see Tommy but Tommy has been drinking and is not pleasant company. We learn that Tommy and his mother ran away from Paddy leaving his other son Brendan with him. Paddy was an abusive alcoholic and Tommy's mother feared for her life. She eventually died because she was very sick when they fled. Paddy will not drink however as he is in recovery and is clearly upset upon hearing this news. He reveals that he had a private investigator look up Tommy and his mother and that he was very sorry about what happened. Tommy leaves basically calling him a piece of $%!* but tells him that he will be in town for the foreseeable future. He begins to start training at a local gym when news of the Sparta MMA tournament reaches him. It's a winner take all tournament where the prize is $5,000,000.We are then introduced to Brendan (Joel Edgerton). He works as a substitute high school science teacher. Brendan is well liked by his students but cannot make ends meet. His wife Tess (Jennifer Morrison) works two jobs and they are trying to overcome a mountain of hospital bills after their one daughter was gravely ill. He also has a second job, Tess thinks he bounces at a strip club but really he participates in unlicensed MMA fights. Although Tommy was a champion wrestler in his high school days, Brendan fought in the UFC. He did not have a particularly successful career though. After winning a fight he was expected to lose, he comes home with a nasty shiner leading Tess to try and insist he quit bouncing. Unfortunately news of these fights breaks out as well and Brendan is put on suspension for his outside the classroom activities. With no other way to pay the bills, Brendan turns to these fights full time along with training with top MMA trainer Frank Campana (Frank Grillo) who is a former friend.If you walked into this movie knowing nothing about the finer plot points, I think you would just assume it would be your average boxing movie plot with MMA. This is not the case. I want to start with the actual fighting within the movie. Although I can't imagine its 100% completely realistic, it's pretty grounded and pretty violent. There's some bone crushing strikes, some pretty complex manoeuvres and some surprising outcomes. The scenes are well filmed and stand up against any boxing movie easy. I would echo other reviewers in saying that the MMA fights are treated seriously and not as a gimmick or a joke like an inferior movie would.On a whole, the plot of Warrior isn't daring or new. It does follow certain plot points that most sports movies do. Normally this would be an instant problem but Warrior moves past that issue by dealing with many heavy themes. The one that always hits me hard is dealing with intense pain caused by those you love the most. This movie shows this pain in a brutally honest manner and it leaves me welling up every time I watch Warrior. Tommy and Brendan have every reason to hate their father and honestly due to the horrific acts he put them through, I'm not sure he deserves their forgiveness. You see how much Paddy's actions have changed their lives, how Paddy yearns for another chance and how both men carry their emotional baggage with them not just in the ring but in their lives everyday. It's hard to watch them struggle but it's one of the reasons that Warrior is so excellent. Other key themes are forgiveness, overcoming addiction and how important family can be. It's for these reasons and more that Warrior is able to overcome using familiar story elements and build upon them so well.The other big reason to watch this movie is the absolutely amazing trio of lead performances. I see this as the breakout performance for Tom Hardy as opposed to Bronson. As a character, Tommy is unstoppable but he's also being suffocated by his emotional and physical trauma. You feel his pain every moment Tom is on screen, it's an involving acting job. Joel Edgerton is just as good playing Brendan. Brendan is more a classic underdog but he's so easy to root for. Joel plays off the rest of the cast really well and he nails every scene with any member of the cast. Nick Nolte received an Oscar nomination for his work and you can see why. He has the most complicated part, being a former alcoholic begging for forgiveness. Nick is probably channelling some of his personal life and it comes through in a gripping performance. I would also note that Jennifer and Frank are excellent in their respective roles too.Warrior often gets compared alongside The Fighter (another boxing movie with Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, and Melissa Leo). The Fighter got the accolades but to me Warrior is the far better movie. It's an excellent sports movie but it's strength is being a layered and superb drama. It's in my top 10 favourite films and I would recommend it whether you watch MMA or not. You can appreciate it either way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not just MMA that makes this different.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What amazes me most about this film is that it perfectly develops the relationship between Tommy, Brendan and their Father without ever using flashbacks or long exposition sequences explaining why their relationship was where it was. You understand the complexities of their relationship by attaining a few details of the story during each sequence allowing you to slowly piece together the past so you can better understand the present. By doing this, the viewer feels an emotional connection to each character. Part of me cheered for Brendan while feeling like Tommy was unnecessarily cruel to his Father. But then later in the film I became much more sympathetic to Tommy in part because the pieces of history provided throughout the film allowed me to better understand that character. As a result, I was connected to every character in this film making the finale that much more emotional.The fight sequences in this film are some of the best I've ever scene in a movie like this. They feel visceral and rough while also feeling majestic enough to make the professional skill of these fighters believable. The fight choreography and cinematography work together seamlessly to convey a frenetic feeling to the audience while still allowing them to see the fights in all their glory. The little shaky cam that exists works beautifully, and I never felt cheated from the fight scenes as a result.This film is masterful in every sense of the world. There isn't one scene that feels out of place or unnecessary. It's edited in such a lean way often making you forget its two hour and nineteen minute run time.Director Gavin O'Connor is able to sidestep the rudimentary conventions that dominate most boxing movies. It's not just MMA that makes this film feel different from films like Rocky, Southpaw, The Fighter and Cinderella Man. This is an emotional story of two brothers and the pain that they must sift through in order to find true peace. And it's this story that separates it from the rest of the pack and makes it feel fresh and new.Story - 9.5/10 Action - 9.5/10 Cinematography/Score - 9/10 Pacing/Length - 9.5/10 Acting - 10/10Overall Rating - 9.5/10Overall Score - A+</fullReview>

But now we have the UFC and MMA, which is today's version of boxing. (When we go get hot wings, we watch MMA. Rarely do we pay big money for boxing anymore.) Somehow this film has been praised so much it ended up on the IMDb Top 250.

		<fullReview>I have to say I actually do like this film but it is more of a guilty pleasure than a good movie. As I am a fan of MMA, Tom Hardy, and Kurt Angle (Olympic gold medalist turned pro wrestle), I was hard pressed not to like it. With that said I can still be objective enough to know that this is not a very good movie. Crummy dialogue, cheesy writing, and way too many subplots render this movie kind of a mess.It starts simple enough, without spoiling, 2 estranged brothers (through different circumstances) manage to both get in a 16 man MMA tournament despite one being a nobody and the other a mediocre retired MMA fighter. Add to that an estranged abusive recovering alcoholic father wanting but being denied affection from both his sons. I would have to say the main problem with Warrior is too many subplots that not only don't enhance the story but they are used briefly and then forgotten. It starts as "the fighter" then it turns into "rocky" then it throws in a "bloodsport" subplot, and all the while the main plot is about a father trying to reconcile with his sons, it's just too much. If they had chosen just one of those movies to "emulate" the finished product would be much better. The subplots also lead to the runtime issue, as this movie is at least 25 minutes too long.Then there are the suspension of disbelief issues. I get its a movie but you mean to tell me that in a 16 man tournament nobody realizes these 2 men are brothers? Sure they have different last names but nobody notices that Tommy is being trained by a man with the same last name as Brandon? They make a point to say that Tommy can't be found on goggle (and why), but a billionaire, who made his fortune on wall street isn't going to do a full background check on all 16 fighters when he's offering 5 million bucks, and deny anyone who can't be found? How did he know Tommy was not an ex-con? No insurance issues? Overall I would recommend this only to people who like Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton (who was great as brandon), MMA or fighting movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit like Rocky, but with kicks as well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warrior tells the story of two brothers who, throughout a turbulent period of growing up, no longer get on. One is a marine, the other a school teacher. And, they both happen to be extraordinarily good at cage fighting. They enter a tournament. Who will win? I don't normally like these sorts of fighting films (I'm about the only child of the 80s not to like the Rocky saga!), but I have to say this one kept me watching. It does follow the 'Rocky-style' ideal of the underdog working his way up and winning against the odds.It's a bit long. There were a few scenes that I felt could have been cut, but, for some reason, overall I found it compelling. I wasn't that drawn in to the characters, but the feel was something pretty epic about the whole affair.I'm not sure whether I'd want to watch it again, but I'm certainly glad I saw it. Maybe if you're into these sorts of fight movies, you'll appreciate it more than me?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is honestly my all time favorite movie and one of the most underrated movies of all time in my opinion. It just has everything, pain, joy, love, heartbreak, redemption. Just everything you could want this movie has. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I would bump it up to the top of your must see list. Tom Hardy is just incredibly in it, so is Nolte and the whole cast. I consider myself a tough grader and a bit of a hard sell when it comes to movies. usually there are only 3=4 movies a year that I am actually excited to see and even less that I recommend to others. This is my number one movie that I would recommend right now. 10/10 for me, just go see it, that's about all I can say without giving any spoilers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that this movie shows great detail of fighting. This is great for Mixed Martial Arts fans. It just made me realize that MMA isn't just about watching the TV shows its about practicing and fighting the real people out thereI love almost everything about it and the character of Tom Hardy is so deep. The ending is just too bad. Tommy knocked out every pro fighter in the first round and his brother got beaten up every round. So how could it be that his brother defeated him. I am not going to say that this movie is bad because I love the fighting scene so much.It would be more realistic that Tommy won instead of being dramatic fairly tale where Branden won and save his house. But if Branden didn't win this competition the ending might turned out to be worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A War Movie where each Warrior Won .........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directly to the point I was sure Warrior is going to be a typical war movie with usual audience rating it high. It was mostly unknown to me. Now I started watching it and yeah the usual stuff of typical dialogues and family problems. That was a bit boring but I thought it may get somewhere at least as good as the movie Drive.Soon the background music got deeper and enriching, covering up the whole yet unclear plot that kept me watching. Plot started to unfold and soon I found that yes there seems something that I should watch completely. Towards remaining 40 minutes I started to wonder over its amazing plot, webs of mutual relation and the warrior within each of them.I remember nearly every movie that has got nominated in Oscars but while watching I just couldn't remember this movie getting any nomination. I said to myself this man here, the father, Nick Nolte should have been at least nominated, may be academy had some annoyance with this movie. Then the whole movie got right on the track and started entertaining, clarifying, flying and emotionally satisfying. It showed each and every emotion in the way I can imagine and understand. The moment film ended, I checked about it on Google and found what I exactly hoped for, the father, Nick Nolte was nominated in the Oscar for best supporting actor category. It proved I was right in my observation, moreover one should not expect academy to give any more other Oscars to such kind of feel good melodrama.So the best points came out to be feel good movie where our all three competing warriors won. Nice and enjoyable emotional and plot layout, soothing background music, family drama and relations, and amazing acting performances. Each of the three characters were stone stiff distinguishable pillars of the movie with all the other characters with good dialogues provided greenery around them.</fullReview>

One could even argue that this movie isn't even about the fighting. This isn't one of those sports movies where you know who's going to win. And that's not even the beauty of it. The best part is that moment when you realize you don't even care about the fight, or the winner, at all. And that's when this movie sets itself apart from all other fighting movies.</fullReview>

The story is just amazing, two brothers torn apart only to be reunited again through MMA, the drama was just off the charts. Parallel editing was also very skillfully implanted into Warrior to build up to that ultimate moment where both brothers face off one another. One fighting for country and one fighting for family really made the audience, well at least it made me, really have a tug of war between who I should support because both are fighting for very reasonable causes. I think that even though Tom Hardy did not win in the end, the movie still somehow had a happy ending for both brothers because we see at the end that they actually are united within as they leave the ring hand in hand.

		<shortDescription>Warrior</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mixed martial arts is a masculine, gruesome, and unforgiving sport that is given deeper meaning in Gavin O'Connor's latest movie Warrior. This film is chalked full of emotion and heart that is evident through the gritty setting, raw acting, and action-packed cinematography. O'Connor fulfills this genre's requirement of gut-wrenching fight scenes, elevating them by not only making moviegoers wince with physical pain, but with empathy as well. The unforeseen complexity of Warrior's plot seizes the attention of its audience, delivering significantly more substance than a traditional sports movie. Separated when their maliciously abusive alcoholic father drives their family apart, two brothers head down drastically different life paths. Tommy, the youngest, returns home a war hero from a recent stint in the marines. Whereas Brendan is raising a family and teaching high school physics. When money becomes a burdensome obstacle for both of them, they find themselves battling for $5 million in the final ring of the largest mixed martial arts tournament in the world; Sparta. The twists and turns of the plot are supported by the appropriately grungy setting. The director's choice to have the story split between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia strongly evokes the brokenness amongst the members of the Conlon family. Pittsburgh, where the father and Tommy reside, is adequately portrayed as grimy, dark, grey, and gloomy. This captures the essence of these characters and their hateful relationship. On the other hand, Brendan's home in Philadelphia is represented with a brighter aura that symbolizes his more put together life. These vastly different lifestyles are made apparent in the setting choices of the brothers' gyms. Tommy's is a dilapidated hole-in-the-wall, whereas Brendan attends a state-of-the-art facility. O'Connor's fitting use of setting adds a broad level of understanding to the characters and plot. Tom Hardy and Joe Edgerton do a stunning job portraying the damaged Conlon brothers. The use of relatively unknown actors by Gavin O'Connor was a brilliant way to appropriately add an air of realism and avoid inappropriate glamour in this movie. Tom Hardy embodies the mysterious, bitter, and surprisingly big-hearted Tommy to a T. Hardy pulls viewers in two emotionally drastic directions. He draws fury out of spectators as he constantly demeans and emotionally beats his rehabilitating father. However, his character grows on audiences after they learn about his involvement in a remarkably brave act overseas. Joe Edgerton, wins over moviegoers' hearts from the beginning between his beautiful family, loving students, and unfortunate money issues. O'Connor manages to provide two heroes in this story. As with any other sports film, action scenes are the blood supplying life throughout the movie. The cinematography of these fight scenes adds an air of emotional depth to mixed martial arts that is often overlooked. Close-ups of the fighters' faces in the heat of competition show not only the physical battle, but the emotional one as well. Large, sweeping pans of the ring illustrate an inside perspective of the fight that is only seen by those who are throwing the punches. Ducking and weaving cameras leaves audiences trying to evade the iron fists of these brutal men. The vicious, action-packed choreography of this film helps produce sensations of phantom pain and empathy that viewers feel with every strike. Warrior hits you with a punch you never saw coming. Emotions and testosterone rage in unison as mixed martial arts coincides with a devastating family situation. When the final fight for $5 million involves two brothers, who will you root for?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warrior ? Rocky on legal performance enhancing steroids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface this is a brawny bromance set to the theme of UFC. Boasting a modest and promising cast, I'm really surprised it didn't get more endorsement from the cinema going populous at release. It's got some divisive critics reviews and while I generally can see credence with some of the negative critiques, I find myself fighting its corner by throwing in my two cents on IMDb (over a year after its release).First of all this film has an obvious plot structure which can be generally fathomed from reading the blurb on the back of the DVD case. To boot there's an assortment of cheesy / cliché dialogue and plot devices throughout the film that has made a lot of the popular film intelligentsia cringe. In this way it gets me thinking of Rocky with its uncomplicated sentiment and sometimes shameful use of American ideology (anyone remember Ivan Drago from Rocky IV, - the soviet steroid death machine). Personally however, I think there's so much more to rate it as a stellar movie in its own right and is well transcended above the realms of generic crowd pleasing poop.So what else does it have going for it? Well the most important asset to this film is surely Tom Hardy and Nick Nolte. Hardy brings a powerhouse blend of passive aggressiveness and emotionally tortured bravado. This is a yet another movie to add to his increasing stack of varied note ? worthy performances. Nolte, whilst bringing a more subdued role, is no less believable as a regret ridden recovering alcoholic. Both bring highly subjective performances which keep the film glowing with a captivating emotional realism; the way the characters are responding and reacting to each other demonstrates that elusive chemistry that is often lost even in films of the most boastful production values. The same can mostly be said for Joel Edgerton, although his part is burdened by more than his fair share of clichéd plot devices. For instance, his high school band of followers gets more than a little cheesy at times during the fight scenes (I was still joining them in pumping my fists into the air). Even so, all three of these characters and the solid back up from the supporting cast gives the film real soul that betters it's sometimes questionable script ? writing.The films UFC theme is also one that makes it stand out. It's a sport that doesn't enjoy widespread acknowledgement and I think I'll say on the whole that Warrior succeeds in representing the film to the masses. There does seem to be an over ? reliance on fist shots a lot of the time, which would seem unfair to a multi ? disciplinary sport. Also the 'shaky cam' employment is a bit overdone at times, though not to a degree that I found distracted from the ringside narrative (my friend said she got a head ache from it). The commentators, Bryan Callen and Sam Sheridan, (real life commentators) are also a worthwhile addition. Not only are they at times very amusing with their genuine high octane enthusiasm for the sport, they also create a brilliant counter ? point to the more engrossing emotional struggles going on inside the ring, particularly as the film approaches its climax. Ultimately the UFC is just the context that the real drama develops within. Bar the cheesy entrées, this films main course is a serving of authentic brilliance. Hope the metaphor gets my point across ? watch it and I hope you get enthralled by it like I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi IMDb,This is just the most wonderful, heart-warming movie I have ever seen in my short life. Brendan is just an inspiration throughout his emotional and physical battles. I want to be more like Brendan and have even started training for MMA. I want to be a teacher like him one day and teach the world about being strong no matter what. Tommy is obviously the weaker one since he has no technique. I mean even though he punches Brendy the first few rounds. Brendan has the soul and passion for his family's survival. He has the submissions and is the best underdog since Rocky Balboa. When I am tired and weary of just being me, I imagine what Brendan would say to his class. He says, "Danny, you are strong like me. Just say yes and go down." Of course, I do not refuse. He is more than a mentor and teacher. He is my future lover. I am sorry, but I hope he divorces his wife in the second movie, which needs to come out since sequels are the best. I want to be with him. He is my hero and my rock. Tommy is just a brute and doesn't understand how hurt Brendan is. #ilovebrendanforever</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually, when i planned on seeing the movie, i thought it would be another fighting movie about a guy, with a questionable history, who has issues with another guy, while dealing with a girl. And when you strip it down to the basics, it is exactly like that. But then you realize that the main storyline is the one about 'the other guy', and that is his brother. The acting is good, way above average. But i do have a problem with the way Tom Hardy is shown in the movie. His behavior and fighting style suggests that he is a barbarian, with an IQ below 50. Maybe it was the directors' vision, but i would have done it slightly different. Nick Nolte is amazing. He deserves a good role like this, a chance he gets not often enough. Frank Grillo and Joel Edgerton do a great job. And then, the fighting itself: it's more than just a fighting movie. I can read in the other reviews that comparisons with Rocky are often made. They are both good films in the genre. Rocky is a huge icon in movie history, known to man and child for over 35 years. But it's more a 'drama' than a 'fighting movie'. Warrior (for me) tilts the balance a bit in the other direction. The difference and variation in fighting styles of the contenders is welcome. Joel (Brendan) has clearly a another approach in the cage. I enjoyed it, no doubt about it. Nevertheless, a huge merit for director, producer and actors: one of the best movies i've seen in a while. Go and see it (or rent it)!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warrior ( November 14, 2011)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see "Warrior" with my two sons, not knowing exactly what to expect. Knowing it was about two brothers who end up fighting each other, I thought it might contain something useful for them to see.Many times movies can move me emotionally, sometimes I may tear up, but in this movie I wiped tears away from off my cheek.I did wonder if the writers were the "older brothers." Or, since it was released on September 11, was there some subliminal message between American "brothers" with terrorists being the younger brother.Warrior brothers does not seem like it should be synonymous. Brothers fighting goes all the way back to Cain and Abel. "And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? If thous doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him." (Genesis 4:6-7) In "Warrior", fallen countenances are seen. Sin (destructive things) can be seen ruling over the lives of the brothers and the father.Tommy had an alcoholic father with all the dysfunction that brings. His mother left his father; Tommy went with her, while Brendan stayed with his father. Brendan also stayed with his father so he did not have to move away from his girlfriend. Tommy and his mother moved across the country; she got sick, she did not have health insurance, she got Tommy to rub her body in oil (praying for healing from God, and she died). I guess Tommy felt everyone betrayed or abandoned him; father, brother, health care assistance, and God. He went to the Marines. In battle, his brothers mistakenly fired on him and those he was with - killing everyone but him. He lost his "best brother" and ran to desert the military, only to run upon brothers in need and was able to save lives. Yet, he fled and took on his mothers maiden name to avoid military court martial.He got dealt bad hands. There is not a lot you can do sometimes to change the cards you are dealt, you can only change how you respond to the cards you are dealt. Tommy's countenance fell. It fell toward his father, his brother, health care affordability, God, and his military service.He had a lot to deal with. Like Cain, Tommy was wroth and his countenance fell. In the ring, fighting against his brother, he appeared much like Cain. "...and it came to pas, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him." (Genesis 4:8) Brendan had issues with his father and with Tommy. Brendan could not trust to allow his father into his life and expose his family to the pain his father caused him. Brendan had evidently gone to college and he was teaching at a high school. He had married and had children. He had bad hands dealt, also. His child had a heart problem, he had medical debts, his house was underwater, and when he sought to make extra money in a "questionable" way his "brothers" (school administration) suspended him without pay. The principal of the school and his students personally wanted to stand with him - but their hands were tied professionally.Brendan needed money to keep supporting his family; Tommy needed money to support his killed marine "brother's" wife and family.The father is watching both his sons fight in the ring.I did not want to see either brother win in the ring against each other. I did not want to see brothers fight. How can brothers win when they seek to win at the expense of other. It is like a boundary, that if you cross it, you uncover your brother - you kill him.In "Warrior", Brendan won the fight in the ring. A lot of questions remain unanswered. Did the military police take Tommy and court martial him? What kind of relationship would Tommy, Brendan and their father have? Was money and both brothers' needs put above their brother relationship? Can one or both brothers say, "I'm not going to fight you? You're my brother?" Since Adam and Eve, we are all brothers in humanity. Also, since Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel, and later Seth, we are either Sons of God, or sons of men. There will always be two lines of brothers, though there are many subclasses. (blood brothers, military brothers, frat brothers, professional brothers, etc.) Within the subclasses, you can have either Sons of God, or sons of men.Jesus is the firstborn Son. He is the elder brother who was willing to die to give all humanity the opportunity to become His brothers and sisters."The Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?" (Genesis 4:9) Cain was a liar and a murderer. He slew his brother.Jesus spoke of Abel as being righteous. (Matthew 23:35) Cain is referred to, as "of that wicked one, and slew his brother." (I John 3:12) Every man is born with "sin lying at the door, with its desire unto you..." (Genesis 4:7) Every man must rule over him."Warrior" was intense. I cried. I left heavy.I thank God for my elder brother who gave a knock out punch - the winning blow - to the adversary of all men.</fullReview>

This normally would have been a cliché, BUT, the story never points fingers at it, instead, like in real life, it DRAWS YOU into the situation and you can subtly see the story that can't quite be put into words. THIS is what makes this movie beautiful.Also don't worry about being put off thinking of the other similar fight movies you had seen, and irritated you. Even I am not a fan of such movies, this movie is different, so even if you are into drama or romcoms, you would mostly enjoy this.Surely one of the top 5 movies released this year, along with 'Drive' etc.Cheers! :-)..............</fullReview>

		<fullReview>when the average rating of the movie is 8.3 u already knew that the movie is brilliant.this movie is a worth watching movie although it will cost more then 2 hours of your life movie is very long as compare to the other movies but in every second u can see the hard work to make it.The most exciting part of the movie is TOMMY(Tom Hardy) section of fights pure 3 knockouts make u wanna cheer for him every detail of the of the matches feels u are sitting right of your TV screens and watch a live match.This movie has a tendency to claim as a 10/10 acting in superb story brilliant music spot one.BUT i reduce the two points only for its climax It could be better like if TOMMY wins the fight and hugs his brother.or we can see some the after story of the brothers.SSROCKS1995@GMAIL.COM</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holy Sh** This Movie Kicked Ass!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had not seen this movie when it hit theaters, but bought it with my Christmas money, and boy, am I glad that I did! Out of all the movies that have to do with fighting or boxing or whatever, such as Rocky, The Wrestler, or The Fighter, Warrior tops them. It had a fantastic story with great actors. I fell in love with this movie. I never thought I'd ever cry during a movie, but after the final fight i almost did, because it is that emotional. It's almost as if you can't decide which of the brothers you want to win at the end. You like 'em both too much, so it's hard to choose. I know much of the public and many moviegoers probably don't like the sport of mixed martial arts (quite frankly, I don't either), but the way it was executed in the film was superb. I have never seen anything so good.Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. it kicked ass! it's that damn good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tommy Riordan (Hardy) trains to be a Kick Boxer and ends up fighting his estranged brother, Brendan, (Edgerton) in the big fight. Both brothers want nothing to do with their father (Nolte).This is really quite a story and I wondered if it was true. I looked but couldn't find that it was. But, in here you get to know all the characters pretty good as they were well defined. Well, except for Tommy as he has a secret and keeps to himself. The dialogues go a long way to making this real and enjoyable.The fight scenes are brutal, but just keep telling yourself, "it's only a movie." That didn't work for me as I was getting a real workout squirming this way and that and dodging this and that too. I knew the brothers would end up fighting each other in the final match, but I didn't know who would win. As the story goes, I tended to favor one brother over the other and then a strange thing happened. I started to favor the other brother. Who will you favor? I thought I was getting weary of all these fight movies, but they seem to get better and better. Who knew?This is Kick Boxing and it's almost a no holds barred fight. There are rules but when you watch you ask yourself: what are the rules as you don't see any adherence to them whatever they are. Senator John McCain wants the sport abolished as he calls it Human Cock Fighting. I am sure we will see more of Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton as both did outstanding jobs. Nick Nolte just gets better with age and will someone get him an overdue Oscar one of these days? (9/10) Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie turned out to be more than what I expected. There is a Rocky-Esq feel but in no way does it hinder the movie. The acting was great, Tom Hardy I personally feel had an Oscar worthy performance. Joel most likely had a breakthrough for his career, he was great. Nick Nolte stole nearly every scene, he deserves an Oscar nomination.The fight scenes were well done and entertaining, but it was the solid performances and story behind the characters that made Warrior special. Its emotional, entertaining, and inspiring. You truly feel for the characters.Honestly, I would highly recommend. The box office numbers are surprisingly low but with time, i feel, this movie is going to catch on. I'd say it is arguably one of the years best. (Knowing the two brothers face off does not in any way ruin the movie, its a must-see).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My family and I just watched this movie and I had to join IMDb just to write this review. After seeing a review about this movie on NPR, I put it on the list of movies my husband &amp; I wanted to watch. Even with that good review, I wasn't sure what to expect: Rocky, Fighter, etc. It's a long movie, over 2 hours, and the fighting doesn't really start to happen till over half way through but that may be the best part about it. Because the fight wouldn't mean anything without knowing the history of these men. This movie moved me to tears, it made me cheer, it made me nervous for the fighters, it made me want them to win and it made me want them to heal. I can't articulate how well made I feel the movie is but if you have any urge to see it, watch it! Just go watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the year's best... (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very poor year in the movie industry overall, but this one shines through! A very good drama film, which fails to draw major attention, because of it's theme. Just like "The Wrestler", this movie has a specific idea behind it and a delicate theme (Mixed Martial Arts). Movie critics and people who like meaningful films maybe have overlooked Warrior, exactly because of it's subject, which isn't very popular in this business.Good sports movies have always drawn huge attention and have won numberous awards, but the so called "dirty sports" like Pro wrestling and MMA have received mixed feelings, when taken as a theme for a film... better yet a serious film! Nobody takes in consideration the fact, that in this line of work there are many significant and complex human beings that would become brilliant subjects for a movie character, like for example Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) a suffering soul that wonders alone, wanting someone to reach out and pull him away from the darkness. Tommy lives his life in the past, a dark past which is buried deep inside him and so he communicates most of the time by primitive ways like violence and rejection. Rejection towards his father, a former boxer and a drunk Paddy Conlon (Nolte) who has destroyed the family and now wants a forgiveness for his actions, his brother Brendan Conlon (Edgerton) and everyone around, who tries to reach out to him. Brendan Conlon's (Edgerton) role is this of the tipical underdog, who had been underestimated his whole life by his father, brother, mother and friends. His responsibility towards his new family (his wife and two daughters) is the only pure, intact relationship in his life, which he wants to preserve by any means necessary, making him a very dangerous man when pushed to the wall!A great script in my opinion, great story about a dysfunctional family that comes together by the only thing that had brought them close in the past... fighting! Don't miss Warrior, it's one of the year's best!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hats off to the entire crew for pulling off such a great feast,which otherwise would have been a cliché. This is easily one of the best combat sports movies ever contrived. There is a great plot here and it works well for setting up the tone of the movie.The film basically showcases the healing up of a family which has been torn apart. The characters bring to the screen a sense of heart in them, which holds as a great formula through-out the movie. The fight choreography was top-notch, and those scenes are simply just nail-biting.It has been done so cleverly that it serves as a medium for spurting out the emotions stricken in the minds.Special kudos to Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton and Nick Nolte for carving up such a gut-wrenching classic. All those who crave about those fighting movies should definitely add this to your watch list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If i could give this a 8.5 i would When i first saw the preview for this movie, i was a little skeptical. I thought it was going to be like The Fighter, with just less talented actors. To a point i was right, none of the performances in this are as good as Christian Bales, but that being said, everyone did a great job in this movie. Nick Nolte gave a marvelous performance that should be worthy of a Best supporting actor nom. The previews let you know the gist of the story, two brothers enter a MMA tournament where they eventually face off. Even though they are brothers they are very different in character and the way they were raised, the only thing in common being their dislike for their father. The movie shows their current and past life struggles to get them to where they are in the movie and it all leads up to awesome finale. This movie does for MMA what Vision Quest did for wrestling, i just hope this gets a better following.</fullReview>

If Nick Nolte doesn't get an Oscar nomination - there is no justice. While both lead actors are in their mid 30's &amp; thus seem a little old for the punishing fight scenes - they do pull it off. I understand that both of them suffered injuries during filming. No matter they are both great in their performances. I've seen them separately in other films &amp; they remain two actors worth keeping an eye on. I don't see them doing too many romantic comedies however.

		<fullReview>Despite the good reviews here I wanted to put off watching this movie for a while as I thought this will be one of those standard movies where they develop a plot just to take it to the last fight which is supposed to make up for everything else the movie may not be. I finally got to watch it and was pleasantly surprised on how well the whole movie was executed from start to end. The movie had many chances to slip into the ordinary but they carefully kept off that road and made a really convincing movie. The lead characters are neatly developed without overdoing any of their individual traits. The fights also had the right balance to it, thereby gelling with the rest of the movie rather than standing out and causing a distraction. 'Balance' is the right word to describe this movie as all the elements are carefully balanced to deliver a good movie. Definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Guilty Pleasure of Watching Brains Being Beaten Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie runs slightly more than 2 and a half hours, but it never bores.Nick Nolte plays the alcoholic father who is about to celebrate 1,000 days clean and sober when we meet him. His portrayal of the flawed, sometimes pathetic, old drunk is just about perfect.His sons are, for various complicated reasons, mixed martial arts fighters who end up competing for a large purse in the Sparta Match held in Atlantic City. About half the movie takes place at the match.The acting throughout is excellent, and, the direction is also very fine. One supporting cast member who deserves mention is Frank Grillo, who I have never seen. He steals scenes when he is on camera. He was so convincing as a MMA trainer that I checked his bio to find out if he was a fighter. He's an actor, and a good one.The script bristles with good lines. While the story becomes fairly predictable early on and there are many scenes which are recycled from other similar movies, the story and the pace are rewarding. There were some glaring errors and inconsistencies in the script or in the editing which didn't ruin the story, but did detract from it. At one point, to save time, a series of elimination rounds are strung together. They were incidental to the plot. That section went too long for me. If the rounds weren't that important, shorter cuts or a another technique might have been more effective. There is a mixture of mortal combat and soap operatic family conflict which, if the soapiness were toned down a little, would have worked better. The relationship between the two brothers is compelling, but, to nitpick, they don't really look like family members. 2011 has been, so far, a lean year for meaty fare. The big money has been concentrated even more into kid-stuff blockbusters than in past years. This film could get critical attention and should be around for awards. Like the Rocky series, the fight scenes are the main event, and you find yourself rooting for the fighters. This was a pleasant surprise. The cast, except for Nolte, was an ensemble of unknown or lessor known actors. This is one of those films which offer these non-A-list actors a chance to break out, and, without exception, the performances were great.See it. It's a knock out.</fullReview>

I've seen Never Back Down, which had one good feature; the gorgeous Amber Heard, and that was a shambles of a film about mma. To say this is the Rocky of mma films is an understatement. Stallone cannot touch Hardy or Edgerton in their acting prowess. This is easily the definitive sports film. Every bout, every fight between family members was breathtaking. The only sports movie to come close in terms of sheer brilliance is Coach Carter.

		<fullReview>I've watched some overrated films and TV shows in my time, but typically when something is rated THIS high, I can feel fairly confident that it won't be terrible. Well, I suppose that isn't the case, because this movie is borderline awful. This is nothing more than a two hour cliché. Every single moment of the film is utterly predictable and completely lacking in creativity. The movie tries so hard to make us feel for these characters, but in the end all I could do was cringe at the cheesiness of it all. I enjoy a film that tugs on the heart strings, and I actually enjoy some cheesiness as long as it's done well, but this film is just poorly written. I still gave it a 5, because it's not unwatchable. The acting is acceptable, and the cinematography is tolerable. My main gripe is with the writing. It's one cliché after another, and with each scene all I can think of is how I'm "supposed" to feel, but nothing was done to actually make me feel that way. I wish people would be more stingy with their 10 star ratings, because this is NOT an 8.2 film, and it would have saved me 140 minutes if people had rated it fairly instead of handing out 10 stars like candy.</fullReview>

His own struggles with alcohol, the war, the family troubles and the distance created by all of it. The military aspect didn't quite tell a tale there and was far from accurate in legalities but the ideal affect was achieved, the government always reclaims what is theirs according to them. The script writing was a bit sluggish, like pulling teeth at times. I don't care for missed opportunities to say what should be said in any situation. When I write, nothing is left hanging unless it has to be. I believe in writing of true human emotion and not Hollywood style where you have conversation with huge emotional impact but never say all that should be said. Mostly, the human race is not like that. We feel it, we say it. This movie tends to leave too much hanging in the air. Thick pains of oppressed emotions. Still love the movie though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have heard nothing but good things about warrior and now I have seen it and boy does it live up to the hype in my opinion. The premise of this film sees two brothers who are both down on their luck enter a ufc tournament which they both look to win. Now joal Edgerton has had an interesting career to say the least but he is fantastic in this film. He is the everyday hero that we root for because he is relatable and the one character that is a good person and that you really like in this film. Tom hardy is also phenomenal in this film, from the very first time you see him you can tell he is damaged and has allot of anger and he is so mysterious that it makes him a truly fascinating character. Nick nolte plays the father and he was also great in this film and you really felt the pain in his character and you feel for him at times even though you do realise he has his issues. Frank grillo is really good as edgertons trainer and the rest of the supporting cast were great too. The story is fantastic, this film is about a broken family and you believe everything and there are some moments where you want to cheer and where you want to cry and that is due to a great story. The script is great, the dialogue made all the characters interesting and the writing helped make it great to. The style if the ufc fights was fantastic with all the hits feeling real and impactful. Overall this is a truly fantastic film that should definitely be seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, where to begin? It's hands down the finest sports film since the 80's. The two brother's story is just as enthralling as the mixed martial arts fighting. Clocking in at just over 140 minutes, Warrior distributes time evenly on developing its characters as its does on the fighting. The two brothers have incredible back stories, neither of which force the viewers bias in any shape or form, making the MMA tournament that they both enter enticing, fulfilling and aesthetic. Tommy Conlon (Hardy) trains under his father Paddy (Nick Nolte), learning discipline and eager to be the best. Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) fights for his family and the money to stop his home from being repossessed. Polar opposite motives and personalities. Their one, common ground lies in their mistrust for their ex-alcoholic father. The Conlon brother's first on-screen meeting's even more suspenseful than De Niro and Pacino in Heat. Warrior would lose points in its one-of-two-ways foreseeable ending if it weren't for how tense it is. A. Must. Watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warrior does not strive to be something unique or differ from the template that has been set for sports movies. Even though the story is quite predictable and similar to some other boxing movies like The Fighter, it is the realization of the drama that is gripping. Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) is an ex-marine who decides to go into the ring in order to enter a winner takes all tournament named Sparta and give the prize money that he receives to the widow of his fellow comrade in war. His brother, Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) is struggling to make ends meet due to which he decides that he will start training again in order to avoid getting evicted from his home.The acting is sensational, with Tom Hardy and Nick Nolte, in particular, giving brutally realistic performances that are able to showcase the trauma and emotions that these characters have undergone.The movie focuses on Mixed Martial Arts, and the choreography of the fight scenes is done excellently with encouraging results. It is easily one of the best sports movies that I have seen.One aspect that sets this movie apart is just how every sequence is integral due to which it is impossible to look away from the screen. The acclaim that the movie has received is well-deserved and fans of the genre will love it.</fullReview>

Story about redemption, forgiveness, wrong decisions, bad choices, letting go of the past and moving on. Nick Nolte should've won the Oscar for his performance, he was incredible as a father who wants to make amends and connect again with his sons. Then we have the two sons, who didn't communicate with each other for years and then they're forced to face one another in the ring. The fight is literal and psychological. The ending was so emotional and also liberating. As a viewer, one doesn't know for whom to root, because the characters aren't one-dimensional but very ambiguous. Definitely watch it. I got the chance only recently and I'm glad I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really watch movies like this but after seeing this movie I will. The reason why I liked this movie was because of the emotional back story and of cause the brilliant and brutal fight sequences. I was gripped to my seat after the first fight scene and after that I knew this was going to be a good movie. I don't usual get upset with movies but the emotional scenes and the outstanding fight scenes it made me get upset. What also made this movie so good was its brilliant cast with no bad actors. I could tell they were trying to make a film you would not forget and well they did the job. This is why i gave it such a high rating and gave it the title of best movie of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece of contemporary cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me be clear about one thing first, this is by far the best wrestling movie I've ever seen. This movie has some of the most intimidating and breathtaking fighting scenes that you cant get to watch in real fights. When the fight commentator confirms that 'Tommy Riordan definitely is real', I figured this really hyped up Gavin O'Connor movie Warrior definitely is real. Daron Aronofsky's The Wrestler (2008) was the fighting movie of my mode with more of life, emotions than the fighting, Micky Rourke acted his best in that Oscar nominated movie. Paddy Conlon reminded me of that old fighter re-entering his life with a lot of difficulties. After awhile Tommy and Brendan Conlon and their twisted relationship resembles another two brothers in The Fighter (2010). But none of them mentioned above are worthy to be the epic one, Warrior, I would say has everything to be remembered as the finest wrestling movie ever made.Although there is a lot of cage in this movie but for me, the story is beyond the cage. I have no say about that war hero part, I think everybody knows that the Iraq War is no heroic war to be fought. People of America need to fight a greater war than that. The last fighting scene tells us too much about brotherhood, about family and about Integrity. I saw the scene as a conversation between two brothers who's passed a long time not seeing each other. When you have a brother who's angry as a mad bull, strong as a lion and not realistic at all, you gotta tame that bull down, sometimes in a cage trapped in an even bigger cage of this world. They both won the fight, more precisely the war, together coming out of the cage as warriors.I'm happy that Tom Hardy is the villain in Christopher Nolan's next Batman movie The Dark Knight Rises, because after Heath Ledger set the standard too high doing The Joker in The Dark Knight, I would be really disappointed to see someone any less charismatic and talented as Tom Hardy. He is the iconic beast with strong instincts and superficial fighting style but unfortunately a very mentally twisted and lonely fighter here. Joel Edgerton, on the other hand a high school Physics teacher trying to get the money for his family. Eventually both of their egos and clashes fall apart in the ring and all that remains is a pure classy drama of brotherhood. Extremely glorious performances from every major character.The movie is tight enough to make you not to do anything during the playtime, dialogues are few in quantity but full of wisdom and quality. About the soundtrack, beside all the well suited sounds in the fights, the last song I believe is a post rock explosive which burst out with joy and glory at the end, nothing could be more appropriate than that. Overall, very good time watching this cult masterpiece. This is the story of the fight of our time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent tear inducing movie, that left me on the edge of my seat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warrior, directed by Gavin O' Connor in 2011, is a powerful and emotional driven movie that places three men into an everlasting feud, until two of them begin to fight over it physically. Between battling their relentless pasts, their undecided futures, their persistent financial struggles, and lifelong regrets, Warrior has to do a lot more with just two men who duke it out in a ring until one of them lies unconscious. Tommy (Tom Hardy) and Brendan (Joel Edgerton) are two brothers who both struggle with financial and personal issues. Their past has them against each other, and both of them struggle to find a truce between one another. When a competition in wrestling comes to town with a $5 million prize, it leads them onto a collision course with one another to determine who takes the money, and the pride over the other. It's the emotional power, and the visualization of the physical pain that the characters go through which makes Warrior an excellent film, and one I would truly recommend.When Tommy shows up on his father Paddy's (Nick Nolte) doorstep for the first time in years, he's subtlety impressed and more-so surprised by his father's sobriety, which is what caused his own disappearance. In return, his father is surprised to see Tommy's appearance after years of his silent estrangement, and graciously welcomes him into his home. With his alcoholic carelessness, what Tommy and Brendan's father did to cause their family to tear apart and take on separate paths cannot be forgiven. His father attempts to reconcile with him, but Tommy only wants him to train with so he can have a shot at the $5 million. He wants nothing to do with trying to have his father back in his life, which is the best his father can get to have him again.On the other hand, neither Tommy or Paddy realize that their brother and son is also going to attempt to win the competition. With personal struggles of his own, and his daughter's medical bills pushing him towards the edge of foreclosure, Brendan, a high school teacher and ex-martial arts player, begins to practice once again in his free time. His wife (Jennifer Morrison) doesn't necessarily approve of this new habit Brendan is forming once again. He shows up late at his home with a couple hundred dollars, in exchange for bruises and cuts on his body which attract the attention of the school's administration (Kevin Dunn). They suspend him without pay, and with no way to hold off his payments on his home, the competition is the only thing that stands between him and financial freedom for him, his wife, and his two daughters.The incorporation of family struggles and issues within this movie, along with the physical action between the family themselves is what truly makes this movie a powerful and emotional film. It gives you a sense of sentimental feelings for the father when all he wants are his sons to come back to him, but also gives you a feeling of acrimony at the same time, and feel as if he deserves to be treated that way by his sons for not being there for them. The way Brendan tries to keep his family tied together, his daughters healthy, and his marriage in check makes you feel sentimental for him. He tries with an exorbitant amount of effort in order to keep his life straight, while still maintaining the goal of winning the competition, while keeping his ties with his estranged brother and his former alcoholic father. Even though he hates his father, Brendan remains functional unlike his brother. The one truly impressive character though is Tommy. This estranged and lost brother makes his own path in order to reach his goal. He's truly a power to fear, and leaves anyone in his way unconscious. Completely disregarding skill or strategy in the competition, Tommy pulls through by only his strength and sheer determination. The thought of beating his own brother in the competition in both ways was satisfying to him, and after their mother left, and they took separate ways, nothing else sounded more accomplishing. Even though he swiftly leaves his opponents in the competition unconscious, while quickly leaving the arena, Tommy still needs help and guidance. Inside the unmovable and invincible persona he tries to pull off, he's just a hurt and lost man. He goes to his father for help and training, and even goes as far as helping him when he gives up his years worth of sobriety. Even then he isn't forgiving, and instead chooses to constantly remind his father of the poor choices he made in life. He reminds him of what he did to his own wife and children. The insane character build up in this film, which is usually unaccounted for in other films, is truly remarkable. Each character has their own traits and personality quirks that make you love them, but hate them at the same exact time.Warrior is not only a suspenseful and action packed film, but also a grueling and sentimental film. It makes you question your feelings for a character on a movie more than any other, it makes even the toughest of men cry, and it leaves you feeling satisfied, as if the conclusion of the movie has brought together the main conflicts within the characters. The storyline itself was incredible. Two brothers brought together by family and financial issues, face each other in a winner-takes-all tournament, with a grand prize of $5 million. The way the movie portrayed the characters throughout the whole story was beyond exceptional. Every scene with the characters made you either confirm a feeling you had for them, or just turn it around on you completely. Warrior is an exceptional movie with truly impeccable acting, great character build up, and it's definitely one movie that I would recommend to anybody who is a fan of either dramas, or fighting films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thoroughly enjoyed this film, the acting was brilliant from the whole cast, it was raw and heartfelt. Although a predictable end scenario its still a very enjoyable watch. Its been described as a modern day rocky, I would slightly agree, minus the cheese! The training and fight scenes were great and as a BJJ and boxing practitioner I enjoyed watching these bits in the film and it does leave you pumped to go and train! If you buy the DVD there's also some great behind the scenes footage from the film and the story behind the 'tapout' brand. The accents were brilliant from both Tom Hardy (who's British) and Joel Edgerton (oz). Both portrayed convincing American accents. Nick Noltes performance was also brilliant in this. The film also features some known faces from the UFC. All in all I highly recommend watching this. A 10\10 for performances and a 9\10 for the story itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautiful, heart-warming, tear-jerking, exciting, EMOTIONAL, uplifting.I can honestly not say enough good things about Warrior. Starring Joel Edgerton, Tom Hardy and Nick Nolte, Warrior is a film about fighting! Edgerton and Hardy (brothers) and Nolte (father) are all fighting for something different. Edgerton is the older brother, fighting to keep his family's home from being foreclosed on by the bank. He's a good, not great fighter with tons of heart. You can't help but root for him as he fills the protypical "underdog" and moral lead of the movie. Hardy the younger brother of the two and the superior skilled fighter is fighting his demons. He is conflicted internally and hurting bad from painful experiences in his life. Hardy deals with the pain the only way he knows how - Fighting. You can't help but to feel empathize with Hardy's character. Nolte the alcoholic father is fighting to stay sober and fighting to win a place back in his sons lives after years of abuse and neglect. The constant rejection he receives from his sons as he attempts to re-establish relationships will have you sympathizing with his character from the very first scene. Nolte's acting chops are very evident and there is a scene with him that will bring a tear to the eye of even the most stoic of viewers. Both brothers who haven't spoken in a decade, through an ironic twist of fate, end up in an MMA tournament where the winner takes home 3 million dollars and the title of Worlds Best Middle-Weight. The film shifts from perspective to perspective of each character and has you rooting for all three. And even though only 1 fighter can win the actual tournament, all three men find a way to win the fight that they need the most. For Edgerton it's money and respect, for Hardy it's peace with himself and his estranged family, and for Nolte it's alcoholism and to get back in the graces of his sons lives. Brilliantly executed. If your not crying at the end there is something seriously wrong with you!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those of you who expect 'Warrior' to be a some sort of fighting extravaganza like the ones Sylvester Stallone or Jean-Claude van Damme used to make, let me get one thing straight: 'Warrior' is a drama about a dysfunctional family. The mother is dead. Her two sons haven't spoken to each other for years and contact with the father is avoided by both of them at all cost. The MMA-contest is but the scenery in which they stand face to face. It easily could have been a tennis tournament or a beauty pageant! That doesn't mean the fighting isn't there. Off course it is. People not familiar with the term MMA are in for a treat. People that follow MMA on a regular basis will probably find the various styles that MMA has to offer not extremely well distilled. What makes 'Warrior' into a fine piece of cinema is not the story as it is seen before in other movies. The performances however of Joel Egderton, Tom Hardy and especially Nick Nolte take it to a higher level and therefore 'Warrior' is definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great movie! One of the best in recent years! The movies' messages of redemption and the importance of family are ongoing throughout all the scenes in the movie and excellent acting allows the viewer to ask himself deep questions at the end. How much pain must a person go through before he is redeemed? How much pain must a person go through that allows him not to forgive? How important is family? Is there a point where it is too late to change the past? And many more. This is not an action-packed sports-movie, that is an original and realistic drama that takes place in the world of mixed martial arts and it is definitely a must-see and one of those movies that every movie fan waits for.</fullReview>

The last part I was biting my nails, pulling my hair, closing my eyes, and finally tears.The movie is a drama and i would conclude saying it is about forgiving and how a heart full of anger is lost and dark but when forgives it finds itself and light comes. The movie is about 2 brothers who are split apart because of different reasons of life. They find each other and have to fight each other.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>British actress Vivien Leigh won an Oscar for playing the most southern of Belles in "Gone With The Wind". It is rare that an actor can take on a roll where they have to learn an accent and make it sound convincing to the audience as well as their peers.The two lead roles in "Warrior "went to an Englishman and an Aussie. They are two of the most astonishing performances I have ever seen.Tom Hardy,and Joel Edgerton, you have left me speechless! Where did you guys come from? How is it possible that you are both virtually unknown? I never for one moment detected a breakdown in your accents. You were both truly remarkable. You don't have to be a MMA fan or even a fight fan to enjoy this movie. It is loaded with action, drama, intensity and gut wrenching emotions. A super supporting cast of Nick Nolte, Jennifer Morrison,and Kevin Dunn just added the icing on the cake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a huge MMA fan, so I didn't know what I was getting into when I decided to watch Warrior (2011) I was pleasantly surprised to see such an entertaining story that really had heart to it. It is about two brothers who leave each other's life very early on. The result is a very tensioned relationship that lasted into their adulthood. The two brothers both end up in a competition together which pits them against each other (a little clichéd, yes) The fight scenes are very well done with enthusiastic commentary by Bryan Callen and Sam Sheridan that really kept the pace quick. Joel Edgerton does a fine job as the more straight-edged chemistry teacher brother but Tom Hardy really steals the show as Tommy, the more disturbed (ex- Marine) and troubled brother of the too. Hardy certainly has the "crazed" look down as it shows up many times during the film much to my amusement. Nolte is great also as the father although I would've liked to see more of a conclusion between him and his sons (although maybe it was better off this way...) The story isn't without it's flaws. The school children who set up a drive-thru theater to watch their chemistry teacher battle it out was a little cringe-worthy. The kids were just a little over-exaggerated with their "Go Mr. C!" signs and their over-sized golf shirts and high-fiving and hollering every time they are shown. The story is obviously ridiculously unrealistic for a couple different reasons but I think the film is not going for realism but trying to tell a heart-felt story. And with that I think they succeeded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I ran across this movie while looking at movies rated 8.0 or higher by IMDb users. I have had very good luck with this system and I am now running out of titles. Despite the lack of big name stars the acting in this movie was Very Good. Both of the brothers and Nick Nolte does an excellent job portraying the recovering alcoholic father. Most of best scenes that define this movie occur in interactions between the Nolte and his sons, (always 1 at a time). The plot is predictable but still manages to hold your attention even though pretty sure how things will turn out. The fight scenes are INCREDIBLE they are almost painful to watch. I ma not big fan of MMA but I have watched a few matches and it's my opinion that this movie shows very well the brutality that takes place in these fights. If you liked "The Fighter" or "Rocky" you will almost certainly find this an entertaining movie.</fullReview>

This one was an exception.This movie had a pretty good cast. The two main characters are 2 guys I really never heard of before which usually means the movie is going to be full of horrible acting and will suck. This one didn't.The main actors were pretty good and didn't overdo things, at times it was more of a real story by them not being big names and not overdoing the acting.The story was a pretty good one that kept you into it, and made you really want to watch the entire thing.

Other than that, this movie was nothing short of amazing. I expected it to be just another fighting movie with great action scenes (Which it did) but it was definitely more than that.

		<fullReview>When I first saw this in theaters I was trying to hold back my tears, mainly because I went to see this with guy friends and didn't want to look like a wimp. I couldn't believe how touched I was by this film and that it was creating this reaction from me. Upon second viewing, I reevaluated the film and must say that it is a good movie but not as great or moving as the first time I saw it. The movie has two protagonists (both brother), each with their justification for entering a MMA tournament and each with personal demons caused by their father. The movie has enough character depth to slip some of the clichés past us, as we're no longer trying to nitpick at the logic of the movie but we're looking for personal triumph of the characters. The only thing that annoyed me was the almost claustrophobic style in which the film was shot. Too many close ups and too much shallow depth of field for my personal taste. I was waiting for the directer to do something gutsy and film a conversation in just a long shot or something. Still I guess that the shooting style compliments the writing and genre, it adds a layer of grittiness or underdog mentality that is a part of the sports drama genre. It also adds a little weight to the demons that the characters carry around through the film. It also had that annoying wobbly camera style that is so synonymous with reality TV shows and unfortunately becoming more common in film. It wanted to add a layer of realism or something but just the close up style would of sufficed. Still this is a good film if you're a fan of underdog sports dramas. It puts a little twist to a very common story, all fans could ask for, to bring something new to a genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We forget about what qualities make an inspiration in todays world. Then we get a movie like Warrior and it all comes back to us. Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton deliver riveting performances. In saying that you cheer for both brothers through out the movie as Tom Hardy plays Tommy Conlon/Rearden who was a marine that went A-WOL after a mission where he lost the entire squad he belonged too. Tommy on his way out was spotted saving another troop after being stuck inside a tank under water.Joel Edgerton plays Brendan Conlon, The older brother Tommy who is a Physic's teacher and father. (The real underdog in life.) After getting notice that his house was going to be foreclosed and refusing to succumb to bankruptcy, Conlon takes up fighting at night for some extra dough in the parking lot of a strip club. After a night in the lot he returns to school with a students brother seeing him and is suspended without pay from the school. Conlon then strikes up pride and goes to his old trainer where he begins his journey through "Sparta" the 16 man competition where the winner takes home $5 million. The only problem with this plan is that his younger brother Tommy is also in the competition and is seemingly the better fighter and is fighting for his best friends family. His bestfriend was killed during Tommy's last mission in the army.An amazing film! Inspiring, Heart wrenching and the total package when it comes to a family held together by passion! Honorary mention to Nick Nolte who plays the two troubled men's father. Outstanding performance once again.Thanks for reading and please follow on twitter. @realaaronford</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Hardy gives an excellent performance in what i would say an excellent film. This film not only has you perched on the edge of your seat as the two brothers fight draws closer and closer but also leaves you in tears throughout and tearing as the credits role.Hardy as ever gives a heart felt and excellent performance and has you captured in the life of tommy riorden from the start. nick nolte also gives another excellent performance and has you in tears.i thought the fight scenes were done very well and did not at all look fake or unrealistic they literally had me on the edge of my seatexcellent film well worth a watch if not to enjoy but hardys excellent body! As a female however i loved the whole thing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie! Initially I thought my husband would like this movie, I hate to admit that I would normally never watch a movie like this simply based on the subject matter; cage fighting. But I'm glad I listened to the reviews.Right from the beginning, starting with The National song, it felt real. It didn't feel over acted, everyone was natural and the pace made sense.The story was brilliant, meaningful and relatable. The action/fighting was exciting, even for someone that doesn't normally like this type of sport. But by far my favorite was the emotional pull each character brought to the movie. The complex family dynamic was enthralling.My only complaint is that it took me so long to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You could over think this to much, but simply, this film is STUNNING!!!!. Tom Hardy in probably the best film he's ever made in the best character he's ever portrayed. It emoted the right emotions, at the right times and you really believe in the cause. Tom Hardy IS the Warrior.You need to watch this film. You have to watch this film. The best film for the last 10 years. I hope there's a not a ''Warrior 2'' - lets not kill it guys, lets keep the magic where it should be. I'm not sure I want to write anymore for this as to be honest the first line said it all - but due to guidelines, you've got to do 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flawless, absolutely flawless. The (British) demi-god that is Tom Hardy has done it again... a superb performance as the broken embittered younger son returning "home" to fight against the wreckage of his early years, and quite predictably (it's in the trailer so not a spoiler) his brother, quite literally. Nick Nolte (who I have never liked up until now - although I knew he was a great actor) is the regretful sorrowful ex-drunk of a father trying to reunite with his sons, who presides over the unravelling feud. Joel Edgerton is a relatively up and coming actor and I think this is his first shot at the mega-big leagues... and what a trial by fire working alongside Hardy and Nolte (in that order IMHO)! This is a brutal fight film - mixed martial arts (MMA) where anything goes; what you would be arrested for outside the cage for GBH is par for the course inside it, where you have no idea how it will end (although you can guess at scenarios) and it keeps you pinned up against the fence until the last, the bloody action interspersed with story of incredible depth, sensitivity and heart. The characters were so finely drawn - Hardy playing a man who's past is revealed bit by bit and despite his animalistic (boy is he like a crazed cornered tiger) hate and fear driven madness you love him. Frank Grillo and Jennifer Morrison were great supporting cast and really add to the drama. But the genius of this film is that there is no damnable Hollywood ending - you are left, tears running down your cheeks, feeling as ragged as if you had just gone a round with Kobo, raw, and spent, heart in pieces with no tidy conclusion when it fades to black. I couldn't have coped with this at the cinema!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unoriginal, clichéd and predictable; brilliant, powerful and moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's an odd thing: Warrior is unoriginal, predictable, clichéd and (almost) formulaic, yet it still manages to be one of the most, entertaining, powerful, moving and brilliant films I've seen in the past few years.It basically, as you probably are aware, revolves around the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) and MMA, which is a bludgeoning blend of, well, whatever you like really. The fight sequences here are much more brawl-like and despite a PG-13 rating, are a brutal flurry of punches and elbows; which thanks to Gavin O'Connor's impressive direction allow the viewer to actually feel each blow, to occasional cringe-worthy effect.At the centre of the film are three marvellous performances from Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton and Nick Nolte. Unsurprisingly, Hardy is practically impeccable, portraying a ex Marine, who's become a perfect storm of directed rage with strong emotional issues, which is wonderfully evident on screen to the point where his screen presence is almost intimidating. However, this makes it harder for him to win our sympathies, unlike Edgerton and Nolte; the former is a completely nice guy, in contrast to Hardy's angry and brooding unpleasantness. He is unusually liked by his class, referred to as "Mr. C", a loving father and husband. In the hands of a lesser actor this genuine good guy could have become sickly sentimental, but Edgerton's charm and charisma manages to make his character work and easily likable. Nolte delivers a magnificent piece of acting, deserving of that Oscar nomination. His performance is so good, that he even manages to make a woefully clichéd line like "If you could find some space in the bottom of your heart...", heartfelt and moving. He is truly a joy in it.With O'Connor's fantastic direction the film pulls on the heartstrings whether it's the emotional family drama or thrilling fights. That the two brothers eventually face other comes as no surprise, but it has a wonderful twist to it, as by the time we get to the climax you don't want either fighter to lose. Its emotional peak is the sort which finds you're insides singing in a stirring fashion. So overall, while hardly original, it is a great film that I wholeheartedly love, which means a lot, considering the fact that I don't enjoy sporting films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing film on so many levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fairly new fan of mma for under a year this film struck me as one to definitely pick up and view. Needless to say I'm impressed by the director's choice of story, actors and choreography.An epic tale that unravels itself furthering the on going drama between two brothers. I was apprehensive at first when seeing that this was over 2 hours, but some journeys are worth the regular 90 minutes.Tom Hardy is an amazing actor, his physical transformation in certain roles eclipses the likes of Bale, De Niro and Theron respectively. Such powerful performances from Jennifer Morrison and Nick Nolte, really sways your kinship of who to route for.I think this movie speaks volumes on the real life events outside of theatres such as...Kurt Angle at one time wanting to be a legit mma fighter gets to act as one here, plays a cinematic version of Fedor even down to his loss via submission. Anthony Johnson fighting in the middleweight division (a weight class that recently got him cut from the UFC after not being able to shed the pounds). Bryan Callen taking the place of Joe Rogan as a commentator for the fights; replicating similarities of the Fear Factor host. And just the fact that unlike Never Back Down this is a highly successful MMA film that will draw a mainstream audience of non fans about the sport, which is now happening with the UFC's FOX deal and just the popularity of this new platform of combat.This is one of those films that really put a stamp on the current status of our interests as a society, highly recommended to all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NO SPOILERS, JUST GIVES YOU A HINT OF WHAT THE MOVIE IS ABOUT.I walked in to watch the movie, i was geared up for something like either "never back down" or "rocky", but to say the truth I wasn't expecting what I saw.The movie was not centered on just mixed martial arts but on various factors. it was inspirational, moving, sentimental, tough and that's to state a few.the plot is about a family torn apart due to all the usual reasons, but that lingering string of love pushes them forward. The mixed martial arts is just an arena for two brothers, one who fights for money for his own family, and the other for venting his hate for his family and his guilt along with it, which is fueled with a cause - to support the family of a comrade who lost his life at war, and believe me their journey is splendid.on the whole, i would recommend this movie for anyone regardless of their taste in movies,because this has it all. and this is my first and only review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forgive unlikely events because of grit and heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warrior is good, very good. What launched this movie into a "favorite" category for me was the heart and soul of the movie. There are lots of movies where fighters train and win the big fight, but usually there is a lack of connection to the characters. Not so with Warrior, we find a completely broken family with extreme baggage(drunk dad, bitter brothers, money problems) where the real fight takes place at home, not in the ring. The family must overcome hurt to be reconciled to one another. Not to worry, the movie is not monopolized by Hallmark moments or filled with cookie cutter sentimental moments. Its all rather gritty and not always comfortable to watch. In addition there is some radical fight scenes and awesome knockouts. Is it unlikely that two brothers end up fighting each other in a world wide fight competition?...yes. I am willing to overlook this unlikely possibility because of the wonderful execution and it should be known that the UFC does have brothers who are great fighters in the same weight class so stranger things have happened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought warrior was a good movie if not really good but it could have been great with a couple of simple tweaks.#1 the purse should have been 2 mil instead of 5. 2 mil is still unrealistic for a mma tourny but 5 mil is just crazy.#2 the tourny should have been over 1 day NOT 2 which is impossible!! if u don't believe this talk to my boy Joe Rogan.#3 this is the thing that bugged me the most, i hated the WWF style slams in the fights!! I am a huge MMA fan and some of the slams are just plain ridiculous.BUT in all i thought it was a great acted movie with Notle putting on an AMAZING performance that should have been Oscar worthy, and u cant go wrong with my boy Bryan Callen!! "I remember him being very unmemorable." CLASSIC! 8/10 and like i said, could have been at least a 9 with a few tweaks that wouldn't have cost the main story anything!</fullReview>

Even though the younger brother spurned the forgiveness of the elder brother but eventually that was what he was really seeking.His pride and anger prevented him from talking the problem out with his brother.He best expressed his challenges in the 'ring'.The 'art of fighting' was a gift given to the two sons by their father.It is in the 'ring' they will find redemption and love,which we all long for. Now will the elder brother spurn the love and forgive his father? On the whole a great movie</fullReview>

So does the ending. A bit predictable and nothing new here. Guy has a loan to pay and a family to support. But come on the all idea is like I can loose the house although both me and my wife have a job and a nice big house with a SUV in the garage.They joined two brother which you will now from the begging will get to the end and then the movie just ends after the final fight... Nevertheless you still get that feeling who is going to win? in the end.And 5 million bucks couldn't they just share the money? :) There was another bad thing the smaller brother (the older one) always get the most spanking and brutal fights... But he had the better technique no doubts on that.Finally and the most important they should had 20m to explain what went wrong with that family maybe with some flashbacks or something like that. And the characters should had been more developed.So these are some details that make difference between a 9 and a 7 I would never give a 10 to fight movie (ahh no there is Fight Club but it's not that much about fighting). Anyway if only all the movies were as good as this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warrior is the most heart-melting movie I've seen in a while. Movies of 2011 have been all the same, and much of a disappointment, if I may say so. But this one is different. The story of two troubled siblings, each fighting for it's own just cause, whilst avoiding the ghosts of the past. Their worlds will rumble as they will have to face each other, their father and their most well-kept secrets in a fight that will decide the life of the one or the redemption of the other. With every fight won, I cried tears of joy, with every punch taken, I feared for the brothers. This movie is so touching, even though it dwells in the primal sport of the MMA. A true masterpiece, probably the best that 2011 has given us so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this movie i a theater is hard. You may have problems staying quiet and not cheering out the characters. I rarely get attached to characters when watching a movie, but Warrior did just that. It starts out by building up the characters into people you want to see succeed. Not only is this a great movie about fighting, it is a fantastic movie about a broken family. Though there are several clichés along the story, you can't dismiss the fact that this is a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat. When the climax comes i had no idea how it would turn out, it was simply a great experience watching this movie. I'll also have to mention that Tom Hardy did an amazing job with his character.</fullReview>

It doesn't take a genius to work out that this is the best fight movie ever created. I have to congratulate the writers for the story line and director for the well crafted fight scenes. Definitely watch this for all fight movies/ neutrals I guarantee that you will think so too and I am not exaggerating.

		<fullReview>I am a Iraq war vet and a 3 yrs sober recovering alcoholic. This movie was the best movie I have ever seen in my life. I immediately called my dad after seeing this movie and told him to forget out about Rocky and Rudy(his 2 favorite movies). Warrior is a movie that tells the story of humanity NOW. It is the only thing I've seen since I returned home from the war in 2006 that even comes close to telling the story of what people go through when they come home.For those that have a recovering vet in their family this is the movie that gives you a perspective.My hat is off to the people who made this movie happen.The best part about this movie is that it was not Hollywood.It was blunt, in your face, and to the point.It displays all the strings that make up the heart and tugs on each just to hear the sound they make.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never written a review on IMDb, even though I reference this sight at least 5 times a day. I remember seeing the preview for this movie in the theater and knew I wanted to see it. However, it was gone from the theater in a blink. I just watched it on DVD and am simply stunned! This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. In the very beginning it seemed like it was going to be one of those low budget, small town movies that I may end up turning off. 10 minutes in I knew I was wrong. This story takes off and doesn't let up. It has a long running time but in no way drags. The acting between the brothers and father (Nick Nolte!) was just right for the story. By the end I was almost moved to tears (I don't think that has happened since Saving Private Ryan.) For the record, this movie KILLED 'The Fighter' that got so much hype last year. I'm sure lots of people will disagree with me on that one but just watch it for yourself. I will be buying this one on DVD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A review for people who don't like UFC fighting yet, somehow, end up watching this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood tends to do things in spurts. When they make one sort of movie, you can pretty much guarantee there will be many more soon after. Back in the 1930s, it was gangster films...one after another. The 1950s and early 60s, it was nothing but westerns. In the late 70s, it was roller skating and CB radio films. Now, in the 2010s, it's fight films. First was "The Wrestler" and then "The Fighter" and then "The Warrior". So, from this standpoint, "The Warrior" isn't exactly original--it's one in a string of similar films. Is it any good? Or, is it just derivative? Before I go any further, I have a VERY important confession to make. I don't like UFC fighting and think it's barbaric. As a libertarian sort of guy, I am not for banning it--hey, if they want to kill each other, that's their right...just don't expect me to pay to go see it. So you might wonder why I would watch the film in the first place--a very, very good question. I am a film nut--a total fanatic. Considering that I've reviewed over 15,000 films on IMDb, it's not surprising I'd review "The Warrior"--simply because of the process of elimination! Additionally, I am trying to see as many of IMDb's Top 250 as I possibly can--and I only have a few more to go. This brings up an important question, then--for whom am I writing this review?! After all, if you love UFC, you'll love this film (hence the very high rating)--and if you don't, you'll almost certainly never watch the film in the first place! So, my review is essentially for about a dozen folks out there--people who are either being forced to watch the film against their wills or who are so nuts about movies that they'll watch anything."The Warrior" is, for me, a turn off your brain and enjoy it sort of film. You cannot over-analyze this one or you'll likely turn it off. Think about it--two guys who have barely any experience in UFC fighting get to go to the biggest tournament in the universe AND although they have different last names, they are brothers and the rest of the folks in the movie only learns this (cue suspenseful music!!) before the final match that they are brothers!! The problem is that early on in the film you learn they are brothers and you just KNOW it will all come down to this! There is zero suspense in this regard....zero. I really wish they'd just abandoned this plot element.There are other aspects of the film that were much better. The men are also dealing with an alcoholic father (Nick Nolte) and this provides for some interesting moments. The old man wants to reunite with them but he's simply burned too many bridges. Additionally, the school teacher angle for the one brother was pretty interesting. I also appreciated some of the twists that do occur in the final match--and it is quite emotional and touching. Overall, this is a decent enough film that is ultimately very violent and rather predictable. Worth seeing if you're into this sort of thing but otherwise, probably not the film for you. I really wish they'd try making another similar sort of movie but without the predictability--which, unfortunately, is the problem with most fight movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The real fight is outside of the cage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Warrior" strikingly illustrates that victory is possible in defeat, and it's not what happens during the final bout that defines Gavin O' Connor's picture, but what occurs afterwards. "Warrior" is a poignant, touching drama where familiarity with the sport isn't necessary, because ultimately it's not about what transpires in the cage. The movie presents dynamic, strained relationships and the bond of family, coupled with the challenging choices we must make throughout life.The narrative focuses on three men: estranged brothers Tom and Brendan Conlon (Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton) and their father, Paddy (Nick Nolte). Tom, a withdrawn marine, has come home to Pittsburgh to train for a spot in "Sparta," a winner-takes-all MMA tournament held in Atlantic City. He is willing to put aside his abusive upbringing in return for his assistance in training. Paddy, a recovering alcoholic, embraces the opportunity to reconnect with his son, even though Tom makes is clear that their relationship will consist strictly as one of trainer and fighter.Meanwhile, across the state in Philadelphia, former UFC fighter and current high school teacher Brendan finds himself in need of cash in order to save his home from foreclosure. Against the wishes of Brendan's wife Tess (Jennifer Morrison), Brendan becomes involved in low-level MMA contests, and suspended by the school board once word spreads. One would need be hopelessly naive not to recognize that this is all going to come down to a match between Tom and Brendan, with a torn father on the sidelines. The first half of the film is mostly devoted to the dramatic setup and character development, before it launches into the Atlantic City bouts that take up the majority of the second half of the film."Warrior" offers strong performances across the board, two of which are standouts. Tom Hardy, who redefined his career with his screen-searing work in "Bronson," (2008) is simply tremendous. The word "volcanic" was often used to describe Hardy's work in "Bronson," and it applies here as well. Nick Nolte, who has received his share of accolades over a long and prosperous career, provides a terrific performance as a remorseful father who is desperate to reconnect with his sons.This real battle here is outside of the cage, involving redemption, reconciliation, and putting demons to rest. O'Connor's filming has a gritty, grainy, sensibility that is only enhanced by utilizing locations around the Pittsburgh area. Putting aside the fighting in the cage, it's the emotional tussle they must contend with that is far more daunting than any opponent in the cage. "Warrior" has the heart of a champion that keeps this film alive and pumping to the bloody end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warrior is a story about two estranged brothers forced by circumstance to enrol in to a MMA Cage Fighting tournament. This puts both on a collision course to potentially face each other in an ultimate battle. Joel Edgerton plays a schoolteacher while Tom Hardy, an ex-marine with a haunting past, plays the younger brother. What sounds like a man-flick full of blood and fists is anything but! There is a decent plot only elevated by incredible performances particularly by the diverse, Tom Hardy. Nick Nolte does his job well as the drunk father who mumbles through his lines and Edgerton, is only overshadowed by Hardy.With the popularity of UFC, it's no surprise that director and writer, Gavin O'Connor took a stab with bringing a movie like Warrior to the masses and although you may compare it to Rocky, it stands on it's own feet and does it well. The action sequences in the fights are shot remarkably well and forces the viewers to feel! Warrior is a great cinematic feature with something for everyone and comes highly recommended for all moviegoers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warrior tells the story of two brothers in their quest to succeed using MMA as their gateway to success. Tommy Riordan played by Tom Hardy plays an ex war veteran feeling the demoralizing affects from the war who feels that his life has lost a sense of meaning as if it has run its course. Tommy enters the MMA tournament in efforts to relinquish any self-doubt and shed a new light into his life back home from the war. Tommy's brother Brendan played by Joel Edgerton, enters the tournament in hopes of winning to save his family from their financial crisis they are in. The two brothers never had a good relationship being that Brendan(Edgerton) abandoned his brother and abusive father when he was 16. Tommy (Hardy) never truly forgave him as they both parted their separate ways in life. The two of them end up fighting for the championship.As someone who has done MMA for 5 years, this movie instantly appealed to me. However, the one thing that I enjoyed most about the movie was the fact that you don't have to have current or prior knowledge of MMA in order to like the movie. Unlike most sport movies in which the movie mainly revolves around the actual sport itself, Warrior focus more on the tarnished relationship of Brendan and Tommy. It also focuses on the relationship they have with their father (Nick Nolte) who abused them when they were kids. Their father desperately attempts to win both of them back though the horror of his actions make it difficult for his two sons too.Tom Hardy executes his bad ass character to near perfection as the same goes for Edgerton. As the movie progresses you get a real genuine idea of how broken and weak the relationship is between Tommy, Brendan and their father.The movie is incredibly moving and intense. You really get the feel for how important family is by the end of the movie. The last scene where Tommy and Brendan fight is one of the most powerful and riveting scenes I have witnessed in cinema. It is not the fighting that makes that last scene so powerful, but how emotionally driven the scene is.Fantastic movie regardless of your views or knowledge on MMA.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really know what to tell you. If I had to explain this movie to you, it would sound like a typical average brainless Hollywood-movie.The Thing is though, this movie has something. I don't know what it is, maybe it is best described with "heart". This movie got heart.I had never expected I actually might get emotional from this movie, after a brutal fight between two men who look like killing-machines, but it managed to do so. Once again, I have no idea why.I have to say though, the IMDb-rating shouldn't be this high. It shouldn't be in the TOP 250 movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Warrior" is not a movie for adrenaline junkies who prefer everything to blow up every 5 seconds. Its not a movie for cynical sports movie buffs who want every second of the movie covered with what happens inside the ring, or for those die hard Rocky fans who want every fighting movie to be Rocky. BUT this IS a movie for those who love the perfect mix of emotion and adrenaline inducing action. For those who like good story- telling mixed with stellar acting. Perhaps the premise of this movie is a bit familiar, two estranged brothers enter a competition which offer a big prize (each wanting the winnings for their own private issues) - its no surprise that they would meet in the finals. But the icing on the cake of this movie is the level of emotion it brings to the table. The connection the characters make with the viewing public is amazing.A major part of this level of engagement is due to the acting. Especially due to the stellar performances of Tom Hardy and Nick Nolte. The scene with drunk Nolte and Tom Hardy is among the most emotional scenes I have ever seen in a film. Also the final battle between the two brothers is a grand cinematic moment.The action is gritty and engaging. The fighting sequences are well executed - thrilling and almost edge of the seat. But I believe it was not the intention of the director to focus heavily on the fights - he was more obsessed with portraying the lives of these characters. To portray why a physics teacher and a father of two would go in to a ring fighting ruthless competitors, or what strives an ex-marine who went AWOL to risk exposure. And to portray a father who desperately tries to right past wrongs.Some may argue that this movie is cliché, some die hard fans of rocky or those who call themselves street fighters and what not may call this movie something not worth seeing. But I don't mind some clichés if they are executed well - just as warrior does...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much more than just a fighting movie. Brilliant in all senses.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a shame that in the past they gave all the Oscars to "Rocky" but they couldn't recognize a wonderful job like "Warrior". That movie is good but completely egoistical in terms of story, just a man and his will to fight and survive; "Warrior" is about two men, their will and fight to survive AND help others. That's important, very noble and what really defines the greatness of the film.On one corner we have Brendan (Joel Edgerton), school teacher, dedicated husband and father who's having plenty of trouble in paying the debts of the family's new house. And on the other corner there's Tommy (Tom Hardy), brave soldier who fought in Iraq and he's back to his hometown with several plans in mind. What unites these characters are: 1) a MMA championship with a big prize for the greatest fighter; 2) both are good fighters, one heavily trained and the other trying to get back in shape; 3) they are brothers and they don't have a good relationship with each other and also with their father (Nick Nolte), a trainer who had serious drinking problem for years and now that he's sober he tries hard to fix things in the family. The best he can do is training Tommy for the battle but nothing more than that. 4) Fate (to be explained later on the review).From the promotional stills released about the film it's no big deal that both brothers will have a huge duel against each other, just like most of us know that Rocky will have a fight against Apollo Creed in "Rocky", and one might wonder why bothering in seeing this if the movie is that predictable. But you must see it, regardless of such aspect. The whole way until the final moment is exciting, thrilling, one of the greatest things ever presented on a film of this kind, which is quite rare. What impressed me about "Warrior" was its interesting way of presenting a critic on the current social/economical situation of America inside of a martial arts picture. As explained earlier, fate brought the Conlon brothers up to this situation in subscribing to the championship and hoping to get the money (but only one can win). Brendan desperately needs the money for the already mentioned debts he has; Tommy needs it for great reasons that I won't detail here, one of the amazing surprises "Warrior" holds to its viewers. They're fighting for good causes but they wouldn't be in such extreme if it wasn't for what their government did with them: Tommy and Brendan are products of the millions of dollars spent in supporting war and conflicts (fought by Tommy) that later proved to be one of the many economical problems faced by several people (and here we include Brendan) who lost their homes and/or had problems to pay for it. So, it's not just a bunch of guys kicking and punching each other for vain and egoistical reasons or to impress someone at the end of the day; it's a movie that makes a reflection on why similar people are put against each other when their reason to live and survive are the same. And it also deals with themes like forgiveness, struggle, the importance of family, so it's not just about the fight, it's bigger than that. But when we get to the awaited fights we have unforgettable moments, a great spectacle that doesn't disappoint. Hard to choose to which Conlon brother we cheer up more! "Warrior" greatness doesn't stop here. The acting is so fabulous, so careful and it's very hard to not get impressed. Edgerton and Hardy are really amazing (their dialog on the beach was one of the highest points of the film, brilliant) with the first playing a very likable guy, real, one easy to be connected, and the latter playing a savage, lonely wolf type who has his tearful moments. The contrast between both brothers were greatly worked. However, the show was from Nick Nolte who resurrected with perfection in a role that sounds so clichéd but it's not, and he deserved a fair Oscar nomination. A long time he wasn't this good and we have to thank writer/director Gavin O'Connor for always having Nolte in mind for such character, and quoting in his words the movie wouldn't exist if Nolte wasn't involved. I rest my case here, I really loved it, one of the biggest surprises I've ever had while watching movies so, stop everything you're doing and go watch it now. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fighting Movie that Keeps the Realism of Fighting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can see the resemblance that this film has toward other underdog films like "Rocky," so if you are expecting something new, you'll probably be disappointed. However, despite all of this, director Gavin O'Connor did a tremendous job of presenting a good story; presenting very good human drama behind these characters, character development, and presenting scenes that are extremely emotional. I really found myself being teary eyed throughout various moments in this film and crying at the climax. Everything was well executed: the character development, storytelling, and the human drama that leads to various of scenes that creates an emotional feel to it. For example, as you watch Brendan go into the octagon ring and face off the athletes who are known as the best, you can't help the fact of wanting to cheer for him and wanting to see him claim that victory. The storytelling was well used, focusing on both characters equally and never going offtrack on portraying one more over the other. This will lead you to possibly cheer for both characters, but you might split on who you might cheer the most. Tommy, portrayed by Tom Hardy, is vicious and is simply an animal and Brendan, portrayed by Joel Edgerton is a Rocky type of character; a good guy and a character who you just can't hate. The story never went offtrack and focused only on the life of these two brothers which leads to climax that was seen in the trailer. Usually, flashbacks are presented in any film in order for viewers to understand the characters or to get a basic idea behind the story. There are no flashbacks, but by watching the great performances by the cast and hearing the dialogue of these characters as they interact one another, you somehow understand their pain and understand how damaged all of them are without any presentation of flashbacks. Just by listening to how Brendan talks to his father and to how Tommy interacts with his brother, you can see that they are damaged and that this family had a rough past. Being a fan of the sport, I will say that if you enjoy watching UFC or any type of mixed martial arts, then you will surely enjoy watching these fights. Hearing about this film, I expected this film to be like "Never Back Down," or "The Fighting," where the film presents a dumb storyline with ridiculous fighting styles and actors committing wire action moves that you probably will see in a Chinese kung-fu film. This film presented realistic fighting where actors are actually committing moves and fighting styles that you actually see in any type of MMA match. I found myself cheering and enjoying these matches as if I was actually watching one live. These fights were well presented; the camera angles behind some of the matches were not well presented, which is possibly my only complaint about this film. However, despite some bad camera angles, these fights were exciting and presents some pretty awesome knockouts. I won't lie, I had a huge grin behind some of these matches, especially toward Tommy's fights. Watching how he knocks out his opponents was gratifying. Have you ever watched a match where two of your favorite fighters are at the main event facing each other and you don't want either one to lose? This is the feeling that you will get when you watch the climatic battle between both brothers inside of the ring. The film did a great job of following both characters, leading you to have that feeling of not wanting to see neither one lose. The acting was just superb, as every actor gave it their best and were great portraying each character. Tom Hardy as the vicious Tommy, Joel Edgerton as the Rocky type of hero, Brendan, and Nick Nolte as the father. These characters are damaged and the acting by these three really portrays how damaged these characters are without the usage of flashbacks to portray the pain that they carry. Everyone gave it their best, leading to great performances by every single actor/actress.This film does not present nothing new to the underdog genre. However, this film is possibly one of the best film of 2011. A great storyline that focused on two characters equally, great performances, MMA action that was actually accurate and exciting to watch, and well focused human drama.</fullReview>

Both sons fighting against their devils from childhood. The old man, Paddy, is that devil from the past and he's fighting hard for a last glimpse of redemption. The wife, fights with desperation for the wellness of her family, wanting her husband to get away from harm. But the last warrior is you. You will fight with thousands of emotions. All the characters are fighting for the humblest and more beautiful ideals and hence it's impossible to cheer less for anyone. This brings a gigantic complexity to the plot and the final showdown, which, will bring you to wish for every character to achieve their goal, something that the events and structure of the plot render as an impossible.They're all humans and for that, you can't pick a human over the other...</fullReview>

Period.It's the whole package: 3 incredible male leads - Joel Edgerton, Tom Hardy and Nick Nolte, and each of them in the role of their lives. And boy have they trained up for this one. It might not stand closer scrutiny from MMA experts, but it sure captures the UFC atmosphere of such an event, and the way these guys are going at it looks nothing but real.But in the end it's the story line that brings it home. It is so absolutely gripping and emotional, I was balling my eyes out when the credits rolled across the screen. If you're missing this movie, then you cannot be helped.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARRIORWARRIOR packs a surprising punch! Despite its apparent disinterest in avoiding the predictable and generic formula of an underdog's rise to fame/victory, it contains an unexpected depth that in return raises the film far above others of its kind. The narrative skillfully crafts us into a tense family drama. Our curiosity is satisfied as we are drawn into the history of the main characters. The film presents an alcoholic father (Nick Nolte) who has been sober for a thousand days. He has two sons, Brendan (Joel Edgerton) and Tommy (Tom Hardy) who have not seen him or each other for years. Brendan has minimal contact with his Father, strictly by phone or mail. Despite being brought up in a household that suffered the effects of alcoholism he has made a success of himself. He has a wife and two young daughters. He became a Physics teacher, moving away from fighting for a living following a hospital scare. Regardless of his best efforts, life still throws him a curve ball and he struggles financially due to medical costs amounted by one of his daughters during recovery from a serious illness. He is left with an ultimatum, find extra money from somewhere quick or forfeit his family home.Tommy became estranged to his father and brother having chosen to follow his mother after the break down of his parents' marriage. Time passes and their mother suffers an uncomfortable death, unable to afford hospital treatment due to a lack of insurance. Tommy joins the Marines to make a new life. This fell apart when his entire unit was killed as a result of friendly fire. Left as the only survivor, Tommy vowed to look after the wife and children of his closest friend who died along with the rest of the unit. There is a clear parallel between the two brothers. Their turbulent childhood had a knock on effect making them stronger and braver than they might otherwise have been. Their individual and collective hardships helped shape their nature towards facing difficulties, to fight, to become warriors.I think one of the reasons this film stands out from the crowd is because despite it's borderline incredible journey of two estranged brothers who enter a $5 million prize, winner takes all, mixed martial arts competition there still remains a great believability and understanding with regard to the brothers' dilemmas, difficulties and to the complex nature of their family's history and relationship towards one another.Family feuds, financial difficulties, illness, loss, substance abuse, War, are all common issues within society. By supplementing these themes into the characters story arc the narrative creates an extra powerful new dimension that many viewers can relate to in some way. Life isn't always fair and to quote Forest Gump, it is like a box of chocolates, you never no what your going to get and regardless of your best efforts sometimes you might find yourself in hot water with your back up against the wall. We can therefore empathise with the two brothers and their troubles and be encouraged by their non-defeatist attitude.Nolte's performance is exceptional. Far from two dimensional, his character has great depth and realism highlighting a reality that is far from black and white. Having rid himself of an alcohol dependency, he now seeks redemption following a cold reunion with his youngest son, Tommy. His uncomfortable, mixed mannerisms display a broken man thrilled to see his sons again in the spotlight, yet clearly haunted by his past. The tones of his voice superbly echo his regret, sorrow and eagerness to make a mends. The two brothers are fighting a lot more than each other in the arena. They are warriors fighting the cruel cards life has thrown at them. This is a film about second chances and up hill struggles with the potential brutality of life mirrored in the arena. I would strongly recommend this film to anybody and I guess this is my point. The substance of the film is predominantly concerned with stressing universal issues within today's society. Plus, if you just want to see two hours of people fighting each other, you will be far from disappointed by the aggression and brutality found within this winner takes all fighting arena.' I'm sorry Tommy, I'm sorry. Tap Tommy. It's OK. It's OK. I love you. I love you Tommy.'(Brendan to Tommy. Fighting in the cage)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK sports movie but overlong and doesn't deliver the story as it thinks it does (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came to watch Warrior knowing that the general opinion was that it was a superior sports movie but also that a lot of people seemed to have been taken by surprise by how good it was, both critics and audience. So, imagine my surprise to find that in my opinion we had a potentially really good sports movie that is rather hampered by a flawed attempt to be more than just two men in a cage hitting each other. The plot is fairly obvious but this is part of it being a genre film; two brothers from a broken home, long since separated from each other and also their now-sober father. Trained as fighters as children, the two are now a high-school teacher who turns back to MMA to earn enough to save his home from the bank, while the other is haunted by his past in the Marines.If you do not already know that the two will meet in the final then I salute you and your lack of cynicism, but the majority of viewers will know this and this will only add to the sense of anticipation. In regards the fight scenes, they are brutal and engaging. I'm really not a fan of this activity and any attempts to watch it have left me cold, but this is shot really well, taking you right into the action with a sense of urgency and a sound design where you feel every impact. This is the reason that the second half of the film really gets going. Unfortunately when it is not focused on these conflicts, the film doesn't have the same impact. I can see the potential and i can understand that some loved the rather slow and mostly unspoken relationship backstory, but for me it was almost too slow, too unspoken and with too little in there to justify the approach. At times it gets close to being pretentious as it grinds out the clichés in an overly worthy fashion and doesn't provide the heart of the story despite having so much time to do so. Speaking of which, the film is painfully overlong and could easily have lost a good 20 minutes and been the better for it.In terms of performances, the film is generally good. Hardy shows us what a good Bane he could be and he is impressive in his body and performance; I would have liked to have seen him have more to work with than he does, but he does a lot with looks and presence. Edgerton has more of a human face and as a result it is him that the viewer feels more for; he is good here, both in the ring and out of it despite most of his material being a cliché. Nolte is Oscar-nominated here and I will say I am surprised. He has good presence and he does seem to get his character and deliver a lot of pain, but I didn't think the film valued him as much as it could have done, as he does rather seem secondary to most of it. The three men do help make the film better than it could have been, but they all deserved more than the script gave them.Warrior seems to be loved by the majority of viewers but for me it left me rather cold. The fights in the second half ramp up the drama and it does deliver as a solidly entertaining sports film, but the rest of it simply doesn't work as well as it should have done. The cast deserved better and, although they do a lot with their performances, the film moves too slowly and with too little impact any time the focus is on character and family. There is a lot of beef in this film for sure, but I was disappointed to find that there wasn't anywhere near enough meat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good part of this movie success comes with the time it was released.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are lots of good things in this movie. You won't see a bad acting, not even from the fight judge. I didn't remember when I've seen big muscled actors making bigger interpretations in a movie before, and those guys are f+++ing big. Warrior also give lotta attention to the fight itself, and half of the movie they're doing just that: fighting. And the fights look so real that actors probably got some injures while training and recording scenes (Tom Hardy, actually, broke some ribs and fingers from hands and feet broke up during shots). So, since half of the movie is based on the Sparta Championship, you get sucked into it.So far I've told you the good, now the bad comes in.1-I can be wrong, too bad I'm human, but the plot seems to have a lack in its story, because I didn't understand what made those brothers hate each other so much. Their dad was a drunk prick and screwed up with his sons, nice, but how exactly? I wanna know how. 2-The other issue is: you know what will happen every time. Is too obvious, from the begin to end. 3-Another missing in this movie is when Paddy (Nick Nolte, the dad) starts training his son Tommy. Well, there ain't a single scene whe he actually trains Tommy. 4-Certain movie point Tommy gets out for a walk and then he mets his brother Brendan. That would be OK if he could, like a divine inspiration, guess that his brother would be, alone and coming out of nowhere, appearing in the same spot as he was going. It could be a coincidence? Nops, watch the movie and you'll see how strange it is. 5-Everytime there's just two people talking each other in some ambiance, the scenes gets black and yellow. Even a movie nobody could handle such as Serbian Film could do better than this. Its boring to watch this set of lights because is kinda obfuscate the actors and doesn't let you to see they facial expressions. Nick Nolte did a great acting in this movie and in the first scenes his face gets hard to understand. 6-The first part of the movie, when you start to know the characters, you see a Tommy drinking like and idiot, just like if real MMA fighter could forget about they diets and do whatever they want with their bodies. You can't compare this behavior with a real fighter. It's stupid. And it was the first thing Rocky took care when he decided go back to the competitions (who doesn't remember Rocky waking up to drink 5 whole raw eggs? not exactly a pre-workout meal, but its something better than Tommy drinking like his messed up father).After watch Warrior I could just though that its success is due the time of release. We're just living the day MMA beated Boxe down and become a popular sport around the world. The day bodybuilding become so popular, we'll probably watch "No Pain, No Gain" as a masterpiece. Since Warrior was a great success, producers will certainly try a sequel and I bet it will pass like, 5 or 6 years before this, just to explain what actions lead this family to ruins, because Now I just can't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warrior has so many elements which normally press the wrong buttons with me. But when the end credits rolled, I was totally mesmerized. It's one of the best films of the year.I don't know much about MMA or UFC. But although this film is about fighters and UFC, it's more about family, redemption and coming to terms with a painful past. I applaud the makers for making a film that takes it's time to develop. Characters are humans in this film, not video game characters. This film could have been made/marketed for the 15-19 yr old male-group. But that would have produced a very different and worse film.All the main actors do excellent work, with the two main actors (Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton) carrying this film from start to finish. Noteworthy are also Nick Nolte and Frank Grillo as Edgerton's trainer.Director Hood finds the right gritty feel and look for the film, as well as getting the best out of his cast and crew (with 4! editors). The fight scenes are exiting, but especially Hardy's scenes where his caged anger is about to explode are powerful.One negative thing: Too bad this movie could not do without the (almost obligatory) nod to the uniform and military.It's a great achievement and this deserved to do better at the box office. I'm afraid that producers with similar ideas will want a film that more is Rocky.I give it 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Action movie of 2011, and something to be seen again and again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warrior is Gavin O' Connor's best movie to date, and certainly one of the best action movies of all times. Beyond the top-notch, and quite realistic action sequences, the movie--as the t-shirt of Brendan Conlon's trainer Frank shows--has the 'soul of a lion'. The backdrop of an MMA championship remains so, in the backdrop, with the key element of drama remaining the tension and struggles of a broken family, consisting of a ex-alcoholic war-veteran father, an elder son who teaches school Physics, and the younger son who suffers from PTSD from the war in Iraq.Forgiveness comes hard when the wounds are too deep, when the man to forgive was responsible for the premature and miserable death of your mother, and when the elder brother stood you up when you tried to run away from the abusive father. Tommy Conlon finds refuge in the marine corps, only to see his best buddy die from friendly fire. He goes AWOL, takes his mother's name, and surfaces back in the States. His father Paddy is the best trainer he's had, the main responsible for making him a child prodigy in wrestling, and despite the loathing, he knows that's the way to go if he's to get the money to support his dead buddy's family.Brendan Conlon the elder brother has always resented his father's preference for his younger brother, the better fighter. Now a schoolteacher, with a delayed and oppressive loan, he knows the three jobs between his wife and him are not sufficient to retain their house, and tries his hand at MMA, harking back to his past stint at the UFC, where his performance was nothing to write home about. He knows the prize money is the way out of a potential bankruptcy, and knows the choices are difficult, but limited.Paddy Conlon the war veteran has been off the bottle for a thousand days and seeks redemption in the church, and Herman Melville's Moby Dick. Try as he might to get closer to either son, the two sons have only thing in common as Tommy puts it sometime late in the movie--they both have absolutely no use for their ex-alcoholic wife-beating father. He tries nevertheless, taking abuse and ridicule in his stride, since he knows forgiveness is the only way out of his past sins. Nick Nolte's role is understated and so realistic it defies comprehension. For that matter, both the protagonists are so good I kept expecting to see either one of them being actual MMA fighters (having not recalled either of their earlier movies). The fights between them are realistic, and hold your attention without being tacky.The climax is sure-fire tear-jerker with the two brothers fighting out each other, but more than that their own demons. One gets to see that blood is indeed thicker than water, but without the message being drilled into place.Worth seeing again and again. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warrior: A Powerful Film About Family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARRIOR is one of the finest films of the year - and that is a statement coming from one who does not like violent films. The film does deal with UFC fighting, a mania incomprehensible to most), but it is more an extraordinary story about the magnetism of family. Writer Gavin O'Connor (with Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman) also directs this intense film and his sensitivity in bringing out brilliant performances from everyone in his cast is simply amazing. This is a monumental achievement worthy of Academy Award consideration.Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) has returned from a tour with the USMC in Iraq where he ran away after saving his fellow marines in a near fatal situation, witnessed the death of his closest buddy Manny, and went AWOL from the stress: he returned to the US to make sure Manny's family was cared for. An ex fighter, Tommy drinks and does drugs and finally returns to his father Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte) to gain new training as a fighter. The Conlon family history is tragic - the mother took Tommy away from Pittsburgh hoping her older son Brendan (Joel Edgerton) would follow - escaping the spiraling alcoholism of the father. Tommy moved with his mother who subsequently dies: Brendon stayed with his father and the family ties seem to have been forever broken. When Tommy returns Paddy is 1000 days sober, but instead of love for this father Tommy loathes him and only wants his expertise as a trainer. Paddy consents and the two begin training at Paddy's old friend Colt Boyd's (Maximiliano Hernández) Gym. In Philadelphia Brendan is a high school Physics teacher and has married Tess (Jennifer Morrison) and they have two little girls, one of whom has renal damage that has been so costly that both parents must each hold down two jobs to survive. Brendan happens upon a Mixed Martial Arts fight (he spends his nights as a bouncer in a club making very little money) and decides that the money he can gain through fighting may save his home from going into foreclosure): he fights, and wins $200. When he shows up at school to teach he is bruised and cut and is suspended without pay for disgracing the school (the principal - Kevin Dunn - hates to lose his finest teacher). With a dim financial outlook Tess hesitantly agrees for Brendan to re-enter fighting for money and Brendan hires his old friend Frank Campagna (Frank Grillo) to train him.There is a much publicized tournament for the championship in Mixed Martial Arts in Atlantic city and through many strange coincidences the two brothers end up in the final fight - fighting each other. The end is brilliant in its understatement, not stooping to resolve all family problems, but at the same time having the courage to show how powerful is the love of two brothers no matter how different their lives. Both Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton are brilliant as the brothers and Nick Nolte gives the performance of his career. Every character created by this extraordinary cast is pitch perfect. For this viewer this is one of the most moving films that has been released in a very long time. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best This Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, Warrior was one of the best surprises of this entire year in film. It's not very often you find a movie that, in all actuality, was about as formulaic as you can get within the context of it's genre, and yet was still a very good film. There really isn't anything new that Warrior brings to the table as far as films about fighters are concerned, except it centers on Mixed Martial Arts instead of boxing. But it really doesn't matter because the story, screenplay, and acting make this one of the best movies I've seen in 2011. And no performance was more compelling than that of Nick Nolte's. I'm not really sure what's been going on with Nolte in the last few years or so, other than some minor film roles and some legal problems. But in Warrior, he delivers what may be the best performance of his career, and certainly a performance that deserves to be nominated for an Oscar. I have a sneaky suspicion that some of the demons that haunt his character here hit a little too close to home for him. But it's also probably some of those negative experiences that helped him deliver such a mesmerizing performance. It should be noted that the film starts to drag just a bit in the second half. But all is forgiven in one of the best conclusions to a film I've seen in a very long time. If you're a little gun shy about this one because you may not be the biggest MMA fan in the world, don't let that keep you from seeing this film. Don't get me wrong. The MMA aspect is definitely on full display here. But it's what surrounds the fight scenes that makes Warrior a very satisfying movie. And it's what surrounds the fight scenes that also makes Warrior one of the best films of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gut wrenching action and emotions that will make your cry... The perfect movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the movie started, i realized it is not just another movie i went to see in theatre, it's much more than that. But the movie truly surpassed my expectations. I was shell shocked during the movie with action, emotion and bone breaking shots. While we guys consider movies like Never back down, the fighter, fighting with utter respect, but believe me guys Warrior stands tall against these movies. you know MMA stuff man that kills it.Tom hardy delivered the perfect emotional punch in the movie along with the bone crushing jab. The story revolves around an estranged family which is haunted by alcholism, favoritism and domestic abuse. Nick nolte played the role of drunk father in past who leads to the separation of his family. In the past he favored his younger son in the wrestling training over his elder one, left his wife when she was ill, part ways from his family. As a result, Tom hardy moves with his mother with a heart full of hatred, anger. After her mother's death he enlisted in the marine, where he saved the life of fellow marines but become AWOL without claiming any medal. On the other side his elder brother moves with his girlfriend gave a switch to his carrer by becoming Physics teacher. While their parent trying to recover from alcholism.The movie would have been a violence filled, bloodied, clichéd, to other MMA movies if sole focus was on the fight scenes. But it is much more than that, thanks to Gavin o conner Who worked on making strong characters and these characters are well displayed by the perfect acting of the three main actors. Hardy and nolte deserved the academy award for such a fabulous performance.The only negative lines i hold for this movie is about the ending where it is left to decide for themselves about the character after the last fight. It would have been good if last scene might have put some insight about the life of both brothers and their father after the last fight.This movie is for all the Man and women who wants to go out there and watch a nice movie. A FULL ENTERTAINER....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The summary says it all and seriously its one the most emotional and powerful movies i have seen in a long time. The acting by the one and only Nick Nolte as well as the two on-screen brothers Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton is exceptional and simply "feels real". The mix of a broken family with MMA and the struggles of each member to get on with their lives in anyway possible is perfect. With me being a huge fan of UFC and MMA in general i can say that, as far as the fights are concerned, they look completely realistic. I must admit that a was almost moved to tears by that movie, something that, to be honest, has happened to me once or twice in the past. I am trying to see if there are any flaws, but don't seem to find any! I recommend it to everyone, despite their movie taste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a script. What performances! Nick Nolte is the icing on the bloody cake! You cannot help but get drawn into this tale of a family gone wrong. It's raw and visceral with a poetic human touch. Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy are fantastic as the brothers bonded by blood. And Nick Nolte where have you been lately?. Terrific as the father seeking redemption. A great supporting role by Jennifer Morrison as the vulnerable wife too. The ultimate question is "What sacrifice would you make for your family ?" I challenge you to not feel every crack, crunch and thwack and not be misty eyed at the same time by the end. It's in my top 5 of all time because its the humanity of the story that runs so deep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, great acting, and it's always fun yelling "TAP!" at the TV.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ahh, been a while since I've seen a movie even worth talking about. And unfortunately, by what I've read here about it being a box office flop is distressing. Now, that said, I've never even seen a trailer for this movie, until I actually saw it. Regardless, amazing movie, it helps if you are an MMA fan, but if you aren't, you're forgiven. As the movie first and foremost is a drama and a family driven drama at that. I really liked the fact that the whole story wasn't just dumped in our laps at the outset and we would have to follow whatever storyline the writers had envisioned. The grey areas and ambiguity let us make up our own mind and we could still change our opinions as more of the story was told. Great performances by all, Nick Nolte, I bought all of it, I felt the pain and frustration and hope that he was portraying, great job. Brendan, perfect as the regretful and loving husband and father, doing what he has to to get by. Tommy, the angry, guilty, quiet and yet amazingly caring guy. Again, great job. There should be at the very least, best movie award nomination awards for this. It's a modern day reiteration of the classic Rocky movie, with a few more details. Stories excellent, great acting, extremely well written and directed. Big thumbs up. Must watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never been one for fighting films. i used to think once you'd seen one, nothing else under this genre could surprise or impress me. this did both and so much more. It tells the story of Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) a physics teacher who needs money or him and his family will be evicted from their home. Therefore he is luckily entered into an intense ufc tournament. meanwhile his troubled brother tommy conlon ( Tom Hardy) is also training for the same tournament with his hated father (Nick nolte)who is constantly trying to get both boys forgiveness. Both boys fight out in the championship. one for money, and one for honour. Apart from the outstanding fighting sequences this films emotional core is what drives it. It is extremely corny throughout but it doesn't matter because you care so much for he characters and what happens to them. Tom Hardy proves he is one of the best actors working today whilst Joel Edgerton also delivers a solid performance, however Nick Nolte gives the performance of the film with his tragic desperate performance of the always failing father. Expect an Oscar nod. To top off the film is incredibly ended. A must see whether you like fighting films or not. Truly special</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not entirely sure what to expect from 'Warrior.' Admittedly, the title is what put me off for a while. But being in the mood for Tom Hardy films recently, I decided to give it a go. I am glad I watched it.Tom Hardy was great in the film. His American accent was convincing enough, and his mysterious, tough-guy character was played well. Joel Edgerton was good, too. Just not as good as Hardy. Nick Nolte, however, stole the show in terms of acting. He played his role with perfection.The storyline was somewhat predictable, but that will always be expected from a film such as this. On the other hand, the fighting scenes were great and made the film very entertaining. They were very realistic, and a lot of the time will have you on the edge of your seat as though it's a real mixed martial arts fight you're watching, and you know one of the fighters.All in all, entertaining throughout, but it is a story you can probably guess the ending to before the film starts. It is definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For some reason - and I do still not know why exactly - this movie was not released in cinemas here in Germany but is only available on DVD and Blu-ray which is in my opinion a huge pity. It is a great, a really great movie that, as far as I can tell nearly has everything a great and dramatic movie needs. And yes it is a great and dramatic movie, Maybe not actually a drama but certainly it is not what the German publishers must've thought it is: Just another martial arts fighting movie! It's not at all. Of course they fight in the movie and admittedly it is very well done so they must've put some thought into it but in general it is about the relationship of the two brothers and also their father.ACTION Scince the movie shows actors performing martial arts (and not vice versa) it is even more impressive that the fighting sequences are so very entertaining. Also they are not overloaded with slow motion sequences like i.e. Guy Ritchie's 'Sherlock Holmes'.CAST Great actors actually performing great acting. Nick Nolte ahead of all others grumbling madly and rather impressively, Tom Hardy especially in the end with both superb acting and fighting and Joel Edgerton as a financially struggling physics teacher (Both astonishingly good as a teacher and loving but troubled husband and also as a ex-fighter trying to get back into the game).SOUNDTRACK Great soundtrack from Beethoven's ninth symphony to a great final song giving the ending the perfect touch. PLOT Well thought out plot story convincingly telling the story of those two brothers and their seriously compromised relationship. FLAWS (SPOILERS) Aside from the (at first) too slowly told story (which later picks up speed after all) I can only report the minor that the back story of Tommy Conlon regarding his past with the army and him deserting his unit, while saving a couple of other soldiers from a drowning tank fairly unconnected to the rest of the movie. I watched the movie twice now and I am still not really seeing the actual connection to both the plot in general and the emotional past. GENERAL But all in all a very good and partially very touching movie with an amazing and emotional end.</fullReview>

The only way to compare this movie is to rocky and i might make a few people mad by saying that but this is such an incredible movie. The plot is extremely well written i kinda wish that they played around with the back story a little more... but that is if anything is being really picky and its not really needed. They fit in 2 points of view into this movie. It shows how different the 2 brothers are. Yet they both have a very good reason to be there. This movie really should win an award. But the worst part is i had to stumble upon this movie on a website and yet it has easily became my favorite movie. Awesome Movie. Awesome Acting. Awesome Plot. AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best fight movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I need to clarify that I do understand the gravity of the statement I've just made and yes Im ready to stick my neck out and say this is the best fight movie ever made! The perennial problem with fight movies is that it has always only appealed to the sex blessed with testosterone and only a handful of movies have managed to transcend the barrier. Rocky, Wrestler, Fighter and Fight Club being the ones I can recall from the top of my head.Now lets quickly come to the reasons why Warrior is a must watch1) The acting is top notch! Nicky Nolte gives a touching performance! He is the absolute standout performer playing the role of a drunk father who is repenting and trying his best to make amends, closely followed by Tom Hardy (the reason why I actually watched this movie) playing the role of an ex army man who seems to be full of hatred and is waiting to explode in the ring. Joel Edgerton does a good job too as a father looking to make ends meet and does justice to his role.2) The screenplay of this movie is fantastic! Gavin O' Connor deserves full credit for this! Also unlike regular fight movies where you really know whos going to win in the end, this movie will keep you on the edge of your seats till the very end!3) Warrior might be a fight movie but only about 1/3rd of it is devoted to actual MMA fighting. The rest of the story defines the characters really well. Also even though it times in at 2 hours 20 minutes it doesn't seem stretched and on the contrary you actually wish the movie was longer.4) It evokes all sorts of emotions from you! And very few movies can actually do that.5) Fight movies have evolved over time and have come a long way from being just eye catching, physics defying Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan starrers to soul touching and motivating movies like Wrestler and Fighter. Warrior in a way summarizes all these aspects and is a beautiful concoction of great fight stunts and emotions.I give it a 9/10...a MUST WATCH!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nolte for the Oscar!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warrior is a befitting descendant to the Rocky series and more recently The Fighter.Stallone shone not just as an actor, but more importantly, as the writer of the legendary fight movie (Oscar nominations for best actor, writer). Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale added to Hollywood's fight legacy with splendid performances in The Fighter (Bale did get the best supporting actor Oscar for the same ... and deservingly so)."Warrior" too is characterized by absolutely superlative performances by the trio - Nick Nolte, Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton.The story revolves around a broken family - two separated brothers (Hardy and Edgerton) and their father (Nick Nolte). Nolte plays a retired mixed martial arts champ who was responsible for breaking up his family. The reason is never known - but that does not dampen the story as it unfolds. He wants in, into the lives of his sons, but is constantly shunned out by them.Edgerton plays the elder brother, now married (to the lovely Jennifer Morrison of House MD fame - definitely want more of her!!), with two daughters and pressing financial needs. His portrayal as a 'Physics teacher' though short, is endearing. Hardy appears out of nowhere, before his father, after years of separation - as the story unfolds one realizes his secret past.The brothers, each of their own needs, decide to take up the UCF challenge with a heavy financial reward for the winner of the tournament. Their quest sets them up on a physical and emotional confrontation with each other.The fight sequences are grueling and elaborate - both actors evidently have worked hard at making them realistic. The sequences are absolutely stunning - the ones with Hardy for his sheer attitude around demolishing his opponent and the ones with Edgerton for his stunning Rocky-like portrayal of an unlikely underdog giving everything he has in every round.But the highlights of the movie are clearly the heart-wrenching moments between the father and his sons. Nolte simply excels as the remorseful father trying everything he can to become a part of his sons' lives.Though this is definitely a fight movie, the emotional quotient of the movie almost makes the elaborate fight sequences seem like an afterthought! Three cheers for Nolte, Hardy and Edgerton! Oscar nominations for the movie and the three leads for sure!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much more than just a film about fighting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I am partial to a film featuring martial arts (largely because that has style whereas boxing/wrestling/whatever seems so thuggish), I don't have any interest in professional fighting whatsoever. I only went to see 'Warrior' as there was little else to see in the cinema. And I was very glad that I did because it was a surprisingly good film that is much more than men beating each other up.'Warrior' is a film about a broken family haunted by past domestic abuse, alcoholism and grudges. Tommy Conlan (Tom Hardy) was once considered a prodigy in the mixed martial arts cage but, now an adult, he is a Marine carrying much anger and hurt. By comparison, his estranged elder brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton)is a physics teacher leading a settled life with his wife and daughters until, thanks to greedy bankers (yes, we all know about them), he is at risk of losing his home. For very different reasons, the two brothers embark on the path to try to win a major tournament-- a quest that will leading to them being reunited after years of separation. In the midst of it, their father Paddy (Nick Nolte) is a recovering alcoholic who is struggling to regain the trust of the sons whose childhood he wrecked.Perhaps this could easily have been a bland, violence-filled film but thanks to strong characterisation that was brought to life by three excellent actors, we have a story that transcends a basic plot about fighting. Hardy and Nolte excel at portraying two haunted characters who can't let go of their pasts while Edgerton is great as the character who has managed to carve a decent life for himself despite his boyhood hurts.I do wish we could have had a more rounded ending, however. It would have been nice to see where Paddy's place in his sons' lives after the final fight was. But that is probably the only negative that I could find and I suppose that sometimes there are aspects that need to be left for the viewer to decide for themselves.After a year of rather mediocre films, 'Warrior' is compelling viewing that both entertains and also offers an emotional aspect to the audience. And certainly do not be put off by the fact that it features cage fighting because that is such a small part of this film. Well recommended (and, on a side note, Hardy looks more than ready to play Bane in 'The Dark Knight Returns').</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stripped down to its basic components 'Warrior' is a family drama depicting the relationships between two brothers and their father who are backed up with the memories of his alcoholism and domestic abuse from an early age. But with the formula of boxing added to this equation we see their emotions shown not only in their personal traits but also through outbursts of violence and other physical movements, which are shown in powerfully effective and moving ways.Brendan Colon (Joel Edgerton) is an elementary school teacher of physics who lives with his loving wife and two children, but within this picture perfect life is presented with the obstacle of bills and the fear of his home being repossessed. On the other side we are introduced to Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy), who is an ex marine and is seen as dark character using alcohol and drugs to cope with his past. With their past experience in boxing from their father, Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte) the situations are now in motion, forcing them to make a living through what they know best.We are shown through contrived situation after another, which unfortunately runs it's course early on but we know it's to get to where the situation is heading. The final confrontation between Tommy and Brendan where all the emotions they have built up from their father, separate lives and what they're fighting for now will come into play. Though we know this is the path we are heading it doesn't matter as the payoff is satisfying, but the journey is far greater. We go through the emotions that the characters themselves go through which is a rare feeling but because of this end up caring for them all by the end as we are shown, despite their physique none are perfect or special, only human.There is a clear separation between both brothers as Tommy moved away with his mother where as Brendan stayed by his fathers' side before eventually abandoning him. Neither brother shows much care of affection towards their higher arch with Brendan requesting only to be rang by him and Tommy using him only as a trainer, maintaining an emotionally distance. Nick Nolte brings a powerful performance showing the anguish he is faced as he battles his alcoholism to try and rekindle the love between him and his sons which makes for a heart wrenching character. Due to the separation of the brothers at that early age it is seen as a wall is dividing them, setting the sides, but you never root for one with the way the film depicts it's un-biased views.Emotions within these characters raise throughout the whole film and none more so that within the ring itself. Early on the fights are shot on steady cams but that term is used loosely as it's hard to grasp on what's going on and who's doing what. But this is soon calmed down and we are given more thrilling and engaging conflicts. There are whole sections when are protagonists don't talk but we see through the force of their bodies and facial expressions what exactly their goals are and how they will stop at nothing to reach them. The fight is their place to let out their raw emotions in the only way they know how and with each fight you want to cheer and punch your fist into the air which is when you then realize how engrossed and involved you are into the film.It's a rarity in modern cinema to become so attached to a small set of characters within such a small time so that by the end of your film your eyes may even fill up with tears, but it works. The film felt like it needed to be ten or twenty minutes longer to wrap a few things up but it is still left on a strong, abrupt point without over doing it. 'Warrior' is a strong drama, which hits you so hard; it may even knock you out.</fullReview>

With a theme like this (Sport Fighting films, I thought this film would be terrible like the film "Never Back Down" which was mediocre. But With great performances by Edgerton, Hardy and Nolte, this film worked very well.Tom Hardy was very dark and mysterious and some his scenes were very powerful, same with Nick Nolte when he was drunk and aggressive. Joel Edgerton were very good too. Although the first half of the film was bit boring, it got very interesting when it came to the fight scenes, it was very intense and very entertaining, the ending was very emotional when the two brothers had to fight each other. I thought this was better than The Fighter there were three great performances, loads of entertaining fight scenes and the family drama between the characters, the script was very well written. I recommend you to watch this in the cinema for that surround sound that will give you goosebumps when watching the fight scenes...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One the worst films a saw in while - and that goes especially for the screenplay. The only reasons for holding up until the end were the fight scenes. And even they became so unreal and the end. The plot was definitely not worth the book it was written on. War hero, Russian bad guy, school teacher MMA world champion ??? A broke war veteran, without PST, who will donate his prize money to the widow of his war buddy? The writers had totally NO idea where the story was supposed to be going to. Fragments of anonymous family biographies, desperately linked up to produce a script. This quality is even worse than a beginners failure... sorry</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but predictable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubting that one of the up and coming British actors around is Tom Hardy. His performances always seem really intense as anybody who has seen Bronson will agree and nothing changes in Warrior . He is fantastic , yet the film isn't all it's cracked up to be.Warrior is about two brothers who are down on their luck ( what a surprise!) who enter a mixed martial arts tournament to win five million dollars. Their father is an alcoholic who wants their forgiveness but forgiveness isn't in large supply. The big problem i have with Warrior is the sport involved - Mixed martial arts. It's just not very good. It lacks the excitement of boxing and because its supposedly no holds barred you never really know what's going on.Tom Hardy is brilliant as is Joel Edgerton but a special mention must go to a forgotten actor in Nick Nolte. He's looking very old yet he hasn't lost it.Warrior is entertaining but it's also extremely predictable and full of clichés but i'm sure most people will enjoy i for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really think that the premise is there for a great movie about MMA, given its expanding fanbase, and really exciting action, but this movie won't be remembered as the "rocky" of its genre.They story is convoluted and predictable, Nick Nolte is wasted (figuratively) and Tom Hardy is not really given any range to explore his character. The action scenes are pretty good, but crucially you don't care enough about the people to care about the outcome. There are weepy subplots all over the place that don't get resolved, and again not enough time or thought is given so that you care enough to fill in the blanks.A fair effort, but crying out for some craft and guile in the script and filming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very old-school treat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for Warrior I rolled my eyes about how clichéd and by-the-books it appeared to be. After having seen it, there's no surprise that it was just that but there is a surprise in how taken I was by it. I think I'm starting to come to terms with the fact that things being drawn around an old and worn formula like this isn't always bad thing, and a movie like this is a prime example of that. It's hard to make a sports film in any other formula, so why screw around with something when it's already so tried and true? Instead you can just take the foundation that works and build something out of that, focusing instead on creating true of-the-time characters and deep emotional reservoirs with their relationship dynamics.Warrior capitalizes on an age-old formula by allowing the audience to instead be swept up with the characters it portrays, which in turn makes those climatic fight sequences as intense as they should be. Even knowing how it all will eventually play out (as anyone who saw the upcoming DVD cover before seeing the film knows), I found my heart racing and my grip tightening during many of the fight scenes, terrified for Brendan Conlon and hoping he makes it through unscathed. The film focuses on the crossing journeys of Brendan and his brother Tommy, two polar opposites linked solely by blood and their hatred for their father Paddy, as they eventually come to a head. These two brothers couldn't be more different and the film approaches them in quite different ways.We know all we need to know about Brendan within five minutes of meeting him; he is a good-natured high school teacher with a wife and children who is returning to his fighting roots in order to get money that his family desperately needs. There's no mystery to him, everything is laid on the surface, so it's up to star Joel Edgerton to keep us engaged with Brendan and rooting for him as the film progresses. Edgerton is an actor who has shined bright in supporting roles lately in films like The Square and Animal Kingdom, both from his native Australia, and here he's given a chance to really take center stage and dazzle and he lives up to his full potential. It's hard to think of a performance that I've seen lately that has had as much pure heart as Edgerton has here and I quickly found myself pulling for him and that never wavered for me. The character might be a little too good-natured, but that thought didn't even cross my mind until the film was well over because Edgerton absorbed me so much and had me so invested in this guy. This is an actor with a pure, natural talent that immediately draws your attention and keeps you glued. He has this vulnerability in his eyes that I always find fascinating and it really worked for the character here.On the other side of the turmoil there's Tommy, and in the approach to him we are given very little at first. He appears on his father's doorstep after thirteen years, wanting to be trained to fight and slowly over the course of the film we learn more and more about what has happened to him that has gotten him to this point. Tom Hardy is an emerging young star and here he's given some center stage but I think the script kind of handicaps him in being able to show what talent he may or may not have holstered. Again pulling a move opposite to their treatment of Brendan, I think the script made Tommy too dark and the guy is just a mean son of a bitch that doesn't have a lot of depth to him. We get an understanding of why he is the way he is, but Hardy's portrayal is tuned into one station and never wavers from it for the entire film. He's just a battering ram of aggression in and out of the ring and I feel like through the script and Hardy we never get a proper understanding of who this guy is. I felt as though they gave a lot of the development to Brendan and Tommy was left too much as a one-note character; although I do feel that some of this can be attributed to the opposing performances of the leads.Still, despite some flaws in the script I think the film has a lot more heart and emotion than most of it's genre. There were a lot of moments where I found myself tearing up a bit, especially when it came to Edgerton's character and his journey. The scales were tipped a little unevenly for me, but I could see other people rooting more for Tommy than Brendan as well. Director Gavin O'Connor, following up his underrated cop drama Pride and Glory, does a lot for this production in giving it a gritty '70s aesthetic that brings us into the world and sets the perfect tone for the stories of these guys. It feels like a cold, grimy winter and it really is expertly done on O'Connor's part and I think saves the film from some of it's script flaws. Because in the end my mind wasn't focused on the few negative aspects of the story, but the multiple positive ones that kept me engaged and rooting for these guys all the way. Like he did in Pride and Glory, O'Connor takes a standard genre flick and imbues it with this old-school atmosphere that makes it feel new and genuine and really hooked me from the word go. It certainly doesn't hurt that the film opens and closes with two of the finest songs by The National, my favorite band of all time, and certainly a band that fits the tone this film goes for. It's about the heart, not the fist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my God !That is the least you can say after seeing this movie. Let's start by saying that I am a huge fan of boxing and fighting film in general. My baseline for comparison until now was, of course, Rocky. After seeing Warrior, I might just have to change that baseline.What a movie, what a script, and to my surprise, what acting! Nick Nolte is, as usual, remarkable. But, to my surprise, Tom Hardy makes one of the best performances I have seen in years. I'm not going to spoil this for you, I am only going to tell you this: I was so reluctant to watch this film, and have had it for several months. After seeing it today, I'm truly sorry for not watching this earlier; after so many disappointing films, this is the one we have been waiting for...Must see !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You just can't ignore Beethoven in Warrior.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all due respect to the excellence of film artists amidst the hype of Hollywood stardom (even without having seen the other movies), this one, "WARRIOR," I really wanted to get BEST PICTURE 2012, and I could see no other in its place. And far be it from me to say, but I think the voters kind of dissed Beethoven because he was too wonderful in this picture, but then again, I'm a musician. Nobody could have rightly fit Beethoven into personal tragedy in these times involving the effects of war rising out of decades of U.S. conflict in the Middle East?beginning back with Desert Storm and Kuwait and Iran, and then later Afghanistan and Iraq after 09/11, and God knows what after. Fittingly, the film brought much of this into play. Called "Warrior," the story tells of two, warrior types, brothers in conflict affected by the unexplainable things that face our own human condition, just trying to grow up and raise a family in this world, and then with this utter senselessness of war pounding them further down. Immediately you pick up on the tension happening with the brothers. And Eegad! They're Irish! And then?catharsis takes you in?you begin to feel that purging, evolving steadily, slowly out of the Beethoven streaming "Ode to Joy" gloriously all throughout. And you felt this burliness too, of the fighters?despite the terribly awesome intensity of emotions the brothers were called to portray, their smash-down burliness served only to heighten an indescribable "machismo" in these two actors, whose names I did not register immediately, so much were they into their character?Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton. Nick Nolte, on the other hand, was just coolly brilliant. Right at the beginning, you caught glimpses of his saddened eyes of repentance for his derelict ways, with just a wee smile of hidden pride in the boys. Aw jeez, I felt like I was almost watching "Long Day's Journey into Night" ? seriously! The whole cast and crew should still be partying up! Amen?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is these kinds of films that make us like the Hollywood so much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warrior is an action-drama centered around Tommy (Hardy) and Brendan Conlon (Edgerton) who get into a multi martial art fighting tournament called Sparta. The film is directed by Gavin O'Connor and stars Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton along with Academy Award nominee Nick Nolte, Frank Grillo and Jennifer Morrison.Pros :A very overdone plot - where a guy fights to save his family and the ones that he cares about -was very well presented. The story wouldn't have been able to attract the crowds if it wasn't handled well. The story was well built and had a perfect balance of drama and action as it slowly moved from the family life to the tournament. The whole second half was full of nail biting fights in the championship along with peoples' reactions and expectations. The writer gave proper attention to the characters giving details of their backgrounds that ultimately gives them the motive to be a part of the tournament. A Russian fighter named Koba, played by Kurt Angle, was introduced. He never lost any fight and was proposed to win the championship. As an audience you know that he won't but you are anxious to know which out of the two Tommy and Brendan is going to fight him. Once that question is answered, there is a bigger one for you. Who will win? You as a viewer don't want to answer that, because not only it is hard for you to decide but also difficult for you to pick your favorite. The director had so cleverly introduced the protagonists and narrated their stories that it is simply impossible to choose. The action director must be credited for all the fight sequences as both the protagonists had their own way of fighting which was completely different from the other. The climax was unexpected and appropriate. I really like endings that don't have a montage at the end saying '?and they all lived happily ever after'. I like films that cut as soon as the conflict is resolved. The dialogs were carefully written and placed to reduce the pressure on the viewers that is building continuously. They will definitely bring a little smile on your face. You can read a few of these here. The movie was very well directed, giving no space for any kind of loopholes or continuity errors. I was waiting if there is an error in the movement when the camera switched to different angles, but I couldn't find any. From my experience I can say that the pre-production was really strong. The director knew exactly what he wanted and hence even minute details like stubble, random messages on the gym white board etc. were taken care of. The art department did a nice job taking care of the different looks of gyms, classrooms and of course that of the tournament. The cinematography was had something new. There was a very slow shift of focus from one subject to another in various scenes, which I felt was nice. There were some POVs in the fight sequences that looked brilliant. It appeared as if the hands came out of the camera and hit the fighter. The actors did full justice to their roles, the efforts in bringing out the appropriate look was seen. Cons:I loved the movie completely. I am not going to say anything here just for the heck of writing something.The Verdict :Tom Hardy already has movies like Inception, Rocknrolla and awaited The Dark Knight rises in his credential and Warrior is an edition in the same. The movie will definitely bring Joel Edgerton to the limelight and we expect to see him in good projects in the future. This is one of the best films that of 2011. It's a Must watch for guys and girls if you find no reason to watch it, just go for Tom Hardy. Acting and Cast : 9/10 Script : 9/10 Direction : 9.5/10 Cinematography : 8.5/10 Editing : 9/10OVERALL RATING : 9.5/10It is these kinds of films that make us like the Hollywood so much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie killed me. I truly could not stop crying, it really gets to you - and hard. People everywhere are saying this, and one must genuinely be without empathy if this movie does not touch you. I'm astonished by how incredible every aspect of this movie is. The script, the directing, the acting - everything. I've seen a lot of good movies in my&#xfeff; lifetime, but when the characters gets so realistic and the story so real that you are left with all these emotions and this overwhelming impression - that is truly rare.It's apparent that this is a very personal film, and I'm so glad it was shared. This story, this film has so many layers, nothing is random and very little is just what you see at first glance. It's capable of being discussed on so many levels, that you end up talking for hours - which my friends and I did. There are not enough superlatives to describe this film, they would not do it justice.I take my hat off to everyone who was involved with and in the making of this film. Especially Gavin O'Connor, Anthony Tambakis, Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton and Nick Nolte. Thank you for a heart-wrenching, touching, wonderful, thought-provoking, unforgettable and amazingly incredible ride.I'll never forget this film, this story, these characters. This film is raw, this film is *truth*. One of the best films I have ever seen. Brilliant film, simply brilliant.</fullReview>

How do they enter a tournament without fighting before? they join a tournament with the 16 best fighters in the world but are amateurs. I could have made a better movie. The ending was original but not bad, but seems rushed. if the movie had been built up to show their past more, maybe to show how the brothers used to be really close but then their drunken father drove them away and the death of their mother caused them to lose contact. Im not sure how this movie got a 8.3... nothing special happens i would give it a 7 for the effort and that it is watch-able but not worthy of a 8.3</fullReview>

The story is incredibly written, it tells the story of the boys perfectly.

		<fullReview>I gave it a vote of 4 because I've seen this stuff before. This movie wasn't something you could consider a fighting movie, because the action is short and not shown.This is a movie where the main character is trying to earn money by fighting in a ring. Thrill, action and suspense have been replaced by drama.The plot is the fighter's relationship with his original family. And I don't think people who like drama will ever watch a boxing movie. There is no background provided for the people he's fighting. Our hero just goes and pummels his opponents and you're supposed to be impressed. This is an uninteresting movie. No thought was given to his opponents.This is just about a poor guy trying to get money for his family, while resolving his issues with his father. Even the fight scenes are pitiful, you can't really see anything as far as the action goes.I can't believe the IMDb score made me watch this crap. It's a drama. As anything else, it misses all points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprised to discover one of my Favorite movies this year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really had no intention of seeing this movie based on the trailer, but since we seem to be in a dry spell right now with no new big or must-see movies out there and because I saw that other people were giving this movie such high marks, I decided I should give it a shot.I was completely and pleasantly surprised at just how awesome this movie was. I am not into MMA or really any type of fighting/boxing at all in the real world, but you'll find that won't affect your enjoyment of this movie because the heart of this movie is about family and personal set-backs and overcoming obstacles and issues. There's no one out there who can't find someone/something to relate to in this movie.The story starts out at a slower pace and begins to build and build until the end - very cleverly crafted. I found myself actually reacting out loud in the theater to some of the fight scenes at the end, and as I said, I don't even really like MMA. But you really care for these characters and that's what makes the movie so engaging.The only other movie I've seen this year I'd put on the same level as this one is The Help. Warrior should at the very least get an Oscar Nomination for Original Screenplay with possibly a couple of actor nominees and best direction/picture nominees as well.Not much else to say except go see it for sure! I laughed. I cried. I grimaced. I cheered. If a movie can evoke that kind of emotion, what else can you ask for?!?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the biggest punch this fighting film throws is an emotional one...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As this film is about fighting, one cannot help but compare it to other fight films that have gone in the past (Rocky, Raging Bull and more recently The Fighter), but I think it would be fair to say that film breathes fresh air on a genre which could easily produce films that are all a bit samey and prescriptive.This film has many things going for it, primarily the excellent performances by the three key protagonists, perhaps the best of all by Nick Nolte, as a reformed father longing for the forgiveness of his two sons. It's this story which really captivates you throughout the film. Yes the fight scenes are excellent, but it's the scenes between Hardy, Edgerton and Nolte that drives this film. It feels strange to say that Warrior's best scenes are not those inside the cage, but I think that is a good thing. Often within this genre you wish you could fast-forward to all the fights but to do that with this film would be to miss many memorable moments. The direction is good and it has a bold story with multiple subplots which i didn't expect. The violence isn't as graphic as you might expect but i think the 12A certificate explains why. Highly recommend this film, even for those who wouldn't normally choose to watch a fight film.Warrior is a well made beat 'em up drama that hits hard, but tugs even harder on the heartstrings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Warrior</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enough of Boxing films already. Warrior brings us to the world of Mixed Martial Arts, which has been around for years, but never really making it to a notable big screen interpretation save for the Hong Kong film Flashpoint starring Donnie Yen taking down a string of bandits led by Collin Chou in the film's climatic finale. Perhaps its more contemporary slant meant a little less understanding of the art to effectively bring it to the cinemas, but Gavin O'Connor's film will open doors for MMA to work, and work well.Structurally it adopts from the many boxing films already out there where you know that bouts alone do not make a meaningful, moving film, without that degree of humanity and adversity, especially if coming from within family. providing avenues for some deep rooted family estranged ties to be addressed along the way. The story by O'Connor and Cliff Dorfman recognizes this key point, and stripped away of its violence, it's this emotional tussle the characters have to face up to that's more daunting than beefy opponents in the ring, providing Warrior its very crucial heart that keeps the film alive and pumping from the get go.Tom Hardy bulks up for this role and his next as Bane in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises, and plays Tommy Conlon, a mean badass of a soldier who had deserted his comrades and made his way to his father's home, whom we learn is a no good drunk during Tommy's formative years, and hence comes the resentment. Needing a place to crash and then grudgingly engaging his dad's help to train him for an upcoming MMA tournament, Tom Hardy owned this role in providing that gruff exterior who has to make compromises in his life, and basically living with the enemy and with a closet full of skeletons that threaten to burst open as his profile becomes larger and more prominent given the public tournament.Then there's his brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton), a physics teacher and once MMA exponent whose soaring bills to pay to sustain a family led him to go back to moonlighting in underground bouts, much to the chagrin of his wife Tess (Jennifer Morrison), which is understandable since getting injured or killed, regardless of his assurances, would leave the family very much exposed and weakened. But one's paymaster is always extremely cautious about having employees moonlight on the side, and a choice has to be made whether to drop his interest totally, or decide to go serious with it especially with a five million dollar carrot dangling at the end of a large tournament known as Sparta, where winner takes all and each brother having their own reasons to have a crack at it.So you pretty much know how this is set up for the final act, but trust me the journey, and not the destination, is what Warrior excelled in, with wonderful powerhouse performances put in by Hardy, Edgerton and Nick Nolte, who plays their father now in his twilight years and hoping very much for his sons' forgiveness. This three way relations form the emotional crux of the film without which Warrior would have limped. With Hardy's and Nolte's middle act focused much on their training montage, Edgerton's character development piece was the more uplifting of the lot, and setting up the underdog role quite brilliantly as you'd soon find yourself rooting for him not to have his livelihood and lifestyle destroyed, putting himself forward for a once in a lifetime opportunity.The fight scenes during the Sparta tournament are what made this film stand out as far as action is concerned, providing that no holds barred front row seats as exponents slug it out in brutal fashion, each scheming, grappling, punching and kicking their way to an opponent's submission, or knock out. There are a lot of gladiatorial sport films out there, but Warrior had designed and crafted sequences that don't employ too much bullshit techniques used to cover up the lack of true ability. It is as convincing as it gets here, and you're bound to reel and feel for the fighters.But for all of its bite in the action sequences, Warrior makes a fantastic balance between the need to thrill, and having a soul through its more dramatic moments, thanks to the very well written roles that the various cast members managed to deliver. Highly recommended, and going into my shortlist as one of the best the year has to offer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Warrior A Movie Review By Nick Iacobucci Two brother's lives collide both inside and outside of the ring. Hello there everyone I'm Nick Iacobucci movie critic for ReelScreenReviews.com and our next movie review is the film The Warrior. This drama and sports film opened on September 9th, 2011, and it features Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton, Nick Nolte, and Jennifer Morrison. "The Warrior" comes to us from director Gavin O'Connor, the director of the Disney sports film "Miracle" and "Tumbleweeds" from 1999. This time out the director once again sets up the lights and cameras in order to capture a very popular sport, this time of MMA fighting.Our story tells of 2 brothers, one an ex-marine with coping issues, and the other a struggling school teacher. We soon learn that events from their past have pitted these two brothers against each other for quite some time, and they haven't even spoken to each other in years. Our marine Tommy soon invites the help of his father who's not only battled in and out of the ring as a manager, he has also battled with the bottle and alcoholism just as long. The other brother Brendan just cannot seem to provide for his family on his pay alone, so he also begins a fighting regiment and soon emerges not only as an underdog but a contender as well. With the success of each of the brother's climb to the top, this puts them on a collision course headed straight for each other. The movie then pretty much stops at nothing to give us a knock down drag out fight that provides new meaning to the term 'Sibling Rivalry'.Well people The Warrior seems to take what could be such standard and cliché material and elevates it to the next level. It accomplishes this by always keeping the sport in a secondary position to the storyline first. Now if I was to say that "Warrior" reminded me of other sports films, well that wouldn't be too much of a compliment in itself. However if I compare it to both "Cinderella Man" and "The Natural", which are not only fantastic sports films but are out-and-out 2 great films of the last 3 decades, that would be a compliment. Just as in Ron Howard's brilliant boxing drama "Cinderella Man" as this film plays out and is so engrossing with everything that is going on, you sometimes almost forget that you're even watching a sports movie in the first place. And most comparable to Robert Redford and Barry Levinson's baseball gem "The Natural", when you do finally come to reach the climatic finale you come to realize that there are many things more important than a title or a victory.Now I can't help but have some comparisons with this project to the very recent Marky Mark/Christian Bale movie "The Fighter", but I actually think that this is just as good if not better. There is not one throw away character in this film, and each actor has clear moments to shine and often does. Tom Hardy has this stern intensity about him, but he always seems anchored into the characters that he brings to life. He reminds me of a young Burt Reynolds?I mean going back to "The Longest Yard" or "Deliverance". He's an action star waiting to happen all trapped in the body of a great actor, and that is why Nolan keeps casting him in everything. Then Joel Edgerton rules every part of the big screen in every one of his scenes. You see and feel a lifetime of decisions, whether they are right or wrong, in every moment that he is on screen. They're also not simple characters but complex people that can even hide secret motivations to fight in the first place.In a back story involving Nick Nolte as their father, he also brings solid works once again to his resume. Nolte's dad also provides the motives that drove the family in separate directions so long ago, and a solid story brings them back together. Chance also brings very sound reasons for both brothers to enter and want to win the "World Series" of MMA fighting. Put simply people, the script never felt empty to me at all. Actually the only spot in The Warrior that seemed like a retread or a loophole was an internet video that depicted our one brother as an Army hero. This just so easily set the stage for him to enter the big tournament, and immediately be its 'Root-For Underdog'.At 2 hours and 20 minutes The Warrior should've felt much longer than it was, but with such talent putting it together it just clips right along. The fighting was almost an extension of the drama and connected the dots of this film beautifully. The combat that takes place in the ring was brutally real, vividly authentic, and in your face genuine. This film is exciting as it builds and builds to a showdown that will see a lifetime of blood, sweat, and tears come out of each corner.The Warrior has something for men, women, or anyone just looking to see a great film. I cannot recommend this movie enough, a perfect 4 stars out of 4.And thank you for your attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can't believe the rating of this movie on IMDb. Apart from the acting by Hardy this is drivel. There's no depth whatsoever to the characters and that the two brothers would end up fighting each other is so predictable it almost cancels out the high school leveled biblical intentions. Even Rocky has great depth compared to this, all five of them.There's supposed to be severe hurt in the main characters of the story. Too bad it doesn't come through. The opportunity to really feel with the father and brothers never arise as they are given no time to become real people. They're just put in three formatted frames that everybody has seen at least 200 000 times before. One- the guy about to lose everything he's got and has to fight to survive. Two- the alcoholic trying to redeem himself and falls off the wagon when confronted with result of his previous life. Three- the barrel of rage in the form of a deserted son.All three very good ingredients to put in a movie-stew. But the taste of this one is sadly bland.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie Warrior, truly is a great movie. I enjoyed everything about it. It was inspiring, uplifting, real, and just flat out good. Everything a movie should be.You don't have to be an MMA or fighting fan to enjoy this film. But I'm sure you'll like it by the end. It pulls you in from the start, and you can't help but care about these characters. Played by Nick Nolte, Tom Hardy, and Joel Edgerton.Nolte is the father of Hardy and Edgerton, and both sons are MMA fighters trying to win a tournament for their own different reasons.Throughout the movie you're rooting for both these men, and hoping for the best. I have a brother and we saw this movie together. By the end, we didn't know whether to be happy or cry. And that's good.I was not disappointed with this film in anyway, and by the end of it, it almost brought a tear to my eye. I love this movie, and recommend anyone and everyone to go and see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like predictable boxing movies with caricatures of boxing caricatures named Tommy (always with fingerless gloves on and a black, cotton stocking hat) and some over acting, you may like Warrior. You may not.Paddy Conlon (Nolte) is a recovering alcoholic and dead beat dad of Tommy (Hardy) and Brendan (Edgerton). Apparently, he trained both sons to be mixed martial arts fighters. Mixed martial arts is really boxing, wrestling, kick boxing, karate and just dirty street fighting all combined into one. It is sort of legalized cock fighting for human males. Somewhere along the line, their mother got sick and died and Tommy joined the Marines. Brendan apparently knocked up his girlfriend and ran off and started a new life. No love was lost anywhere. Tommy goes AWOL from the Marines after rescuing his buddies in a tank, but then loses most of them in a friendly fire incident. It all makes for three men with lots of pent up anger and issues. Lots of issues.The relationship, or lack thereof, between Tommy and Brendan is not well explored or revealed. And other than dad Paddy acting like a drunk Nick Nolte, neither is that relationship well explained. There is just lots of "history." Fortuitously, they all end up in Atlantic City at "Sparta"?the MMA world championship. Tommy and Brendan somehow repair their relationship by beating the living snot out of each other. It's a nice fairly tale?.I guess.What was the story or point of all this? Nothing. Hardy clearly studied Rocky Balboa to work up his dumber than dirt demeanor and accent. He may deserve an award for doing a great Sly Stallone imitation. Other than that, I got virtually nothing from this movie other than some adrenaline rushed fight scenes. Having participated in martial arts for five-years, TMG left the theater wanting to go back in the ring for a round or two, but I settled for a few push-ups and a beer instead.Brendan's predictable relationship with his wife was kind of corny. Nolte played Nolte. I was impressed there was not a single male urination scene, thus the 0.0 P factor rating. The bell rang and I left.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the movie I expected, but much better for it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are looking for a fight you'll get it. You'll also get a lot more. This was the first movie I have EVER shed a tear in. Gripping and powerful. Even though the trailer made it clear how each fight was going to end I was still on the edge of my seat.The family dynamic was heart wrenching. Nick Nolte's performance as a lonely old man grasping for a hint of forgiveness from his family is Oscar-worthy. The roles of the two brothers were pretty archetypal (tough guy fights for honor, peaceful guy puts gloves back on to fight for family) but were played well, and the family relations make up for the lack of originality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Film of 2011</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eight months into the year and this is easily the best film of 2011 thus far and a sure Oscar contender. Saw an advanced screening at the Landmark in L.A. and haven't seen a reaction like that from an audience in a very long time. Cheering. People crying coming out of the theater. Very blown away. The performances are across-the-board phenomenal. Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton give movie star turns and should be nominated for Best Actor, and Nick Nolte hasn't been this good since AFFLICTION and should win Best Supporting. He's the best American actor never to win an Oscar and that should change this winter. Edge of your seat excitement, raw emotion, humor--WARRIOR does everything. Expectations weren't high going in (the trailer is very pedestrian and makes it look like a genre sports movie, which it isn't), but I was completely floored and wiped out by the end (a song by The National plays over the film's final scene and if it doesn't make you cry you're tougher than I am). Hats off to director Gavin O'Connor for this one. Not only is it better than THE FIGHTER, but it's on par with ROCKY and RAGING BULL and is something of a combination of the former's spiritedness and the latter's grittiness. Incredible movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheesy &amp; corny, but proves a huge point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Men also need romantic pop corn flicks like The Notebook or Twilight. That has been proved with Warrior. I've read and heard that a lot of guys have been saying how Warrior made them cry, how emotional it was. I get it.But this movie doesn't deserve 8/10 and i think it has 8/10 because most guys rated before wiping their eyes.Warrior brings out the big guns. Every cliché you've seen is used here. Almost every line is cheesy. Did you enjoy seeing how the teacher beats up the undefeated Russian world champion, knowing it could never happen in real life? If you did, you got clicheed good.Did you like the ever so cheesy scenes with the kids routing in the parking lot &amp; the principal routing in his living room? Cheesy.Nolte was brilliant, but this movie isn't and the ratings will probably drop once people re watch it with dry eyes.5/10, for Noltes performance, and because i enjoy fantasy. After all, it's a movie about the biggest tournament in the world where the best fighters from all over the planet fight, and the 2 finalists is a teacher who has been working out for 1 month and one ex soldier who hasn't fought since he was 10. (And the TEACHER WINS, LOL!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comparing this movie to Rocky is an outrage, so shame on you if you dare compare a poop pile like this to Rocky. Warrior has some decent fighting scenes in it but thats where it ends which unfortunately isn't enough to make an entertaining movie. The acting was below average and the way the entire story was put together was a train wreck. This one just drags on and on and on and it's so unbelievably boring that you would have to be a warrior to stay awake. I think spending 2 hours watching grass grow would have a better plot. The fact that the story in a way tries to rip off Rocky makes it pretty pathetic as well but I would still never dare compare this to Rocky. I gave the movie a 3 because like I said the fighting scenes were OK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bromance Fight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first glance, I thought it's gonna be like The Fighter since this film is about fighting sports and there's a brother relationship. But here, the brothers are against to each other. The film doesn't really spend so much time dealing with their relationship. It mostly goes to the father of the main leads. The film is unnecessarily long but the third act has plenty of exciting MMA fights. If you're expecting this to be like The Fighter then you'll be disappointed. But Warrior has its own drama piece.What's intriguing about this film is the idea of making these brothers fight on a match. Most of the film is an exposition to their lives. Telling what happened to them from the past and bringing a lot of emotions. There are only few scenes of Tommy and Brendan being together but all we know they're against to each other. It's a family struggle.When it comes to the third act, it's all about the fighting. The fighting is pretty exciting. It's also too suspenseful because the first 90 minutes of the film is getting to know these characters. Fans of MMA and UFC will enjoy the whole third act. No matter what, Tom Hardy is always awesome. The film has plenty of heart and emotions. Most of these goes to Nick Nolte. He made all of his scenes compelling. I think Joel Edgerton is bland but his fighting is pretty good.I'm a bit disappointed after watching this because I thought it's gonna be like The Fighter but still this is pretty good. More darker but not quite better though. The action is better. If there is one thing that is similar to The Fighter then that probably be the filmmaking. The camera's shaky, a little music score, but a whole lot of style. Well, this is not True Story but the drama works mostly to the scenes of Nick Nolte. Since he nails most of the drama, Hardy and Edgerton nails the action. Warrior has a lot of emotions and a bit of bromance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised by this film. Very intense and exciting. I didn't think I was going to get hooked as I did. The film keeps you tense up till the end. The way the story is told makes you connect with the characters. The role of brothers between Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton might make you feel identified if you ever fought with your brother. I think the role of Nick Nolte is very well done. Jennifer Morrison acts very little, but their role is well achieved. I think they could have improved a little Tommy military background history, and the end could have had a more detailed outcome as how each story ends. But They leave an open end. I fully recommend this movie, very entertaining, very well acted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie!! With unsettling ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a great piece. The story was well written and you truly feel sucked in the whole film.I felt I must post that the ending did in fact throw me off a bit as I knew who would win between the brothers. There are far too many unanswered questions that left me befuddled.- Did the widow receive any of the winnings, from which brother? - Was patty going to be ever to meet his grandchildren? - Did Tommy get brought right to the marines after his brother helped walk there, prison time!?The better outcome would have been seeing tommy and Brendan battle it out with Tommy coming out on top. One could say well, Brendan was always the underdog, who cares..... Brendan had already beat the unexpected and it was time for him to find his place as the inferior fighter in comparison to younger Tommy. Tommy, the brother that didn't bail on his mother at her worst times and was fighting to help 100% for his dead friends wife. If Tommy would have won, he could have hugged it out in similar fashion as the ending, but rather told Brendan he loved him and given him enough of the earnings to stay afloat plus some. Then Tommy could have given the rest up and walked with his head high into the clunker. I would have much rather preferred this ending.Thanks,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched this movie on Netflix and didn't really know what to expect as I hadn't looked at any reviews beforehand. After watching it, I went on to buy it for only ?3 (Which is a bargain). It starts off a little slow but it was definitely worth it in the end. What I mainly liked about this movie, is that it has a lot of background information to the main characters, which really makes them interesting and most importantly memorable. When it gets going, its almost impossible to move your eyes away from the screen as it keeps you gripped at all times. This is partially because anything could happen at any given moment. I simply cant see how people can give bad reviews for this masterpiece. The makers have done a really good job by creating a truly outstanding movie. I strongly recommend to anybody who hasn't already seen it because for only ?3, its a crime not to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hahaha yeah, I cried at the final fight and some Nick Nolte scene :( .This is build up movie. You will emotionally invested to the characters, you feel bad for them, you love them, you care for them...and than BAM it will just explode at the finale.The final fight is great, I love the acting, the score, the camera movement. It felt like a real MMA fight. But this is more than a fight. It's deeper than that. These guys are brothers. It is hard watching them hurting each other. I can't really find better words to explain it, but for me that was really emotional scene.Oh yeah I said it is build up movie and I highlighted the finale fight, but the build up parts are great too. All part of the movie is good, not just the finale. These guys are great actors. Oscar worthy performance from Nick Nolte, Tom Hardy, and Joel Edgerton. The action also great too, not bad since these guys is not real fighters.BTW if you wanna enjoy Warrior, you have to suspend your disbelief for awhile. Because I think there is major plot hole in Tony story line, but you can just ignore it. If you can do that, you will have a good time watching this movie. It's not perfect but it is still great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beast in man tamed by financial motivation and family values</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the course of history we saw a great lot of the fight movies. There was Bloodsport and Rocky, Million Dollar Baby and The Fighter. In all these movies there were the heroes, each of them having their own reasons to keep going, to keep fighting. Fighting for their friends, for their pride, for the sake of proving themselves, for their dreams. Or at least for some vain glory. Those heroes were facing the improbable odds, the unbeatable foes - and the only thing that made them victorious was their motivation, their goal.Warrior, a new member of the fight film family, tries to play it right, play it modern. No more black and white, good and evil, righteous and deceitful. It brews a nice steaming pot of conflict, adds the characters, each twisted and flawed in their own way, spices it all with a dark prehistory that connects them together, and finally boils it all down to a burning mix of action, emotions and adrenaline that keeps you on the edge of your seat, both teeth and fists clenched. Sounds like a perfect game, right?Indeed, seconds after the credits start rolling, accompanied by that mighty blockbusterized Beethoven theme, when your head is still hot and your armpits sweating from all the fighting you imagined yourself being a part of, i'm sure you wanna say that you just saw one of the best, if not THE best fight movie of all times. And yes, in terms of the action and the tension that was continuously building up towards the climax, Warrior does hit well above par. Much higher than the same Million Dollar Baby where the last third of the movie gives you almost no action at all, letting your steam cool off and leaving you confused and unsatisfied. But thankfully Warrior is our hero tonight, and we should be grateful for that unparalleled and non-compromising feeling it gave us.Hovewer, if we too do it right and modern and dig one layer deeper, the things we uncover might be quite a surprise. Because it turns out that Warrior played a very unlikely, almost a cynical trick on us: it sold us the movie where a man is made a hero for fighting over... money.After all, who are our protagonists? Two brothers with a dark shadow of the past lying between them and the father figure looming in that shadow.There's Tommy, the younger one, cast away and left alone to take care of his dying mother. Who lives for one goal - one dictated by his own honor and responsibility. A beast in a human form who's willing to kill and die for that goal. Whose only brethren are those who've gone through literal hell shoulder to shoulder with him. And there's Brendan, the older one, who used to be envious for his father's love to his sibling. Who changed loyalty to his kin for a girl's love and became a happy family man, with a wife, two kid daughters and a job as a school teacher. The only thing he doesn't have is a money to pay for his mortgage.The stories of both brothers are hard and dramatic. But for the first time in the fight movie genre, the cause of providing for a dead friend's family is antagonized by a personal housing crisis. Nobody's dying in Brendan's family, he simply refuses to move to a smaller house or an apartment because it's a personal matter to him. Yet from the get-go we are almost forced into rooting for Brendan. He has more screen time, he's shown as a good husband and a loving father. Even his school students seem to adore him. While Tommy is portrayed as an abusive and aggressive chaotic pill-eater and alcohol-drinker, who has no place in this life to call his own, no person to call his friend, no love neither for his father nor his brother. Just an animal at large, roaming around and trying to survive somehow.One might think that Nick Nolte's character of Paddy, an alcoholic-turned-sober father, who's equally rejected by both of his sons for his actions in the past and who now finds refuge in the "Moby Dick" audiobook, could become a bridge between Brendan and Tommy and between their causes. Indeed, up until some point there was hope in it, and Paddy's attempts to mend what's been broken felt most sincere and endearing.But the director and co-writer Gavin O'Connor never dared to sail as far and deep as Herman Melville did. And when the contract between the outcome of the Captain Ahab vs Moby Dick confrontation and the prescribed ending of the film itself became too obvious to ignore, Paddy was comfortably written off without any reasonable explanation whatsoever, to be reduced to a distant and wordless part of the setting.After that cowardly transformation we are left face to face with the predictable ending that's been built for us through the whole movie. The good husband and a loving father wins, the animal in a human form loses. And with that a new moral testament is written down in the history of the fight movie genre: that no matter how improbable are your odds and how uncrushable your foes seem, you're bound to win if you have a wife, kids and, most importantly, a mortgage to pay. Because the modern American hero must live by the family values and never inflict loss to financial institutions.And the rest... the rest is negligible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, this is in no way original really. But the amount of heart it has is definitely surprising. It helps that the film is revolved around a pair of brothers, although The Fighter was too and for some reason that one just comes off across as way more superficial. This one has the right heart in mind. The three central performances are pretty fantastic, especially Edgerton who continues to be a very under-the- radar actor but is always pretty strong in what he appears in. Notle is also very strong in a meatier supporting role. Overall, this isn't anything too amazing, but it gets the job done and many people might need some tissues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sort your family problems but not in an MMA final</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not have many expectations before seeing this movie and also didn't read the description of the movie. The plot was at many times pretty obvious and many viewers anticipated from the start of the movie that the two brothers will settle family business in this unrealistic MMA final. I won't criticize the fantasy of two underdogs fighting an MMA final, but instead I want to emphasize on the idea of a broken family: on one side was the rebellious Tommy who was blaming everyone around him for his mother's death, while on the other side, Brendan the retired UFC average fighter who picked up a teaching position choosing lower paid but secure employment as a physics teacher, fighting for the biggest motive, not fame, girls or belts, but his family's salvation from bankruptcy. Also the Pop (Nick Nolte) did a great job as the estranged father fighting alcoholism who in the end sees his two boys reunite in an applause filled movie happy ending. At the end I could say, Brendan tamed his furious brother and took up his big brother role again, while Tommy finally could be happy with himself, although losing this match. Actually, I had a feeling (maybe I'm wrong) that Tommy wanted to lose and let the guilt consume him as he never felt being a part of his family. I gave it a 7.5/10, due to the plot and the pretty grandiose happy ending who were obvious at all times. All in all, a good movie about fighting, personal &amp; family dramas and underdogs winning MMA championships. It's worth watching, you won't be disappointed. In case you haven't seen it yet, don't miss it: The Wrestler with Mickey Rourke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MMA Version Of THE FIGHTER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night I watched Warrior which is an MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) film about two brothers played by Tom Hardy &amp; Joel Edgerton that don't get along.Tommy (Joel) is an ex marine that is haunted by his past of almost drowning and dying which has made him go off the rails. Brendan on the other hand is an ex MMA fighter who is now a teacher and also has the perfect family but he has a problem, he has no money coming in and could lose his house.That is until they both hear about a huge MMA event called SPARTA which could turn both of their lives around.Now let's be honest, if you've seen THE FIGHTER then you know what to expect, this is near enough the same story just with a different sport and I will admit it was a good film which starred lots of real MMA fighters and UFC stars (including WWE / TNA wrestling star KURT ANGLE which puts in a menacing performance).It just wasn't what I expected, yes the fights are well filmed and it is like watching a UFC event in the fight scenes.I just didn't warm to any of the characters and it was more drama then action (which can be a good thing) but this left me cold as you can see who the main fight is going to be against before it even gets there.The film rushes to it's main event final and it seems that in the film everyone and their dog is really into MMA like a religion and their TV is stuck on the channel that is showing MMA, UFC, ESPN MMA News (anything to do with MMA).It just seemed rushed to me like they had ran out of ideas so it was a quick let's get to the main event.So i'll end it here by saying if you like MMA check this film out, otherwise your not missing much as their are films that tell this type of story better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie up until about 30 min left, I still really liked it but the ending was just too unrealistic. So Tommy the younger brother comes out of nowhere and beats the best fighters in the world easily without hesitation, I can buy that. There are always great fighters coming out of nowhere. Now the speed he beat people in was unrealistic but that wasn't what bothered me. What bothered me is his brother Brendan, not the character but what happened to the character. So he was out of fighting for awhile and all of the sudden he joins a contest with the best fighters in the world. He was obviously older than all of them and hadn't fought in years. In every fight he gets beat the crap out of but somehow in the last minutes he pulls off an amazing move and gets a tap out. Literally every fight of the tourney he gets beat up badly but wins. Nobody can take the beatings he took and pull out a win, maybe in the first fight but not in 4 fights in 2 days. And when he did fight in the past he wasn't even good, they mentioned he was a .500 fighter. I don't know that just kinda ruined a great movie for me. The movie as a whole was really good though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Does contain spoilers.First, Let me say that I am a fan of Nolte and Hardy, and I also really enjoyed "pride and glory". The difference is that I was actually able to finish that film. O'Connor has a knack for creating/showcasing tension between family members, and "Warrior" is no exception. The movie is shot well and the MMA stuff is pretty cool, although I am a fan of boxing myself, but the movie is just too cliché, and perhaps that's why I wasn't able to finish it. For example, the principle reprimands Brenden but eventually comes around. Paddy destroys his sobriety, and the guilt becomes too much for Tommy. I think the acting and dialogue was good, but the MMA seemed more like an afterthought to me. I hope one day I can go back to finish it because I made to the last fight, but I don't know if I care to see what I know is going to happen. For an MMA movie, it's sad that it is the least enjoyable part of the movie, and that's not to say the fighting is bad, it's good, I just think the drama between the three is more important and more enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is the film that the MMA world deserves, a fantastic movie with an emotional and very well written story,with great actors that displays wonderful performances, although there is a bit misrepresentations about MMA and its fighters, the film is able to capture the epic, the glory and the essence of the greatest sport in the world. The fights in the cage are very realistic and well done with many powerful , dramatic and inspirational moments.. Is not a film just for fighting fans, people who never have approach to the Mixed Martial Arts world can also enjoy it and even shed a tear with the dramatic and touching moments of the films...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The untold tale of love and bravery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "Warrior" is justified to its fullest extent by the story which revolves around 2 brother and their father all spitted away yet woven together by the web of love. It is a story about two brothers who split ways in their teens because of their father's alcoholism. Younger brother Tommy departed with mom but elder brother Brandan decided to stay back for her girl-friend. This creates a rift between the brothers which resurfaces and dissolves when they clash against each other in arena of death and life.The movie opens with Tommy, the younger brother, an ex-marine returning to Pittsburgh, his home town to train for "Sparta" MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) under his father whom he treats as mere trainer and nothing more. On the other hand Brandan, an ex UFC fighter takes up a job as physics teacher and lives with his family close to yet far away from his father. Because of daughter's illness and other loans Brandan takes up fighting once again to meet the ends. However when the fight of Mr C (Brandan) gets public in the school he gets suspended for breaking disciplinary rules. Brandan left with no other option decides to take up fighting once again his profession to save his family and house(which was on verge of being taken away by bank) and trains under his friend Frank.Tommy catches a media attention when the video of knocking down champion "mad dog" in less than a minute, goes viral. On the other side Brandan gets better trough his training regime and when Frank's leading fighter gets injured days before the tournament, he convinces Frank to fight the game of death for five million dollars. In the tournament Brandan catches the glimpse of younger brother which takes him back a little. The story gets more gripping when their father Paddy Conlon in-spite of his desperate attempts to seek forgiveness of his sons is turned deaf ears by both the brothers.As the action begins in "Sparta" we see the two brothers in a total contrasting fighting techniques. Tommy was a destruct knocking down his opponents with hefty blows and leaving the arena in haste. Brandan was "never give up" character who patiently struggled and waited for his opponent to make the mistake and catch them on the wrong foot and finally getting them tapped out. Meanwhile Tommy's heroics of ripping apart a tank door and saving fellow marine comrades during war gains him unprecedented support from soldiers and audience.Each of the brothers defeat their heavy?? oppositions to make road towards the final clash. In the final battle in-spite of early pounding from Tommy, Brandan manages to survive and in the opportune moment gets grip over his brother. However Tommy was also amongst the ones who would give up and his ligament snaps accidentally. Brandan realizes this and seeks? his brother to give up as he doesn't want to hurt his brother any more. The support from fellow soldiers make Tommy fight in-spite of the excruciating pain of his dislocated hand.Brandan's word "you don't need to do this" definitely stirs the audience's emotions.The last scene of tommy crying over Brandan's shoulders and their father smiling at the reconciliation was the undoubtedly the best scene of the movie. The strong story line with some good action sequences makes this movie amongst the best sports movies, definitely in the league of Rockies and Cinderella Man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good, deep and emotional film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film just last night after seeing a facebook status saying how "sick" it was. Sorry for the childish dialect there but we will move on. This movie started off quite slow, building up the characters but this was to be expected. Tom Hardy played the character well being someone with little show of emotion and did not talk much but however was shown to care although he may not have wanted others to think that. Nick Nolte being the ex-alcoholic father was also played well it's a shame he doesn't seem to be in as many films these days. Having never seen Joel Edgerton play a major role in a film I did not know what to expect. He was good although maybe too bland in some places but overall produced a good performance especially during the closing scenes.I like the story of the film. It was simple but had little extra things popping up throughout the film that added to the overall suspense of the ending. I found myself leaning up out of my bed biting my nails wondering what was going to happen to these two characters.Overall a very good film and well deserving of it's IMDb rating. Definitely worth a watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably one of the most emotional and inspiring films you'll see in a long time. Tom Hardy is a stand out in this film with his portrayal of a man with the bad boy look but when you see the film you know why. It's like all the Rocky movies put into one and it shows us why he is now a Hollywood star. Nick Nolte does amazing in his role as the father in the film and Joel Edgerton also gives a stunning performance in this film of determination and grit. The film starts out a bit slow and if you haven't seen the trailer then you probably aren't sure what it's about but within 30 minutes you pretty much know what the story is about and although in my eyes the ending was a bit shocking, I still feel that it ended well and the characters were given a good ending to the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to use and avoid clichés at the same time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a grim PIttsburgh town I feel like starting by saying Tommy used to work on the docks but he didn't, he's an ex-marine come home to try and get his life in order and maybe, try and patch things up with his abusive and recovering alcoholic estranged father, cut to Brandon, his brother who by contrast has a great life, seemingly, and a wonderful family. BUT, both of them have problems and the solution for both is to enter the same Mixed Martial Arts tournament for a five million dollar winner-takes-all prize where you kind of know exactly what's going to happen.And that is the film's curse and yet also it's strength because in a way you want it to go the way it's going to go and yet somehow when it happens it feels like such a shock. The script is packed with cliché's and yet because the film-makers do them right they never feel like it, and yet strangely enough the thing that isn't cliché feels more obvious than what could have been the clichés. The script and performances are top, some of the fights are brutal and yet others at times almost feel like they are not shot right, the story allows everything to get laid out in perfect clarity and yet it only takes up half of the film before they are at the tournament. Nick Nolte is top and Tom Hardy is his usual excellent self, although I have to say Kudos to Joel Edgerton for providing the emotional core of the film against such despair and desolation that alcoholism and domestic violence leave behind.A fight film that is ultimately about family more than anything else, that which we are born with, that which we create and those that which we choose to call family and it's that which will have you in tears at the end.A triumph.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action With eMOTION....!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film follows two fighters and their families as they enter the fast big money martial arts (MMA) competition, Sparta. Brendan doing it for the family (Joel Edgerton) and a seemingly brutal Tommy who is looking for a payday (the suddenly ubiquitous Tom Hardy)with Nick Nolte as Paddy , a sad, reformed drunk of a father and we have the basic elements of another run of the mill sporting movie. Or at least that's how it starts. It examines family relationships and regret and faces the terrible truths when some wounds just cannot be healed by forgiveness once it is too late.It's not all family drama though and unsurprisingly it does have a lot of fighting in so even though I think it is enjoyable for most if you can't stomach the violence then don't bother with it. However the fighting is well balanced within the narrative, excellently shot and excitingly edited so we do not get the cliché slow-mo or the epic hour long battle even for the big finale. Some of the fights are brutally quick and even those that go the distance are edited down very well indeed while maintaining that punishing feeling - they certainly had the audience cheering and wincing along with every slam and punch. There will be blood along with some horrible curdling crunches too.My final verdict is that... this is an awesome film which pulls you with its intense action and great emotions..... story of a fighter.. a father.. son and a family..!!!!! must watch...!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warrior is one of those films, you've got nothing to do on a Friday night, so you take a trip to the video store (even though your getting a DVD) and you pick it up and think, I'll give this a try.I get in the car and 2 mins down the road i've forgotten what movie I've chosen, in fact I'm contemplating a game of FIFA. No no I'll put this on.Wow, what can I say. I was expecting another Rocky in the Octagon and what I got was a film that delivers on so many emotional levels. Not only does it do this but it does it without a single molecule of cheese. That's where this film has succeeded for me. I'm not big on sports films and hands down this is the best of the genre I have seen.Lastly, I would also like to point out that Nick Nolte's performance is arguably one of the best performances i've seen on screen. His character is simple, with little complexity yet the acting was anything but.Highly recommended to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What occurs when Rocky Redux doubles down?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong: this is a well-produced and well-acted story that has all the fighting elements you'd want in a film that includes brutal, knock-down MMA.Trouble is, the actual story ? boxer who wins big against the odds ? has been done quite a few times already, Rocky (1976) being arguably the most remembered example. Hence, from that perspective, there is not much to say about this one. The synopsis on the main page provides sufficient as a starting point for most viewers' needs, anyway.In my view (no pun intended), what's more interesting is the performances from Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy ? coupled, of course, with the poignant portrayal of failed father and reformed drunkard from Nick Nolte.Edgerton is simply amazing. Having seen him previously in Animal Kingdom (2010) and The Square (2008), with his bearded, heavy-set and even over-weight physique, it's clear he trained hard to reduce his weight for this film. The intensity of his aggressive acting has just got better though. Hardy tops Edgerton, however: he is just awesome and reminiscent of a young Marlon Brando. Never have I seen an actor "get into" a role as he did here. With his portrayal as the guilt-ridden ex-Marine wanting punishment for his sins, he forced me to sit up and take notice of who this guy is. I found out I'd seen him in Black Hawk Down (2001) ? but completely missed him ? and recently in Inception (2010); but I didn't see his potential then.Nolte, with his bloated face, his aging, pudgy body and saddened features is perfectly cast as the drunk he once was (in acting and in real life). He's a good choice as the externally gruff wife-beater who finally wakes up to what he's done to his family and himself. The reconciliation scene as Hardy hugs Nolte on the bed in the hotel is one of the best father/son scenes ever put to film, I think.The supporting cast ? including some real-life MMA tough guys ? is uniformly good. Photography and editing are well up to the mark. The pacing slows somewhat with the various sub-plots but not to the point of me wanting to leave the room. My only other beef is that the dialog is difficult to hear many times, either because of external noise or low vocals, or both.If you liked Rocky as a story then this updated version is worth two hours of your life ? even if you can't abide those "animals" in the MMA cage. The two main actors certainly earned their fees for this one, both sustaining injuries while filming. As a martial artist myself, I know the drill.Recommended, mostly, for all MMA freaks and boxing fans. Give it seven.June 6, 2012.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mixed Martial Artists get it done in this winning flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie Warriors, come out and seeeeee "Warrior". You will not regret it! I am still dumbfounded how this movie did not make more money at the box office. "Warrior" is a gritty film starring Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton as estranged brothers Tommy and Brendan Conlon. Tommy is an introverted, rage-filled former Marine who wants to make a return run to mixed martial arts and participate in a "big money, winner takes all" infamous tournament called Sparta. The elder Brendan is a devoted husband, father of two girls, and physics teacher; how is that for a white-picket fence physics equation. When Brendan cannot make the mortgage payments on his home and is on the brink of foreclosure, he decides to also make a return run to mixed martial arts to bring in the extra flow, and therefore also trains for Sparta. So yes, Tommy and Brendan do yell in unison in one of the movie's scenes "We Are Sparta!!!"; OK, that did not happen but its just part of the close to "300" puns that I insert in each of my movie reviews. Nick Nolte co-stars as Paddy Conlon, the alcoholic father of Tommy and Brendan who definitely did not play "paddy cake" with his sons during their childhood. In other words, Brendan and Tommy do not take a liking to Paddy due to his past lush life. Tommy does ask Paddy to train him for Sparta in just a mere trainer-fighter relationship. Jennifer Morrison also co-stars as Tess, Brendan's supporting but scared wife; and Frank Grillo puts it in the acting grill with his supporting effort as Frank Campana, Brendan's friend and after some St. Brendan praying &amp; begging to Frank, eventual trainer. I will not reveal too much what happens in the Sparta, but let's say that the Conlon brothers from the same father &amp; mother, do make their match. Director Gavin O'Connor excelled in helming "Warrior" in all aspects of the movie including the fight scenes, the brother/father relationships, and in the sport that is mixed martial arts. O'Connor and fellow screenwriters Anthony Tambakis &amp; Cliff Dorfman did not exactly pin down a perfect screenplay in "Warrior", but good enough to take worthy of. The uprising Tom Hardy, who delivered in my eyes one of the most astounding acting performances in the last 5 years with his bravado leading performance in "Bronson", continues to rise up the thespian charts with another strong performance here as Tommy. Joel Edgerton did not match Hardy's performance "pound for pound" but Edgerton's work as Brendan was mixed with more good than bad. But the granddaddy or at least daddy performance of them all was Nick Nolte's stellar work as the Moby Dick obsessed pop Paddy, who even garnered a well-deserved Best Supporting Actor nomination for his passionate thespian effort. I must cut now to the part of the brilliant editing of "Warrior". Unfortunately, the film's editing did not make the cut of the Best Editing Oscar nominated films but it sure deserved it. So get your kicks and thrills (and maybe a few punches) with the magnetism of "Warrior". ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warrior Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*May include spoiler*Warrior is not an ordinary action film, which makes this movie excellent. Don't get me wrong the film has its share of action but the real plot of the story is based on a dysfunctional family. Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte) a drunk father s two children Tommy Colon a U.S. Marine (Tom Hardy) and Brendan Conlon, a high school teacher (Joel Edgerton). Both brothers are Mixed Marshal Arts (MMA) fighters and they enter a tournament called Sparta with two different intentions. Tommy, the Marine, enters the tournament because he needs the grand prize to take care of a struggling family. Brendan , the high school teacher, needs the money so he will not lose his house. The biggest obstacle the family has of getting along is forgiveness. Tommy and Brendan will not forgive their father for being a drunk and dividing the family and Tommy will not forgive Brendan his older brother for not coming away with him and their mother. Conflict was resolved in a gripping and suspenseful way that left me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie.Warrior family is dysfunctional like the family from a film called this Christmas. The storyline is different but the plot is the same. Both families have disputes over things in the past and the families come close due to different situations. The film director did a great job using sound effects, music and different tempo's to enhance suspense and emotions. In several action scenes the the cutting speed is slow motion whenever a knock out or big punch occurs. Sound effects from each punch or body hitting the mat makes the action more exciting and the crowd and environment makes movie suspenseful. Transitions throughout the film are done effectively by using different tempos and sound effects. Music and sound effects are loud whenever it is a action scene, but whenever the scene is serious or sad music is low and there are no sound effects included at all. The camera also zooms in on the characters whenever the scene is emotional.The theme makes the movie different from a typical action movie. The title of the film and the trailer would only attract a certain crowd of people (action seekers or MMA fans) but the theme actually relates to diverse set of crowds including the action seekers, teenagers, adults and the family orientated crowd. Warrior overall is a great movie with a suspenseful and dramatic plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goes for the obvious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie for Tom Hardy, and his performance was excellent as per usual, so I am being generous in my rating of 7 because of this because it should be more like a 5 or 6. It was just too clichéd. The story was OK, I liked the whole idea of the physics teacher moonlighting in MMA, but it seemed to stretch reality at some points in a film that is trying to be serious. There could of been a few more scenes to the story to add more dimension and give more depth to the characters relationships so it wasn't so clichéd (I think it could be more moving in the end if it had done this - seriously at the end I knew I was supposed to be moved but I wasn't). For example the Dad did some bad stuff, but what exactly, why did they leave? What was the brothers relationship like before all the crap went down? Etc. I am a viewer that definitely doesn't need everything spelled out, and I like when films leave some mystery, but there wasn't enough here to emotionally invest me. And when the film does reveal a hidden secret I was kind of disappointed, it went for the obvious at every turn, The performances in this movie are great, especially Nolte and Hardy, and that is what the film relies on to get our sympathies. With different actors the film would have really not been that good, so I would give the director/story and all other aspects of this film a 5, the acting around an 8, again I am being generous with a 7 rating. It is definitely worth watching, and entertaining, but anyone with half a brain will know what is going to happen in the end half way through the movie, and will even know the plot surprises before they are revealed, because the film goes for the obvious.</fullReview>

This movie was released with Contagion which was quite overlooked by many people but they appreciated it so much. I don't think i disliked Warrior at all but thought it was just overrated, it is not even near The Fighter or something like that but is a good movie to watch. I think people who are a die hard fans of action and fighting movies will love it and not to forget fans of Tom Hardy. So Tommy played by Tom Hardy is a former U.S. Marine has a love and hate relation with his father Paddy played by Nick Nolte because of his past behavior. Paddy is now a Christian but was very violent alcoholic in the past that hints towards their disturb childhood. During a visit he fails to impress Tommy that he have changed, Tommy enters a competition called as Sparta which is a MMA Tournament after he beats a well known fighter at a local gym and the video gets viral. Paddy's older son Brendan played by Joel Edgerton is a high school physics teacher struggling to cop with his financial difficulties even he and his wife Tess played by Jennifer Morrison works very hard, he has two daughters too. He has no other options but to enter the MMA local fights with different fighters which was his former profession earning enough to finish the loan but the rumors start spreading the school and he has to stop doing such a dangerous profession or would be expelled. With the help of his friend and trainer he enters the Sparta too just like his brother who is being trained by their father. Things get a bit thrilling and weird at the same time when the two brothers comes face to face with one another at the ring.As this movie isn't your usual offbeat or indie movie but a mass entertainer, i would avoid giving out much smaller details of the movie. Now i think the scene stellar in this movie was the one and only Nick Nolte, i am rooting for him getting a Supporting Actor Oscar nomination, he is just brilliant. Tom Hardy's character was interesting and he performed nicely too while Joel's acting abilities aren't as good as both of them but he really handled this movie perfectly. Nick Nolte is pitch perfect in his portrayal of a troubled father finding his way back into his sons life. I was brilliantly touched, superbly effected and in some scene furious to his acts all at once which is a rare thing for an actor playing such a diverse role to convince you through all these factor even if director doesn't show some of them. You can clearly see paddy's past and his obvious willingness of a bright future in his eyes. I think this is one of the best supporting performance of the year, brilliant and outstanding. I will also appreciate Tom Hardy's work in this movie as deeply satisfying and quite convincing. Joel Edgerton is fine too but Tom Hardy plays his character with much more conviction. Overall the movie is very heartbreaking and somewhat gripping sports action drama that truly knows its audience and their emotional spots. Towards the end it came of as emotionally satisfying to me and i really like the human spirit of this movie.I think it might be the lack of interest in the sport movies or in fact in the fighting movies but then i appreciated Moneyball and The Fighter tremendously. I don't know what holds me back for giving this movie a above average score but not a very good one like everyone else and the fact that i am calling it overrated. I think the character development in this movie is outstanding, just a few minutes into their life and you feel like you knew everything about them. At the end, it is a rare fact that no one comes out as a loser in the movie, everyone wins which is a satisfying ending in terms of the story where they were doing the fights not to win or make their careers but for some specific reasons. I think the fights scenes were carefully examined and added, i was thrilled by many of the sequences specially the endings one. There is story development and everything in the start but hardcore fighting scenes in the other half. It has fine music and cinematography to it too. I enjoyed the movie, not all of it but most of the parts and thought it could have been a bit better than what it already is. But its not bad or average at all,i think you will have a good time watching this movie.Rating:3/5C+Follow My Blog: HollywoodAndMe.Blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess I could go into explaining the true meaning behind the movie, the spiritual redemption and healing. Challenges and obstacles that appear before each character emotionally and physically to shut up some of the critics of this movie. But I wont. The bottom line for me is that when I get those goose bumps, or the hair raises on the back of my neck, or the intense feeling of wanting to jump out of my seat while I am watching a movie such as this one, then my own emotion tells the story that this was indeed one of the best movies I have seen. My only gripe is, I wish it was a little longer eg fight scenes and the hint of European accent during the chat between Brendon and his father. Tommy certainly had the demeanor of a Philadelphia fighter and a MMA tough guy while Brendon had the finesse and hints of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the trailer to Warrior many times, I wanted to see this movie from the start. When I bought it on DVD, I was shocked of this film. I love all performances from Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton, Jennifer Morrison and Nick Nolte. The story line behind the film wasn't any ordinary where one guy loses everything in the beginning and battles back over obstacles at the end and rise about everything. You get many stories through this whole film where Nick Nolte is a recovering alcoholic, Joel Edgerton and Jennifer Morrison are a married couple with two girls and they are just like any other American family. Working two to three jobs to help their kids and doctor bill as well. Then there comes Tom Hardy's character where he plays a Marine that goes AWOL after his brother in arms in killed and he saves a fellow marine in the process. He returns home and asks the help of his father to train him for an MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) tournament. By far, this movie has Oscar buzz flowing around it. Gavin O'Connor coming from making Miracle to this is a big step forward in his career. I just liked it cause within 15 minutes of the movie, there is a fight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You don't knock him out, you lose the fight. Understand me? You don't knock him out, you don't have a home." After being away from home for a long long time Tommy (Hardy) comes back to see his father Paddy (Nolte). Across town his brother Brendan (Edgerton) is having financial troubles. The only way the two brothers can find a way to make the money they need is by fighting in an MMA tournament. Tommy asks his father to train him and the family dysfunction grows until the tournament. Regardless of what I say here this is a great movie. My problem with this is that I think my expectations were too high. Any movie that draws comparisons to "Rocky" gets my hopes up (like "The Fighter"). Much like "Rocky" though, this movie has the fighting as a secondary plot to the family struggles that are going on. This movie is very interesting in the way that you are not sure who is the "good" brother and are not really sure who to root for the entire time. If you have seen "The Fighter" you may agree with me when I say that the movie was good but Christian Bale's performance made the movie. Nick Nolte gives that kind of performance in this one. He takes a part that could get glossed over and makes it stand out enough that to me he is the front runner for an Oscar. Overall, a very good movie but my expectations were too high to love it as much as I wanted. Of the last "fighting" movies to come out I would have to say this is 3rd on my list. After "The Wrestler" and "The Fighter". Still very much worth watching though. I give it a B+.*Also try - The Fighter &amp; The Wrestler</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfinished Storyline - made up for with amazing acting and intense moments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this film, but at the same time it was nowhere near perfect. To start with I'll talk about the things that really annoyed me about this film, and then I will talk about how it managed to redeem itself.To start with the ending is terrible, the film is missing about fifteen to twenty minutes of actually finishing the story lines, as you could see what was going to happen form the beginning Tommy was ultimately going to loose to Brendan, and after they had their final fight the film would end, and thats exactly what happened. It was a little disappointing to see this happened as it did not answer the questions as to what will happen to Tommy after the fight as he was about to be imprisoned for desertion, it also did not end the story line of why Tommy was in the tournament to start with, which was to raise money for his comrade who died in action, this was only mentioned once or twice and was never fully explained. I was expecting Brenda to offer half the money at the end of the fight to stop but instead he had to beat him - way to kick a man while he was down.It may have also just been me but I did wonder where the father had gone, which kept being mentioned but then he just turned up again, and it didn't really show why he had left, and so I didn't really get this part of the film. Finally the most annoying part of the film is that in my eyes Tommy should have won, he was the better fighter and Brenda won most of his fights through 'flukes' which was irritating. Like I said earlier Brenda should have offered him half the money to stop fighting as Tommy had already taken his anger out on him and so had nothing to loose. Instead the guy who had been really average throughout the film won and just carried Tommy away, which only really ended the family drama part of the story.However although this film's ending really annoyed me, what it did make up for was great acting Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy were absolutely amazing as their given roles, and anything they did seemed to be faultless. These two kind of stole the show, as they really got into their roles as fighters and it was really easy to see them as fighters, so little was left to the imagination. The fighting scenes also did not cut to much so you got to see some amazing fighting moves which was nice to see when most modern films don't really put them in, so this was another amazing factor.Taking that all into account the main positive for me was when 'About Today - The Nationals' was played, it fit in so well to the film and really became quite emotional as these two brothers fought in their final round against each other. This is one of the few movies where I generally felt completely swept up in the moment and it really was quite sad, to see a man having travelled so far and get shot down at the final - However this does go along with my belief that Tommy Should have won, or they should have drew.None the less I thoroughly enjoyed this film , and unfinished film but the journey was exceptional and I would be glad to rate this film as a must see for just about anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is amazing! No, not amazing, amazing does not even come close to its level of perfection. It was so great, I am forced to make up a word for it.... Scrumtralessent! But really, this is a great movie. Nick Noltie gives the performance of his life in this movie (nearl bringing me to tears at points) and Tom Hardy and Jeol Edgerton give it there all in this Rocky-Esq movie. The level of emotion and power given in this movie is unbelievable!If you have not seen this movie and are having doubts as to if you should or shouldn't watch this, only ask your self this question: "Do i want to see a moving and powerful film?" If that's a yes, watch this movie. It's not some MMA rock'em sock'em movie, it's a drama with some cool MMa stuff in it.This only makes me sadder to think how great this movie is, for not only did Nick Noltie not get his Oscar for this movie, poor Gavin O'Conner didn't get his Directing Oscar and best picture Oscar!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very emotionally driven movie, with pitch-perfect performances.Nolte is amazing and was frankly robbed at the Oscars. Hardy is brilliant and Edgerton successfully underplays his role.Along with 'the Fighter', the story is all about family and sticking together.MMA is the backdrop and provides a good setting for these three men to duke out their differences.This is a drama first, the spectacle is the powerful acting.And admittedly, it relies on many of the clichés of this particular genre but it remains gripping and true to itself, the story.Which could just as easily have been a true one. It probably is.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've had this movie for around 6 months but never really wanted to watch it despite the rating it had on IMDb. The start was a bit dull and confusing for me but after that it just kept getting better and more exciting. Great story, great plot, great climax.Although the fighting sequences or techniques used could have been better and a bit more realistic it was well compensated by acting. If you are not a fighting fanatic this will be no problem for you.Would have given a 10 but considering it is primarily a MMA movie then the minus 1 goes to the fighting scenes.A gotta watch movie which will appeal to all mature audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Movie - as good as Rocky!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie so very excellent, it deserved more Oscar nominations. It easily finds its way among the best fighting movies of all times and in my opinion it's as good as, if not better than, Rocky. The last sequence specially is amazingly well done and brings you close to tears. The fights are portrayed stupendously, and in fact they seem extremely real.As far as the characters are concerned, Nick Nolte takes the cake with his brief but marvelous show of emotions. Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy too are great. I loved the passive aggression and the pent up anger showed inside Tommy Conlon. Kudos to both the scriptwriter and Tom. In fact I found about Tom after searching IMDb for the villain in Nolan's next - Dark Knight Rises. Now more than Batman, I am eager to see what Tom is capable of! I would've loved to see Nick Nolte's role extended in the movie, even if that meant extra few minutes. He truly deserved the Oscar nomination.Full marks to the movie though. If you haven't seen it yet, watch it on DVD with full surround sound to experience this truly remarkable story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warrior is one of the best movies ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard something about this movie upon its brief showing at the theater, but because of atrocious advertising it was not seen by many including myself. So upon it's release on DVD and based on all the great reviews by critics and past viewers I decided to rent. Well, as the credits rolled at the end of my viewing I felt I had just watched one of the greatest movies ever made. I don't think "Rocky" or "The Fighter" are on the same level as "Warrior."The acting from Mr Hardy, Mr Edgeron and Mr Nolte was truly amazing. These actors made you embody their character.Paddy - played superbly by Nick Nolte was a drunk and abusive father. Mr Nolte was excellent in the hotel scene where it seemed like his son Tommy had finally broken him has he returned to the bottle...it's then I felt sadness for this terrible excuse for a father.Brenden - The older son who is a devoted and loving husband and father of two girls is on the brink of financial collapse. Everyone loves Brenden - his family, students, faculty and long time friend. By all accounts he is a good man. Tommy - the younger son. How my heart cried for Tommy. A man so broken by so much pain and suffering because of what life had thrown at him. There was this feeling of abandonment from his older brother who decided to stayed with his drunken abusive father, the heartbreak of caring for his sick mother while watching her die surrounded by poverty and the horror of war as he stood witness to his entire combat unit and best friend succumb to friendly fire, with him being the only surviver. Tommy is emotionally and mentally scared. Tommy is rage toward everyone, especially his father and brother. The only peace he seems to find is in his mission to help his dead best friend's wife financially. So he must win the MMA competitionThat final fight in the iron cage between Tommy and Brenden was heartbreaking. Tommy's anger toward his brother had almost reached the point of madness. He was like a caged animal let loose. He was willing to fight almost to his death, but this man was calmed when his brother said "i'm sorry" and "I love you" You saw that steel of armor drop revealing a broken and sensitive man who had never stopped loving his brother. Mr Nolte and Mr Edgeron gave excellent performances, but it is Tom Hardy who stood out for me. I feel he gave one of the best performances I have ever seen on screen. And as a fellow Brit I am proud to say he is one of the best actors to come out of England in decades. I've seen his brilliance in Bronson as Charles Bronson, his cool and likable Eames in Inception and that of Handsome Bob in RocknRolla, to name a few. The man is a chameleon. It's such a shame Warrior was not more recognized because Mr Hardy gave a Oscar worth performance and Edgeron should have been up for supporting actor. At least Mr Nolte got recognized. This lady gives Warrior 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was recommended by a friend and it took me a while to see it. I watched the trailer and I thought it's another film about fighting.So, when I saw it last night, finally, I was thunder struck by how good the acting was right from the very first scene. I didn't expect that at all. I knew that Nick Nolte is a good and underrated actor but the fact that he is old made me think about Al Pacino and Robert de Niro and some of their last films. But in Warrior, Nick Nolte did an outstanding performance worthy of an Oscar. About Warrior. The script and the way it was filmed, had me engrossed since the very beginning, the characters story was heart breaking and the director and the writers made me feel for both brothers and for the father, giving them an amazingly sad life previous what the movie shows and I cheered for all of them. I didn't expect a "muscle man" to really act, getting accustomed with Stallone and Arnie's lack of skills, and Tom Hardy proved me wrong. I liked the way he played Tommy, making him an indestructible but fighting his own demons throughout the movie. And Joel Edgerton was new for me because I really didn't pay attention to him or his roles before. They both did an amazing job showing the hurt and the everlasting bond between two brothers. Maybe Warrior is a big and old cliché since it isn't the first or the last of his kind but I don't care. The last 20 minutes I cried my heart out for both of them and in all my life I didn't cry so much for some fictional characters. I give it 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action-Packed and Masculine, But Not as Deep as it Thinks it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just your run-of-the-mill Hollywood sports movie, it's disappointingly static and mostly predictable with an armload of blatant plot holes. It does deserve credit for bucking convention in a few ways, particularly in building to the inevitable finale with two potentially viable results. Typically the happy ending writes itself halfway through the picture and then just goes through the motions to get us there: in Warrior, we follow both perspectives for the whole of the film and either outcome would make for an appropriate, warm ride into the sunset. The fight scenes are fun, if highly exaggerated, takes on an in-vogue sport; it's about as realistic a portrayal of mixed martial arts as Rocky and The Replacements were to boxing and pro football. Nick Nolte deserves special mention for grizzling up and embracing his inner Burgess Meredith, but I didn't see anything above and beyond from leading men Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is what Hollywood is about. Pure, emotional, bestial , true and... simple. A real introspection in what winning is and is not. But... They chose the wrong winner (And it's what we like or not). The bestial brother needed to win over his fellow 'smart' family member. Just a little lack of daring on a story basis from a Hollywoodian perspective. But it's really all we can reproach to this piece of art. I cannot not think of the The Wrestler and the not yet disfigured Mickey Rourke (of 9 1/2 weeks) when I see the lost soul in this movie who grew up with the mother and left the army shamefully. Just a bit too American maybe... just maybe... The realization is sensational. At the end of the movie we really feel like getting out of reality. This movie was the best that UFC could expect. In 'Warrior' We are deep in the Greek empire as noticed by the father of our two heroes somewhere in the begging. This movie is an epic journey. Who know, maybe in two thousand years mythology will be about watching such movies... I can hardly grasp how awesome it will be to study history in 2000 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as Rocky!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went to see this film on it's opening night last year and I was blown away, Warrior is the best fighting film since Rocky all those years ago, that's the best accolade I can give it.The story is brilliant, the script is cheesy at times but is very good. As for the acting, it's top class all across the board, but Nick Nolte &amp; Tom Hardy are the standout performances for me. Nick Nolte's performance as the former alcoholic father of Tommy(Tom Hardy) &amp; Brendan(Joel Edgerton) is absolutely brilliant and the scene between him and Hardy is very emotional and probably Nolte's best scene.And then one of the most talented actors around at the moment, Tom Hardy who plays Tommy Riordan a former marine who returns with a chip on a shoulder and is an unbeaten MMA fighter since he school days and Tom plays this role to perfection and if it were up to me, he'd be up for an Oscar along with Nick Nolte who also rightly deserves the nomination.And Joel Edgerton who plays Brendan, who's settled down to a family lifestyle and works as a teacher but is in debt and Joel Edgerton also pulls out a great performance.The action scenes and fights are very hard hitting but what makes it brilliant is the story of the brothers and the emotion in the film. There's certain plot holes and problems with the film like there is in any film but the 2 hours and 20 minutes fly by.The ending is one of my favourite endings, but it is a little bit corny but I loved it and a couple of scenes made me cry, the ending will make you tear up at least, made me cry anyway.You need to watch Warrior because for me it was the film of 2011 and one of my favourite films of all-time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An ex-Marine haunted by a tragic past, Tommy Riordan, returns to his hometown of Pittsburgh and enlists his father, a recovered alcoholic, to train him for an MMA tournament awarding the biggest purse in the history of the sport.As Tommy blazes a violent path towards the title prize, his brother, Brendan, a former MMA fighter unable to make ends meet as a school teacher, returns to the amateur ring to provide for his family.Even though years have passed, recriminations and past betrayals keep Brendan bitterly estranged from both Tommy and his father.But when Brendan's unlikely rise as an underdog sets him on a collision course with Tommy, the two brothers must finally confront the forces that tore them apart, all the while waging the most intense, winner-takes-all battle of their lives.This film scores really highly on this site, and for me, i'm really scratching my head as to why.It's well acted, and is very entertaining, but on the other end of the spectrum, the film is way too long, and predictable.From the upstart, we know that Brendan is going to come up smelling of roses, because he has the family, Tommy on the other hand, has a huge chip on his shoulder and the attitude as well, any seasoned film goer should know the outcome.The director does throw a little curve-ball when we learn that Tommy will give his prize money away, but it's far too late to change the mind of the viewer, because Brendan is a nice guy, with all the school behind him.The three leads though are amazing and really put their all into the film, making that little more watchable.But for critics saying that this is better than Rocky, they should really throw in the towel.Good, but not amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first movie I have ever given a rating this high, the reason being the researchers obviously did their job very well as one of the characters is obviously suffering from PTSD. This is an illness I suffer from myself and could so relate to why he was like he is, It was shocking how realistic it made that character seem to me, and I have never experienced that emotion from any film I have ever watched. Putting all that aside this is a proper heartfelt sport/action/drama movie anyway and is well worth a watch, and will leave you feeling glad you gave up the time to do so. I started watching this movie with low expectations, as i wrongly assumed it would be another story-less waste of an hour and a half or more of my life, but was shocked and surprised how good it is. Watch it you will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A former alcoholic boxer (Nick Nolte) faces his past in the eyes of his two sons, Tommy (Tom Hardy) and Brendan (Joel Edgerton). Things tend to get personal during a mixed martial arts tournament where both brothers participate.Nick Nolte gets into the skin of such characters, he's fantastic. Tom Hardy comes from the latest brilliant generation of British actors, very talented, great performance. The theatrical Australian, Joel Edgerton, shakes things up with his 'warrior' side.At first, i lost the rhythm of the film for a while. Close to the middle of it, it started clearing up to a really good finale, in my opinion. Yes, you might get that Rocky rush here, also. It is exciting. The music's great, suits pretty well. It was composed and produced by Mark Isham. The atmosphere was humid, cloudy and focused on the cage. The matches scenes seem to have been shot with TV MMA show cameras. They move pretty quick outside and inside the ring.Again, if you're into sport films, with the drama lurking in the background and some good actors, you may like it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My emotional response to this movie was surprisingly strong.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I'll get down to Warrior's script. The screenplay may be littered with clichés, but you know what? I don't care about any of that. Rather than pick apart predictability, I was practically amazed by how massive my emotional response to this movie was. Something in this movie manages finding sincerity.At the center of the script is the crippled relationship between two brothers. The movie's rousing strength comes from their relationship, and we don't root for one to beat the other in their tournament. Maybe we do, but I don't know. What we really want is for the two of them to reconcile. These roles needed serious life to get them off the ground, and Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton prove they have enough emotion to match their bulky physiques. Not to be forgotten is Nick Nolte, taking what could have been a typical role in any other hands, and managing to give it deeper meaning.Finally, I must mention the editing. The film is a bit over long, but the work by the film's quartet of editors (Sean Albertson, Matt Chesse, John Gilroy, and Aaron Marshall) is quite excellent. The film manages to find a consistent rhythm, whether it be showcasing the more subtle tactics of the characters and sub plots, or the more flashy styles of the brutal fight sequences, especially in the film's fight heavy second half.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directing 8/10- Solid directing, intriguing shots and well paced. The fight scenes were phenomenally choreographed. Acting 9.5/10- Some of the acting from the extreme minor roles was cheesy but nick nolte, edgerton and hardy gave amazing heartfelt performances. It's sad to see that nolte, in particular, is not getting more recognition for his performance, his performance was riveting. Screenplay 8/10- The screenplay was rather cliché and predictable. However, I have yet to see another sports film a better and deeper character story line. I have also yet to see a mixed martial arts film this deep and heartfelt. So it's original in those aspects. Visual Effects 7/10- Nothing crazy at all visually, but its not needed with a film like this. The fight scenes were filmed with near perfection. Sound Effects/Music 9/10- The music throughout was solid, but what really lifted the film was the ending song. It tied the scene together in such a beautiful fashion. Overall, great film that might sadly be overlooked. Amazing storyline between the characters and definitely one of the best sports films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Warrior" looks and sounds like a type of film we've all seen before; except this time, it actually works.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Warrior" Director: Gavin O' Connor Writers: Gavin O' Connor, Cliff Dorfman, and Anthony Tambakis Stars: Tom Hardy (Inception, Bronson), Joel Edgerton (The Thing), and Nick Nolte (Affliction)"Warrior" is the story of two brothers and their father, who's an ex-boxer and recovering alcoholic. When I say that, it sounds like a type of film we've all seen before; except this time, it actually works. Brendan Conlon, who is played by Joel Edgerton, is a former-MMA fighter who has left his alcoholic father and brother behind to start a new life. Brendan is now "living the American dream"; he has started a family and works as a high-school physics teacher. Things appear to be going great for Brendan and his wife (Jennifer Morrison); however, due to financial problems, Brendan and his family are about to lose their house. To make some extra cash, Brendan goes to apply for a job as a bouncer at a local "titty bar". Instead, he ends up participating in a small MMA event. Brendan wins but ironically things get worse. A video of Brendan's fight is uploaded to You-Tube; as a result, The school-board sees the video and Brendan gets laid-off from work. With no other option, Brendan trains and enters the big MMA tournament, "Sparta", to win the big prize money.Meanwhile, Tommy Ridoran (Tom Hardy), Brendan's younger brother, returns home after several years to his now sober father, Paddy (Nick Nolte). Paddy, who is now a thousand days sober, just wants to get to know his son and repair their broken relationship. Unfortunately for Paddy, you find out that Tommy wants hardly anything to do with his father. Tommy only wants one thing; he wants his old man to train him for the "Sparta" tournament. From That point on you can guess what the climax is."Warrior" has a simple, yet heart-throbbing story that could make the manliest man cry. Most of these "heart-throbbing" moments are with Nick Nolte's character, Paddy. (with a first name like Paddy, you feel even more sorry for him.) Paddy tries so hard to repair his relationships with both of his sons, Tom and Brendan, and nothing ever seems to go his way. "Warrior" teaches us that it's essential to forgive friends, and most importantly, family for wrong doings. At the same time though, "Warrior" also teaches us to never forget. Alright, so now your wondering how the Mixed Martial Arts are represented. One word: BAD- ASS. Do keep in mind though, this is coming from a guy that's never actually watched MMA before. With that said, it's pretty awesome. Tom Hardy's character, Tommy, ("Who's too small to play Bane in TDKR") is a F-ing monster. Tommy's first punch is always that last punch that gets thrown. Tommy immediately knocks out every opponent he encounters with only one hit. Tommy comes in, throws a punch, and walks out even before the ref can clarify that his opponent has been knocked out. Don't think for one minute though that Tommy's older brother, Brendan, is a weakling. Brendan (Joel Edgerton) might not knock out guys within one hit, but he can sure fight. He's the underdog of the story, and the guy that's probably the most relatable. I'm not spoiling anything when I say this, (They reveal it in the trailer and TV-spot) but when the two brothers collide in the climax, you're not sure who to root for. That's the great thing about "Warrior"; you genuinely like these characters.Edgerton, Hardy, and especially Nolte give great performances. Edgerton plays the underdog role so well, and Hardy plays the tough broken spirit like a violin. Nolte; however, steals the violin and plays it on steroids. I really believe that Nick Nolte deserves an Oscar nomination for "Best Supporting Actor". It probably won't happen, but at least it won't be the first time that The Academy has snubbed someone. We all remember last year's big snub, don't we.There are some problems with "Warrior"; fortunately though, they're very minor. The first problem I have with "Warrior" are the commentators at the MMA tournaments. Much like any sport that you watch, they never fail to be over obnoxious and just plain annoying. The commentators pull out some of the most inane dialogue that do not serve the least bit of significance. The second problem (much like the first) I have with "Warrior" is some of the dialogue. The good news is that 90 percent of the bad dialogue lies on the shoulders of the two idiotic commentators.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and I advise everyone and anyone to see it. Like I said earlier, this movie can make the manliest man cry. In fact, this movie caters towards those kinds of people. "Warrior" is that "tough guy" movie with a huge heart at it's core. I give "Warrior" a 4 out of 5.-Colyn Kirkland</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warrior is an absolute juggernaut of a movie. It's a well built powerhouse that simply flawed me. Many may look at it as another fighting/sports movie, but Gavin O'Connor has the sense to delve much deeper. The biggest draw to this film are the two protagonists. Most films give us just one to follow, or a single team to root for. Here we are given two brothers that move closer and closer towards confronting each other. Hardy is exceptional as the emotionally damaged younger brother. A war hero and an absolute beast of a man, he tears his opponents apart in a matter of seconds. There are moments when it seems as though he has lost all control. His older estranged brother is fighting for his family. Now a physics teacher, he turned his back on fighting a long time ago. Unlike his destructive brother, Edgerton must wait for his moment to strike. Giving us two protagonists means we are not sure who to cheer on. During their individual scenes, they are the hero, but the final is obviously there for them to fight for the prize and get out the animosity they hold towards each other. We also have Nolte playing the reformed alcoholic wife-beater. He is stuck in purgatory, as Hardy allows him to train him, but cannot mention anything outside of fighting. Nolte cherishes this opportunity, but is knocked down by both sons. He is gradually taken to the brink, where his breakdown scene has Oscar slapped all over it. The fights are epic. Even though the trailer shows you who will be in the final, the journey is still powerful. Bringing tears of excitement and joy as well as clutching tightly to the arm of the chair. By the time these two face off, it's impossible to know for certain who will stand victorious. A dramatic and exciting film that uses the genre's conventions to its advantage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story started off pretty good but got more and more unbelievable to the point of being ridiculous at the end. The acting and dialog were good overall, especially Nick Nolte. But the melodrama got so thick at the end I could barely stand it. It also started to get really tiresome listening to Tommy grunt and snarl at everyone all hunched over like a cave man. And, what a surprise, he turns out to be a war hero who never took credit for saving someone's life so the whole crowd is cheering for him. That by itself, okay; but added to all the other unbelievable stuff; no. If the writers had consulted a group of high school boys, they probably would have recommended that. Then how the fight turned out in the end: could it have even been attempted to make it more dramatic and moving? What else could have been thrown in there to aim for a higher crescendo to make it by far the very most dramatic sports movie of all time--since that seems to have been what they were aiming for? Maybe the other guy's daughter could have been taken hostage and he has to win to save her life, but at the same time Tommy actually had organ damage and would die if he was hit again. Sound pretty good? I mean, that would be really dramatic. It is possible to overdo something so that it just becomes dumb, and despite the good elements of this film, it could not have been much more overdone in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but 8.3?? Come on!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie yesterday. The movie is good. But, the story is nothing really new, too much unnecessary drama, clichés make this a 7/10 and nowhere close to 8. I also hated the fact that a not-so-good-and- experienced fighter with a little training and heart wins over much better fighters, not once but just way too many times. And that too, after taking a pounding every single time. I understand that he is one of the main characters but, come on!. When I watch movies such as this, I expect it to be a realistic but this one pushes some things way too far.Still a good movie but don't see the IMDb rating and think this is one of the best. Its not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a moving film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just watched Warrior for the second time and it hit me just as hard as the first. Hardy, Nolte and Edgerton along with the rest of the cast, deliver such an emotional and powerful story in Warrior. The film may not please those who want all-out MMA action but what it does deliver is a real-life story that we can relate to and believe. This film hits hard, both physically and emotionally, as we are reminded of what really matters in life; the love we have for those close to us. I, personally, think that the acting from the characters is real and you can feel it.I would highly recommend this to anybody who hasn't seen it yet, even if you're not the biggest fan of MMA.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warrior</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this movie is extremely well made. This is without a doubt my favorite film of this year, my favorite sports film, and probably one of my favorite movies of all time. And all this is after only one viewing, which is going to change dramatically in the very near future.The acting is top notch in Warrior. Joel Edgerton did a great job with his role, and I genuinely felt for the character and his family. Nick Nolte was outstanding in his role as the father of the two main characters. His character's problems and the way acted towards his sons is very well done and realistic on his part. There are some dramatic scenes of his that really make you feel sorry for him, and you feel sorry for his family too because of what he has done to them in the past.Tom Hardy, however, was the best part of this movie acting-wise. He took the stereotypical "tough guy who doesn't need anyone or want anyone" and made him very relatable. He still plays that kind of character, but he is so much more than that, and I felt for him in almost every scene he was in, regardless of his actions, because you just have that feeling that he has had a very rough life. I got goosebumps numerous times throughout the movie due to his amazing acting.The editing and cinematography was fantastic as well. My favorite showing of this aspect is when they show a montage of people training. It sounds like it has been done before, but the way it was done was...well, you'd have to see it to know what I mean.Going into it, I knew that this movie would be at the very least good, but it was amazing. I would not be surprised to see Hardy and Nolte get acting nominations at the Oscars, and I think they both have a great chance of winning. Best editing, picture, and screenplay awards are also very possible for this dramatic, heart wrenching, amazing film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painfully beautiful film. *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally i give it a 10 out of 10 because i loved everything about this film, including and especially the fighting (girl here). With a cast like this there is hardly anything bad you can say about it. It certainly has heart, certainly has a story, it makes you think, it makes you feel and it makes you relate..and it made me cry. It made me cry because when you look at just how much these men (the family) had been hurting by who did what, when and why which broke the family apart, and then what brings them together even if just about..you just can't help but to think and/or relate to it slightly and cry...or not. Anyway, in the end the money didn't even matter, sure this was the goal for either Tommy and Brendan at the beginning but it became about so much more than that, despite what happened in that ring which led to his defeat, it just really made you realise how much Tommy was hurting and how much Brendan wanted his little brother back, and the father his sons. I recommend this film to everyone even the non MMA fans. Everything made this film just perfect. Please watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally I reserve my reviews for caustic comment on the fodder churned out by the film industry, but the quality of Warrior has forced me to make an exception.Not being given to regularly watching violence, I had expected a gratuitously violent movie with shades of Rambo and Rocky but found quite the opposite. The action was very well balanced within the plot; there were no fight scenes just for the sake of having fight scenes. Nevertheless there is sufficient action for those who like to watch a good, gut-churning fight.The movie isn't about physical strength, it's about our strength, the strength of human nature, and how we deal with life's lessons as individuals to overcome the trials and adversity that life often brings.The story is so well told that you can feel and understand the emotional pain of the three protagonists.Unusually, and quite unexpectedly, this is a very good movie. Provided you have a heart, not a mere house-brick swinging nonchalantly on the end of a rope inside your chest cavity, which you try pass off to unsuspecting passers-by as a heart, you'll understand, and probably thoroughly enjoy, the movie's underlying tensions. Best of all, you'll grasp it's real meaning.I give it 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warrior is the best movie of the year so far!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't be misled by the name- Warrior is no action movie. It is though, a superlative emotional roller-coaster, inter spaced with the occasional punch or too. In the style of Rocky, this is a combat sport movie, on the lives of two brothers- who set out on different paths that converge in one titanic fight in the ring, and the greatest thing about this movie is that you don't get to pick sides, you root for both of them till the very end.Tom Hardy plays Tommy- an ex-Marine who was a champion mixed martial artist, trained by his father. With the build of a bulldog, he has the personality of a champion too- brooding, confident, and with the capability to finish off his opponents in seconds. But he is also disillusioned, a deserter from the armed forces, and a dipsomaniac too. Joel Edgarton plays Brendan, and he is every bit the proverbial underdog. When he was a kid, his father was never interested in him as he saw more potential in Tom, and we all know how favoritism from parents can make the unfavored sibling feel. And so he always has a point to prove- when his coach tells him that when the moment comes, he will tap out or when his wife tells him that he won't go all the way - it shows in his eyes when he says he will. And yet, Brendan, like most of us, fights best when his back is to the wall. Both the brothers don't talk to each other, and also harbor deep resentments towards their alcoholic father, whom they blame for their mothers death, and for mistreating them. And no one could have played this redemption seeking, guilt ridden yet trying to pull himself together father as Nick Nolte did. In one of the movie's finest scenes, he breaks down in his son's arms reciting Herman Melville, and with that builds bridges too. A surefire Oscar nod for this, I hope.The first half focuses on what all directors aim to do but cant- character development. Little by little insights into the lives of the main characters, what drives them, gives us a glimpse of what drives them towards participating in a global mixed martial arts championship. The second half has some of the most authentically choreographed fight scenes in MMA history, and credit goes to both Tom and Joel for making this look so real- it feels that they have been doing this all their lives, and not only for this movie.Both have contrasting fighting styles- Tom is overpowering, dominating, and attacking, while Joel is fast, stealthy, thinking, absorbs a lot of punishment but gets his foe down in the end- reminds me so much of my childhood WWF hero, Bret "The Hit-man" Hart. And the one thing common between the two is that none know how to give an inch. So when the climactic, emotion filled final bout between the brothers take place, one of them has to shout repeatedly to the injured other that he loves him, so that he gives up and the fight gets over.The movie is predictable as most sports based movies are- families unite, barriers are broken and champions emerge. But Warrior, in spite of its clichés, holds its own as a powerhouse of a movie. Many Oscars coming the Warrior's way, I say!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fight-night makes a comeback</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for this and immediately thought that this was a Rocky for 2011. To a certain extent this is true as everything builds up to the main event - a $5 million cage fight for the toughest fighters around the globe - and it is the story of 2 underdogs both of whom happen to be estranged brothers. Brought up in and then split by a harsh, patriarchal family, the 2 brothers follow their own separate paths - one a physics teacher and family man, the other a troubled marine.Both Edgerton (Brendan Conlan) and Hardy (Tommy Conlan) play their respective parts well but it is Edgerton who gets more screen time and is the more likable character - a struggling teacher who needs to fight to pay his mortgage and keep a roof over his family's heads. Hardy doesn't get to flex the acting muscles too much as we only get to see him do angry or angrier. He is angry about his past and angry about his present. He does however play the pit-bull pugilist to a tee with his fight scenes in the cage being the most brutal. Nolte plays the rather pathetic, recovering alcoholic dad competently but I found a few of his scenes slightly forced as this character was too sketchily drawn for the viewer to become emotionally involved. Brendan' wife, Jennifer Morrison, is no Adrian Balboa as her character is given little scope to express anything more than mild worry about her husband's decision to return to fighting as a career.I enjoyed this film immensely but I personally don't think that it's the Oscar material as some are touting. Warrior is hugely watchable but for me, this is not in the same league as the Fighter or Rocky. Both of those films provide us much more in terms of character development, back story and in the Fighter's case far superior dialogue. It is, however, a fantastic Friday night fight film that will entertain and excite in great measure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warrior is for MMA fans what Rocky was to Boxing fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨Break out the yellow tape, Sam. Tommy's walking away from the cage like he's leaving a crime scene.¨ Warrior is one of my favorite films of the year along with Drive and the final Harry Potter movie. This film really caught me by surprise. I'm generally not a huge fan of sports movies; don't get me wrong, I like them, but they usually are very predictable and never end up among my favorites. However, Warrior is really a terrific movie that had me routing for both fighters at the end. What really stands out however in this movie aren't the actual fighting scenes, but the entire family drama that goes on. Warrior makes The Fighter look like a silly movie and I really enjoyed that one, but the performances in this film (apart from Bale's excellent performance) and the script are much better. The family in Warrior is a totally broken one, and although there are some clichés and corny moments, I really had a great time with this emotionally strong sports drama written and directed by Gavin O'Connor who also directed the 2004 sports film: Miracle. The fighting scenes are really well choreographed and the actors all look like real fighters. Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy are great as the lead characters and they really buffed out for this movie. The true surprise of Warrior however was Nick Nolte's powerful performance as the broken father who is looking for redemption and forgiveness from his estranged sons. There are really some powerful and emotional dramatic scenes, but there are also plenty of strong fighting scenes so you will be satisfied whatever it is you are looking for. This movie deserves some Oscar buzz, it is just that good, and it really hasn't received as much recognition as it should.Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte) is a recovering alcoholic and former boxer who is living on his own after having pushed away his sons and wife when they were teens due to his alcohol abuse. Fourteen years later his youngest son, Tommy (Tom Hardy), who just returns as a Marine from Iraq, shows up at his doorsteps, and despite realizing his father is a changed man he still doesn't want to have a relationship with him. He is still hurt and broken for everything that went on in his past. Paddy wasn't a good father, but Tommy recognizes he was a great coach and wants him to train him for a Mixed Martial Art tournament called Sparta where the best fighters from the world will come to compete for the grand prize of 5 million dollars. Paddy coached Tommy during High School where he broke all the wrestling records and was never defeated. As the movie progresses more details about his past are revealed, and we also get to know why he needs the prize money. Tommy's older brother, Brendan (Joel Edgerton) is also estranged from his family. Brendan never ran off with Tommy and his mother because he was in love with a girl who later became his wife and mother of his two beautiful daughters: Tess (Jennifer Morrison). Tommy never forgave Brendan for this and hasn't communicated with him since. Brendan is a former UFC fighter and now works as a Physics teacher. Tess made him give up fighting after he was hospitalized and nearly died. They seem to be happy with their kids, but they are having financial problems and will lose the house in three months due to some heavy debts from his youngest daughter being hospitalized for heart issues. She is very well now, but Brendan can't pay off his debts so he decides to enter the tournament as well and begins training with his former trainer Frank (Frank Grillo).One of the things I enjoyed the most about this family drama is that it played out perfectly. O'Connor doesn't talk down to the audience, we begin putting the pieces together about the family's past through natural conversation that go on between them. We realize there is more to Tommy than we actually expect at first. Behind his tough guy persona there is some good in him. Brendan is also an excellent father and a nice guy. As the movie progresses we identify with both characters and can't help but route for both of them. The trailer lets us know that both brothers will reach the final and compete with each other so it is no spoiler that I'm telling you this. You will have a hard time choosing who you want to win the fight. The family drama plays out perfectly and there are some great scenes between Hardy, Eldridge, and Nolte. Jennifer Morrison also does a great job playing the worried and carrying wife. The performances in this film are really top notch, and the action doesn't let you down either. Fans of MMA and UFC won't be disappointed with the fighting scenes. This is a great film with a great story and great performances. As we begin to uncover one layer after another of this family's past we begin to route for them and identify with their pain. Nolte's eyes really show us how repented he is for his past sins and how much he wants to reconcile with his two sons. His performance is Oscar worthy as a supporting character. By all means go see Warrior, you won't regret it. This is Rocky meets Bloodsport meet Brothers.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raw and gripping, Gavin O'Connor's mixed martial arts film is exhilarating action and poignant family drama combined into one potent knockout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take the family dysfunction in last year's Academy-Award winning 'The Fighter', combine it with the underdog heroics of 'Rocky', and you get Gavin O' Connor's 'Warrior'- a deeply engaging and edge-of-your-seat exhilarating sports movie set in the world of mixed martial arts (MMA) and of course the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).In fact, the UFC is referenced a couple of times throughout the movie- it is where the older of a pair of estranged brothers Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) fought before settling down with wife Tess (Jennifer Morrison). Now a father of two young daughters, Brendan teaches physics at a neighbourhood high school, but an imminent foreclosure at the bank leaves him no choice but to moonlight at strip-club parking lots for a few hundred dollars a win. Word gets out, and Brendan gets suspended from teaching duties, presumably because no one wants a teacher who picks fights. Brendan's younger brother is the Iraqi Marine Tommy (Tom Hardy), who returns to his home town of Pittsburgh and stuns a group of experienced MMA fighters by knocking one of them stone cold in the ring after a practice bout. The match is You-tubed, soon becoming an Internet sensation, and Tommy is presented with a lucrative opportunity- the chance to compete in Sparta, the 'Super Bowl' of MMA held in Atlantic City and with a prize money of five million. To get ready however, Tommy makes the difficult decision of reconnecting with his father and ex- wrestling coach, Paddy (Nick Nolte). Meanwhile, Brendan approaches his former mentor Frank Campana (Frank Grillo) to train for the same event- the threat of financial ruin just makes the prize money even more irresistible. You'll know where this is leading- Tommy and Brendan will eventually go mano-a-mano at the final, bringing to a head their deep-seated resentment towards each other and their father. Both brothers had apparently left the alcoholic and abusive Paddy when they were young, but Tommy further blames Brendan for leaving him to care for their mother suffering from terminal illness alone so he can go get married to Tess. They say blood is thicker than water, and so it goes when that blood is poisoned, it's only going to be harder to cleanse it. Leaving the bouts for the second half of the movie, O'Connor- who co-wrote the script with Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman- uses the first hour to set up the complex relationships between his characters, revealing their backstories and their current circumstances which lead them onwards to a collision course. And with plenty of sensitivity, he makes the family drama resonate so strongly that even the hardest of hearts will be moved. The investment O'Connor makes in his characters pays off immensely as we head into the ring proper. Together with d.p. Masanobu Takayanagi and no less than four editors (John Gilroy, Sean Albertson, Matt Chesse and Aaron Marshall), O'Connor delivers the JJ "Loco" Perry fight scenes raw, brutal and ferocious, putting us right in the thick of the action and ensuring that not one ounce of the excitement is lost. He also mirrors the disparate personalities of Tommy and Brendan in their individual fighting styles- Tommy, brash and filled with seething rage, finishes his opponents within seconds of the match; while Brendan, more calculated and patient, endures his opponents' beating while waiting for a chance to pin them down. The climactic fight between Tommy and Brendan is quite something else in itself- viscerally thrilling as any of the earlier matches, its true knockout punch however lies in its emotional weight, as the two brothers exorcise their own inner demons they have dragged into the ring with them. It is deeply moving and heartbreakingly poignant, made even more terrific by the standout performances of both Hardy and Edgerton. The amount of physical work Hardy has put into the role is written all over his body, but more than just physicality, Hardy gives an intensely gripping portrait of a man filled with anger, hurt and bitterness. On the other hand, Edgerton is equally affecting as the family man goaded by circumstance to put his life on the line inside the ring. In a supporting role, Nick Nolte gives a tour de force performance as their father, racked by remorse over his past and struggling- yet failing- to get his sons to forgive him and accept him as family once again. A scene that sees him once again inebriated in a hotel room after being berated by Hardy the night before is probably one of the most emotionally powerful sequences you'll see this year. Thanks to the stellar performances all round, 'Warrior' rises above the typical sports movie to emerge as one of the best of its league. It is also the first movie built around the relatively new MMA sport, and O'Connor does an outstanding job capturing its grit, ferocity and intensity. But O'Connor also understands that some of the toughest battles are not fought inside the ring, but outside, coping with life and learning to forgive. Because it makes the fights outside the ring just as fierce as that inside the ring, 'Warrior' isn't just thrilling in its action, but tremendously affecting in its real-life drama. Quite simply, this is one of the best you'll see this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stirring, enthralling and absorbing. In one word: brilliant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best cinema releases of the year ? and so far only the third to get my 5 star rating ? this MMA-centric motion picture has been compared to the likes of Rocky, Bloodsport and almost every other movie featuring some form of competition "fighting". Not only is that a lazy association, it's also inaccurate, as writer-director Gavin O'Connor's sophomore feature effort is foremost a relationship drama, with the brutal MMA (Mixed Martial Arts for those not up to speed) supplying a suitably hard-hitting format for conflicted brothers Tommy and Brendan (played with gravitas by Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton respectively) to work out their differences. The story is emotionally powerful; the combat sport is superbly staged; and the acting is awards-worthy from the major trio of Hardy, Edgerton and Nick Nolte as their repentant ex-alcoholic father. The physically commanding Hardy is already bursting onto the A-list scene with fantastic performances in Inception and Bronson (and an upcoming role in The Dark Knight Rises) but, if there's any justice in Hollywood, Warrior should also see local boy Edgerton hit the big time. Terms like "stirring", "enthralling" and "absorbing" barely do justice to just how moving this film really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tale of two brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In recent years we have seen a great deal of social realism in sports movies like in The Fighter and The Wrestler. Warrior also sets out to do that with Mixed Martial Arts with a little bit of the Rocky thrown in.Warrior tells the story of two brothers, Tommy Riordan (Tom Hardy) and Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton). Tommy is a ex-marine who returns home from Iraq after 14 years to Pittsburgh to his father's, Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte), doorstep. Paddy is a recovering alcoholic who use to beat his wife. Lost and angry Tommy turns to MMA, joining a gym and surprising beats a top middleweight contender. He asks his father to train him. Brendan lives in the suburbs of Philadelphia with his wife Tess (Jennifer Morrison) and his two young daughters. He is a former UFC fighter turned High School physics teacher. The couple are struggling financially and with the bank about to take their house Brendan fights in street fights. In the world of MMA a new tournament has been created, Sparta, a 48 hour tournament where the winner can win $5 Million and both brothers enter it.Warrior was directed by Gavin O'Connor and it was advertised that it was from the director of Miracle, another sports movie, but he also showed that he could do gritty urban set movies with Pride and Glory. He shows a lot of skill with this sports film and shows some style. When shooting in inner city the film uses a grey colour filter and in the suburbs it is lighter and brighter. One of my favourite moments was two training montages at the same time, shot using multiple screens like 24, showing action going on at the same time and showing two different training styles, Tommy taking a more basic, old-skool approach, whilst Brendan has a more modern, scientific method. Despite its long running time Warrior actually flew by. We get to know the know the characters in the build up and developed and the fights scenes show MMA to be a really tough, brutal sport. I liked the fact that rival fighters were not made out to be total dicks but simply as rival athletics and seeing how tough the sport is the writers didn't need to show much well.Warrior also has a great cast, Hardy and Edgerton are both excellent, but it was Nolte was absolutely brilliant and he properly get a best supporting actor Oscar nod. He was so natural and believable as a man trying to be good, atone for his past sins and try to get close to his sons despite them not wanting anything to do with him. He was a tragic character and Nolte's performance and role reminded me a lot of Mickey Rourke's in The Wrestler, a character trying to make amends with his past sins. Hardy is of course a very talented actor as we have seen in Bronson and his character is a very angry, bitter man but because he is a war hero he is the public's choice to win. But there is depth and reason behind it because of his past both as a wrestling protégé and family background and his experience in Iraq. Brendan is the most sympathetic character because he is only doing MMA again because he needs the money for family. He is reluctant but is willing to do anything for his family and he is the typical film hero. There is strong believable chemistry between the three characters and really believe there is a past between them. There is also a strong supporting cast: Frank Grillo played Brendan's trainer and whilst he looked like a gym nut that could easily parodied by Family Guy he is made out to be a decent man who is a little like Mickey from Rocky. Morrison is a decent actress and Kevin Dunn was actually pretty ground and serious in his role.Warrior is not perfect and there a few little problem. The first that Tommy is made out to be a really tough fighter, able to knock other men out with one punch but there is no establishing any fighting experience besides wrestling. The other is that Tommy is a complete unknown before the Youtube and he gets into Sparta without any previous bounds, but surely wouldn't he need to registered and have a ranking. Also there is a longer cut and I believe that it establishes other elements of the film through visuals like Brendan's daughter's heart condition.Overall Warrior is a very well made film and I believed it happened its family drama much better then The Fighter which it is very similar to.</fullReview>

Anyway, I'm a woman, although one admittedly with a soft spot for Nick Nolte, and I really liked this film--much better than the similar 'The Fighter' which most people seemed to think so great. My only quibbles were that I didn't quite buy Joel Edgerton physically as a fighting machine and that the Tommy character would have been able to go AWOL so easily. That being said, I liked the way the movie stayed on point, the way it showed ever character's motivation and most of all, the way it brought in the everyday realities of You Tube, the Iraq War, and underwater mortgages to move its story along in a satisfying manner. One of my favorite scenes was when Edgerton is talking to his 'friendly banker' who can't remember his sick daughter's name. "So many stories", he sighs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since I lived my life in the midst of very real, extreme violence most of my life I'm, generally, not really one to rush to an "Action Movie" featuring large servings of violence. I've experienced enough to last several lifetimes. Generally. Warrior was the only film in my local theater I hadn't seen, so I bought the ticket. The experience turned out better than I expected.The film revolves around the two grown sons of a family headed by an abusive-alcoholic, Marine war-veteran father with frustrated delusions of an athletic youth. So, he tortured his boys to grow up to be tough, honorable men with leanings toward violence against others by training them and pushing them to compete in amateur wrestling. As that story began to unfold I was thinking, do I really want to stay? This is my life story for cryin' out loud. In the end, I opted to watch more as after all, there was that exorbitant ticket expenditure.The focus of the film is the life struggle of the brothers; Brendan Conlon very ably played by Australian Joel Edgerton and British actor Tom Hardy as his Marine Corps brother Tommy Conlon. The unenviable role of the father is masterfully enacted by veteran actor Nick Nolte as Paddy Conlon. The film belongs almost entirely to this trio; the rest of the actors being mere counterpoint; albeit excellent counterpoint. Sadly, Nolte's character is a sad example of the breed. He drank, abused and bullied his way through life and now he clearly wants to finally make a relationship with his two sons; but complications ensue. Neither of his sons want anything to do with him on a personal level. * In their teens, their mother leaves their father, taking her younger son, Hardy, with her. The older boy, Edgerton, stays with his father. Hardy's character remains sullen and brooding as he ages and joins the Marines. He deserts the Marines in the desert and flees back to the states to become an MMA fighter, brilliantly hiding from authorities by going by his mothers maiden name while his face is spread all over worldwide media. Hardy plays the character so Brutish and mean that it's impossible to have any feeling for him but revulsion. The performance is nearly over-the-top and the realism they may have been looking for falls short as a result. In making that choice of characterization I feel the director made the mistake of letting it happen. A little more of a balanced character would be more realistic and play better. Edgerton's character gets an education, marries, has children and becomes a physics teacher. Not surprisingly, both of the sons grow up to hate their father for the decades of abuse they, and their beloved martyr of a mother, suffered under his roof. They also harbor bad feelings and overall resentment towards each other, designed to heighten the film's tension. Nolte is, doubtless, superb in his performance of the lifelong booze sponge trying to finally clean up his act, while at the same time, he feels himself teetering on the rim of hell, contemplatively staring into the abyss he's soon to join. He expects to find forgiveness from his sons and a chance to know his two little granddaughters, whom he doesn't know. Of course his sons reject him, appropriately. But, Hardy wants him as a trainer so he can go beat up more people with greater efficiency (he reportedly gained 30 pounds of muscle for the role) so he enlists his hated but efficient father to help him achieve his goal.The sympathetically Edgerton, finds himself in a financial bind over the catastrophic medical expenses of one of his daughters. I can't help but feel that they're trying really hard to make me like this guy. Predictably, he decides to get himself right, financially, by returning to the underbelly of MMA for quick paydays. That sets up the world of MAA as a reuniting force that finally slams, quite literally, the two brothers back together. Right there should be a winner, because, after all, what guy has not wanted to pound his brother into a bloody pulp at some point, and here is the vicarious opportunity!The separate roads they take before reaching the cage is splattered with a large amount of gratuitous violence. The "fighting" is barely removed from street brawling and the "fighters" were beaten relentlessly. It's also peopled, as it was pointed out to me, with a generous serving of male bodybuilder-type meat for the enjoyment of the distaff attendees. I found it odd that the film makers didn't take advantage of the rating to include at least some gratuitous female nudity. Such an addition would, at least, be non-violent.I have seen bloodier and more violent films, but this one is solidly ensconced in that genre. Brutal might be a better word. Still, given that vehicle, I have to admit that the filmmakers have managed to inject some humanity in the subtext. The boys, although explicitly unforgiving of their father, are also torn over that position by their own humanity. Edgerton has what appears to be a great relationship with his wife, well played by Jennifer Morrison. He is also loved by his kids, his students and at least one colleague, played by Kevin Dunn as Edgerton's boss. He also appears to have a friendship of mutual respect with Frank Grillo as his friend and trainer. The best thing that can be said of the remainder of the cast is that they seamlessly create the authentic feeling atmosphere, which is the be all and end all of MMA; and it is brutal, bloody and at times sickeningly violent.By Bruce L.

		<shortDescription>Rock 'em Sock 'em Brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. It's always a bit thrilling when a movie catches us off-guard and is much more than expected. Walking in, I was all set for a testosterone fueled fight fest featuring BS bravado and mounds of machismo. While that element is abundantly present, writer/director Gavin O'Connor wraps the fighting around a pretty interesting story about family, bravery, desperation, pride and forgiveness.The story begins with the convergence of a broken family - two brothers and their father. The split occurred many years ago, and without the details, we are able to piece together that dad (Nick Nolte) was a violent drunken ex-Marine and the mother planned to take the two boys and run. One of the brothers (Joel Edgerton) had fallen in love and decided to stay with dad. The other brother (Tom Hardy) went with mom and even nursed her through her final days of cancer prior to his joining the Marines. The three men have been incommunicado for years, until one day Tommy (Hardy) shows up on Nolte's doorstep.What sets this one apart is the details of each of the brother's stories, very little of which I will discuss here. There is a terrific scene on the Atlantic City beach where their demons confront each other and we see that so much pain and bitterness exists despite their having been teenagers at the time of the split. They each felt abandoned by the other. Now one is an angry ex-Marine and the other is a desperate physics teacher with a family. This story couldn't possibly end any place other than smack in the middle of an MMA cage fight! Their Dad (Nolte) had trained the boys as youth wrestlers and now a giant $5 million tournament is being held. Both brothers are carrying secrets and need money to solve their problems. Their secrets drive them to risk life and limb in the cage of this most brutal activity. To best describe these characters, Tom Hardy has the presence and physique of the guy you would never consider confronting in a bar fight. Joel Edgerton is the kind that your buddies would egg you on thinking you could probably take him. Instead you would end up in the back of an ambulance.As expected, and shown in the trailer, the MMA tournament ends with the two brothers facing off and guilt-riddled dad watching from the crowd. Despite the rowdiness and violence of the fighting, very little blood is shown. That's not what this movie is about. Instead we get many adrenaline-rushes from the spectacle of the fights, plus a montage of the training leading up to the big moment. This is a crowd-pleaser in the vein of "The Fighter", but not quite as mainstream given the MMA element.The two leads were each on my list of favorite movies last year. Joel Edgerton was in the excellent and under-the-radar "Animal Kingdom", while Tom Brady was in the mega-hit "Inception" and will play Bane in the upcoming Batman film. In this film, Edgerton has more freedom with his character, but Brady does a wonderful job of capturing the quiet intensity followed by roid rage in the ring. Most surprising is the fine job turned in by Nick Nolte. He really showed up for this one. Other support work comes from Jennifer Morrison, Kevin Dunn and Frank Grillo. We also see former Olympic wrester Kurt Angle as the terrifying Russian MMA machine Yoba, and writer/director Gavin O'Connor as JJ Riley, the millionaire sponsoring the tournament.There will be comparisons made to both "Rocky" and "The Fighter" and both make sense. It is not quite at that level, but don't mistake this as some dumb fight movie made for teenage boys. There is a story and it provides further proof that men, no matter how hard they try, manage to screw up the whole family thing more often than not ... but in the end, they do try their best to make things better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky never had it this good....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is nothing new, its the underdog's rise but done in a fresh way from two different perspectives. It is exciting and very well done and has a modern twist on the old training montage. The performances; a tour-de-force. I would say that appropriately describes Tom Hardy's performance here. Wow. He is unbelievable. A dark and troubled character who is wound so tight that once he steps in the ring he becomes an animal, with the haunted look of all your favourite psycho's down the years. He has to be getting Oscar buzz for this. Nolte too is fantastic, a recovered alcoholic and so troubled by his past and his olive branches which he extends to his estranged sons get torched without even being entertained. It is an understated performance but very powerful. Egerton is almost the boy next door, driven to fight to support his family, he blends in alongside Hardy and Nolte but so would anyone else. He handles his emotional and fighting scenes very well, without being clichéd. Again, he is understated.The fight scenes in this film are the most realistic I have seen, they are gripping and have you on the edge of your seat willing for the right result. Some of the camera-work is very creatively done and you can really feel the pain etched on the warring men's faces. The sound in the cinema only adds to the atmosphere, the fierce thumps and crunches of men hitting the floor and each other really immerses you in the action. Overall I rate this film very highly, it hits all the right notes and I look forward to seeing it again on blu-ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than a... 'fighting' movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't often write reviews, but on this occasion I felt I must for the simple reason this movie really moved me. It's more than just a fighting movie. It's a movie of life. A broken home, a war vet, a family struggling to get by. A good.... no... fantastic all-round movie. Basically the story goes two brothers, one, the war vet, the other a teacher, not able to pay the bills and look after his family the way he wants to, compete in a mma contest. (That's mixed-martial-arts for those of you who don't know.) Yes it may be an obvious outcome, the brothers have to fight each other in the end. But the movie has so many more levels to it than that. All of the leading actors, Joel Edgerton, Nick Nolte, and of course Tom Hardy are all really on-form. Good to see Nick Nolte back on top after an unfortunate couple of years, and that may be why his performance is so good because he can relate to this in real life as he plays a troubled alcoholic. But for me Tom Hardy steals the show. This is an actor who is really on fire just now. It doesn't seem to matter what part he plays, whether it be a prisoner in Bronson (again a fantastic performance) or an mma/war vet he plays it like the part what made for him. He plays this part perfectly and I don't think there is a single actor at the moment who could have played the part better. Go see this. You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brenden should have died</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie presented an obvious plot line and gave a new perspective to getting beaten up. Giving the blueprint for how to win UFC, just get beaten relentlessly for 3 rounds and then perform an camora and break one of your opponents limb's on the bell. Tommy had knocked out several fighters in the first round but remarkably his brother seems to be able to gain super- human abilities and defies the laws of UFC. As Brenden didn't punch for 3 rounds and was stuck in a full mount against a first round knockout artist by making a impenetrable guard impervious to the ground and pound. Overall the director should learn some UFC rules and tommy should have knocked out Brenden in the first round. The movie leaves a lot of questions unchecked at the end plus the fact that Brendon had a abandoned MMA for teaching seems to have helped him rather than doing the opposite. There is no logic to the final fight and has a predictable ending as the styles made it obvious that the submission had to win.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am very disappointed in this and the reason is I thought it was gonna be a masterpiece. Honestly for the life of me I can not fathom how people liked this movie. Fault? the STORY! My main criticism is that the film is littered with any possible cliché you can imagine and then some, and for me it ruins the movie. The story is dragging and dragging the main characters compete one against each other for whom of the 3 lives the biggest tragedy when -think of it for a second- if they put aside their differences every one's problem will automatically get sorted out. On the positive side the fighting scenes are among the best as is the cast, and I also enjoyed the soundtrack.Long story short, this isn't a bad movie by any measure it is just so unoriginal. The Fighter, Rocky, Cinderella man, Raging bull. Every single plot twist and every character can be found among them. A nearly wasted Saturday night. Overall 5/10</fullReview>

I cried toward the end, during the end, and even AFTER the film on the way home.If you have a brother or a sister that you love, you must see this film. And you should see it on the big screen. The score, soundtrack, filming, direction, editing.... all were integral pieces of this beautiful puzzle.What MOVING performances by all three men --Nolte, Edgerton, and Hardy. It has a brilliant, subtle, quiet kind of screenplay, to be a film with so much action and drama. You have to keep watching and don't miss a moment, as it's totally unpredictable. And yet, it's absolutely realistic.An incredible, moving story. Not just for men, but for women too. We absolutely loved it. I can't wait to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>predictable mushy mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie to be a predictable mushy mess full of clichés and obvious attempts by the director to tug at the heart strings of the viewer. Every combination was thrown at the viewer - father vs. son, son vs. son, family financial trouble, marital tension, etc. etc. It was numbing after a while. Oh, I almost forgot about a good dose of American flag waiving with the US military (reminded me a little of Transformers 3's disgusting false patriotism). The fight scenes weren't particularly compelling or interesting, as the final outcome could be seen a mile away. The actors gave good performances, but that's just not enough to save the movie from its awful script. Stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie would be much better if it was less pro USA. I liked the Idea. I love MMA but as an non-American this really spoiled it for me.First of all. You can see the movie is sponsored by the US Army. The army kid who is a hero. In the fight with his bro he looks at the army men in the audience and all sudden gains his strengths again. so cliché.Then again the bad guy is off course the Russian Koba. Hello?! Cold war is over. But the funniest and dumbest thing was that Koba enters the ring with a former Soviet Union flag?!?! The writers must have forgot the Berlin wall has been down since '89 and the Soviet Union doesn't exist.Off course wrestling is the base of both fighters. That didn't surprise me.Another thing. Brazilians rule MMA in the world and especially in the UFC. I haven't seen a Brazilian fighting in the whole movie? If you're an American teenager you'll like the movie. Too bad they didn't think off a broader audience.Have you seen Redbelt (2008)? A BJJ movie. Much better.Greetz.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a festival of clichés ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't written any review till now (and probably I won't do it from now on) but this movie intrigued me enough to make me write this. First of all, a definition: cliché: a trite, stereotyped expression; a sentence or phrase, usually expressing a popular or common thought or idea, that has lost originality, ingenuity, and impact by long overuse. Second, my claim: this movie is a festival of clichés. I will argue in support of this claim:1) the broken family cliché: common man! I saw this one over and over again!2) the beautiful family cliché: nice smart husband (he's a teacher), good looking wife, two cute kids3) the evil system cliché: a) banks are bad guys, b) the scene where Tommy and his friend signaled their presence but the American army did nothing to save them - soldiers are good, armies are bad, c) Brendan is suspended till the end of the semester. 4) the good cause cliché: fighters are not just violent and vain ... they need to fight for something bigger than them. Brendan for his family, Tommy for his friend's widow. this is so much as those TV shows where lots of social cases are presented to the public and they sing, dance or whatever ... and they all represent a good cause and everybody cries and so on. 5) the bad guy cliché: this was actually the trigger for my review. After more than 20 years since the ending of the Cold War, the director thought that the bad guy must be a Russian (with no Russian traits whatsoever). This is not all! :)) Koba has a red communist T-short! common man! this is hilarious! and the Russian patriotic song!? :)) (lukilly it wasn't Katiusha) the second bad guy is the gym guy. (he beats a spare partner)6) the spiritual training cliché: this is a variation of the fast-food yoga cliché (many martial arts movies present this cliché) yeah Beethoven is nice but really ... conlons are fighters not dalai lamas!7) the lucky coincidence cliché: Marco Santos broke his leg and Brendan is there to replace him. I saw this move so many times ...8) the slow hard working turtle cliché: your lack of skills is not important! you only need to work hard and have a moral purpose. You will beat anybody! :)) this is related here with the underdog cliché and to the age in sport is like age in wines-the older, the better. I mean if Stalone/Rocky did it and they were like 60 years old ... Brendan could do it too!9) the gangsta education cliché: this has two parts: first, American high-school students are usually pictured (in American movies) like not that smart (but cool) punks. Second, the teacher is also cool but smart enough to teach a gangsta version of physics (Newton in this case). I don't know much about US education system .. but physics implies math and in senior classes you can't teach stuff that easy! anyway this is a cliché because I saw it in lots of American movies.10) the resenting wife cliché: this is about every wife in any boxing/martial arts movie .. first she is frightened then she become a supporter ...11) the danger of death cliché: these movies grossly exaggerate the danger of practicing a sport. I mean OK is not chess, they usually get hurt but really, it is a sport, there are rules and actually driving is statistically more dangerous than practicing MMA.12) the brothers cliché: way too many brothers in boxing/martial arts movies. you can't be a boxer if you are the only child!:)) the final scene is ... (I won't describe it here) sooooo much like Latin American soap operas. I MEAN .. REALLY! so from these 12 points ... yes, I think that the movie is a festival of clichés and that's not a coincidence. (can't prove this but I have a feeling). If you want to sell something ... there are at least two ways: you can sale the future in the present (mainly Apple's strategy) or you can sell emotional clichés. This movie (I think) is on the second class. It sells emotions that ordinary people usually experience. everything is simple and focused on the viewer's emotion not on his/her reason. we are all brothers, sons, we all have wifes, kids, we all have problems with the system ... the only difference is that in movies we can actually win:)) and that's why we buy this movie. We win here. in itself, the movie is not as pathetic as I described it (Nolte actually did a decent job and the Moby Dick stuff might be a nice idea). The pathetic part is the huge amount of stars it received. the only thing that's missing from this picture is an Oscar for Tom Hardy or for his more pathetic brother-character, Brendan/Joel!</fullReview>

Nick Nolte got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his performance as the father, but I don't feel it was deserved. His role was very secondary (as per my "token" comment) and he pretty much just had to mumble and ramble his way through.The thing that makes the movie watchable are the fight scenes.

		<fullReview>Warrior is a pretty engaging film, emotionally. However, with that said, nothing else feels all that striking about it. The film has a tendency to drag on and harp on some of the more uninteresting moments of the story, whilst it also tries to complement it with quick and fast paced fighting scenes which ultimately make the film unbalanced.Warrior was slightly disappointing, with it giving too much heart as to feel it is being to serious. There are parts which drag and become boring, but it's ultimate sin is inability to focus in on what the film is; is it a sports film, is it a family drama or is it a redemption story. In saying that, some of those genres fit in well within Warrior, but all of them together makes it oddly unsatisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very intense, interesting and does the trick for building suspense, but, in my opinion, lacks the interaction between main characters. The conversations Tommy has with his dad are not very passionate and the viewer just can not know what to feel.It's hard to choose which brother to cheer for here, both of them have their good sides, i was slightly more inclined towards cheering for Brendan to win the fight. Would have love to seen more personal interactions, yes, in the beginning everything was kind of laid out for the viewer and we got provided with some background information, but i felt it was not quite enough.Sure, it is a great sports drama, if you like movies about fighting this is definitely a decent watch fighting wise. If it was only for the fighting, it would have been a 10/10 movie without a doubt, it is intense and brings just what is needed for a fighting movie. But when compared to a movie like Rocky, which has excellent fighting scenes and outstanding family life scenes, this just can not quite compete. Nonetheless, not bad and worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warrior (2011): Dir: Gavin O'Connor / Cast: Joel Edgerton, Tom Hardy, Nick Nolte, Jennifer Morrison, Frank Grillo: This film seems inspired by the popularity of Ultimate Fighting Championship with mixed martial arts skill is put to the test. Joel Edgerton plays a physics professor who is barely able to make ends meet. He has a wife and son as well as a past that involved fighting. Returning to the cage for fighting he hopes to reap a victory over his debts as well as gain respect. Tom Hardy plays his vile tempered brother who returns home after serving in the war, and seeks training from his father, a former boxer. Nick Nolte plays their father whose relationship with his sons has been damaged by alcohol. He desperately wants to gain forgiveness and attempt to heal the damage caused. Both brothers are destine to meet in this tournament. Edgerton is the underdog who defeated the predicted Russian winner. Hardy mashes up an opponent he had beaten before upon arriving home. What makes this film work is not whether the brothers meet in the ring, it regards how the fight will determine the future of their family. Nolte is very good as a father who can only stand by and hope that life will show him favor. Frank Grillo plays Edgerton's trainer who will obviously whip him into shape for the climax. The film has two big weaknesses. One is Jennifer Morrison as Edgerton's wife whose role is predictable and cardboard. The other is the corny reactions to town folks rooting, including a school principal who elevates hypocrisy. It serves as a look into the decision to engage in such a career.

		<fullReview>"Warrior" wants to be a great sports movie so badly, so desperately, that it loses touch with what I suspect it was supposed to be about all along. Theoretically speaking, everything you could possibly want from an inspirational-but-grounded sports movie is here: Brooding themes of brotherhood, redemption and guilt; a scrappy underdog beating the odds; the indestructible, Ivan Drago-like combatant who looms for our heroes (they've even made him Russian here, despite the fact that he's played by U.S. Olympic Gold Medalist Kurt Angle); and of course the Big Competition at the end, in which all the plot lines are wrapped up in a single-elimination tournament. A lot of this works; director Gavin O'Connor ("Miracle") knows his sports movie tropes well, and how to hit them to maximize their impact. But by focusing too much on the sports movie conventions and not enough on the movie itself, it doesn't punch us in the gut at the end the way it should. It's a lot of impressively empty theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fighter of 2011</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thanks to Nick Nolte's Oscar nomination, otherwise very likely I will miss this film (I know I am Oscar-fixated). Directed by Gavin O'Connor, the film is on a par with the recent sport kindred THE FIGHTER (2010, 8/10), although MMA is much brutal than boxing and the cast is much more downbeat but pragmatic. The film starts with a parallel storyline, a family being torn apart, two brothers haven't seen each other for years, one is a physics teacher with a merry family, but struggle with his young daughter's illness; the other is AWOL ex-marine, suffering from his best friend's ill- fated death, returning to his ex-alcoholic now-sober-for-a-year father, there are deep lacerations in the memories of both brothers, the film intrepidly opts not to use flashbacks to reveal the wounds, instead, through the conversation between two brothers, father and sons, the hallowing past is oozing out in its own pace and comes across as a superbly touching deployment. Later in the tournament, their final knockout combat is being labeled as Underdog Vs. War Hero (Joel Edgerton has to be pummeled like a punch-bag each round before miraculously tackling down his indomitable opponents while Tom Hardy's over-brawny figure alone could intimidate all his pompously grandiose rivals), the fighting scenes are raw but less fly-on- the-wall than THE FIGHTER if my memory doesn't fail me (the final victor is gratifying enough, but I am curious to imagine what the film would end if the winner is the other brother), but like THE FIGHTER, the sport is only the foil, a visual stunt to meet the (bloodthirsty) eyes, a familial drama is the mainstay of the triangle interplay. Nick Nolte is my current No.2 supporting actor of the year, his Oscar-moment is definitely the devastating monologue of Moby Dick after he recollects the alcohol; Edgerton and Hardy are both sacrificing a lot for their roles especially physically, I wish my top 10 slots had more room for them. Actually the truth is Edgerton's part is quite flimsy (although he has proved his versatility), and Hardy's part feels less-exploited and his tough contour is the fatal barrier for viewers to find the access to connect with. P.S: Before I watched this film, one question popped into my mind is why the title is WARRIOR instead of WARRIORS? For the reason that it's a savage winner-takes-all match between two brothers, which one is the warrior refers to?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly clichéd sports film elevated by performances of power.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Warrior,' has previously been compared to 2010's 'The Fighter,' an easy comparison to make. Both are centered on professional fighting, yet the true bulk of the story comes in it's portrayal of a highly dysfunctional family. However, whereas I found 'The Fighter,' to be quite overrated and fairly dull, 'Warrior,' is not. Primarily because of a holy trinity of incredible performances from its three male leads, Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton and Nick Nolte. Whereas the film is fairly conventional in its plot and direction, the sheer power of these three truly elevates the film to something great.The plot is fairly conventional and there aren't many surprises, which is perhaps the film's greatest weakness. However, the three main players consistently keep the audience engaged with three wholly different performances. Joel Edgerton is Brendan Conlon, a former fighter turned physics teacher who's struggling with his finances following his daughter's expensive treatment for a heart condition. His friendly every-man is perhaps the most likable of the three male family members. Brendan reluctantly returns to the ring in order to support his family, much to his wife's dismay. Edgerton gives a great performance, the struggles of a man trying to keep everything together conveyed perfectly. Tom Hardy, as his younger brother Tommy, is also exceptional. His pained performance is one of Hardy's best, in both emotional depth and physical appearance. Hardy has obviously bulked up for this film, and his dedication pays dividends. This is a great physical performance, and a true definition of an actor giving everything to his role. However, his character can at times be quite unpleasant, and as a result I found myself failing to connect with Tommy as I did Brendan. His pain is evident, yet he seems oblivious to the pain that he inflicts on other characters. However, the best performance of the film, and one deservedly nominated for an Oscar, was Nick Nolte's tortured, formerly alcoholic Paddy Conlan, the boys' father. Nolte is explosive, an actor at the top of his game. One scene in particular is absolutely shattering in its potency and is delivered perfectly. Nolte should have won the Oscar.However, as I've mentioned previously, the plot is fairly obvious, and this is the film's greatest flaw. There aren't many surprises, and it's a shame the story didn't do much to differentiate from others in the sports/fighting genre. The strength of the performances may do much to bring this film to greatness, but the plot hampers its ability to be rendered a classic. The fighting is well choreographed, the score rousing and the direction solid, if a little uninspired. 'Warrior,' is a good film, maybe even a great one, hampered only by the obviousness of its plot. See it for the performances rather than the story however, and you'll be in for a good show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotional drama to remember.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most likely I less prefer emotional drama movies because I do not want to wet my eyes while entertaining myself. Entertainment means enjoyment, an entertainment which will give tears in your eyes is not a entertainment, But in some cases tears in eyes gives you a pleasure that can not be purchased, and a pleasure is also a entertainment.While watching warrior I did not get any drops of tears in my eyes but the family reunion and love had touched my heart. I admire this movie because it has well storyline and well directed although song The National "About Today" in last is superb. I love the song.Warrior is a movie which is referred by my friend to me, and he is referred by his sir. Warrior is a story of two brother who fought final match in mixed martial arts tournament both brother got separated in past and they live without their father. They hate each other because of their family problems and behavior but a brother is a brother, he loves his brother irrespective of behavior that is shown in the movie at last. I think that's why movie got more popular and fantastic.In starting 20 minutes movie is slow and boring but it gain speed at proper time, the cinematography, editing, screenplay, directing all are good, there are no need to complain, overall I like this movie and I enjoyed it twice.So go rent the DVD and watch it, have tears in eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I want to keep it quick and easy just read my summary title. I recall this movie coming out at the cinema and I avoided because it was a 12A which means lots of screaming chatting teens turning up who spoil the show. Finally saw this on blu ray and in a word wow. The story works well and newsflash here, both the stars can really act (Tom Hardy of course is Bane in the new Batman movie). The mma and choreography in general is crisp and sharp and you can't help but cheer as you watch. I really don't get why such a well made movie didn't do better at the box especially when you look at some of the rubbish that does well. Two brothers who went on very different journeys in life with an alcoholic father and nothing in common to unite them. I even love the contrasting styles. You have the former marine who blasts in short and sweet and finishes the job. His brother a school teacher on suspension for prizefighting mma (ironically). He is a thinker but former mma star in his own right and is a lot more technical and calculating for a better word. Anybody watching this who studies martial arts or mma will have a smile whilst they watch this. Karare Kid this isn't.Enjoy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a truly outstanding movie. I watch a lot of movies and from time to time I get get into some, but not a lot. This movie I was literally standing up, I was talking to the screen, I was punching my own hand with the excitement. I have seen some sad movies, but rarely do I feel anything, But this was a different story. The directing was amazing and the plot was something that you will rarely ever see in movies or on TV. My only regret was I didn't see this movie in theaters. Truly the only thing missing from this masterpiece for me was not seeing it on a huge screen with surround sound. I would recommend this movie to any and everyone. To anyone who is questioning whether or not to watch this movie, PLEASE take my advice and do so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blood brothers...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something familiar about Gavin O'Connor's latest film, Warrior. I can't quite put my finger on it. I mean, its a gritty underdog tale about second chances and punching people in a ring for pride, love, cash and redemption. It's also set in and around Philadelphia and features a growling old trainer, sweaty brutes, a training montage and a bunch of rousing scenes that'll send chills down your spine and tears down your cheek. If you're yet to fathom what I'm getting at, Warrior resembles that old 1970's classic Rocky. A truly unforgettable film that very few people still have on their "to see" list yet the unfortunate catalyst to countless amounts of barrel-chested fighting films that were just not worthy of John Avilsen's Oscar winning rock. Bloodsport, Kickboxer, Split Decisions, Fighting, Never Back Down, Best of the Best, the list goes on and on and on. All jokes aside, Warrior should fall into that category with consummate ease. It should be a superficial, clichéd piece of trash. It should be a terrible film. But it isn't. Not by a long shot.The film tells of three men. Each solitary tale contributing to one story about forgiveness and family. Troubled US Marine Tommy Riordan (Tom Hardy) turns up on his father Paddy Conlon's (Nick Nolte) doorstep after 14 years away. Turns out the old man was something of a woman- beating drunk back before he found God and went sober. Tommy gave up a promising career in professional wrestling to run away from dad with mum in his early teens: nursed her, buried her then joined the core. Now he's back and after decking a top- middleweight contender in the local gym, he has a chance to fight in SPARTA: the biggest mixed-martial-arts (MMA) tournament in history with $5million up for grabs. Tommy needs a trainer. A prick his Dad may've been, but he always was a good trainer. A few hundred miles down the road is Tommy's older brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton). A physics teacher, husband and father of two who also has a beef with dad. Brendan's also broke and facing foreclosure if he doesn't come up with some big money in the next 3 months. Before he got into teaching, Brendan was an average MMA competitor who failed to make it big and packed it all in to be with his wife and kids. He still does a bit of midnight brawling on the side though. And after an amateur circuit win in a grubby parking-lot tournament, Brendan wants a shot at SPARTA. No points for guessing who he's going to run into.Predictable Warrior most certainly is. A modern-day Rocky counterpart it very nearly is. Masculine? Yes. Fantastical? Yes. Warrior is almost mythical in stature: a torn-apart family tale that's nothing short of a Greek tragedy. David takes on Goliath, there're nods to Moby Dick, the unbeaten ancient Greek wrestler Theogenes and.....Beethoven?? Oh, and the winner-take- all tournament is called SPARTA. If it wasn't for Ridley Scott and his 1999 classic, Warrior probably would've been called Gladiator.The reasons why Warrior earns its place amidst the heavyweights of combat orientated pictures like Rocky, Raging Bull,The Champ and The Boxer, though, are threefold: 1) Subplot- the three mens' tragic past and present family tale is a bitter affair rife with pain and emotion that emerges more important than the in-ring rucks and bucks, 2) Fight scenes- they're brutal, breakneck and utterly convincing, 3) Acting- its some of the best you're ever likely to see in a mainstream film. Tom Hardy turns in yet another imposing, multi-layered performance as the muscle-bound, tormented Tommy: a ferocious and vengeful runaway who for all his muscles, tats and ass-whoopings emerges a vulnerable man haunted by those who've done him wrong. Australian born Edgerton is also excellent as the determined and likable underdog Brendan. Both Hardy and Edgerton do themselves proud inside two physically demanding, all- American roles. Nick Nolte, though, is a revelation. His grumbling turn as the guilt-ridden, recovering alcoholic trying to make amends is worthy of a thousand Oscars. Director O'Connor claimed the part was literally written for Nolte who gives a career best performance at the age of 71. One scene with Nolte and Hardy, in particular, will have the hardest of blokes reaching for the Kleenex.It's not all about feuding families, though. Warrior is the first film to explore the ever- growing sport of MMA with the level of respect and realism it now deserves. Gone are the days of no-holds-barred cock- fighting in cages. MMA is now a disciplined, sanctioned tactical combat sport with seasoned athletes and weight-classes. Some say it could eclipse boxing someday.Once the final bell has sounded, though, MMA is nothing more than a backdrop to which Warrior is so brilliantly set against. It isn't really about MMA, winning, losing or two men slugging it out for cash and the mantle of world's hardest bastard. Its about pride, honour, redemption, family and love. Rocky-esque? Of course. The final scene in particular will have those same hard nuts reaching for the Kleenex...again. Warrior is worth a watch for the acting alone. Films about boxing and boxers have been done to death and done again. The likes of Rocky and Raging Bull are the films against which all of their kind have to measure themselves against. That's why its refreshing to see films like The Wrestler, Redbelt and now Warrior step into the ring with something just a little bit different albeit familiar. Believe the hype. This one's a winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthwhile melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie industry has collected its fair share of boxing films, but not quite as many MMA, mixed martial arts, films. Especially not one with the kind of star power that is behind Warrior. The film follows two brothers who have been distant all their lives and it tells the story of how an MMA tournament brought them back together. It's got a mixture of hard hitting brutality and a soft spot of emotional prowess. It's a story of family set on the stage of organized fighting, only this stage is octagon shaped.Warrior sports an excellent cast with three very strong leads, Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton, and Nick Nolte who was Oscar nominated for his powerhouse performance as the father of Hardy and Edgerton's characters. It's a character driven film that thrives on the relationships between these three main characters. Edgerton, Hardy, and Nolte play Brendan, Tommy, and Paddy Conlon respectively and their relationships form the plot of this film. The film opens with Tommy returning home to his father, who ends up becoming his trainer, as Tommy wants to get back into fighting. Meanwhile, Brendan is living a quiet life has a high school physics teacher, completely detached from his brother and resentful of his father. However, when his financial situations puts his own house in jeopardy he decides to return to his roots and try to win the prize money from the MMA competition that his brother has also signed up for. What results is a powerful, emotional, and somewhat over-the-top story.Warrior is one of those films that screams melodrama at points, but still manages to tell an engaging enough story to be interesting and well worth the watch. We've seen this story of broken family and detached brotherhood plenty of times before, just not in the context of MMA fighters, and that's what makes Warrior a worthwhile film that is enthralling to the end and packs enough of a punch, both physically and emotionally, to really stick with you. It's not a film I would watch again and it probably isn't something I'll rave about for months and months, but there's really no reason to skip over it because, overall, it is a great drama that doesn't have too much to offer, but what it does deliver is plenty respectable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So two brothers Tommy who has recently returned from war and Brendan a former fighter who has a family to support and are the sons of an alcoholic former boxer start fighting to earn money. Brendan wants the money to save his family's livelihood and Tommy is fighting to earn it just to give it all away to a widow of a fallen comrade. They are both portrayed as protagonists however to me it seemed that in the end Brendan came out looking like the selfish ass in the end. The final fight makes me so angry because there were so many opportunities for Brendan to do what he did during the fight before the fight. Tommy's lack of taking credit for his heroic actions and him taking responsibility for something that wasn't his fault makes him the selfless protagonist the one you root for because he is so selfless, honorable, and heroic. Brendan is the person you cheer for because he is the underdog. In my opinion Brendan only won the fight because he was a cheap and manipulative fighter not a better one. The story of hate and forgiveness was sweet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The new ROCKY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK i'll try and give a short review on this film as i'm knackered. It deserves more.The characters and plot IMO is much deeper than other films in the genre like "the fighter". The plot seems simpler when you try to define it, but demands more questions.This is a modern day Rocky without unnecessary polar training and the "eye of the tiger" and with a better developed family of characters. At one point i did think the baywatch theme was going to break out before a match but alas it didn't happen and i was left disappointed.The main reason i like this film is that you end with a fight and unlike any other, you don't know who you want to win. I guess this is inevitably the point of the film and the directors do well to balance the favoritism of both main characters. However, I do feel I ended up siding with the older brother only because he had more focus on him and became the underdog, even though i had more sympathy for the circumstances of the younger brother. But then i am a younger brother so maybe biased.Possibly the father's character could have been better defined. What exactly did he do to destroy his family other than being a ballsy drunk? Nick Nolte seems too nice and gained a lot of sympathy. The darker side of his character should have come out more, possibly. His short drunken episode which bonded him and son jr was too minimilised. I would have liked to see some carnage there.Quite a long film but worth the time as you wont look away, especially towards the last 45 mins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warrior is an unexpectedly excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching Warrior, I expected it to be a poor imitation of Rocky, but set in the more violent world of MMA (Mixed Martial Arts). However, the reality ended up being very different, because Warrior is an excellent film which is more similar to The Fighter, in which we had also seen the rivalry between two brothers dedicated to the same brutal sport, balancing the action with a deep family drama in which the repair of grudges ends up being as important as the fight on the ring (or octagon, or whatever it is).It's not very common to find a martial arts movie such well written, directed and acted as Warrior is. For better or for worse, this kind of stories is usually relegated to "B" cinema, in which the action takes precedence over elements such as performances and narrative. On the opposite, Warrior counts with a very well written screenplay, perfect direction and wonderful performances from Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy, who both work perfectly as brothers/rivals with turbulent emotions under their laconic surface.The only complaint I have against Warrior is that its screenplay includes a few clichés. Nevertheless, I unexpectedly enjoyed this movie very much, and I recommend it with a lot of enthusiasm. In summary, a very pleasant surprise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! That was the first word that I said after finishing this movie. Director Gavin O'Connor did a great job with these group of actors and allowing the audience to get absorbed in the story. I'm not a MMA fan, but I loved this movie. This movie was more than a MMA movie. It was a movie about hardships, determination, pain, and triumph."Warrior" deals with the story of two brothers who don't really know each other. An alcoholic father, Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte) who doesn't know his sons anymore due to his alcoholism. Two brothers with totally different lives that both need a fighting competition to get their lives back on track. I thought younger brother Tommy (Tom Hardy) performance was really great. I can't wait to see Tom Hardy in the "The Dark Knight Rises." He was believable, real, and a very powerful character. The older brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton) also had an amazing performance. I was pulling for him the entire movie. And Nick Nolte was the perfect person for his role as an recovering alcoholic. And the remaining supporting cast also made for a real authentic experience.This movie was probably the best fighting movie I've seen in a really long time, if not ever. It was great because it was authentic and genuine. It was emotional and heart felt. It had everything a good fighting movie needed. It was a great culmination of directing, acting, film making, and music. I highly recommend it. You will want to get in the cage yourself after watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely devoid of Hollywood cliché</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warrior gets a 10 for one reason: it's the only movie I've seen in the past decade that is completely devoid of Hollywood cliché.When the separate brothers interact with their father for the first time? No forgiveness or feel good pat-you-on-the-back tear moment. When the one brother tells his wife about the big fight, no "Oh honey I'll be watching you earnestly and will cry and cheer when you are victorious" cliché. When the brothers interact for the first time, no 'family and brotherhood is more important than all the gold in the kingdom' B.S. Just tried and true emotion and real people from real backgrounds.This is just four examples that set this movie apart. The real reason you have to watch this movie is to remember what the experience of watching movies is actually about. It's NOT to cry over a clichéd ending or have an "oh duh" moment over something you saw coming a mile away. It's seeing real characters, in a real tortured scenario, living and being the way they've known and been raised in a way that is completely separated from modern cinema. So, no, it's not about beating people up. Please just watch it and thank all the 10 star reviewers later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best movie of the year. It has the elements for both gender. Fight scenes for guys, and emotional/love scenes for gals. The fight scenes are very well conducted. Seem very real. It's extremely hard to find male actors who can fight AND act, I mean real act at the same time. Tom Hardy is brilliant. Joel Edgerton looks a lot like Conan O'Brian. It's a little weird for me to watch comedian 'Conan OBrian' do fight scenes. Tom Hardy is so sexy in this movie. I love strong men with something vulnerable and childish inside. The love between brothers and father/son is strong yet subtle. Men don't express their love for each other easily and often. I'm touched to the bottom of my heart when I see them communicate their love through fights and arguments. They can seem strong from the outside, harsh to each other. But the love is stronger. I think Tom Hardy deserves an Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiring emotional MMA film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's rare for me to get so emotionally involved with characters in a movie, but this is a film that did it for me. If you don't already know, the film is about two brothers who end up fighting each other for $5,000,000. There are so many things that this film got right, that I have no idea how it didn't get nominated for best picture. The story was great, the dialogue was excellent, and the characters felt very real. The back stories behind the two fighters makes it so you want to root for both of them and when the end comes you don't know who to root for. I have never watched a fighting film where I had no idea who I wanted to root for until watching Warrior. Nick Nolte played an excellent role as the once alcoholic father, and Tom Hardy was excellent as Tommy. When I first saw Tom Hardy in Inception, I thought of him playing roles that are meant to be sarcastic, however this movie changed that opinion. His character was isolated, angry, and cold hearted and Hardy captured it perfectly. I would put his character in the same category as Christian Bale in The Fighter. This movie had everything that I was looking for and more. It had awesome fighting scenes, emotions, and great character development and dialogue. I would highly recommend this movie even to people who don't like MMA. It's hard to watch this movie and not become emotionally involved with them and for me, that's what makes a great film. In my opinion this is a better movie than The Fighter, and one of the best films I have seen in a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am speechless! I have not seen a film so moving since Secretariat. (What a disgrace to the academy that neither of these films was even nominated for best picture two years running, even though they now have 10 nominees to get it right!) Tom Hardy and Nick Nolte shine brilliantly. Hardy is so intense and filled with seething rage and hatred, while at the same time we can detect a yearning to love and be loved if someone dares to break through all the walls he has erected around his life. What a multi-layered performance! Nick Nolte will rip every father and son's heart clean out (and most everyone else's too) with his wonderful performance as Paddy. But the real star here is the story itself. Flawless camera work, film editing, script writing, and casting have all come together to tell this magnificent story of family, heartbreak, desperation, forgiveness, hope, and triumph of the genuine human spirit.</fullReview>

I also liked how the back-story is created rather slowly and the pieces of the puzzle come together comfortably and are not pushed to the viewer just to get it over with.

That is what is wrong with Hollywood these days. Even my Tasmanian friend Luke agreed, though this was the first colour film he had seen.10/10 for me, highly recommended boys!! Big Eli</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a beat them up...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this film was gonna be a regular beat'em up, live happily ever after type of film. But I couldn't have been more wrong.You get to know Brendan and Tommy, their life, their woes, their problems, and you end up wanting them both to win, and you can't help it. This makes the film different from others of the genre, like Million dollar baby - don't get me wrong, I think it is a great film, but you only have one main heroine, that you end up backing - here you empathize with both the Conlon brothers, and I sincerely could not choose between the war vet (Tommy) and the soon-to-be-bankrupt-man-of-the-family (Brendan) What I did not like was the lack of an aftermath after the final fight, what happens to Tommy - did he get court-martialled, thrown in prison? to Brendan - did he share his money with his brother/reunite with his bro after some time? Did the brothers make peace with their dad?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warrior - A Perfect Pugilistic Melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Numbness" because of the sheer emotional tension of the moment is what I felt during the Silent Catharsis of the three lead characters in the culminating scene. Warrior is a two-track drama of fighting and redemption which, in the initial first hour, methodically reveals the back stories and defines the lead characters of the movie with some pummeling thrown in between. The second half showcases the first rate fighting sequences and arousing emotional moments between the lead characters, making it a "perfect sports movie" in the process.The movie is about two estranged brothers Brendon &amp; Tommy Conlon (Joel Edgerton &amp; Tom Hardy respectively). Brendon is a beloved high school physics teacher married to his childhood sweetheart Tess (Jennifer Morrison). Tommy is an Iraq war veteran who ran away from home with their mother in his early teens because of their abusive &amp; alcoholic father Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte). Both have a troubled past with their father &amp; neither of them is on well-disposed terms with each other. The movie sets into motion when Tommy returns to his hometown to meet his father after several years. Both brothers were fierce MMA fighters in their teenage, while Tommy learnt MMA boxing under the tutelage of their father, Brendon had his best friend to thank to, who uses Beethoven's Ninth symphony to motivate his fighters. Both the brothers, who now have some financial problems in their lives, decide to take part in a Winner-take-all MMA world championship in Atlanta to put an end to them without the knowledge of each other's participation. What follows next, is the engine of inevitability which leaves both the characters of the movie &amp; audience drained of all the energy.Gavin O'Connor's ("Miracle" fame) brilliant acumen in the sports genre is visible all over the movie. He along with his co-writers did a terrific job in generating virtually equal sympathy for each brother &amp; coming up with an emotionally &amp; dramatically satisfying climax. Credit must also be given to him for eliciting such powerful performances from his three lead characters. Nick Nolte's heartfelt &amp; audacious portrayal of anguished Paddy is worthy of an Oscar nod of best supporting actor. Fighting scenes are vividly choreographed, complimented by some skillful camera work which makes you twitch during the fights. Commentary during the fight sequences is hilariously inciting, I can watch even the most mundane of sports with that kind of commentary.This is a rare fight movie in which you don't want to see either of them lose, with a climax which can move even some strong men to tears.My Rating: 10/10.http://flickyfriday.wordpress.com/2012/02/09/warrior-2011/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually write very long winded, very analytic psychosomatic reviews of films. However, words just don't do this one justice.Hardy is quite quickly becoming one of the best actors on the planet and if you thought he was good in "Bronson", you ain't seen nothing yet. Nick Nolte delivers an Oscar winning performance that would put most of the Hollywood "Elite" to shame and Edgerton is so brilliant that I forgot I was actually watching a piece of fiction.Don't download it or watch a poor copy, don't rent it, hell don't even buy the official Blue-Ray. Watch this on the big screen. It will be the best thing you ever do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warrior: A Story of Struggle, Love, Hate, and a Family Worth Fighting For</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why did I go see this movie? Well first of all, when I read that this film was like Rocky, (I'm a die hard Rocky fan), I thought "Eh, what the heck, I'll go see it". That wasn't the only motivation though. What was the other? Tom Hardy. I first saw Tom Hardy in Inception, even though his role was a small one, I could tell that he had a talent for acting.So a movie like Rocky, with Tom Hardy? Could it get any better? Yes, it could. Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you Warrior.This film has a consistent mix of action, drama, and feeling, all wrapped up into a beautiful package.With amazing performances from Nick Nolte, Joel Edgerton, and Tom Hardy, I would recommend this film to any fight fan, or a drama lover.My only complaint: I was disappointed that Tom Hardy didn't have a role in the story as Joel Edgerton did. Yes, the film was a story about the both of them, but I felt like they introduced Hardy, and then pushed him off to the side. But, that's just how I felt about it.So, in conclusion, I would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a good fight/drama. If you loved Rocky, you won't be disappointed in this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best movie I've seen in the past 10 years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say I've made an account here just to say a few words about this movie. It was one of the best dramatic movie I've encountered, one of the best fighting movie I've seen and put together it was one of the best dramatic/fighting movie ever. The action mainly goes on two lines, representing the lives of two brothers but as the story unfolds, secondary lines add to the plot giving even more depth to the main characters. Although there were some things that are hard to believe they could happen in real life, there was absolutely nothing awkward or misplaced, and the story went in such a plausible way. The fighting scenes had nothing cheesy or idiotic blending so beautifully in something that in the end is a dramatic story. Another unique aspect is that the way those two brothers live their lives reflects heavily in the way they fight, and this is just incredible, giving so much uniqueness at the same time to both protagonists, as they are so different while you can't actually blame or take side to either of them. Your only option is to like them both.The ending is worthy of a fighting and at the same time of a dramatic movie. It's like that's what the brothers needed to get together as a family having their father somewhere between taking most of the blame.It's amazing how the dramatic binds together with fighting that being something that mostly could be considered an opposite genre of movies. I'm a grown man and I know there were scenes that almost moved me to tears, and this never happened before although I've seen a lot of movies . Someone should write a book inspired by this movie, 'cause it had more depth than most movies I've seen inspired from books or novels. I can say for sure this movie came the closest to reading a book than any other movies I've seen, 'cause it had such a consistent story and those 2 hours felt like a day.The act in my opinion was impeccable. I only regret this movie wasn't promoted as much as it deserved.</fullReview>

But I was glad to be wrong, and more glad that I looked passed the title and viewed the film on my own willingness and accord. And this was one of those you shouldn't judge by it's cover, in this case it's the title, not the cover. It was a wonderful film. I was happy to be surprised with an unexpected plot. At first it all seemed very confusing but in the end it all came together. I may be apprehensive with the movie at first, but with tears running on my cheeks at the climax of the story, I can't describe it. Let's put it this way, if I had three thumbs it will all be up.

		<fullReview>Gavin O'Connor and Anthony Tambakis have written a superlative screenplay for "Warrior", a film most deserving of all of its great praise. Nick Nolte gives an expected great performance as Paddy Conlon, the father with a sordid past and compelling abandonment issues. Joel Edgerton and the British performer, Tom Hardy, are perfectly cast as the brothers (warriors) and Note's sons. The casting is perfection itself. The fight scenes are brutal yet so compelling that one finds oneself sitting at the edge of one's seat with the excitement of a real match.It is difficult for me to cherish this film any more than I have already expressed, and I would put it at the top of my next "Must See" list if any of the movie buffs have not yet watched it. It is now available in Blu Ray Discs and well worth the rent or purchase. It is a film that you will remember long after your viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotionally intense fight film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warrior is one of the new wave of sports dramas that seem to have become popular in recent years. As much a family drama as an action film. It tells the story of two brothers who enter into a no-holds barred national fight competition. One is driven by his past in the marines, while the other to support his family in a financial crisis; both share a very troubled relationship with their father, a former drunk and wife-beater. Both are destined to fight one and other.The primary drive of Warrior is in the acting departments. The three leads are all excellent in their respective roles. Tom hardy and Joel Edgerton are the warring brothers, with Nick Nolte as their father. The latter has unsurprisingly been nominated as best supporting actor for this role. Nolte gives a very raw and vulnerable performance; one where he conveys his character's regrets and weaknesses perfectly. While Hardy and Edgerton are never less than compelling as the estranged brothers.The story itself isn't especially original to be honest but the set up does allow for it to pan out in a slightly different way. Because the focus is divided equally between both brothers, and because they each have their good and bad points, the audience are at liberty to choose who to root for. Unlike in the vast majority of fight films there is no clear hero and villain, for this reason the film is not set on a preordained path.Warrior is a fight film whose emotional punches are every bit as potent as its physical ones. Its unique dynamic of two sympathetic men fighting for a good cause lends it something different. While the intensity of its acting performances ensures that we always believe in the drama that unfolds. A great sports film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was breathtaking. It had everything a movie needed; great acting, fantastic story, intense fight scenes and emotions that are indescribable.The acting is phenomenal. You can feel the character's feeling towards one another and how much tension there is. The fighting scenes aren't the wimpy made up ones where its very obvious the actors did not hit each other and they grunt as they do their fake hits. This movie looks like a legit MMA fight.The story is very believable. From the beginning, you have so many questions about the relationships between the characters and the answers are depressing and very emotional.5 star movie for everyone that shows some bad ass fighting scenes, but will also touch you and make you tear up at least 6 times throughout the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was blown away by the quality of this movie with overall great performances by everyone involved. They kept the real MMA fighters to limited roles with no dialogue where they didn't have to do much more then bring legitimacy of having real MMA fighters involved with the movie without bringing the movie down in the process of having to sit through their attempts at acting.The movie centers on 2 brothers who haven't seen each other in a long time. Tommy the former prodigy wrestler who went into the Marine Corps but has something to hide. Brendan the older brother who's a former UFC fighter and now currently a high school physics teacher. Both are fighting for the prize money but not for themselves. Tommy to help out his fellow Marine buddies family and Brendan to pay off his mortgage so he doesn't lose his house.The best part of this movie in comparison to other MMA movies it's about these brothers redemption and not about your cookie cutter MMA movie which just pits an evil promoter against your good guy which is lets be honest quite played out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has it all!! It was brilliantly directed and has all the components of a great movie. There is a beginning, a middle and and end. The story line is great!! There are these two main characters who are brothers. One of the brothers is Marine and really mad at the world. The big brother is a school teacher who is about to lose his home. They can both fight. Tommy is the younger brother and hits people so hard that he knocks them out with one punch! The older brother - Teacher, is good to but he is not that mean an angry. They both have Nick Nolte as a father - can you say Oscar? Nick was awesome as the father that for some reason they both hate. That is never really explained. I think it's because their Mom died of cancer and Nick was too busy drinking booze to care. Anyway, there is this one great scene where Nick can't take it anymore so he drinks booze and listens to Moby Dick with his walkman. He is crying and screaming the words to Moby Dick (the novel, not Led Zeppelin song). So, the fights are great. Teacher is at one point fired from his school for being a fighter by the principle - Mr. Z. One thing leads to another and in a match called Sparta - the two brother do so well that they eventually have to FIGHT Each other!!!! This final fight was better than Bloodsport, Enter the Dragon and Karate Kid all combined!! The two brothers also hate each other for some reason. Actually Teacher doesn't hate Tommy as much as Tommy hates Teacher. I can't figure that out either. All you need to do is watch this movie and be entertained with the great fighting scenes! I give Warrior TWO UFC's UP!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a great fan of sports, but I've seen a movie with sports genre, that's because I prefer sports as it is - real, full of passion and emoticons. In my opinion sports and movies just don't go together. Both should be kept apart.Anyway after a lot of recommendation by friends, I decided to give this a go, and boy oh boy how wrong was I! This was easily the best movie that came out last year. After watching this I've decided to give "The Fighter" a go too. And any more recommendations for sports' movies are welcome too.Anyway here goes the actual review... Hmmm, so where to start... This movie breaks out as completely unique and very moving. The story really takes you on a emotional roller-coaster. It immerses yourself into the movie and you can almost feel all the tension that runs between the characters. The MMA sequences definitely are on-the-edge-of-your-seat stuff and gives you goosebumps. Tom Hardy, Nick Nolte and Joel Edgerton, I would love to see these guys get rewarded for their brilliant acting performances. The performances are uniformly excellent, and the writing and direction by Gavin O'Connor is concise and real. If you haven't watched it go and watch it, you will definitely enjoy the ride.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warrior (2011) - Fight for Family! Fight for Country!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Warrior" is another of those classic boxing movies with powerful characters and strong fight scenes. This mixed-martial arts drama is a combination between "Rocky" and "The Fighter". This is half underdog story, half boxing movie, and half brotherhood tale. "Warrior" is set with an ex-Marine named Tommy, portrayed by Tom Hardy (starring in the upcoming "Dark Knight Rises"), who teams up with his recovering alcoholic father, portrayed by Nick Nolte, to help him train for the biggest event in the history of the MMA. On the other half of the story, we meet Tommy's brother Brendan, portrayed by Joel Edgerton. He's a married man, a public high school teacher, and a former MMA fighter. But when he loses his money, and is about to lose his house, Brendan also enters the MMA competition to save his family. Then, when these two brothers team up for the same tournament, they have to finally confront each other, and the forces that tore them apart, in the biggest battle of their lives. All I have to say is this: "this is awesome!". This is a spectacular, amazing, exhilarating, powerful, and unforgettable movie, and this is one of the best movies of 2011. I was completely blown away by this movie. I was kept on the edge of my seat, wanting for more. Director Gavin O' Connor knows how to make an underdog boxing story. This movie has a bunch of well-written material, fine directing, and tons of powerful fight scenes. But it's the casting ensemble that really carries the movie. Tom Hardy does an amazing job playing such a powerful character, and I can't wait to see this guy in the final Batman movie. Joel Edgerton delivers the finest and underrated performance in this movie, and I really like this guy. But, it's Nick Nolte that deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his work as Tommy and Brendan's ex-alcoholic and emotionally damaged father. I really thought that Nick Nolte steals the entire movie, because he makes the movie good, with all of his heartbreaking and dramatic moments, and he still has lot of charm in his heart. The cast is truly the best thing in the whole movie. The fight scenes are top-notch, the cast is well-acted, and the finale leaves you with jaw-dropping surprises, and edge-of-your-seat thrills. "Warrior" is one of the most entertaining boxing movies ever made, and it's truly one of the best of 2011. "Warrior", in my review, "a dramatically powerful brotherhood story".</fullReview>

I originally put the movie in to fall asleep to, but as you might have guessed my interest level was so high there was no way I was going to sleep. After the movie I did sleep but I was probably throwing kicks and punches all night in my sleep. This movie has the right mixture of emotions. Nick Nolte plays a part well suited for him with high's and low's all through the movie. I do like fight movies but never gave one a 10 until this one came along. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brendan and Tommy Conlon are two estranged brothers of an alcoholic father, both whom have cut ties with. The younger brother, Tommy (Tom Hardy) who is AWOL from the Marine Corps, returns home to his father. Tommy, deeply resentful of his father (Nick Nolte) and brother, begrudgingly seeks his father's help to train for an upcoming MMA Tournament. He makes it clear to his father that he wants nothing to do with him, other than to train him just like he did when he was an up-and coming high school wrestling champion. Tommy has a lot of skeletons buried deep in his closet, all of which slowly start to come out as the film progresses.Brendan (Joel Edgerton) is an ex-MMA fighter who is now a family man with a wife, two kids, and surmounting bills to pay. Brendan works as a physics teacher and fights in underground MMA clubs to make ends meet. Brendan finds out about an upcoming MMA Tournament with a five million dollar purse attached to it and decides compete. At his age, everyone thinks it's a bad idea, especially his wife (Jennifer Morrison.) What the two brothers don't realize is that fate will lead them to deal with their past in the ring. The tournament will also force them to come to terms with the relationship with their father.In recent history, other than "Rocky" (1976) and "The Fighter" (2010), there hasn't been too many good films about boxing with a solid, emotional storyline behind them. "Warrior" is the exception. Action-packed fight scenes and an emotional story line make this an Oscar worthy film. Powerhouse performances by both Hardy and Edgerton make the audience engage in and truly feel what the actors are trying to portray in their roles.At age 71, a gritty faced, gravely voiced, tough as nails Nolte has delivered the best work of his career. This film would not have been what it was with anyone else playing the role of Paddy Conlon. I would be surprised if a Supporting Role Oscar nod didn't come his way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>more than just a movie for guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anytime a movie comes out that involves some form of boxing there's always a comparison to Rocky, and Warrior is no different. The only things the two films have in common are that they were very well cast and each movie is exceptionally well done; the similarities end there.Gavin O'Connor, most known for directing Miracle, the very under rated film about the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team, co-wrote, directed and makes an appearance in Warrior. A dramatic film about family and Mixed-Martial Arts (MMA), Warrior is more than just a run of the mill fight film. The movie is incredibly well constructed and nicely paced. At a run-time of 140 minutes, the movie never feels like it's running too long. The fight scenes are intense and brutally realistic, and the family dysfunction is all too real. Tom Hardy as the psychologically scarred Tommy Conlon, gives a very emotionally charged performance. Hardy's career has really started to break out, having recently been seen in Inception and playing the main villain, Bane, in the upcoming Dark Knight Rises. Joel Edgerton, who made his break as Uncle Owen in Star Wars: Episode II ? Attack of the Clones, plays the financially strapped Brendan Conlon. Edgerton is convincing as a husband and father trying to do what's necessary for the betterment of his family. Jennifer Morrison, as Brendan's wife Tess Conlon, is very good and believable as a woman torn between her love for her husband and her fear of losing her family. Oscar nominated Nick Nolte, plays Paddy Conlon, father to the Conlon brothers and an alcoholic former boxer. It goes without saying that this is the best we've seen from Nolte, since Affliction.As much as I enjoyed the film, I thought that it was a little over hyped. There were a few things that I felt were a little to convenient, like a Physics teacher being included in a battle of the top 16 fighters in the world. I understand that it was for the betterment of the story, but it just didn't sit right with me. I also felt Jennifer Morrison's character was underutilized and could have been a bit more developed. Warrior is a movie that guys will like for the fights; the idea of a Sparta style tournament in MMA is good one, and one that many fans would enjoy. Woman will like Warrior for entirely different reasons; such as the story itself that builds up to the finale. Although Warrior was marketed as a "guy" movie, it's definitely one that both men and women can enjoy.Grade: A visit our site at www.twodudereview.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent , I totally recommend!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is outstanding!!! To me Oscar worthy!!! My god, I wasn't expecting such a great movie. this one is awesome, fool of passion, courage, revenge, anger. Good script and really well directed and written by Gavin O'Connor! And it's not all about fighting, believe me. In the end...the fight was won by LOVE and Family, not by a man!And we can't just forget the good performances by Joel Edgerton, Tom Hardy, Frank Grillo and of course Nick Nolte. To me Tom Hardy did a tremendous job, as a kid that had been through a lot a bad things in his life. But in the end we gets, not what he wanted but what he needed. Nick Nolte as usually was outstanding, to me Oscar worthy. Frank Grillo prove himself in this movie, I used to love him in "The gates", but in this movie he shows a lot a personality and that he is one of the best actors of our time, because I think sometimes he's a lot underestimated!To me this movie deserved at least an Oscar nomination it's way better than most of the movies of 2011!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie is very entertaining and tells a great story. The fight scenes are very well done and both actors clearly look like MMA fighters.I think Nick Nolte really was the star of this film. His portrayal of the father who is trying to reconnect with his sons is spot on. Nick's old grizzly look and emotional outbursts bring great emotion to the film. In addition, Tom Hardy really showed great acting skills with his acting and his character is someone that grows on you.The movie never drags on and the pacing of the movie is perfect. The only complaint I have about the movie is the ending. It was cut short and I feel there was still a story to tell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, my 5 star film of 2011!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, I have always maintained that "Rocky" 1&amp;2 are Sylvester Stallone's best movies; not because these movies paved the future for Stallone, but due to its huge underdog factor. Everyone loves a good underdog story and this is also why "Rocky" has always ranked within the top 10 on my list of favorite movies. Having said that, I now see a serious contender to one of my favorite movies of all time. Just twenty minutes into this movie and I started to get the feeling that this is no ordinary fight movie. In fact, it is unlike any other fight movie I have seen; but more on that later. We are first introduced to Tommy (Tom Hardy) as he visits his father, Paddy (Nick Nolte), after a 14 year hiatus. This opening scene is critical to the film as it sets the tone, pace and foundation for solid characterization. A former alcoholic, Paddy seeks forgiveness for his abusive past, but Tommy has no interest in reconciling with his estranged father. Tommy believes he has a shot at winning the title in a Mixed Martial Arts tournament and wants nothing else but to be trained by his father. Elsewhere, Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton), a family man and high school teacher faces eviction if he continues to default on his home mortgage. A former UFC fighter, Brendon resorts to street fighting for money, but is shortly suspended by school authorities due to his afterhour's reputation. Left with no other choice, and with the help of an old friend (Frank Grillo), Brendan starts training again and quickly gains public favor as a local underdog vying for the title. Meanwhile, Tommy rises as an undisputed fighter but is not after the glory of winning. His motive for winning becomes apparent during the course of the movie and it stands out as a truly noble gesture. Do you see what is happening here? Written, produced and directed by Gavin O'Connor, the plot becomes an emotional roller-coaster ride when both fighters embark on a collision course. To avoid spoilers, I am omitting a vital plot development in this review. Although many other critics have not found this to be a plot twist, I feel it is a surprise that adds a powerful oomph to the film's emotional tug. Even so, the first half hour is all you need to see this segment emerging. Unlike other fight movies, there is no antagonist here ? two fighters, each respectable, with individually justifiable motives to win the mega bucks tournament. This is where O'Connor's story plays with your mind? making it very hard to choose sides; and then some. Production values in this movie are one of the leading best I have seen for a year that had barely a handful of top notch movies. This includes a phenomenal screenplay co-written by O'Connor, eating up over an hour of runtime in building impeccable character detail in Tom, Brendan and Paddy. More than anything else, this movie is a heart-wrenching cry for redemption and O'Connor more than drives that message home. There are plenty of caged, yet brutal fight scenes, but these are strategically placed in the second half. Fight choreography and cinematography are astounding without any apparent visual effects while always giving the viewer a ring-seat perspective. Sound editing is another area of technical excellence, especially when you hear the very realistic yet sickening sound of a fist pounding wet flesh. Casting and acting are easily one of the best of 2011. After this, Hardy and Edgerton are going places; for sure. However, not since "Prince of Tides" (1991) or "Affliction" (1997), have I seen Nolte in a role that begs for an Oscar nomination. Thorough, authentic and soulful are the words that come to mind. I normally reserve a 5 star rating for a maximum of two movies a year. Even that is being generous when considering that all major award systems can crown only one movie as the best film of the year. Yes, "Warrior" is not perfect with its perceivable flaws; but it does a great job in avoiding typical Hollywood traps and clichés too. At some point it can even be compared to "The Wrestler", "The Million Dollar Baby" and "The Fighter"? all Oscar nominated movies with a central theme of redemption. It also screams "Spartacus" (1960) towards the end. However, "Warrior" is in a class of its own due to the standard it has created while raising the bar in this genre, and ends up as a full-bodied multi-genre movie. Right from the start, the movie trades one-two punches with the viewer. Be prepared though, for that heart-tugging, teary eyed haymaker in the end. This is exactly what makes this movie palpable to the hardest of critics or even viewers who loathe blood sport. Aside from recommending this movie as a must-see, I can vouch that this is easily one of my top 5 movies of 2011.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie For Anybody with a Beating Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you only like to watch movies that have a dazzling twist at the end or where you really do not know what will happen next, then Warrior might not be for you. Warrior is Cliché in movie terms, but cliché in real life terms too which is not cliché but is. Make sense? Warrior is a movie where you know the direction it's heading in, but at the same time, it's a movie with some very real, disturbing and painful issues going on. The MMA fighting is what's going on on the surface, but beneath the surface, that's where the movie really lies, and that's what makes Warrior a truly great film and above most(if not all)films in this genre. So if a moviegoer only likes movies that dazzle them with a Sixth Sense twist or where they don't know what is going to happen next in the film, then again, that moviegoer may or may not like Warrior and that would be a shame, and quite myopic in my opinion(Although you don't fully know what will happen in Warrior thanks to Tom Hardy's performance as Tommy). Warrior is extremely well acted, it's extremely well edited, the director Gavin O'Connor knows how to time reaction shots exactly where they need to be, because a lot of rooting for the Main Character's is going to be through those precise, calculated reaction shots on the ones that are cheering in the film and because of those perfect reaction shots on the ones cheering in the film, there will be a lot of cheering for us, the ones watching the film. Also, The movie has a great score, every great movie needs a great score or at least one that flows organically well with the movie. The story and some of the lines/dialogue are heartbreaking, and anybody who has ever gone through any rough spots in their life, will be affected in some way by this movie, and you may need a box of tissues because this movie runs through the very highs and the very low's of pretty much every emotion that a human being can feel, and you as the movie watcher will probably be going through all the emotions that this movie evokes out of you, so you may catch yourself getting tears in your eyes here and there, as I did. There are no false moments in this movie, it is what it is, it's merciless and there is no easy way out for these characters. As in life, sometimes things have to come to a head whether we like it or not, sometimes they have to come to a head in order for there to be change, forgiveness, and rebirth which in turn usually makes it all for the better in our lives. The real shame is this movie did not do well at the box office. It had a great trailer that made me want to see it, but unfortunately there are no box office Superstars in it(yet), which is what the masses usually seem to want. The irony is, on AFI's 100 best film list of all time, 42 out of the 100 movies were not box office successes in their time that they came out at, but only as time went by, did they become regarded as 'great films' and 'Historically and/or Cinematically Significant'. Citizen Kane was a box office dud at it's time, I forget, what number is Citizen Kane on AFI's List? ;)..Unfortunately for Warrior, it was a box office dud, and it also hasn't had the campaigning that a lot of these other movies have, that aren't as good as Warrior, that are heavily campaigning for Media Buzz, Golden Globe, Oscar, Award buzz, etc. So again, Warrior got completely gypped out of any Golden Globe Nods, then it got one nomination for the SAG awards, so I can only imagine that it might get one Oscar Nom for Nolte in the best supporting actor category. However, if there was any justice, and if the academy awards wanted to make it up to Warrior with the string of bad luck it's had, they would make it up to this movie for nominating it for the nominations it deserves. It deserves a best film editing nomination, a best supporting actor nomination(either Nolte or Hardy), and a best film nomination. And if the Academy really wanted to do Warrior a full justice, it would give both Nolte and Hardy a nomination for best supporting actor and Gavin O'Connor a best director nomination and finally Jennifer Morrison a best supporting actress nomination as she is highly underrated in this film. To make amends with this film would be to give it 6 Academy Award Nominations. I'm just saying. But with how things go with the campaigning, Warrior might be lucky to get 1 or 2 Oscar Noms, but I hope I'm wrong about that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>.....the best movie I've seen in YEARS. I'm shocked. I've always loved MMA, watched so many PPV events I could probably pay a mortgage so I expected a sappy, yet enjoyable sports film. Oh my.....was I ever wrong! Tom Hardy....you've blown my mind. But it's not just him, everyone in this film is so believable, I forgot I was watching a movie. I laughed, smiled, chuckled, frowned, held my breath (alot), literally jumped off the couch yelling stuff, held my breath some more, and felt tears well up in my eyes. And that was before the ending!!! The ending is epic, in my opinion. I've read other reviews stating an opinion that it would have been better if certain things happened but I don't agree. I refuse to put spoilers in here but the ending is perfect just the way it is. It's more like watching reality TV the way it's done and like I've already said, I totally forgot I was watching a movie, it's so believable. Please, females who read this......do NOT pass this up because it looks like a guy film. This is like a chick flick wrapped in testosterone. Besides, the stars are gorgeous. This is definitely going in my Blu Ray collection and I'm inviting everyone I know to come over and watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sad and brutal masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Warrior" is about two "Rocky"s in one movie set in the rough world of Mixed Martial Arts. Tommy Reardon (Tom Hardy) is a guilt-ridden war hero who wants to help the widow of a dear friend who died in battle. Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) is a high school physics teacher who is about to be evicted from his house. The movie follows their training and winning matches en route to the inevitable finale at the big-time Sparta Tournament. We also get a peek into their troubled family lives which paints a more dramatic background to the main sports story.I am sucker for movies about brothers. There was "A River Runs Through It," "The Mambo Kings," "The Fighter," and now "Warrior" is another one. Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton don't really look like brothers, but both look credible in their roles as mixed martial artists. Hardy has that brooding aggressiveness on him. Edgerton has the more underdog role. Nick Nolte shines as the absentee drunkard father who is trying his best to reform, but is still facing rejection. The story takes its time in the beginning, but you will be hooked once the competitions begin. You will definitely want to know who wins in the end and how. The action in this movie is very realistic. Choreography is not evident as everything seems to be happening in actuality. We are brought to ringside seats to see this extremely strenuous sport up close. A sad and brutal masterpiece, you will be moved to tears.</fullReview>

It turns out that I rented a masterpiece. You will see a deep story that on its surface bleeds action. You will cry, laugh and shout from your seat out of spontaneous emotions. With every discussion between the characters, with every non expected punch, you will feel like you are in the movie, like you are part of the story. Believe me if I tell you I didn't want this movie to finish. Believe if I tell you that this one makes "The Fighter" look like an average movie. Believe me that for a moment I forgot who the hell Rocky Balboa was, and all the sudden, the credits were just rolling up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From beginning until end, "Warrior" is more than fight-drama movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning. I've seen the running time of this movie, 140 minutes and I thought that it would be kind of tired. However anyone can make mistakes like I did, the fact is that this movie is very interesting from beginning to end not only for the fight scenes, but also for the story that we can see. Most of the people have problems between brothers, and some of them can lead into a fight, but have you ever imagine to solve it into a ring? That's the reason why this movie can be so shocking. The soundtrack is perfect, beautiful instrumental and lyrics songs that are in the company of a magnificent screen play. We have to recognize the role of Joel Edgerton as Brandon that is, in my opinion, one of the roles that deserves to be recognized with an Academy award.This is one of the movies that makes 2011 a salvation for movies besides the fact that this year only a few films were merely to see. If you like to see a drama movie with a little of action in it, see "Warrior" and you will enjoy it since beginning until end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pandering to the lowest box office denominator of UFC, elevated to higher art by Tom Hardy's performance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film in a Oscar vote distributed, DVD version, whose sole purpose is to garner Oscar buzz and the resultant addition gross dollars involved. Unlike it's contemporary Real Steel who panders to the same audience, but seeks to gets it's additional (Undeserved?) $ Umph from shameless, demographic cross marketing, including Action Figures, a Hip Hop soundtrack (while the EM&amp;M-less, Danny Elfman OST is available through entirely different platform marketing in it's own more demure... dare I even say whiter and more Christian offering). Warrior sought it's market in it's less dollar bankable, but more respectable stars (maybe they should have saved a little more for the writers) and the producer's obvious hope that this film, despite it pop-populist plot roots insuring a bottom line box office, that more, it could join the pantheon of great films that have pugilism as their backdrop, and through that BE A CONTENDER (insert marbles in mouth here) and through that reach respectable return and distribution beyond what it would otherwise have reason to hope.While Tom Hardy is not givin' much to say, beyond the tear jerking, jingoist, overall mass arena appeal guidelines of the overall, utterly implausible, screenplay (How stupid, or special interest media manipulated, are we to believe legions of reporters and their editors are, not to mention the United States Marine Corp; that not one of their ranks figured out these two guys are brothers, one of whom is AWOL from active duty, until 12 hours before they meet in a nationally televised, media market saturated casino "event")... Or not much more anyway, than that which forces the often gifted Nick Nolte to look at best effect, like a character from a A&amp;E historical recreation or a 2 tissue vignette, pulled out for plot device, much like violins in afternoon TV.Still, Hardy's performance transcends the mediocrity around him, and he, and he alone, on pure power of performance, literally carries this film from drivel to destiny. I think it not unfair to say any post opening weekend buzz you hear, or reason's told that you should watch it, especially in after theater release, do not stem from professional shooting and editing techniques super imposed on UFC fighting (which are themselves unquestionably serviceable-but do no not a contender make-or TT3D would be getting a nod as well). It is from Tom Hardy's gritty animalistic and indomitable performance, that in spite of it's cynically contrived and marketed background, stands out like maybe no other from the year 2011 and which moves this film, singlehandedly, from a low 6 to a high 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's that rare feel good sports movie that never gets sugary or one sided</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as sports movies go, Warrior is one of the few that actually seems to deliver what it promises. Most sports movies in today's age often feel stale because of the lack of emphasis on characters, but Warrior is not that kind of film. Unlike Gridiron Gang, Warrior focuses its time more on characters than the sport itself. That's what makes Warrior a tremendous surprise given how the trailer emphasized most of its time on the big MMA showdown between Hardy and Edgerton. For the first time since Miracle, Director Gavin O'Connor delivers a picture worthy of his talents and makes Warrior a brutal but affectionate feel good picture.Tommy (Hardy) and Brendan Conlon (Edgerton) could not be more different as brothers who despise their recovering alcoholic father (Nick Nolte). But one thing that does bring them together is a MMA event that fetches a 5 million dollar prize, although their paths are quite different. Tommy is a war veteran who has just returned home under mysterious circumstances, and decides to train with his father after knocking down a major MMA contender in which becomes a viral hit.Brendan is a father of three struggling to make ends meet, and he has no choice but to fight in "Sporta" after a fight leaves him suspended from his day job as a Physics teacher. With his house about to be foreclosed on and his wife (Jennifer Morrison) struggling to raise their three daughters, Brendan decides to return to the ring despite an earlier fight that left him unconscious. As these two paths collide, one thing is for sure: these brothers will hold nothing back to live their dreams.Much like Rocky and The Fighter, Warrior is a fighting picture that focuses more on its characters than the fighting at hand. Despite all of the brutal fighting that ensues throughout, most of Warrior devotes its time to the journeys of the characters. That's what makes Warrior a special sports movie, as it rarely feels like a stale "rise from the ashes" kind of tale. It also never feels stale for a feel good movie, as it truly digs into all of the emotions the characters to the point where it pushes the actors to their limits. If you don't cry at least once throughout Warrior, then you will not hear the end of it from me.Warrior reminds me of Hoosiers, only instead of one man finding redemption we have two finding redemption in the "cage". The one drawback of Warrior is that it feels like an expose of MMA, digging so much into the underbelly of Mixed Martial Arts that it sort of ruins the mystique of the sport. But Warrior doesn't become as obsessed over these elements as one will expect, so it's not much of a surprise that Warrior boasts such great acting. As an emotional roller-coaster, Warrior is never short of moments that feel like Oscar bait. And you know what? The men in the picture do quite well in their roles as a whole.Hardy bulks up and does well as the resistant son, delivering a brute but powerful performance both inside and outside the ring. Edgerton is splendid as the father down on his luck, delivering a "Rocky" like performance that's hard not to love. Besides the incredible physiques, both Edgerton and Hardy are incredible in their final fight sequence. While nothing exceptional, the final fight sequences echoes much of what's great in feel good sports movies. You hate to see one of them lose, yet you know that only one can get what they want. The MMA event sort of goes by too quickly, but its impact is made by the brutality of the event.Just seeing Kurt Angle fight in Warrior is a treat, as the film doesn't hold back the harsh nature of MMA in general. However, Warrior's best element comes from the emotionally vulnerable performance of Nick Nolte. It's hard not to see why Nolte is up for awards, as his emotionally volatile take on the alcoholic dad is nothing short of heartbreaking and devastating. Throughout the film he tries to reconnect with his sons, but it's clear that his sons want nothing to do with him despite Paddy staying sober. This creates some serious drama by Nolte, and the way he breaks down over the rejection of acceptance from Hardy and Edgerton is truly tearful.The script lacks great originality, but its low key approach allows the brutal nature of the fights to be more surprising than expected. It covers too many areas of the fighters' lives at times, robbing some of the "underdog" nature that Warrior strives for, and the camera work is a bit shaky with all the shaky cam at hand. Many will consider Warrior to be a rip off of The Fighter, Rocky, Hoosiers and so on, but with results like these it really doesn't matter. Warrior is not your usual feel good sports film, but rarely does something as emotionally intense and cheerful like Warrior come every year.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best, if not the best movie of 2011</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for Warrior, I dismissed it immediately. Two brothers and fighting. It looked like an MMA version of The Fighter. I have never been more wrong about a movie. One of the best things about Warrior was the performances. Nick Nolte's role as Paddy Riordan was simply spectacular. He should certainly be nominated for an Oscar. He portrayed the alcoholic father of Brendan and Tommy perfectly. The blend of his rough, scratchy voice and his teary, shifting eyes combined to create a portrait of a father who was truly saddened and upset by the way he treated his sons. The scene in the diner, which was later cut from the film, is in my opinion, his best acted scene in the movie. It is a shame that it was not shown in the movie, but can be seen on the DVD/Blu-Ray's Special Features.Tom Hardy really performed terrifically in his role as Tommy Riordan. He kept the audience guessing about why his character was so mentally torn. The fact that he became this jacked for the movie just goes to show how dedicated he is as an actor, and his performance in Warrior really got me excited for his role as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises. Joel Edgerton played a former UFC fighter turned High School teacher who has recently fallen into financial trouble. He was virtually unknown before this movie, having minor roles in films such as King Arthur and Star Wars. He was good in his role as Owen Lars in Star Wars, and I am glad he has finally received recognition. He was good in Warrior, but not as good as Hardy and Nolte.One of my favorite parts about Warrior was the fact that the viewer was able to decide which brother he or she rooted for. In all movies, especially sports movies, we are presented with a protagonist who we want to succeed throughout the film, and in most instances, it is quite obvious that they will succeed. In Warrior, there are multiple protagonists. Both have their good qualities, and both have their bad qualities. It is up to you to decide which one you will root for.Some people may decide who they will root for right away. Some will prematurely root for Tommy, just by looking at him. He is a bad ass, how could you not root for him? Some will root for Brendan just by looking at him. He is a teacher and an underdog, how could you not root for him? Some people will emotionally connect with Tommy. He is a war-hero who has finally forgiven his father and allowed him to be his trainer. Some will emotionally connect with Brendan. He is a high school teacher with kids and a wife who needs money. When we watch Batman, we all root for Batman over the Joker, and we know Batman will win. When we watch Warrior, some will root for Batman, and some will root for the Joker. It's up to you to decide which one's which.Overall, Warrior was a fantastic film. The screenplay was not fantastically well written, but it was directed so well by Gavin O'Connor that it does not matter. Warrior is by far one of the best movies of the year, and it is a shame that it will not be nominated for Best Picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic sports drama with an outstanding performance of the actors!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I must apologize for my bad English...but now to the movie:"Warrior" is definitely one of the best films in 2011! A sports drama in a class of its own! This film has just everything: feelings and emotions, suspense, action and a terrific acting performance of the three main characters Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton and Nick Nolte.The story is from beginning to end very poignant and captivating. The troubled past in the family and the current problems of the three main characters are represented by an almost perfect actor's performance from the beginning and are communicated in a very emotional way.As a counterpart to the many poignant dialogues of family problems, the very successful fight scenes also convince because of their realistic representation which is often not the case in many other boxing films.Right from the beginning, it is clear that this is not about a meaningless sting of fight scenes! The emotional story and its development up to a dream end is definitely in the foreground. All this is just refined with this emotional and realistic fight scenes.All in all you can say that you find a perfect mixture of drama and action - just what constitutes a successful sports drama - in this movie. Anyone who sees this film will be enthusiastic about the great story and will remember this movie for a long time. Therefore, i cant understand why this film is so unknown and so few people have heard of it.Conclusion: "Warrior" is a movie you must see! 10/10!</fullReview>

I guess if you are a fighting movie fan or something of that kind you'll like it, but I don't have much experience with what fighting films are usually like:P So don't base your decision to watch it on me saying this.I, as a girl and non fighting movie fan, loved it!

		<fullReview>Believe me, this film deserves the Oscar for best picture. This film doesn't only tie the aspect of fighting but brings all those close moments we share together. The film has a very powerful ending which leaves the audience happy with what the outcome is no matter whose side they picked. A fantastically directed and produced film.My only wish about this film is that it becomes more public as not many people know about it. Please suggest it to all your friends and families as it's one of the years best films and also one of the best films to ever come out.A truly beautiful story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, you may be asking yourself why I declared this to be one of the best films of the year, but gave it a nine out of ten. Not to worry. I do not give out many tens. I reserve those for movies that I deem to be some of the best movies of all time. Nevertheless, upon hearing about this film, I was worried that it would simply be a low-quality rehashing of "The Fighter". When I finally saw this film, I was pleasantly surprised and extremely impressed with everything that they had done. "Warrior" is not just another sports movie that portrays an individual or a team overcoming great odds and finally reaching victory on a high level. This story has multiple layers and satisfies on multiple levels.This is a story about three characters, two of whom are MMA fighters and one of whom is their father. It portrays how a fighting championship called Sparta brings a family together after they have become strangers to each other. The two sons, Tommy and Brendan Conlon, feel they have been neglected by their father, Paddy, for their entire lives, due to his drinking problem, while the brothers have become distant as Brendan has started a family while Tommy joined the Marines. Tommy feels that Brendan betrayed him by not joining the Marines with him, while Brendan is disappointed that when distancing himself, Tommy also distanced their mother from him. On top of this, Tommy is fighting to earn money for the family of a fallen comrade, while Brendan is trying to earn money for his wife and children so that they don't have to face foreclosure. All of this comes together seamlessly to build one of the greatest sports films ever made.Much of the poetic beauty of this film comes together in how the brothers Brendan and Tommy are portrayed as perfect foils of each other. Brendan plays the guy who is settled down and mature, while Tommy plays the rogue Bad Boy who likes to break all the rules and goes against the grain. The makers of this film make this theme play out on several different levels, from the way in which the brothers walk, talk and behave, to the style in which they train and fight. They even go as far as having Joel Edgerton, who plays Brendan, wear white shorts during his fights, and having Tom Hardy, who plays Tommy, wear black shorts. The way in which all of this came together reminded me very much of how, in "Black Swan", the characters Nina and Lily, where perfect foils of each other. I must say that, in this respect, this was done just as well.The other point I enjoyed about this movie is that the audience doesn't know how this story is going to end like in just about every other sports movie. When you began watching "Remember the Titans", you knew that the movie could only end with the Titans winning the state championship. In "Coach Carter", the Oilers failed to win the championship, and while the film makers tried their best to make the best out of it while still opting out of the standard sports movie ending, it still ended up being disappointing. The makers of this film eliminated that problem by focusing on two competitors instead of one. At no point during the film did we know which one of the brothers was going to win the final fight, which made it all the more thrilling.My only gripe about this film is a rather small one and does little damage to the film's overall quality. In the beginning of the film, we are lead to believe that the two brothers were once excellent fighters, but have not stepped inside the cage in a very long time. I found it a little difficult to believe that they could become top MMA fighters after only a few months of training. That is really my only criticism for this film, but it really doesn't take away from the rest of the story.My bottom line is: You must definitely see this movie. I loved it even though my interest in MMA fighting is minimal. After some time, I will probably watch it again, and I will probably enjoy it. This movie definitely earns all the praise it gets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicely performed sports drama with some excellent fight scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Former U.S. Marine Tommy Riordan (Tom Hardy) returns to the home of his estranged father Paddy (Nick Nolte), to find him sober and a Christian. Tommy left home with his now late mother after suffering years of abuse from the alcoholic Paddy, and now Tommy wants to fight in the upcoming mix-martial arts tournament called Sparta, and enlists his father to train him. Meanwhile, Tommy's brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton) is a physics teacher who faces losing his family home to the bank. He also fights mixed martial arts, and when the school board finds out he has been fighting in some small back-alley tournaments, the school suspend him without pay. Brendan must convince his wife to let him fight in Sparta, and must face meeting his brother who hasn't talked to him in years, and his father, who he despises.Warrior is another successful entry into the recent revisionist sports dramas such as The Wrestler (2008) and The Fighter (2010), that take David-and-Goliath themes and spin them with an almost docu-drama approach, while sticking to the traditions (some could say clichés) of the genre. Here, director Gavin O'Connor (who made the pretty crappy Pride and Glory (2008)) uses a hand-held camera and a muted blue colour palette to also explore family themes such as unconditional love, forgiveness and redemption. Familiar themes, I agree, but thanks to some confident directing and stellar acting from the three leads, Warrior is one of those rare sports films where you truly grow to root for the characters and get caught up in their plight. It also contains some great fight scenes that are surprisingly brutal given its 12A certificate.Naturally, if either of the brothers want to win, they must face the prospect of fighting each other (and if you've seen the trailer, you'll know if that happens or not). Whereas the likes of Rocky (1976) had one clear hero to cheer on, here there's two, and I found myself caring equally about both. As Tommy, Hardy gives a performance of ferocious intensity. He becomes an unwitting national hero when one of his earlier fights goes viral on Youtube, and finds he has the backing of the Marine Corps. Tommy is angry, and this is reflecting in his fighting style. He storms into the ring, smashes his opponents with a few punches, and storms back out. It's no surprise Christopher Nolan wanted him to play Bane in the upcoming The Dark Knight Rises. Brendan is calmer, and his trainer adopts a patient and tactical fighting style to suit Brendan's age. He even enters the ring to the sound of Beethoven. The two performances are equally good, but they are both overshadowed by Nolte, a man so consumed with regret and sadness that is drives him back to drink in one especially powerful scene. Nolte is great here, and I'm sure he'll be up for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar come March.For those wanting action, there's plenty of it. When the Sparta tournament comes around, there's barely a moment spent outside the ring. They come thick and fast, and are impressively captured by O'Connor's camera. This may be the film's biggest problem, as the emotional core of the film's relies on the conflict between the three leads, especially between Tommy and Paddy. There is some sort of closure in one very good scene, but it is never shown again after that so the story fizzles out while we are consumed by the fighting. But what fighting it is, and when the action is this good, it's hard to be too concerned by the slight neglect of it's main theme. It under-performance at the box office, but I'm sure it will pick up the dedicated fan base that it deserves in the years to come.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Film of 2011</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film sets the new standard for fighting films bar none. No fighting movie in recollection can hold a candle to Warrior, to include the first Rocky. While the plot has been used and abused in previous film, never has it been done this well. The acting is flat out perfect, without a single line by the protagonists (there are two), that seems forced. The ability to identify with the characters is what makes a movie gripping and interesting. I cannot recall a film in which I really did not care how the end turned out, but just enjoyed watching it like this one!If there is one movie you see this year, Warrior should be it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mediocre effort with the cast giving the Midas' touch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay. There are probably a thousand movies with the same plot, the same character build-up and the equally probable climax. All due respect to the director, but there is no fantastic direction that takes this movie to a whole different level, a good different level. The screenplay is ordinary, the photography linear, the direction, if not great, but very textbook. Plenty of fights for the action junkie to get high on too, and a lot of clichéd drama coupled with it. And this is not why this movie is different from the rest of them.But for the acting, this movie would have been lost in time as another one of the fight movies that hopes to pump up the audience and earn some big bucks. Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton and Nick Nolte have poured their hearts in this mediocre piece of work. There was not much character development available to these actors, but it still turned out to be great, and only because of their exceptional acting. Joel Edgerton's character was probably the most complex in the entire movie. And he played his part to perfection. There was so much heart in this movie, you actually will begin to care for these characters, so much so that you will cheer for them, and not because you are on an adrenaline rush from all the punches. Hats off to the entire cast, for this was indeed a miraculous, once-in-a-while acting work.A must watch, and much appreciable work. One of the best that 2011 has churned out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie , but seriously people ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Get this out of IMDb Top 250 , because it's rather embarrassing that this movie has such high rating . I like it and it's definitely quite well made movie . Still , I can't stop wondering why people love this movie so much . Is it because the new sport such as MMA is rather more popular now than boxing ? Maybe.Anyway , there isn't nothing here that you didn't see in one the "Rocky" movies . With the exception of Hardy's mysterious past the movie is very straightforward and rather predictable from start to finish. The movie also failed to really explain what the conflict between brothers was all about. I understood the conflict between brothers and father . The movie takes it time to explain that to us and that's a good thing . Unfortunately , the whole explanation of conflict between brothers takes only few seconds and is rather unconvincing (at least for me). In the end it felt very rushed and it's a bad thing , because it was important part of the movie."The Warrior" feels also strangely like a commercial for MMA . You don't have money ? Go to MMA. You want to repair your relationship with father ? Go to MMA. You want to forgive your brother ? Go to MMA. You want to relax after hard day in job ? Go to MMA.Thankfully , this is also a movie about winning self respect and achieving forgiveness . It's obviously directed with passion . Sometimes even with too much passion (the last 5 minutes of the movie full of pathos) . There is lot of energy during the fights . The mysterious past of Hardy is intriguing to the end of the movie . Nice dialogue . And definitely good acting.Nick Nolte is phenomenal in a heartbreaking role of ex-alcoholic father. He deserved the Oscar nominee . This must be the best performance of his career . Joel Edgerton is good as the mild mannered teacher fighting for his family . Tom Hardy is even better as the black sheep of family . There is lot of anger, mystery and tension in him. Jennifer Morrison is nice in her love of loving wife , even if she basically repeats her performance from "House MD".It's a good movie . Overrated , but good . I give it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fighter, Rocky and Million Dollar Baby mixed in one great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was when I consulted the premieres of the week that I came across the despicable poster Warrior. See: two muscular men, naked trunk in a movie called "Warrior" and subtitled Portuguese is "Fighting Between Brothers". Well, let's say Warrior is buried deep with a picture of these for the first printing. It was when I saw some reviews and by high scores to the film that I thought maybe the thing was not so linear as this, because in almost all the film was held in high esteem, with high scores and the surprising rating of 8.3 on IMDb, that puts you in the top 250 films of all time. And it is confirmed: Warrior is a great movie. Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton play two brothers separated for 14 years, created by an alcoholic father, played by Nick Nolte, who taught them to fight from a very young. The first became a lone Marine and a second physics teacher, married and father, which is currently in serious financial trouble. As for the father, this was abandoned by both sons, who ignore and cut off all relations with him, preferring to forget it. That's when Tommy (Tom Hardy) returns to her father's house 14 years after the plot develops, and the biggest tournament in mixed martial arts history will take place. More than a sports movie, Warrior is a great drama with brilliant performances by Nick Nolte (nominated for best supporting actor Oscar) and Tom Hardy, the British actor who had done a good role in Inception and is now preparing to play Bane, the villain of the next Batman movie, The Dark Knight Rises, and that is undoubtedly establish itself as a rising star. All dialogues and scenes in which Nick Nolte appears are fantastic. The character of old father, abandoned and sorry that strives for the children to accept and to love again is superbly embodied by the actor, creating thin links between family relationships and the spectator who leaves no doubt moved. Tommy is also excellent. The actor Tom Hardy builds an unstoppable wrestler, dir would be invincible until, apparently almost no feelings, disgusted and enraged by the children he had. A fighter who is more like a rabid dog that a dark man. Already Brendan, played by Joel Edgerton, while also being well can not be at the other two. Perhaps because of its character is more "normalized" (Brendan is the underdog, a retired fighter competition in whom nobody believes) the player will eventually have less room to maneuver, or their abilities as an actor does not really go to meet their pairs. We tend more to this second option. The two brothers have to rest a single scene of dialogue throughout the film that reinforces the emotional charge and the separation between the two, this scene once again superb. The dialogues and dramatic aspects, but even very well exploited, in principle would be the highlight of the film. It would not be combat scenes also exceptional realism and movement of a camera that impresses us very original, as if we were to actually watch the UFC fights on Sic Radical, forgetting that those who are fighting are actually actors . Note also positive for the dedication of both actors in learning martial arts and especially for Tom Hardy and his rigorous physical training, appearing on the screen with a monstrous muscles, specifically for the film, causing us to remember "method actors" as Adrian Brody in Predators or Christian Bale in Dark Knight and Machinist. Highlight for further engaging soundtrack. Warrior However, despite being a film very dear, is not a bed of roses. There are some inconsistencies that can not be ignored, such as Tommy was fighting unbeatable champion Greco-Roman in his youth, only to have changed his nickname now enters the tournament as an anonymous, unknown if any data on it, which turns out to be ridiculous. The realism of the final scene also ends up leaving something to be desired. And unfortunately Warrior ends up suffering, though not of evil in a maddeningly combat films, this is the successive cuts of exciting fights to see the reaction of secondary characters, sometimes extremely annoying, irrelevant and end up being comical and in bad taste, which is following the fighting at home. Still nothing to compare with the heinous Cinderella Man, perhaps the most disgusting film's dramatic fight I've ever had the misfortune to watch. Warrior actually turns out to be an overview of the best that is done in The Fighter, Rocky and Million Dollar Baby, for all the reasons cited above, and not without a scent, but a little, feeling Hollywood (bloody cuts to Watch the reactions of secondary characters), but this is not necessarily bad, quite the contrary. Causes this is an interesting film, addictive and dare I say inspiring, with a dramatic charge well dosed and ultimately go positively different genres of cinema. Objectively Warrior hangs between good and very good, 3 and 4 stars. However, bearing in mind I have just my personal opinion, and with great satisfaction, to assign the top note and hope that justice is done and Nick Nolte is awarded.originally published in the blog retroprojeccao</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only thing "Warrior" could have added to make its shamelessly manipulative screenplay even more emotionally manipulative would have been a three-legged dog dying of cancer. This movie makes "Rocky" look as austere as an Ingmar Bergman film.But damned if it didn't work on me anyway! The story of two brothers with heaps of back story who face off at an MMA championship, "Warrior" couldn't have a hokier set up, but it's executed so well that it almost makes you buy it. Get this -- one brother plans to give the $1 million prize money to the widow of a brother in arms who was killed in action; the other wants the money so that he can dig his family out of financial crisis and save their house (I might throw in that his daughter suffers from a serious heart condition). Don't worry about not having a rooting interest.But here's the thing. The screenplay wisely avoids a lot of talky scenes in which these two brothers work out their personal demons, estrangement from each other and their gruff father (played by Nick Nolte). These guys aren't very articulate, so their pent up rage and anguish, at each other and at life in general, comes out in the ring, and that somehow feels right. The film understands that men aren't frequently given a lot of options for expressing themselves, and that sometimes beating each other up is the closest they're ever going to get to declaring a love for one another.I'm embarrassed to admit that I almost cried at the end of this movie.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Warrior' brings back Academy-Award-Nominee Nick Nolte to supremacy. Nolte, after a long hiatus, gets a meaty role, in which, he delivers a masterful performance. A performance so well-done, it raises above everything here. 'Warrior' tells the story of two estranged brothers entering a mixed martial arts tournament, and deals with the brothers' struggling relationship with each other and with their father.'Warrior' is flawed, but engaging &amp; entertaining nonetheless. What I thought the film lacked, was a water-tight script. Though not at all boring, I thought the script could've had more of that punch. However, Gavin O'Connor, Cliff Dorfman &amp; Anthony Tambakis's Screenplay does deserve mention, as it engages all through. Gavin O'Connor's Direction, is intense. Cinematography &amp; Editing are routine. MMA Fights are awesome.Performance-Wise: It's a Nolte show all the way. He delivers one of his performances here! Joel Edgerton &amp; Tom Hardy are highly efficient. Jennifer Morrison is impressive. Kevin Dunn is good. Others support well.On the whole, 'Warrior' is a well-made film, but it's Nolte's performance that makes this film unmissable.</fullReview>

This movie will definitely be included in my list of movie favorites and I just found two new favorite actors as well.

His estranged and deeply troubled brother Tommy who has eloped from his unit in Iraq returns on the scene and also competes in the MMA scene, where we see several brutally realistic bouts take place not just with other MMA hopefuls but eventually between the two brothers. The two leads are excellent, Joel Edgerton is entirely convincing as is Tom Hardy who is terrifying and brutal in the ring. Nick Nolte is amazing in his role as the equally troubled father who trains Hardy, one can argue that it appears that Nolte resembles Lee Marvin in his appearance. Nolte's portrayal has won him universal critical praise and rightly so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't understand the poor reviews Warrior has received in the UK. Admittedly, if you write down the plot it seems complete hokum, but the outstanding acting performances across the board lift the film above its fight-movie premise.In particular, I enjoyed Joel Edgerton (reprising his star turn in Half Nelson) as a science teacher attempting to earn extra bucks to keep his family afloat after medical expenses sink their finances. Tom Hardy is fine too as his grumpy brother who's gone AWOL from the army.The schoolroom scenes are superb and the later part of the movie also captures the feel of Atlantic City. One of the few omissions is that you don't get to see Tom Hardy train with his father (NIck Nolte) when this should be one of the cruxes of the film.Overall then, I think Warrior deserves a few Oscar nominations rather than a critical mauling. Perhaps Hollywood is just tired of fight movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't let the movie title 'Warrior' put you off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shockingly poor movie title aside, I'd heard this film was good so went in with reasonably high expectations. These were met, mostly down to the close focus on story and character development, and some fine actingI've followed UFC since the very early days, watching the dodgy VHS tapes of Royce Gracie in the 90's, and I also love quality film. Warrior finds a happy compromise. Yes the fighting is ott at times, a couple of highly suspect moves - guillotine escape to arm bar? some Hulk Hogan style body slams, bundles of ground and pound that would stop fights immediately miraculously saved by the bell, and also a silly Russian fighter complete with flag and Rocky IV type music Thankfully these moments are rare. The fighting feels authentic enough mostly helped by fast and slick editing, and TV segments and commentators that feel real - not an easy taskNotably strong performances are turned in by all three leads. The father, Nick Nolte, who really digs deep for this role (some personal experience?) and both sons; Joel Edgerton who I was really impressed with (he's in the upcoming Thing remake so I now hold out a candle of hope for that movie) and Tom Hardy from Inception etc who I barely recognized as he was so bulked up. The supporting cast are also solid including some familiar MMA faces and fighters The best part of the story for me was the brother who works as a teacher and needs to fight again or lose everything. I've taught, and I've sometimes imagined what the students would think if their teacher became an mma fighter!! Here we see it happen and it lends some nice humour to an otherwise mostly serious film Obviously don't go in expecting art-house or Raging Bull, but this is easily up there with The Wrestler for example. If you want a fun and very emotion driven movie then go see it</fullReview>

It ends up with a knockout tournament for a $5 million prize.However, it turns out that this is no more than a hook on which to hang a tale of two brothers (Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton), estranged in their teens by virtue of an abusive alcoholic father (Nick Nolte), and his attempts to re-connect with them. In some respects, this is all a bit soap opera, yet these three people come across as real people, with credible problems and behaviour, and you care about them. The film is at its best when dealing with the family drama.Having said that, the action is well presented, and visceral, and the performances are all good. I find Nolte's croaky delivery increasingly difficult to understand, but he is unquestionably very good here, as are Hardy and Edgerton. In fact, the film fails only at the end when the result of the final bout of the tournament is used as the end, leaving too many plot threads unresolved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a legit MMA movie that is taken as a sport seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very well made sports movie. It's the first MMA movie where it's legit and MMA is actually taken as a serious sport instead of just wannabe's fighting for whatever reasons. The premise to this movie has been done before, in fact it reminded me of "Crying Fist" while watching although the scenario is different. But they are both uplifting movies and this movie grabs you in a emotional level few times. Some people say that there wasn't enough fighting in this, but I personally thought it had a good amount of it. And the fight sequences are very well done, it's entertaining and engaging to watch. In fact some fights makes you want to get up and cheer. And not just because you end up caring for the characters and this is a very character driven movie. Some scenes just seemed lame though and not believable at all and could have been cut short or cut out entirely, but that is just a small complaint. The performances is probably the best thing about this movie next to the fights. Tom Hardy played his role well as a character that is hurt and damaged because of his past, the guy is a beast in this movie. The main flaw of this movie is the pacing and the development, some stuff just didn't seemed developed all that well. Despite that this is a movie that is worth seeing, especially audiences that are fans of MMA or any other sports.7.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cameras cut away too soon from pivotal wrestling holds that spell victory for Brendan. The Moby Dick motif could have worked with adequate foreshadowing or exposition. Another movie in which a protagonist suffers unbelievable punishment in the ring for far too long to credibly achieve victory at the last moment. Despite those misgivings, this movie is well-written, well-acted and superbly directed. It reminded me of the exploration of abusive father-son relationships in such other films as "The Great Santini" with Robert Duval and "I Never Sang for My Father" with Gene Hackman. The film contains many great scenes that will be crowd pleasers for an array of audiences, especially the scenes depicting the students of physics teacher/warrior Brendan and the scenes showing Brendan getting into tip-top shape. The development of the human adversaries/behemoths is cleverly arranged with predicable but stunning results. The angle of vision resulting from realizing that one fighter is a formidable hero/AWOL soldier fleeing from some demonic Iraqi cage, adds another believable layer to Tommy and to the movie, too. I liked the scene in which Brendan allows the very serious little girls to paint his face like a fairy princess on the deck in the family's back yard. I thought the fight with the Russian was almost totally unbelievable. No one could endure that much damage; and though it is quite plausible that such a juggernaut fighter might never have faced that much pain, since he usually ended the fight in one punch, it would have been nice to see more of a detailed close-up of that particular winning hold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fictitious...Yes, But, Damn Moving!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As movie viewers we've seen about every iteration of fighting/boxing movie that can possibly be made...Not this one. "Warrior" written and directed by Gavin O'Connor breaks out as completely unique and very moving in the bargain. Two brothers splintered by their alcoholic father are pitted against each other in a mixed martial arts super battle final in a truly moving way. How can one help but feel some kind of empathy for the dysfunctional climax where one may be declared the victor but the larger battle of healing is at stake?This story could be total pulp, but somehow it isn't. Director/writer O.Connor deftly creates a story that works with the excellent performances of Joel Edgerton (the well adjusted survivor) and Tom Hardy (the black sheep good soul) as the separated brothers who only become family after a spectacular showdown. Perhaps incidental, but oh so vital is the fantastic nuanced performance of Nick Nolte as their fatally flawed father. This combination could have been a sub-standard "movie-of-the-week" celluloid piece of pulp...But, it is anything but! Instead it is one of the better "fight" movies ever. If you have a shred of humanity see this movie as it will speak to you. You'll watch two hours plus as if it was 15-minutes. Everything works. The performances are uniformly excellent, the writing concise and real, and, finally, the fight sequences brutally real. How can one help but enjoy this ride? Don't miss this as "Warrior" is truly entertaining and moving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible movie, totally unexpected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't usually write movie reviews, but I felt compelled to after seeing this sensational film. I can't believe that it didn't get a wider release in Canada, or somehow slipped by me. I am not a big UFC fan, or fight fan for that matter, and nor is my wife (who balled her eyes out in several emotional climaxes of the film); so don't believe that it's a film only for fight fans. It is in fact more of a family drama with UFC as the vehicle and backdrop in which to tell that story.Nick Nolte is amazing in this movie, and totally steals every scene he is in. Tom Hardy is incredibly different than anything he has done before and I commend him for it. Joel Edgerton is perfect as the family man you can't help but route for. In fact, I found myself wanting nothing bad to happen to any of the main characters in this movie and that's why it was such a success. The characters are developed perfectly and it grabs you emotionally without you realizing.In conclusion, let me make some bold statements: This is my favourite film of 2011. I hope more people get to see it as it is excellent. I also think it is a better film than Rocky, but obviously not as groundbreaking. whoa, right!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw Warrior after seeing many trailers and was very excited before the film.It Did not disappoint me at all, it is one of the best films of 2011 and excellent acting from Hardy,Edgerton and Nolte.The Movie is about Two brothers who participate in a world famous MMA tournament,with the worlds best Mixed Martial Arts fighters participating in it. Tommy(Hardy) is a no-nonsense type of a guy who gets a chance in participating in the tournament as the dark horse. Brendon(Edgerton) is a physics teacher who needs the money won from winning the tournament.The Movie has displayed great acting skills from Hardy And Nolte especially and i wont be surprised if they get nominated and may as well win some Oscars in the upcoming Academy Awards.Totally Recommended movie and i simply loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly emotional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gripping, emotional... These two adjectives comes to my mind after watching 'Warrior'. It has been a while since I wanted to jump in the air during watching a film, and I am not overreacting now. When I first watched the trailer, I thought 'yet another predictable fighting movie...' What a great surprise it was for me. Story is about two men, brothers as we find out. Brendan and Tommy have not seen each other in a long time, and very deep tension, anger can be sensed when we see them both meet. They have their problems. Brendan is closed to losing his home, where he lives with his wife and three little daughters and Tommy promised his close to heart friend while fighting in the war to take care of his family. I do not want to get into details, so I will just skip to the part which is important - they end up in the MMA tournament, called Sparta, with the main prize of 5.000.000 $.As opposed to other fighting type movies, where we see this bad dude, and a really good man, victim usually, this one is different. To the last moment we do not know who is really going to win, because they are both good, they both deserve to win the money. We see them struggling not only as opponents but also as brothers. They are hurt, have regrets.This is why I really enjoyed this movie. Because it makes you feel the emotions.I think it has been ages since I gave a film 10 out of 10 in rating, and I am happy to do it, especially that this film deserves a lot of credit.Thank you for taking your time. Enjoy :)10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been reading reviews on IMDb for years now, but I have never felt compelled to rate a movie on here because I was always content with the outcome. So here I am, with an account just to give this movie 10 stars. It deserves much more than the measly 8.3 it has at the moment. This was the underdog film of the year and deserves picture of the year, I'm not going to go on about what it's about because there are already reviews on here that touch on that subject. But just know this, it's touching, it's emotional, it's inspiring and it's about forgiveness and love, something that rarely moves me in cinema.10/10 from me,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's much more than a fight-movie, the film structure is perfect due to the compelling performances and the perfect screenplay. I usually don't like this genre (too technical) but in this case even the fights showing violence and barbarity go beyond the stamina on the ring. The film is about family relationship but what is extraordinary is the lead actors ability to commit their bodies and souls to the roles. Everyone's tortured by the past and they play their parts with understatement, passion and grace. The finale ? despite its violence ? is astonishing. Nick Nolte would probably deserve an Academy Award as a father tormented by past mistakes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is fascinating.You will be in complete shock after this movie.Story is full of emotions and you don't have to be ashamed if you let a few tears after this movie.Great performances by actors especially Nick Nolte as a father of two sons,Tom Hardy is incredible in his role certainly the best role of his career,Joel Edgerton is also very good.All three actors put up some of the most convincing performances in their career.The Fighter is a good movie,Oscar nominated movie but Warrior is ten times better than The Fighter.Father Paddy (Nick Nolte) is former alcoholic who is trying to reach out for his sons for forgiveness of being a family wreck.His older son former Marine Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) is a war hero who is suffering through PTSD decide that he wants to fight in Sparta and give the prize money to a wife of his fallen friend Manny.Younger son Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) is a former MMA fighter,now a Physics teacher who faces financial problems with his house and is slowly getting back into the mix by competing in underground fights. But the education system finds out about his underground fights and he is suspended without pay,so he uses this to train full time, and compete in Sparta.The movie had a specific way to get emotionally attached to characters and to know them really good.This movie is a truly respectable candidate for the Academy Award.My advice is that you leave anything you doing and run to the cinema,you wont regret it.This movie will be carved in your memory because of his incredible emotional story and incredible roles of actors especially Tom Hardy,Nick Nolte and Joel Edgerton.Once again i have to say it is truly amazing movie!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this film at Glasgow cineworld with the gf. I'd previously been impressed with Tom hardy in "Martina Cole's The Take", "Inception" and "Bronson" to name a few. Even as far back as his small stint on "Band of Brothers" TV series. Love watching and training in MMA, so was excited upon hearing this film was coming about. Was hoping &amp; praying this would NOT be a "Rocky" with MMA and found myself completely blown out the water by the emotional depth of the characters, (provided by Hardy, Edgerton &amp; Nolte), and the honest acting. Great story, fantastic acting, humorous in parts throughout and beautiful direction! We both loved it, told our friends about it........C'mon the DVD! :) Nolte should get an Oscar nod.

		<shortDescription>Simply ridiculous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me submit another review that is sure to accumulate negative votes from people who enjoy any brainless series of images you throw at them. Why not? The only problem is that it's really difficult to review this movie--to describe its crapitude--without including spoilers.This could have been quite a good movie. It really could have. But rather than make it even the slightest bit realistic, they take the low road. All the main characters are caricatures.I am very good at avoiding the temptation to predict what will happen in movies. I don't find it enjoyable to guess what will happen. A good movie will help to this end, by not being painfully predictable. This movie is so painfully predictable... it hurts. The kind of "predictable" that is utterly annoying. And unbelievable.We have two brothers who look absolutely nothing like brothers. And neither looks at all like their father. Already, this movie is making it difficult to suspend disbelief.One brother is an absolute monster in the ring. The other was not good at all, even in his prime. Yet we are supposed to believe that the guy who sucked when he was a young adult has become the world's best fighter in his late 30s, after a few weeks of training listening to Beethoven.The middle-aged brother is so opposed to filing for bankruptcy that he decides it's better to get pummeled to make money, because hey, $500 here and there is so worth it. And he loses his teaching job along the way. Great plot. But oh!--There's a huge tournament coming up with a massive payout! How lucky! Good thing middle-aged brother has a Rocky-like ability to overcome the ravages of time and reality.It becomes annoyingly obvious early on what will happen: The motivated middle-aged guy will defeat his talented brother (who magically ripped the door off a tank), and a mysterious, monstrous Russian who has wiped out everyone in his path thus far. Yeah, OK. The movie tries to stem predictability by adding a contrived bit about the talented brother giving the (huge) fight winnings to a fallen comrade's wife, but it doesn't help much toward that end. The movie is still painfully predictable.The crap relationship the brothers each have with their father goes nowhere. The best and most realistic part of the movie is when Nick Nolte's character falls off the wagon and gets drunk after being berated for the billionth time by talented son.Please, please rate this review as not helpful. I need to feel like I'm not a mindless sheep and helpful votes will not achieve that end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie gods be praised. Because after the laziest, most uneventful Australian winter at the cinemas that I can remember, the more impatient among us are just now seeing signs that things are about to pick up again. A quick scan of any cinema's day sessions shows an array of new films covering tastes all across the board, which is more than I could have said this time two weeks ago. Leading the charge of intrigue in the long run to the Academy Awards is Warrior, an emotional heavyweight that, on first impression, looks like it might just sneak in with a Best Picture nomination of its own.Once a promising young martial artist, Tommy (Tom Hardy) has recently returned from national service in Iraq still bearing a grudge against his lousy father (Nick Nolte) for his alcoholism and failure to keep the family together. Meanwhile, estranged brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton) is a physics teacher moonlighting as an amateur fighter- the only thing keeping a roof over his family's head. When the two hear of an MMA tournament pitting sixteen of the world's best middleweights against each other for a grand cash prize, each man decides to enter for very different reasons. Powerhouse performances from all three main actors are the strongest suit of Warrior. Edgerton plays off a strong script in developing an engaging character the audience can immediately empathise with, while Hardy displays impressive depth as the brooding, heart-of-stone Tommy. Starting out as a mostly bit-part actor in grit films, Hardy came to mass attention as whimsical fan favourite Eames in Inception. With this film, he proves he can take on more dramatic, challenging roles with equal success, and with a supporting role in Nolan's final Batman outing next year, 'promising' would be the greatest of understatements to describe how his career is shaping up.The standout, however, is Nolte. The masses are right to lavish praise on his Oscar-baiting performance; one that is certain to earn him at least a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He is the greatest accompaniment to a film packed full of touching and highly emotive moments, and his role as the father desperately trying to rebuild a once happy home life leads to inevitable comparisons with last year's excellent The Fighter, which is by no means a bad thing. In fact, without giving anything away, it is arguable that the most emotional scenes of Warrior are on a heavier scale than those of The Fighter, which should be reason enough to go and see it.The entire film is beautifully shot, in particular the fighting scenes that set up the aforementioned emotional peaks. Subtle nods to genre-moulders Rocky and Raging Bull create the most immersive cinematic experience possible short of walking out with a broken nose. Warrior continues the recent trend of films set in Pittsburgh (always good news for an adopted Steeler/Penguin/Pirate such as myself), a perfect fit due to its naturally gloomy, industrial surroundings, which complement the serious (and occasionally miserable) subject matter nicely.The film loses some points for an overly predictable second act. Admittedly, the climax is quite original and never fails to maintain the viewer's attention, but the path taken to get there is somewhat stale. This results in a handful of convenient moments that we're supposed to believe could really happen, which is too much of a stretch for a film that takes itself as seriously as this one. For example, an injury suffered by one of the competitors thrusts Brendan into a tournament (at a time when he is a relative nobody in the world of MMA) supposedly restricted to the world's most accomplished fighters. Another such moment during the tournament itself is equally lazy (which can't be divulged lest I give away major spoilers) and prevents the film from pushing its way into the 'all-time classics' department. But in the end, these are downfalls, not dealbreakers, and can't keep Warrior from earning a respectable score and a personal recommendation.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is compelling, it is socially apt and the acting is perfect by all....each character of the main ones have their arcs....and you are on the edge of your seat! I hope it wins the Oscar for best ensemble acting....I am afraid that because two of the actors are so buff that some will not appreciate their amazing acting skills throughout this, too.....and it is such a relief to have a feature movie about the working class and not the upper middle class or super riches! Plus, I love the intimacy of the camera....you feel like you are brought so close to the characters so that you can read their nuance, you feel for and love them in all their complexity.. Even though you have to watch some serious bashing in the ring.....('tis why we have eye lids) , the fight scenes are not pulling you into the hurt of it though neither do they escape the physical realities....the sound tracks brings you right into the ring and arena....and they play with the camera work....in varieties of ways to show the story and it is a No BS story. I've seen a few others that had Mid-East Veterans in the story line (Sheridan's the Brothers was one &amp; there is a simplicity and inauthenticity to those (am also thinking of Hurt Locker) or caricatures that are one dimensional) ....this one is complex by not interpreting just sharing the depths and contradictions and it is the best by miles.....no false notes.....despite the preposterousness of the conceit.....my one tiny criticism is that sometimes the back music was a little too crescendo-ish....just a couple of times it pulled you away with its drama....but only for a "bitlet"...They did such interesting work with lens colors' too....darkly tones for the scenes that are emotionally that way....light and bright for others....without being in your face about it.....I really liked!!!! It is so nice to see a GOOOD movie....!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just left an early screening from "Warrior" and I hate to use puns but this movie is a First-Round TKO. Yes, the fight scenes are incredible but what really surprised me is how emotionally powerful this story and the performances are.Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton and Nick Nolte are spellbinding. There is not a dishonest moment in this movie and that is thanks to their fine work here. You heart breaks for both brothers, you understand what they're fighting for and you want them to win. It is not a spoiler when I write that, unfortunately, there can only be one winner and it is the final outcome that is truly the most heart-wrenching moment that I have seen in a film in a good long time.This film deserves any success coming to it, I think it will become a word-of-mouth sleeper hit, once people see what is undoubtedly the best sports movie since Million Dollar Baby. What a surprise! This is a must-see film.</fullReview>

The match was clearly a fixed one. Tommy lost it for the sake of his father and brother. It is clearly visible dude. And what was his father doing in a taxi in the end (out of the stadium) and he was back in the end....there is no meaning you dumb A**. It looks like director was throwing away like giving the audience some thing 'UNEXPECTED'. I am watching the MMA since years. Most dumbest thing was the makeup. Who is the idiot (makeup artist). Did he ever saw any of the boxing or sports movies...!!! Look at the ROCKY movies dude and learn some thing from them. makeup was so unreal. Any one who will be the head of MMA will never award the 5M to the winner of that match. But in the end it was nothing but Bull S#!t. I was actually ready to rate this movie 9/10 before watching it. But after watching I thought 6 is more than enough. I don't understand why makers of the movies think that always making something different would satisfy the viewer. Anyway's Tom hardy was awesome and brilliant with his high energy performance. This movie was almost a letdown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rocky Of Our Generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warrior is that rare, unexpected film that grabs you by the balls and doesn't let go. Sure, it's a tad cliché. It's beats are taken from most other fight movies about underdogs competing in a major fighting competition. However, it one ups the usual by presenting us with two men, brothers no less, who are both fighting for something worthy. This in turn creates one of the most memorable climactic fights of any sports fighting film ever. By far, this is the best film of it's kind since Rocky. Warrior is fairly typical of it's kind of film. Tommy is an ex-marine with both a heroic and shady past, as well as a bitterness for his family. These experiences have shaped him into a bitter and broken man who simply needs to fight. Brendan is a family man with financial woes and someone who also has troubles with his father, but wants to reconcile with his brother. Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy are fantastic in their respective roles and each is an equal contender to root for when it comes to their respective quests. Both have their fair share of issues with their pasts and their struggle to overcome their issues is channeled through their need to fight. When that time finally comes, the emotion behind the fights creates several powerful matches that are more than just entertaining fight scenes. It's through these two fine actors that we have such powerfully emotional fights. Nick Nolte is also noteworthy as the father, who receives both brother's scorn. It is hard to feel bad for the man after all you've learned about him, but one scene towards the end of the film leaves a feeling the gut that makes you pity him.All of the stuff before, however, leads up to one of the most emotionally satisfying fights in film history. Imagine the final struggle Rocky had to go through and multiply it by two. Now throw in some unpredictability and a ton of very personal emotion, and you have one incredible, climactic fight. I think it's no secret what fight this is, as the trailers have spoiled it, but for those who haven't seen the film, I won't say. I will only leave you with the fact that it is incredible, brutal, and very well put together. This isn't simply a fight for a championship and a purse, it's a fight with decades of history, and one that both these characters very clearly needed to go through. Suffice to say, anyone with a love for Rocky will enjoy this one. It's also nice that both characters are likable and easy to root for, making it very unpredictable.My biggest worry was the technical aspect. Most fight films of this kind tend to have some questionable filming. Warrior, too, had some. The unfocused shot here, the close up there, but for the most part it's all good, and there are some brutal and powerful fight moments here. There are some technical things I might question, namely in editing decisions. We get the cliché training montage, this time with an attempt to creatively display it by playing both brother's training off each other. We have all the emotional beats coupled with heart-tugging music. It's PG-13, so it's not surprising that the film opted for some more cliché and obvious emotional moments, but it's still fairly predictable. My biggest pet peeve are the moments that seemed a little too easy. Tommy, while a very troubled young man, seems to have far too easy a time in the ring, and it's simply not believable. The fact that we're only really privy to a couple fights he has doesn't make it any easier to swallow, no matter how entertaining. Likewise, despite his UFC background, the fact that Brendan can so easily defeat a man that is touted as nearly invincible is far fetched. At the point in the film it happens, you already know he HAS to win, so the question is how, but the simple fact we know it has to happen is a tad over the top. Not to mention that the man is twice his size and probably younger than him in several years.However, these are all minor complaints. Is Warrior as typical sports film? By all standards yes. But it's one of the best made. It takes the typical formula and throws a gigantic monkey wrench into it. If you love these kinds of films, or even simply like them, you owe it to yourself to see Warrior, one of the best films of 2011.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth seeing but prepare for disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were some very strong and emotional moments and again, it makes you look at yourself and your personal and family relationships. This is a very powerful movie in more ways than one. You'd think it's all about MMA and fighting and all that but that's just a subplot. There will be those similarities to The Fighter and they're justified. The difference is you already know exactly how Fighter is gonna end. With Warrior, the first 2 acts of the movie are perfect in almost every way. Gavin O'Connor is a very capable writer and director and I'll be peeping more of his work later. But the last act is what disappoints here because it goes from perfection to predictability. I'd love it if they'd have gone a different route to the happy ending than what they did here. It's pretty much cookie cutter and deviates from everything that came before it in regards to style and realism.There was a scene where Joel's character lied to his wife. He told her he was a bouncer when he was really fighting to make extra money. My problem with it is there was no consequence to the lying. They made it seem like it was no big deal because they needed the extra money the fighting brought in but a lie is a lie and it is a big deal because what if he'd gotten hurt or died? They already established that he got severely injured in a fight before and his family was struggling. What would happen to them if they lost his income and now had to cut and scratch to pay his medical bills in addition to the bills they already couldn't pay? There is no advantage to the lie he told in the movie and in real life, there's no advantage to lying to someone about something not worth lying about. He may have done it so his wife wouldn't worry but if he'd kept up the charade and things didn't go as planned or if she found out through other means, wouldn't that have been worse? This movie failed to show consequence and I want that to be known.On the flip side, the theme and some of the plot really revolves around the consequence of alcoholism. When you take a certain route in life, and it's a bad one and you know it, and you still choose that route, then you deserve all of the bullshit that comes from it. Nick Nolte played a recovering alcoholic and it fractured his family. As a result, he lost them. Circumstance created a chance for him to get back what he lost but that didn't happen and I applaud the filmmakers for that. A confrontation between him and Tom's character in a casino was quite strong. Tom carried a boatload of animosity and took it out on Nick. It was hard to watch someone take that kind of verbal abuse but at the same time, Nick created that for himself due to his past actions so it was hard to sympathize with him. My point is, when you make what's clearly the bad and wrong decision, you earned and deserve the consequence, and this aspect of the movie came through loud and clear.I really wish this movie didn't take the typical Hollywood route for its ending. Kurt Angle played a beast of a fighter yet he was defeated by Joel's character who wasn't built up to be a beast or a beast defeater. Nor was his trainer. Tom's character was. Nick was his trainer and he was too. Their path to victory was defined and believable. Joel and Tom played brothers and both had reasons for fighting and winning. That don't mean they should have pit them against each other in the finale. There could have been different plot devices used that could have led to one or both of them accomplishing their goal but not necessarily in the ring. Kurt's and maybe another character could have been used to make that happen. As it stands, as you watch the last part of the movie, you can see what's about to happen and you become disappointed because you went through all that good stuff, that great journey, only to be given what every other movie of this type gives.I'd hope there's an alternate ending to this with deleted scenes that tells a different last act because this movie could have been something near perfect and great. The story, the acting, the everything was great. Can't stress that enough. It's just the last act, man. It destroys a good thing. Gavin has a bright future ahead of him, that's for sure. I'd like to see him have the opportunity to do something unconventional and non-Hollywood. Something where his writing and directorial skills can shine properly if he's capable of it and I think he is based on this alone. Let the man tell his stories the way they need to be told, Hollywood, and that goes for all filmmakers who are being restrained by the system. Let's get America back to making respectable movies. Definitely go see Warrior and be completely entertained by the first 2 acts if you like dialogue, a slower pace, and solid acting but you've been warned about that last act. I give this 7 out of 10 stars. Woulda been higher if not for, well, you already know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Couldn't Carry Rocky's Jock Strap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Come on now. I was super excited to see this movie after all the glowing reviews. Let me check that. Unrealistic, false left-right paradigm, superficial emotions, contrived story, the one brother is vilified while the other is made a hero. Super predictable, no training sequences, cheesy Joe Rogan wanna be announcers, and average acting by the supporting cast.While Rocky was about an average man overcoming great odds with sheer determination who fought for glory there is nothing average about this crappy, super far fetched storyline. One brother, who is fighting under his deceased Mom's maiden name, is bitter who hates everybody and is so mean to his Dad that it causes him to break his sobriety of 3 years. Apparently his only friend in the core was killed in a friendly fire bombing (where he was the only one who lived) and he promised the purse money of the tournament his fallen comrades wife. However, she sells him out to the media who discover his real identity and then he faces a court martial after the tournament because he went AWOL after his friend died. Oh, did I mention on his way out of Iraq (apparently on foot) he walks into a battle, saves a life and becomes a war hero? The other brother is loved by everyone, especially all the 25 year old actors playing high school students where he teaches physics to cheer leaders. He is underwater on his house because his one of his daughters has a heart condition and needs the money to pay off the bills. (Not really sure what his wife did for a living.) Of course, the brothers relationship is estranged because of complications of their mothers death. The two meet in the finals after the marine brother wins 3 straight fights by 10 second knockouts. The other brother, who is always the underdog, pulls off submission upset after upset. Geez, I wonder who is going to win in the finals?Yawn. If this was supposed to be good, this is just another reason why I barely waster my time watching movies. It's fodder for the uniformed, discerning, zombie masses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***spoilers warning***This movie is the worst sport movie I have ever seen !!! where do I start !!! poor tomy! Wasn't enough that he had to leave home alone with his mother to escape his father, then had to watch his mother die and berry her!! He saw all his friends die in IRAQ and when he came back he risked his life (knowing that the army will know his place) just to win some money and give it to the poor widow !! he even went to his father who he hates just to get the money. On the other hand, his brother brandin screwed him and their mother at the last moment because he fell in love !!! he got the perfect life, wife, job and children!! He only needs the money so he doesn't leave his big home to a smaller one !!! Seriously !!!! brandin takes 5 millions at the end !!! and poor tomy and the widow got nothing !! it wasn't enough what he suffered for his whole life !! but also the army was waiting for him to take him under custody at the end of the movie !!! I really didn't get the point of it! Except that I think they wanted to say " don't underestimate the underdog" but they exaggerated a lot and delivered the message poorly!!the last fight was so cliché, tomy was superman knocking out every one with one hit and Brandin struggles in every game. at the end, guess who won?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are You Kidding Me!?!? This Got An 8.3 Rating!! This Movie Is Terrible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, no exaggeration at all here, but I am now on my 6th session of attempting to complete this movie, that is how bad it is. I could not even get through 30 seconds of it and figured I would be better entertained writing a review for this awful movie. This movie has nothing to it!!- Horrible plot, horrible acting, stupid fight scenes, lame touches (trying to fit real UFC fighters into a completely made up scenario/tournament/fighters etc..) and the list goes on. Everything is just awful. Just awful. I have been training in MMA and competed in wrestling for about 10 years now and this movie is so inaccurate it makes me sick. Its as if the producers and writers of this movie have never even watched a fight before in there life &amp; have not a clue about the sport. This movie is 100% just to excite viewers who have no knowledge of the sport, but a complete insult to fans. The fight scenes are just unexplainable and stupid. The fights are like if Amateur MMA and WWE, on steroids, had a child, who also took steroids, along with many other drugs, and then got in the ring. There are WWE "moves" used in this movie. They don't exist in the sport. Period. Enough Said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, OK I understand there is no such thing as an unethical movie. But this has to come as close to proving there just might be such an animal. Truly sickening moments of awfulness. Which the actual sport avoids. Apart from the pathetic storyline and seriously misjudged opportunities to make a watchable film out of this mess, we have to tolerate wound up sequences of empathy squeezing, drivel dealing moments that make you want to eat your head off.If you last long enough to eke out your miserable Saturday night life to the finale, the only question is why did you do it? You already knew how ridiculous the plot was. Did you continue out of curiosity? Or sheer terror at realising how bad movies of this genre have now become? The fight sequences are beyond disbelief. They are Disneyland. I could make a tougher movie with my cam. The director tries to make these leaden humans worse on film than even the worst movie monsters of all time, but with such hubris he fails to make them more threatening than blow-up dolls. Without the sensible gore of, say, a decent movie like Rocky, it is mere mind-numbing torture. And I like fight movies. This is the worst film of any genre I have ever ever watched. And that's saying something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The initial reviews floored me of this being a great movie.I'm not understanding the comparisons to Rocky, any of the Rocky movies.Story? You don't know what's going on for a main story line until the very end of the movie. Even then, it's extremely thin.You have one absolutely unstoppable brother, former Marine who destroys everyone he faces in the cage including a one punch knockout to one opponent. To face his brother, a slightly beefed up Conan O'Brien who's a teacher. I see mentions of Nick Nolte and an Oscar nomination, he's not in the movie enough, he has 2 major scenes, really.Also mentions that MMA fans will enjoy this, not true. The only lengthy fight scene had been at the end when the brothers fight, 3 rounds out of 5. Do yourself a favor, stay far away from this movie. Catch it on cable and then decide for yourself. This ranks as one of the worst movies I've ever seen and that is saying a lot!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Good Not Bad... Just OK :(</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is not much in this Mixed Marital art film but it is on the top end of the spectrum, good cast and script with a few well choreographed fights here and there but it's mediocre, not good nor bad, just mediocre which to be fair is the worst thing for films but as you don't get many of this type flying around so it does have its time in the spotlight which is more to say for most that just degrade and get watered down from their B movie titles.The story line, what can I say about this? To be frank every tom dick and harry has used this story in their films over the years so I don't know why O'Connor took it up but I guess it's one of those films that just make up the space between block-buster's, it's about two brothers Tommy played by Tom Hardy (Bronson) and Brendan played by Joel Edgerton signing up to a massive tournament of last man standing. They were both taught by their marine father played by Nick Nolte (who is good for the veteran with the voice on concert ) when they were younger so you already know that both men know how to fight.Tommy "Hardy" is just angry as Hell pretty much, not really a bit of back story in his character but from what there is you can understand him at least, ex-marine whose friend died in duty from friendly fire, and he promised to support his family, already trained to fight and with this 5 million payout and a mega tone of angry issues to release what's not to love? You also find out he saved a soldier's life while on tour so you get a certain feeling of pride for this guy.Brendan "Edgerton"? is a physics teacher who is behind on this payments and hospital bills, this daughter has a heart problem and he borrowed money to pay for his daughter's life and now the bank is threatening to take their home. Being an ex-fighter himself and doing what he can to scrap up money he slowly turns back to fighting and then goes for the 5 million pay out at the last man standing tournament.The whole film is built around them and their family problems which from what I gather is just the build up to the fighting with no real depth and real lack of explaining.There are four things that make a fighting movie and every one of them has them and they are:- 1.The reasons why they do it 2.The Training 3.The problems and issues they have to overcome 4.The final Fight.All in all its just a MMA version of rocky which really doesn't hold a light to it.I did enjoy it and Tom Hardy was pretty good in this film but it should of been a hell of a lot better</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warrior: a daft movie with a kick in the tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the past two decades, mixed martial arts (MMA) has become increasingly popular in America. The Brazilian Vale Tudo (anything goes) style was brought to the US in 1993 with the establishment of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). At first the tournament was designed to find the most effective martial art, but as the UFC developed competitors began to incorporate different styles in order to get the edge on their opponents. As a result, MMA, as it is known today, was born.While it began as a brutal cable-TV novelty, efforts to refine the rules, such as introducing weight classes and safety regulations, led to MMA finding acceptance in the mainstream arena. In recent years, pay- per-view sales of UFC bouts have even begun to challenge those of both boxing and professional wrestling.Of course, the next natural step in the sport's legitimisation was for Hollywood to immortalise MMA in a star-studded sports drama. Lo and behold, we now have Gavin O'Connor's Warrior, a clumsy and faintly ridiculous film which somehow still manages to tug at the old heart strings.Warrior begins in the grey streets of Pittsburgh. Tommy Riordan (Tom Hardy), an Iraq War veteran and all-round badass, pays his father Paddy (Nick Nolte) a visit. Tommy and his mother had fled their home when Tommy was a teenager, due to Paddy's alcohol-fuelled violence, and Tommy's mum died soon after. Returning to the family home, Tommy taunts his father about his past, but then, for no apparent reason, decides to stick around. Coincidentally, a new MMA tournament called Sparta, which promises $5million to its champion, has just been announced. Tommy decides to enter, and despite his supposed hatred of the man, enlists the help of his father, who used to train him in his pee-wee wrestling days.We are then introduced to Brendan (Joel Edgerton), Tommy's older brother who decided to stay with his father when Tommy and his mother left. A former UFC fighter, Brendan is now working as a high-school physics teacher and living in the Philadelphia suburbs with his wife Tess (Jennifer Morrison) and two children. On the verge of bankruptcy, he enters Sparta in order to pay back his mortgage and prevent the bank from foreclosing on his home.Not only is this a pretty flimsy preamble to the inevitable showdown/reconciliation between Tommy and Brendan, but these dual story lines are also painfully ill-conceived. Tommy's justification ? that taking his father on as his trainer is strictly business ? seems somewhat insubstantial considering his torturous childhood. Also, the fact that Brendan is clearly past his prime is glazed over by the claim that anything can happen in MMA. Nevertheless, the film casually skips over each of these gaping plot holes in order to get Tommy and Brendan in that ring together.At times, the plot seems almost insignificant as the film's constant promotion of MMA seems to suggest it is primarily designed to celebrate and legitimise the sport. Before entering Sparta, Brendan is suspended from his teaching job as it is discovered he is taking part in smalltown MMA tournaments. The principal tells him that, as a teacher, he 'doesn't belong in the ring with those animals', to which Brendan responds: 'I used to be one of those animals.' Moments like this seem to suggest that O'Connor is less concerned with making a believable drama than he is with challenging the sport's image as a brutal hobby.As the tournament begins and the fight scenes take centre stage, O'Connor provides some much needed relief from the shoddy backstory. However, while these intense sequences do indeed showcase the athleticism that the sport requires, it soon descends into shameless MMA propaganda which becomes tiresome rather quickly.But just as soon as you think that Tommy and Brendan are mere 2D vehicles to promote the sport, something strange happens: you find yourself caring about them. While Warrior takes some very cheap shots, using everything from alcoholism to the Iraq War to try to force an emotional response, in the end it is also a humane, soppy story.In much the same way that in Rocky, Sylvester Stallone produced a much better performance by getting his head bashed in than he ever could have under his own steam, the strained relationship between Brendan and Tommy only becomes truly heart-breaking when they're trying to knock each other out. While this by no means makes up for the plot's many faults, the occasional emotional intensity somewhat compensates for all the boorishness.Warrior is truly little more than an advert for MMA wrapped up in a lumbering and predictable storyline. But if you can be bothered to stay to the end, it still packs a punch.</fullReview>

Nick Nolte plays superb, in my opinion. He is an amazing actor, and gives great atmosphere in the scenes he does.I only knew the two actors playing the brothers very little, but they come across very true to their roles, very believable.For the first time in many, many years I was, literally, sitting on the edge of the couch, almost rooting for the guys when they were fighting.

		<shortDescription>Not as much in love with it as everyone else seems to be but there is still no denying that this is a great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall I believe that I still have some more issues with this movie than the average person seems to have. This is one of the most loved movies of 2011 and also critically it received lots of praise. And yes, it deserves most of this but that doesn't mean that I saw this movie as a perfect one.Let me just start off with giving the reasons as to why I still think that this is a great movie. Despite being, in essence, just like any other sports movie, or a movie with an underdog type of story in it, this movie still manages to work out as something refreshing and original. It's probably due to the very simple fact that instead of focusing on one main character and one underdog, it focuses on two. And not just two but brothers as well. It gives the story already a whole lot of depth and different dynamics between all of the main characters. It makes things all the more interesting by making the two characters almost total opposites of each other, even though they have the same blood running through their veins.The movie also does a great job of not letting you root just for- or pick sides with just one of them. Both main characters have their good and bad sides but ultimately they are both fighting for a just cause. In the end it really shouldn't matter to you who should win or loose the final fight, since you feel both will earn it to win.And just like the audience will be torn and be having a hard time picking sides, with just one of the main characters, so is the Nick Nolte character, who is the father of the two. He pretty much is the glue of this movie that connects both story lines to each other, since the brothers themselves are not really on speaking terms. But by saying this I'm probably making it sound like he is a good father but hey, it's Nick Nolte, so of course he's playing a rotten and washed up character, that never has been much of a father for neither of his sons, mostly due to alcohol abuse in the past. But that doesn't mean you can't care for the character. On the contrary quite really. Perhaps it's the most interesting and also most important character out of the entire movie. You can definitely understand why his sons want nothing to do with him but at the same time you also feel sorry for him and want him to make up for the things that happened in the past and you are hoping they all can be a happy family again, even though you know this is basically impossible to ever happen. Too much has happened in this family to accomplish that.After so much praise, how can I still have some problems with this movie? Well, I actually still had plenty of them to be honest.First of all the way the movie is build up. Sometimes the movie is too slow and sometimes things happen to fast. I don't know, I was just taken out of the movie by it a couple of times. At times I wanted the movie to slow down so it could focus more on- and go deeper into certain subjects and at others it was sticking too much to its drama. The first half of the movie can basically be seen as the drama part of the movie, while the second half is focusing way more on the the fighting aspects but not without its emotional and dramatic impact though. As a matter of fact, the final fight has the biggest and most emotional impact of the entire movie.Second of all, I actually though that the fight scenes got mostly poorly shot. What the movie was lacking were some good wide-shots at times, that could give you a better idea of what was going on exactly. Besides, it also was often way too short. I know MMA fights normally don't last that long, due to its intensity but that perhaps should have meant they should had gone for another fight sport instead. Also often the build up to the fights was lacking a bit at times, as did the emotional impact of it on the characters outside of the ring, or cage in this case.Another thing that I thought was seriously lacking was its musical score. Whatever went wrong with Mark Isham's career. He once truly was a promising composer but his score for "Warrior" mostly annoyed me and often didn't seemed to suit the movie at all.But obviously all of this problems still couldn't ruin the movie for me. Just thought I would share them with all of you, to also indicate that the movie is perhaps not as perfect as most people make it sound. It however still is a great movie of course and deserves to be seen by all!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film of the year....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film released parallel with Contagion. Contagion earned much more than Warrior. Contagion was also better than Warrior in critics mind. I watched both of them and realized the difference between these movies. Believe me if you'll watch Warrior too you'll be sure.When I have firstly saw the trailer? I thought that it'll be just a action-sports film. However I was false. Film is full of dramatical moments as well as the fighting scenes. Let me clarify and talk about the plot. It is about a three members of a separated family. Lonely father whose drinking and angry personality was the main reason for separation. Disturbed little brother who faced with tragedy in army after his mothers death. At last a big brother who had got married and had some material problems. The way of three people who are hopeless to unite again crosses in one place. One emotional and physical exam, fight. At the little brother arrives at forgotten father's house with a one desire, train him again as he trained his son in childhood. Reason for this desire was the was simple but touching. He wants to repair the injuries of the people who suffered from his fault. Big brother has another problems. He put big portion of his money to daughter's heart operation and now he is in the edge of losing his house. What he needs is money. When he decides to fight for earning money he faces with several problems both in family and in school(He is physics teacher). Soon those two brother will meet in the pursuit of the life for achieve their own points.The reason of Warrior's flop in the theatrical run can be explained with the decreasing interests on such drama films with poor but powerful star cast. It is fact that films made just on 30 million dollar budget and earned lesser than it's budget. However this film is Gavin O'Connor's best film so far. Furthermore, Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton and especially Nick Nolte deserves Oscars. Nick Nolte's acting is just amazing. I have not seen his another films yet, but I think that this film is his lifetime career's peak point. This film deserves to receive four academy awards including "The Best Picture of the Year". There are plenty of films that you can see many fighting scenes in it. There are also a number of films that touch your heart. However there are few films that can show you both of these artistic materials in it's highest level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Writer/Director Gavin O'Connor is a true rising star, and may be the next Ron Howard or James Cameron, but standing on their shoulders capable of more. His innovative cinematography and editing style is crisp and edgy and entirely real world, while his writing skill is truly extraordinary, and his ability to draw the best out of his actors is UNRIVALED in my mind. This is a tough mixed genre... maybe the toughest to direct. Too many interpersonal dynamics to expect believable scenes from start to finish, and far too many crowd scenes to ever expect believable moments, but somehow O'Connor brings the best even out of his extras, and without question, his crew. This is an amazingly raw and believable American tale that is a MUST See for fans of honest drama, Americana, great love stories, or great sport films. Above all, this is, in my opinion, all things considered the greatest sports related movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warrior is a good fight flick but might make you cry if you have daddy issues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Helloooo!! Just checked out this sleeper and it was OK. Cinematography and themes are similar to the fighter but the acting is no where near and the mma thing isn't as big of a deal as you would think. The main point of the movie is the effects of alcoholism on a family. Nolte is great as always as a former boxer and wrestling trainer to his sons. After years of drinking his family is torn apart. His two sons hate him and they all go their separate ways. One to war,,,One to a family. Through hardships in both their lives they turn to ring matches for financial gain. Thus a modern day kumite bloodsport style movie is born. Of curse its tapout mma stuff and not backbreaking action. The best parts of the movie are the scenes between Tom Hardy kicking some major ass and not showing emotion or he's making Nick Nolte feel like a complete p.o.s. for being such a bad father in the past. This is really a "BRO" movie. Some OK fights but pretty predictable. Redbox it up,,,,but could be an OK present for an mma fan that has daddy issues</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best sports drama film to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In every sports drama film, there is the underdog overcoming the arrogant champion, the washed up aging athletes seeking redemption and coaches who come up with a pep talk to boost the morale of the team every half time. In Warrior, it doesn't follow the traditions. The mixed martial arts tournament serves only as a backdrop to a broken family composed of two brothers and their father. You have the elder brother, Brendan who enters the tournament to save his home from foreclosure while the younger brother Tommy enters to make a promise to his fallen comrade by giving the prize money to the widowed. The father however, longs to redeem himself by reconciling with his children who also are...estranged. What's so unique about Warrior is that there is no clear protagonist and antagonist, it is about their own issues that they're up against, particularly Tommy who has this deep resentment towards his father and elder brother. It is a story about forgiveness and redemption from the sins of the past, I'm hoping that this film would get Oscar nominations. It's a highly recommended movie for the family and their teenage children as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film focusing on two main fighters in the same competition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside form the action Rocky (1976) and The Wrestler (2008) seemed to be more about the individual and their demons and while there are elements of that here it really focuses on the (dysfunctional) family drama. Of course it is going to get the obvious comparisons to The Fighter (2010) but I don't think it's a bad thing and that should really be taken as a compliment. I would not be surprised to see it picking up a few awards along the way too. Even if one was to compare the two I think Warrior stands up very well and having the film follow two fighters marks it apart. Like the fighter though the two leads are outstanding and worthy of all the attention they will receive for them. Performances are impressive across the board in fact and it's wonderful to see Nick Nolte back in the frame with a delightful role that he seems to slip perfectly into. (A sorry ex-drunk with a history of violence - apologies Nick!) As well as their acting performances the two main characters are to be complimented on their believable appearance as fighters with some impressive physique on display. Both of our fighters here are easily as believable as the muscled yet high pitched and whiny Wahlberg and certainly must have done a fair bit of training for the role too. Although that wouldn't really be a surprise for anyone that has seen Hardy in Bronson (2008) most will know him from his turn in Inception (2010) which is something completely different. Joel Edgerton too looks different from the roles I remember him in ? Kinky Boots (2005) and Animal Kingdom (2010) - as well as his Uncle Owen turn mean this is another impressive transformation.As much as I love this film there are a few gripes as there always has to be (sorry I've yet to find a 10/10 film!). Props to director Gavin O'Connor who also wrote the story and starred but the direction could have been a bit tighter and its not a movie where every scene is trimmed with a few wasted shots or lazy and obvious camera work. Although performances were all good some of the characters seemed to lack depth and I felt the wife (Jennifer Morrison) was a little underused as I thought Nick's role also seemed to be forgotten about in the final third. These are very minor quibbles but unfortunately the main one is that it's a product of its self - it's difficult for any film like this to avoid the cliché or cheesy ending. A film focusing on two main fighters in the same competition was always limited on outcomes and although Warrior does it's best I'm afraid the ending could have been handled a bit better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW : WARRIORONE LINE REVIEW : Cain and Able meet RockyRATING : See it in theaters. (rating system: "see it in theaters", "wait for the instant download", "don't waste your time")SPOILER FREETommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) is a former marine who has returned home to ask his father Paddy (Nick Nolte) to help train him for the upcoming Spartan Mixed-Martial-Artist fighting match. It's a single elimination brawl between 16 fighters.Meanwhile, Tommy's estranged brother, Brendan (Joel Edgerton) is facing bankruptcy and foreclosure. And to make matters worse, he is fired from his teaching job for moonlighting as a competitive fighter. Brendan enters into the Spartan competition despite his wife's opposition.But there is friction in the Colonder family. Paddy was a lousy father and a drunk which forced Tommy to leave home with his mother. The mother died when Tommy was just 16, so he is only talking to his father so that he can get the training he used to get from him as a kid. Meanwhile, Brendan has disavowed his father and will not talk to him.The characters are all in play... And we're off.I really enjoyed this film. If you're a UCF fan you will enjoy it. However, the fight scenes leave a bit to be desired. There are frequent cutaways and people walking through the shots. No doubt this is due to the fact that the actors did not do a lot of the fighting . Compare this to "Rocky" where Sylvester Stallone and his actors were actually boxing in his movie.But it's not all blood and punches. The pain in the hearts of the two brothers is evident in fine performances by Hardy and Edgerton. Nick Nolte as the recovering alcoholic father is believable and tortured. I was happy to see Jennifer Morrison ("House") as the wife in a more complicated role than we've seen in the past (although most of her scenes were underlit).I did walk away with one nagging question ... Who is the Warrior in this film?So, for great fight Scenes intercut with some sightly meaty relationships, I recommend you "see it in the theater."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My top 5 movies of 2011!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie at Kuala Lumpur City Center last month and it just shot into my top 5 list! Not much promotion for this movie as I recall, so its a sleeper hit this year.I first noticed Tom Hardy in Inception. He wasn't that tough-looking in it, so I had my reservation about him playing Bane in The Dark Knight Rises. Then I saw him in Bronson, so I was 50-50 confident that he can play Bane well. After seeing Warrior, I am 1000% confident he will break Batman's back next summer!!!! Sorry Bruce....I didn't really knew Tom Edgerton before, but his role in this movie really put him in my radar. His torn, in-dilemma character is one of the best this year. I'll give him Oscar for this one. You can feel the attachment to him. From being a normal everyday teacher, struggling husband to care for the family, to mixed martial arts' (MMA) contestant, I truly enjoyed the transition.There were not many MMA movies around, so for those of you who are sick of boxing movies, watch this one. The fight scenes not overly done, but very very intense, not just because of the choreography, but also because of the emotions involved.Can't wait to see Tom Hardy as 'the man who broke the bat' next year!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathtaking and outstanding!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I would like to say that I am not a fan of sports or fighting movies in the first place. Rocky did not interest me as that it just not my type of film and I have to say that I was reluctant to go and view this movie BUT.... I was extremely and pleasantly surprised whilst I was exiting the cinema after seeing this film. This movie is not just a movie for hardcore UFC fans but it is a movie for anyone who enjoys films altogether. The fight scenes that take place throughout this movie are brilliantly choreographed and they will take your breath away. The plot line is very well directed and the cinematography is outstanding in some instances |e.g the montaged training scene|. The actors did fantastic in their roles but I would have loved to see more of Nick Nolte.In conclusion. This movie was amazing from start to finish and will leave you wanting more when the credits start to roll. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Let me explain something to you: the only thing I have in common with Brendan Conlon is that we have absolutely no use for you." Warrior is brutal, emotional, and touching experience of family drama concept. In the bandage of sports and enjoyable powerful drama, it's very hard to resist this one. Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy gives an depth emotional and sympathy accordance to each characters background. Dazzling cinematography also from Masanobu Takayanagi, which successfully grab the feel and elegant fighting sequence.Gavin O'Connor finally got his masterpiece, it's funny when he decide to come out from behind the camera. OK, Warrior is 2011's heart stirring spectacle that you've to see anytime, anywhere, and any circumstances. Strongly recommended!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of 2011?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warrior tells the story of Tommy (Tom Hardy), a marine, who comes back from Iraq. He's angry at his father Paddy (Nick Nolte), for past actions, and refuses to forgive him, although he does train for a ultimate fighting championship called Sparta, in order to win enough money to help the ex-wife of his dead best friend to support her family. Meanwhile, Brendan (Joel Edgerton), a school teacher, has to live with his two daughters and wife Tess, and needs money to pay his house after a heart operation for one of his daughters pretty much stole him of all his money. He decides to enter an ultimate fighting championship called Sparta in order to make enough money to pay his house, and trains with one of his good friends. The brothers Tommy and Brendan will then realize that if they each win everything, they'll come face to face with each other, and both have their own reasons for winning and their own reasons for hating each other...I'm not going to lie, I was expecting this film to be really good, and it totally blew my mind away. Warrior is not necessarily an ultimate fighting movie. The fans of UFC type of fights (such as myself) will get their share of what they want, but they might have to be patient a bit and wait for the second half of the film. Instead, we seem to be abording different themes: Redemption, Forgiveness, Reconciliation, Brotherhood and Family, to name a few.The story is written in such a way that you cannot help but feel the need for both protagonists to win the ending fight. Sure, some might vote a little more for Tommy, others might root more for Brendan, but in the end, you don't want either of them to lose. Sure, the story might be a little unrealistic: Two unknown fighters training for barely a few weeks can outclass fighters who have been training for years for this tournament, but it's all done in a way that you end up forgiving it for that because of the ending.The ending fight is the best moment of the story. Most would think it would end in a cliché-type of ending, with both fighters winning or a draw or some type of bull$h!t!, but it's in fact much more profound and emotional than that. The actors play perfectly their role of torn people wanting to end their feud in the ring once and for all, accompanied to the sad sounds of ''About Today'' by The National. Nick Nolte is a terrific actor in this film, and I do hope that the Academy recognizes him with not an Oscar nomination but rather an actual Oscar in his hands. Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy's performances are both terrific, but I felt that Hardy outclassed Edgerton, perhaps not by much, but at least slightly. Hardy's confused and dark character is portrayed beautifully, and I do hope it could result in an Oscar nomination for the role.With that being said, I do believe Warrior to be the best film of 2011 so far (though be aware, at the time of this writing, I have not seen Drive or Moneyball yet). With enough beautiful, fighting to keep up pumped and cranked up, some emotional scenes that might make the toughest of men cry, and an incredible distribution, Warrior should definitely be nominated for the big Award in January. If you haven't seen this film yet in theatres, run to it now! Definitely buying the DVD when it comes out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Closer to Bloodsport than Rocky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) returns home after a tour of duty in Iraq and re-unites with his estranged father Paddy (Nick Nolte). Paddy is a recovering alcoholic who wronged the family in the past. Tommy is a former wrestling star and although he wants nothing to do with his father he recognizes that Paddy is a great trainer and asks Paddy to train him for a mixed martial arts tournament with a five million dollar purse.Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) is Tommy's older brother. He works as a school teacher but is having trouble making ends meet. Brendan is a former UFC fighter and when he hears about the five million dollar event he decides to try and enter it himself to save his house from getting foreclosed on.None of the family's members get along. Tommy and Brendan have not spoken for many years and Tommy feels as though he was deserted by Brendan. Both Tommy and Brendan hate their father because of his abusive alcoholic past. All of this tension comes to head when the two sons both reach the final and are forced to fight each other.I have to give Warrior credit for choosing to have the story revolve around the two brothers, they both have interesting back stories and you want them both to win. The problem is that one of them has to lose and that alienates some of the audience who won't like the conclusion of the film.I am struggling to not give too much away here for those who haven't seen the film but, for me this movie was somewhat like the Star Wars episode I the Phantom Menace. The most interesting character in that movie turned out to be the bad guy (Darth Maul) and instead of feeling elated when he died (sorry for the spoiler for that one person out there that didn't see Phantom Menace.) I felt more let down then elated. That's how I felt when I left Warrior. (No one actually dies in Warrior, this was just a metaphor for what I was feeling not actual events.)Thomas Hardy and Nick Nolte are exceptional in this movie. This is some of the best acting I have seen from Nolte since The Good Thief (2002). Joel Edgerton does a decent job as well but his character is really just a laundry list of movie clichés. He doesn't want to fight but he has to do it for the money, his wife doesn't want him to fight and there is tension in their relationship, it just goes on and on. It almost as if Gavin O'Connor just watched every movie ever made about the guy nobody thinks will win and used every gimmick to create Brendan Conlon.I know a lot of people are comparing this film to Rocky but I think a closer comparison would be Bloodsport (1988) with Jean-Claude Van Damme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Contemporary Fighter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I had first seen the preview for Gavin O'Connor's 'Warrior' I wanted to say that this is going to be a post - any idea we have ever had of any fighter from 'Rocky' to last years 'The Fighter' starring Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale. Now, after seeing it I'm not so sure if that statement holds the same amount of weight.This isn't your typical fighter. This is also a long distance sibling rivalry between Tommy (Tom Hardy) and Brandon (Joel Edgerton). The fighters trade their stories in the same way we've seen done in movies like 'American Gangster' and 'Brooklyn's Finest' only with different bumps in the road that are just as contemporary as threatening home foreclosures and trying to outrun demons, people have recorded and posted on youtube. American Gangster also made caring equally, for both characters so much easier, whereas in Warrior you really can't know enough about Hardy's character.In between these stories is another one about a father (Nick Nolte) trying to rekindle his relationship with these two fighters, but the most I really want to say about that is from the beginning of the film Hardy almost brought me to tears with his first monologue. The relationship Hardy has with his father is what makes his story so much better than his counterpart's. Until then, both men are in training for the main event Sparta that could possibly be fought against each other.With all of that, it takes about maybe an hour and twenty minutes to get to any real fighting. But I think O'Connor wanted to give us everything he had to offer in cinema before this pay-per view. A taste of what Hardy can do in that ring is given here and there throughout, but it isn't until Sparta do we see exactly what we have been waiting for. I don't really know how much more I need to say to tell you that this is what makes Warrior Tom Hardy's film.Man to man, Tom Hardy as Tommy, in O'Connor's 'Warrior' is the post apocalyptic beast that I have always wanted to be.Now, I can see why Christopher Nolan cast him as Bane in next summer's final installment to the Dark Knight series. And by 'Bronson,' Nolan probably knew this long before Warrior. However it's this one that showed me what Bane has in store for Batman next summer. For those that have not seen Bronson it will certainly show you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't love MMA; I like MMA and this movie was hands down the best movie I have seen in 3 years. Yes years. It is that good. Great acting, drama, plot, and back story. Amazing editing in the fight scenes. Riviting and gritty, sad and triumphant. Awesome patriotic hero side to the movie coupled with dysfunction and addiction. This movie is a true masterpiece. If I could vote this a 11 out of 10 I would. hope this gets the Oscar nod because it is without a doubt the best movie of the year. The audience in the theater including myself were cheering out loud in some of the fight scenes. It was great. Moving. I am a straight mans man and I actually had a tear come to my eyes in some of the scenes with Nolte and Hardy (in the casino) and also in the victory's in the cage. AMAZING MOVIE. Run, don't walk, RUN to go see it. You will be inspired.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awestruck Expected a good movie, got much more! Many blanks in storyline filled in so well with little dialog. Movie progresses without a pause, pulls you in on all levels. Emotions kept in check by the actors, run rampant throughout the audience. Movie is neither a "Rocky" nor a "Raging Bull," but more like the "The Great Santini" on emotional steroids. It tears at your heart and mind beginning to end! Nick Nolte seems out of his element and somewhat awkward, until his drunken scene hits a grand slam with the unleashing of unsaid demons sequestered in Hell for so long. Facial and body expressions painted under a veil of what seems a still frame filled with only the sounds of ones thoughts, brings a forceful turning point of a dysfunctional father and son (Tom Hardy) to accept and grant absolution in a confessional of a surprising embrace.The pi?ce de résistance is the powerful closing forcing the brothers (Hardy and Joel Edgerton) to confront the collision of love and hate in confines of a no win way-out. Superlatively carved out in graphic imagery, both the path and pain towards salvation is unmatched in modern film. As the brothers walk from the ring, the 1969 song "He Ain't Heavy... He's My Brother" by The Hollies most vividly comes to mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>transcends the sports movie cliché</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this movie, I had a hard time explaining why I like it so much. I don't like predictable movies, especially sports ones. I don't like movies that are full of cliché. Warrior is a sports movie that revels in the cliché. But I LOVED it.There are a few different reasons this movie stands out. First of all, the acting is ridiculously good. The two leads, Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton, were convincing not only as MMA fighters, but as three- dimensional human beings. And Nick Nolte is great as the brothers' newly sober father. Second, instead of being a sports movie, it's a good movie with a sport in it. If you went into this movie without knowing anything about it, you wouldn't realize it was a fight movie until about half an hour in. It builds up the characters perfectly, so that when they fight, the viewer is completely invested in them.And when the movie finally reaches the big tournament at the end, the fights are awesome. It actually kind of shows the different styles going into MMA, where one brother is just a giant physical force, while the other is more about technique. The scenes were a little too heavily edited for my taste, but I could ignore it because I was invested in the outcomes of the fights.I honestly can't think of many people that wouldn't like this movie. It didn't do too great at the box office, but hopefully word-of-mouth will get more people to see it this weekend.</fullReview>

I do not even enjoy watching fights and yet I found this movie fascinating to watch, because the fight scenes are about so much more than just the physical act of fighting, but more about what each brother is trying to accomplish through the tournament. One an atonement of sorts and the other trying to save his family's financial future, but in the end bringing them together in a much more valuable way then monetarily. Go see it!</fullReview>

This was the story of the "unsung" hero who served his country and passed down his unresolved issues from war to his family. I sat on the arm chair of the movie theater seat most of this movie. Each character's emotion will grab you and not let you go. It's almost like you can feel their finger nails (of emotion) digging deep into your skin. When the movie ended, it was so quiet in the theater. Like everyone in the audience was waiting for more. Thank you for the best movie I have seen in a long time. I will definitely go see again.

		<shortDescription>A Final Act with a Powerful Punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the best fighting scenes I've seen in a movie. As I watched, I found myself flinching with every blow, wriggling around in my seat delightfully enraptured during these truly epic scenes. They are by far the best part of the film, and that's saying a lot. All the actors are outstanding and the emotional build-up at the end is so fantastic and gripping, that it's hard to put into words. Granted, the first half is very slow and a little cliché. Once you get to the halfway point the movie SKYROCKETS. By the beautiful, heart-wrenching, touching, action- packed, magnificent, and overall EXHILARATING, final act, you'll have forgotten all that might have been possibly slow from the beginning, for you will be truly captivated. The final minutes will make you want to weep and cheer all at the same time. I've never seen such a huge take off in a movie as this one, for the second half is just plain brilliant. Tom Hardy is a machine in this movie, a ball of tightly wounded rage and hurt that his opponents unfortunately feel as he viciously unleashes it ALL in the ring. While his brother, Joel Edgerton, is more stable, still dealing with his own heavy problems as well, but like his fighting style, is thoughtful and deliberate in his decisions. I'm tempted to say these brothers make up your protagonist and antagonist, but then I would be sorely mistaken. You have your clear-cut hero, Edgerton the good-hearted school teacher trying to save his family and home due to financial troubles, and your ANTI-hero (most of the time my favorite characters in movies) Hardy, the dark, complex, and untrusting war "hero" that cannot let go of his tragic past from both war and his earlier home life. Both these actors carry the film, both equally engrossing, and their inevitable confrontation at the end is powerful, brutal, and breathtaking. Nick Nolte is especially engaging, playing the formerly severe alcoholic father begging for redemption from his two sons. (I sense a possible Oscar nomination for him) Overall, this movie is brutal while thoroughly uplifting and touching at the same time, and it is speckled with some surprisingly humorous moments. It creates quite a build up, and the ending trumps and exceeds all possible expectations. The fight scenes are BEAUTIFULLY choreographed and are, once again, some of the best fight scenes I've seen in a movie. If your not an MMA fan you will become one after this movie. If you are an MMA fan, you will lose your mind with delight during this movie. Overall, the first half may be hard to stay with, but the movie eventually transcends into a gripping, emotional, heart-racing, and brilliant tale of two brothers with stakes higher than you can imagine. This one will have you on the edge of your seat, whilst you hold back tears. Warrior is a must see.On one quick different note, if Tom Hardy's Bane is anything like he is in this movie, then Batman is sure in for a beating, because he is a MONSTER in Warrior. I cannot wait to see Hardy in The Dark Knight Rises for he has proved to be intriguing and captivating, while equally terrifying in Warrior. Seems like a great fit to me. :)</fullReview>

For dramatic effect it was a definite fail. Withoout giving anything away, I really miss the Rocky movies after seeing this 'must miss'. One of the things that really irritates is when filmmakers thrust the microphone right in the thick of special effects and seemingly completely remove it during vital conversations. It implies that the audience suffers from a complete lack of imagination on their own and deem it necessary to supply it for them through loud special effects. I don't recommend this movie to anyone who wishes to be entertained for 2+ hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All the clichés ever thought of - and occasionally good fighting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all - this is mostly a drama flick. If you disregard the "MMA" part of the movie, it becomes a cliché drama with all the stereotypical family problem scenarios Hollywood has to offer.Then, looking at the fighting - there clearly isn't very much MMA in it. The moves pulled by the two main protagonists often don't make much sense. A lot of energy wasted for very small damage. And when someone weighing 70-80kg lifts 120+ kilos worth of "panzer fighter" after a 20 second choke-clinch... Well lets just say its not a believable scenario.I did like the actors performances though the plot was too cheesy.So, disregarding the fighting - a 6/10 cliché flick. With fighting 4/10, because if you actually sit and think about what happens you can't agree with the way things go in Warrior.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Just a Guy Movie, Quite Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to be honest, I was not looking forward to seeing this movie because I have never been interested in boxing or arena fighting of any kind, but this move is so much more than a cage fight.Right away you can see the tone of this movie from the steel yards of Pittsburgh and the grayness of Pennsylvania in the first scene. The cinematography is great because there is s much symbolism and depth to the visuals.My favorite scene is the final fight because it is so emotional and I cried so much. The music in that scene is also amazing because it really adds a deeper quality of emotion. When the movie first started, I thought I would give it 2 stars because I was expecting a typical boxing movie, but now I give Warrior 4 ? stars because it is so amazing.This movie is for 13 and up because although it's just a movie, the fighting is so realistic and graphic that it does a little disturbing. This movie is definitely not for everyone, but if you're looking for a deep emotional movie, or if you're in to MMA fighting, Warrior is perfect for you!

		<fullReview>Okay, you've seen most of this movie before...Rocky, The Fighter...most movies about families reconciling through a championship fight. But beyond that familiarity, this movie delivers an emotional powerhouse. Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton (both non-Americans) delivers believable and memorable performances. You will most certainly find yourself rooting for both characters (despite their faults). The MMA fight are vicious and brutal, despite not being too graphic. Nick Nolte also does a fine job, although he may be a bit over the top for some people. Jennifer Morrison does an adequate job, despite being little more than the "wife" character. See this movie for Hardy, Edgerton, and the fights, and you will not be disappointed. The end may seem a bit forced and rushed, but I dare you to not feel moved by the end of this film. It thrives on emotion and delivers as a family sports film. Go see it in short.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To begin with, i had this movie for about a month before and i really didn't expect much from it other than the usual action packed fight scenes kinda movie but i got bored 1 day and not having anything to do, i decided to watch it after all and boy was i in for a pleasant surprise. this movie literally blew my mind.It was excellent in every sense. the acting was on point with all the main characters and everyone involved in this movie. the dramatic aspect of it also took me by surprise when i found myself on the verge of tears a couple of times through out the movie. the story was very well thought out and explaining everything without flaws as the movie unfolds and some of the dialogue were just brilliant to say the least.I must say some of my favorite moments though were the commentary during the fight scenes...very clever wise cracks there by the commentators.This movie just made it into my top 5 movies of all time if not top 3.I recommend this movie for anyone that simply appreciates good movies.AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It has it all, from the brilliant script, direction and acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Check out the official site of the movie, maybe read a few reviews, note the all around critical acclaim and top rating for this movie; all of it is deserving. I was hoping for a good performance from Nick Nolte because I'm a steadfast fan, but I was not sure if Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton could make a good match with Nolte. They outdid themselves; they performed with the skills of veterans, not overreaching and maintaining their respective character's persona. Nolte was obviously perfect for the part; Hardy is far more versatile than I knew (I've seen several films in which he was supporting actor) and Edgerton did hold his own, not weakening the top tier cast (I'm not yet a fan, so am slightly reserved in my praise). The supporting cast, talented and hot looking Jennifer Morrison in particular, did as fine a job with her role as Amy Adam did in 'Fighter', and the rest helped make this movie as good as it is.The script was very well done, going by the result on screen; I'm sure writer/director Gavin O'Connor was investing all of himself in this project and he has every reason to be proud. This is drama as gripping as the first 'Rocky' and last year's 'The Fighter', better even, given it's not based on a real life story. I think the lack of budget for marketing and publicity may be the reason it did not fare as well as it should have at the theater box office; so buy it, or rent it and have your friends do the same. They won't be disappointed one bit.</fullReview>

It brings out so many different emotions and all at once.A father...brother...wife...coach...all deeply rooted on to the plot. It will make you cry , shout out in excitement and the background score is good too. I felt that this movie is not about the fight sequences but how they bind the people involved together, their relationships with each other. For fight lovers it also has the correct mix of intense fight sequences. Simple storyline....wonderful depiction...tremendous acting...cudos to all the film crew !!!!

		<fullReview>This is the best movie about MMA fighting. It is definitely not better than "The Fighter" or "Rocky". I wish it was the best but it wasn't. I'm sorry. Where did it fail? The weak script is partly to blame. Go back to "Rocky" and see what made it a classic. There's not enough establishing wide shot to make it a classic. If you watch spielberg's movie than you know what i'm talking about. The first half was good. But the second half started to play like a music video right up to the brothers duel. Not enough clever and powerful dialogues to fill the last 30 minutes. Even the fight announcements from the ring masters would help. Its just too silent for me towards the end. So that emotional ride for me got lost. A little bit more wide shot of the actual fight would be contribute would make it more real. See "rocky" and "the fighter" All in all a very good job! Make the sequel a classic please !! yay</fullReview>

But the great soul of Brandon for his family made him winner. That is how the life treats people who has reasonable desire to win. I will be always Warrior in my life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie expecting very little. I must be honest, I was expecting some dumb brainless action flick that would only really excite the fans of UFC. More modern day Bloodsport than Rocky. I couldn't have been more wrong. At the core of this movie is a real heart. It's so touching to watch the lives of the three central characters and the demons that they face played out so expertly by the three leads. Whilst undoubtedly Tom Hardy will take a lot of the plaudits from this movie for making what could have played as a petulant unforgiving brat a likable and fragile monster, Joel Edgerton is equally as impressive as the father fighting for his family. His quiet presence adds weight to every scene he is in. Nick Nolte gives his best performance in decades as their father and come awards time he will be unlucky not to get some nominations. The fight scenes all looked pretty good to me (I confess, I have never seen UFC) and the drama that was racked up in a story that was only ever going to end one way is a real testament to the director. Great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good, The Questionable, The Bad and Why... Warrior</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good - Not much. Yeah right! Where do I begin, this is a movie about a family and how fighting (MMA) affects their lives. Honestly, do not be misled by the title, while fighting is a part of the story this really is a movie about family. From the offset and from the trailers we know two brothers will be doing battle for money in the mixed martial arts arena. It sounds like a cheesy 80s movie but it is far from it. What makes this movie work is the fact that we come to understand how this dysfunctional family comes to fight for money. That's the core of the story, two brothers with history who can only settle it in one way. I won't say which brother wins but it is one hell of a thrill ride to get to that point. But more importantly this is a movie that just works, and I have to tell you it is an Oscar worthy story.THE QUESTIONABLE - to some, some parts of the movie may be a little slow but there are slow parts to every movie.THE BAD - Not much. But for real this time...WHY do I give this movie an 8/10 IMDb style or a regular 3 and a half out of 4 stars... it's just a darn good movie. If you're an MMA fan or any kind of sport enthusiast you have to get a certain thrill after watching the conclusion to an epic match. That's the feeling you will get after finishing the "Warrior".</fullReview>

The cartoon character villains are quickly dispensed with in the cage. Excellent performances all around. Nick Nolte may have been trying too hard for a supporting actor award. A written and directed by situation may be why the movie runs well over two hours.Sports movies are a tough sell. This one deserves to be seen by a wide audience. If nothing else it proves there is an alternative to resolving family issues besides Dr. Phil. You'll cheer, you'll cry and enjoy the experience.</fullReview>

Tommy(Tom Hardy) a former marine, with a big chip on his shoulder, returns to confront his father(Nick Nolte), who used to be a drunk, While training at the gym, Tommy spars with an upcoming UFC fighter, and puts him in his place. Tommy gets an offer to become a UFC fighter,and asks his father to be his trainer. But how will it come between the two brothers? I lot of training was put in this movie and the effort really shows, it had a lot of intense fighting. Tom Hardy was amazing, his performance was almost Oscar worthy, and he does a great Brooklyn accent, you'll forget he's actually British. Now Joel Edgerton was alright, but his performance was quite boring compared to Hardys. Nick Nolte was mesmerizing has there former drunk father, who is trying to connect with his two sons, I hope he will not be missed by the Oscars. A great film, almost as good has The Fighter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say I really enjoyed this film and I'm not into movies about fights. I don't get why people in the academy always love them but this one is really amazing. It doesn't have many dialogues but Tom Hardy's performance is outstanding. I wanted to cry during the final fight. But I have to be honest and say that I have a weird relationship with my older brother and that's why this one hit me hard. Feeling like your older brother bailed on you is not something you can easily forget and Hardy portrays that so well. But then again, it happened the same with "The fighter" because at the bottom is the same dynamic the most important part of the movie; but the latter has more substance and the only reason why I don't say it is better than this one it is because it had Mark Wahlberg in it.And this one has a Conan O'brien look alike :)</fullReview>

And then carves a niche for itself with its brilliant performances and human connect.What i really liked about the film was the camera work...it teleports you wonderfully closer to the actors making you feel you are a part of that moment living with them!

		<shortDescription>Nick Nolte Deserves an Oscar Nom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface, Warrior is about MMA and UFC fighting, but this takes a back seat to the gritty emotion of the relationship between father-son and brother-brother (Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton). As back story, we have a family that has crumbled at the hands of an alcoholic father (Nick Nolte), who nowadays is mature and sober (and listens to Moby Dick on audio book). Joel Edgerton may have a more enticing story playing the older brother who gets suspended from his normal science teacher job for fighting MMA, but the hardcore way Tom Hardy portrays an ex-Marine beast is undeniable. You will most definitely root against him, but the stronger your hatred towards Hardy, the more you have to applaud his amazing performance. Of course, Nick Nolte takes the cake. In a scene that reads "Oscar Nom" all over it, the type of scene that Oscar people salivate over, we find the mature, 1,000 days sober father in a hotel room drowning his sorrows. With empty bottles strewn across the floor, Moby Dick piping through the headphones, Nolte is drunk as a sailor shouting, "Ahab! You stop the ship! Ahab! Stop the Ship!"</fullReview>

They "were" a family, and in the end, they finally became a family again.Dad was great in that he was remorseful and trying to make up for what he did, but like Tommy said, "What was done was done. You couldn't change that." Dad later collapsed but the tension with Tommy eased after that.As for Brendon, he showed responsibility at the brink of bankruptcy, the heart of a champion and the care for his family.The movie ended in a very good way, and with all the fight scene and conflicts between the three main characters would stick every moviegoers till the last scene.</fullReview>

Typical things we associate with a soap opera or Hollywood superficiality. Nothing honest and real, more contrived.What one really misses in the last fight is two players giving their best and fighting out like two competitors, in the end acknowledging the best performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Warrior" is a f**king great movie, full off cage fighting action, emotional family drama, and great performances.Warning ? Possible spoilers ahead! Some will no doubt unfairly compare "Warrior" too last years success "The Fighter," because off the fighting element and the story evolving around two brothers and their families. I personally think the plots off these two movies are completely different. In "The Fighter" the main character had been putting up with his dysfunctional family for years, while here the two brothers (and father Nick Nolte) haven't spoken for years, and the film is more about their reconnection. Plus with the brothers in "The Fighter," you had one fighter and one the loser junkie trainer, while here both brothers are in the ring, and end up fighting each other for the championship in an exciting finale.The story gradually builds up too the action making us feel as if we know these characters before they finally take part in the fight. I think what is so great about "Warrior" is that I wasn't entirely sure who too root for in the final fight, where there is usually one who is clearly going to win.Both leads are excellent, and its awesome too see the always promising Tom Hardy play another bad ass tough-guy like he did in "Bronson." The tears in the film come from Nick Nolte though. He is in a smaller part, but surely rivals "The Fighters" Christian Bale with his emotional performance here.</fullReview>

Making choices that will affect the rest of their lives two brothers must find and drive to their own destinies in two different ways but to a very common ground! One brother a family man who is trying to keep it together, and the other a war time hero just trying to keep a promise while carrying a huge chip on his shoulder.

		<fullReview>'WARRIOR': Five Stars (Out of Five) Mixed martial arts gets the 'ROCKY' treatment and what a film results from it! Although this film centers on two 'Rocky' type protagonists whom are both brothers. As a result of that added dynamic the movie is as much about family drama as it is about fighting and overcoming inner demons. Being that the story is about two brothers on parallel journeys, while both fighting their way through an intense fighting competition, sets it apart from the other fighter/sports films and really makes it a truly emotionally rewarding and unique film going experience. The fact that there is no traditional antagonist, other than the other brother, makes it a powerhouse film going experience as well. It leaves you with a K.O. blow, in terms of movie magic and you really wont know what quite hit you (until you've had time to think about it). The film stars Joel Edgerton (a popular Australian actor who's known for such critically acclaimed films as 'ANIMAL KINGDOM' and 'THE SQUARE' as well as playing Owen Lars in the last two 'STAR WARS' films) and Tom Hardy (an English actor best known for playing Eames in 'INCEPTION' as well as being cast as Bane in Christopher Nolan's next 'BATMAN' film) as the brothers, Brendan and Tommy Conlon. Brendan is an ex MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) fighter who now works as a high school physics teacher. Due to his daughter having heart difficulties he's now in a heap load of debt and unable to support his family despite the fact that his loving wife Tess (Jennifer Morrison) also works. Brendan's secretly gone back to fighting, in strip club parking lots mainly, against Tess's wishes and when he's busted by the school he works for for it he's forced into returning to the sport more seriously, including entering a big MMA championship with a huge 'winner take all' cash prize. Little does he know his brother Tommy (an ex-Marine and high school wrestling champion) has returned home to Pittsburgh and taken up the sport as well. He's also enlisted the help of their alcoholic father Paddy (Nick Nolte), whom both had broken contact with, to coach him (as he did in high school). Tommy has a strong dark side and is definitely battling some depression and heart wrenching past memories. The two brothers haven't spoken in decades and Tommy still holds a grudge against his brother for, what he sees, as abandoning him and his mother all those years earlier. The two fight their way through the championship on a parallel course into an obvious collision. The film was directed and co-written (along with Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman) by Gavin O'Connor (the man behind such films as 'TUMBLEWEEDS', 'PRIDE AND GLORY' and another heartfelt sports drama 'MIRACLE', oddly none of which I've seen!). The script is richly written with strong thought out character development and realistically honest emotional drama. The issues of alcoholism, an abusive father and brotherly love turned to bitter dispute are all very real and common issues and there's not a tad bit of contrivedness here in my opinion. The directing when dealing with these issues is subtle and poignant and the fight scenes are so emotionally heartfelt as a result of it (as well as some of the most spectacularly awesome I've seen in a film). The acting to top it off is astonishing as well. Edgerton, Hardy and Nolte are all exceptional in the film and all three give what could be their best performances. Nolte is so lovable and sad and knowing his monstrous past leaves the viewer somewhat emotionally confused and feeling deeply sorry for the whole situation and everyone involved. Hardy is more of a dark and troubled antihero; we relate to his struggles but the monster he constantly unleashes leaves the viewer split on how to feel about him as well (it makes for some pretty cool fight scenes though). Edgerton is the more traditional underdog hero movies like this are known for, there's nothing too deep or original to his character but he still carries the whole heart of the film on his shoulders and he does an amazing job at it. All the parts are as great as the whole and the film is an epic masterpiece in my opinion. It does live in the same league as 'ROCKY' and all the truly great cinematic sports/fighting films and should be long remembered and revisited as an inspirational classic.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pEuD61SPG4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I could make one admonition to anyone reading this it would be to go to this movie with an open mind about the sport. You don't have to be a fan of MMA to like this movie, heck, you just don't have to hate everything related to it to be able to enjoy this masterpiece. The interpersonal relationships displayed in this film are presented impeccably and with such precision that you cannot help but care about the results of every action through out. If you can watch this movie without building an emotional tie to at least one of the characters, then maybe your life has been to easy and you need to take a walk to the other side of the tracks and let this movie open your eyes to the complexity and development of unconditional love. Warrior leaves the question to the audience as to who the title is attributed and it is definitely something worth thinking about. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and recommend it with my highest regard to anyone looking for more than cliché fight scenes and high school drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a feel good movie, and awful camera work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big UFC fan and have started to watch all the MMA movies I could find. I went into watching this movie completely ready to enjoy the story line, the fight scenes, and whatever other magic this film would have to offer. That is, I was ready to like it. Well, sad to say, this movie disappoints on many levels. It starts out fine, with good character development, the hint of some intrigue, the modern theme of foreclosure, and it seems like the movie will be good. The problem is, the way the story unfolds, it definitely is not a feel good movie. Of course, it's obvious to everyone where it's headed, so that's another disappointment - there is no surprise as to how the tournament will turn out, except for who will win. Ultimately, I expected some sort of resolution where both guys win - meaning, one guy wins the fights, yes, but both guys come out winners in real life. The director does the best he can to get to that conclusion, but I think it's just yucky by the end. How can I really feel good after seeing the final fight? Not knowing how the prize money, which has good intentions for both guys, will be used or split? Of course, there had to be the brother reconciliation, that was to be expected, and that part was OK. The two things that really made this movie a stinker are these. The MMA scenes are awful. Just terrible. Why? The camera work! It's dizzying, moves way too fast, there is never any focus, and it all just feels, well, not even frenetic, just like it was the best that could be done to splice together bits of the acted fighting to make it feel intense and high action. I had to look away for parts of the fight because the camera work was so bad, and certainly, you get no sense of what is developing in the fight. Of course, they can't show even a full 5-minute round, but the editing down to what it ended up with was terrible. Then, the final part where one brother gets injured badly - forget it, right then and there, it's just pointless. At least if they'd ended the final fight at the 3rd round at that injury, there would be a semblance of reality in terms of how MMA fights really wind up. The second thing, now, is that everyone kept saying this was the next Rocky feel-good underdog movie. It wasn't. The reason being, by the time you get to the final fight, the whole lead-in is awful, and you feel conflicted knowing brothers are going to fight. How does that feel good? Of course you know why - because the brothers will reconcile. So there should be triumph. But there isn't, not to me. And how could there be? One brother has to lose, and he gets devastatingly injured in a very similar fashion to the way that Antonio Nogueria was in real life (granted, that was after this movie was released). Rocky feels good at the end. Rudy feels good. This movie does not. I usually feel very confident relying on IMDb movie review ratings, and I could see this coming in at 6.5 to 7.0, but no way it's 8.3 in my book. If you're an MMA fan, and if you have any expectation of a feel good Rocky type movie, forget it. This movie turns out to be quite disappointing. Better: Never Back Down 2. That movie isn't as high production quality, but it's better overall to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love movies of all kinds regardless of their age. 2011 so far has been a very hit-and-miss year, luckily alongside Drive and The Tree of Life(though both won't appeal to all) Warrior is among my favourites of this year.Warrior is a well made and directed movie, with lighting that consistently fits with the mood and cinematography that is skillful and intelligently used. The dialogue was thought-provoking and written with vigour and heart, the fight scenes are incredible feeling both authentic(you can smell the sweat and feel the tears) and harrowing and the story for me was absorbing and hit me hard emotionally.The characters are fully credible too, and the wonderful performances help. Tom Hardy is outstanding in one of his best performances to date, and Joel Edgarton is every bit his equal, but Nick Nolte is a sheer delight and comes close to stealing the film on several occasions. The climax was very exciting, and while the film's end is rather inconclusive, everything else is so good you don't care so much.In conclusion, fantastic film and one of the best of the year. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to an early screening of this movie with my bf and all I can say is this is my favorite movie of the year. It's poignant and entertaining with lots of action in the second half.We follow two brothers who enter the ring for different purposes with different style of fighting. The question is who will take it all.I don't know much about MMA fighting but Warrior really hyped me up. I couldn't stop flinching or jerking during the fight scenes cuz they look so real.Overall, Warrior is a must see. I'm so glad I watched it. The only problem I had was the length of the film. It was over two hours long. Although, it did felt necessary in order for us to understand the characters vividly which allows me a reason to root for them. And the finale -- perfect!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, i will start off by saying that I'm a Marine, so the second I found out that one of the fighters was a Marine, i had to go watch the movie, not expecting a lot I must admit, since all these Boxing and Fighting movies now a days aren't that great. Well i did get a lot more than what I went for, definitely worth a trip to the theater.The movie kept me on the edge and cheering every time Tommy was in a fight ( like if I was actually watching a real UFC event lol ) .. and even made me sing the Marine Hymn in one of the fights! Anyway, the movie is really good, you can go watch it with your buddies or with your girl and it will still be good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most intense movies ever ....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a fan of MMA but I am sure that its history is much less than WWE. While a lot of people watch and follow WWE just because of its story lines and "acts", MMA fans usually watch MMA fights for real fights. Fights are real and the outcome at times could be between life or death. The intensity behind and beneath its fights should be portrayed much more than WWE matches. Warrior delivers the intensity up to the maximum level it possibly can. I do think fight scenes are good enough. Obviously if you haven't watched MMA in your whole life, you need to be with someone that at least can tell you the rules. I was with my wife and she is definitely no fan of MMA, boxing, WWE, etc...and I explained to her the difference between MMA, WWE and Boxing. The acts are great. I will be shocked if I don't see some Oscar nomination. One of the story lines is everyday - unfortunately for these days - life of many of us. The other story line at least from my point of view needed more information. It was good to see both sides of a human being in his life however the story doesn't give you time to feel close to the character,when he does something heroic and when he runs away. When I saw that Warrior came out 3d in box office, I thought people might be biased toward a movie about MMA - and many may say wth is MMA - so I decided to get the review out. Once again it's an INTENSE movie so if you are on a date and looking for a romantic movie definitely it's not recommended but if you want to see why and how some people go to the CAGE to FIGHT for a GOAL, this is definitely a movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performance in an unbalanced movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I have mixed feelings about this movie. All 3 lead actors give a great performance. Not Oscar worthy, if you ask me, but Nick Nolte MIGHT be nominated, as this is his best acting in years and kind of reminds me of James Coburn in "Affliction (1997)" (with Nick Nolte, incidentally) - a performance that I felt was less deserving of an Oscar than his performance in "American Gun (2002)". Tom Hardy, who I came to appreciate since seeing "Bronson (2008)", is great as usual and Joel Edgerton was hard for me to judge, since I'm not really familiar with his work (although as I now check IMDb, he was great in "Smokin' Aces", just like the rest of the cast there).The movie feels like two movies, quite different in tone, that were mixed into one movie, like a big salad. The first half of the movie elaborates on the background of the dysfunctional family and its inner tensions. The director handles the story very well, with low-key approach (I especially liked Hardy's - how his character was written and how he played the part) and gives the actors a great opportunity to show us a great performance.That is why I was so let down by the second half. The disappointed starts sharply with a cliché montage of training. It's like we've never seen "Rocky" before. Not only is the story completely predictable, but you get the usual scenes that were done in so many "fighting movies" before: Insertion of "pre-recorded" crowd reactions (that completely break the flow of the fight), a wife that covers her mouth at least 6 times and commentators who are always surprised.It's almost hard to believe that the two halves of the movie were directed by the same person. I can say the same about the Tess character/actress: It was written/acted pretty well in the first half, but was completely lowered to "cliché level" in the second half.The fights by themselves were directed well. It's just too bad they had to contain all the flaws I mentioned above, which ruined the enjoyment a bit (I blame both the director and the editor).All in all, the film is enjoyable. Watch the first half for a good drama and the second half for a cliché fighting story.5/10 Recommended</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes it was very good movie. Very best in fighting categories. But i want to add something disturbed me. Lets see;First take Tommy. He is a tank. Literally. A mean his body , his power he almost unstoppable. He wins all match nearly don't take any punch or kick except final. He beat up all his rivals like a super hero. But he hate his father and brother so he became bad person in scenario. The topic i really understand is , tommy end up with his brother like they hate each other since ever, why scenarists trying to show us? A mean to what end ? This is the weak part of the movie.Second take Brendan. He is family guy and broke. And he is old and considering to his rivals, he is nothing. He taken beat every match and he wining all of them by some tactics.Another weak part of scenario is the tommy didn't use all his power on his brother somehow. Brendan take huge beat from tommy and he have still power to strike back, and miracle happens for Brendan win the match and emotional end with "i love you tommy". In the end if anyone like rocky series must see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the worse movie I've ever seen, but it didn't have enough action to hold my attention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler alert: this review will spoil not only Warrior, but possibly a few other movies. And off we go I understand the irritation with Warrior trailers, really I do. The first time I had a real issue with spoiler trailers was with Just Like Heaven. Yeah yeah, chick flick and all, but the first trailers made it seem a little interesting. Who is this mysterious ghost woman? If you go to a lot of movies, later trailers reveal that she's in a coma somewhere. Seriously? That's amazing, now I can save a few bucks/hours. Corpse Bride followed the same annoying trend ? mystery, less mystery, oh what they heck here's the whole movie. Warrior definitely lost an element of tension, but I didn't feel like it took too much away from the film.Warrior follows the lives of two brothers (who end up fighting each other for the championship!) ? one is an ex-Marine, appearing under mysterious circumstances and an absolute animal in the cage, while the 2nd was a mildly successful fighter turned teacher who has to go all the way to save his house, pride, and pretty Blond Doctor wife. Add gravely drunk Nick Nolte as the vaguely abusive father, and we've got our cast. The two are fighting for noble reasons, but in the end, only one brother may leave the championship that match that they are certainly going to fight against each other. Did I mention ? THEY'RE BROTHERS!?I wanted to see this movie for two reasons only: Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy. Edgerton is part of the award-winning Blue Tongue Film collective and Tom Hardy is kind of insane but a fun actor. The problems started early with Tommy's (Tom Hardy) brooding homecoming with his father. This first and very emotional scene could have been a great start to an action/drama, but it had an awkward vagueness that plagued every scene throughout the film. Tommy's father did something, but they don't come out and say it. His brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton) uses the same language ? "Yeah, phone or letter ? after that THING you did." What thing? What did he do? Tommy and Brendan finally meet/argue/hash in an amazing chance meeting on the Atlantic City beaches before their big fight and they too argue about that plan that Brendan didn't follow through on WHAT PLAN? I've got to imagine it's as ridiculous to watch two people argue about as it would by to attempt that kind of thing in real life. I think I'll pick a fight with my wife about something I didn't like, but never actually come out and say it. I might be The Sad Man tomorrow, but it could be fun.There were a host of other problems with this film ? pacing, edits, the entire believability of any actions, the premise that anybody can lose their house these days after a few late payments ? but there was one redeeming aspect ? THE FIGHTING. I'm not an MMA fan, but I do like well shot action. Every moment in the ring was intense, chaotic, and made you feel every massive hit. The sound design reinforced the brutal beat downs that Tommy administered and Brendan received. I've had the chance to sit 2nd row at an MMA event, and even that close, it's just a bunch of slappy-sounding hits and grunting. Warrior gave us what we really wanted ? bone-crushing hits, flips, tosses, and general mayhem in the ring. The intense, sweat and emotion laden choke-out at the end of the championship match could have been the most amazing moment in cinema history given all the great action, but I had laughed at the drama far too many times take it seriously at that point.What went wrong? I think Warrior had the several writer problem like Cowboys &amp; Aliens. Too many writers, too many plot lines vying for attention. My good friend Ryan pointed out that the story should have been told from one character's point of view. It never had a focus and tried to cover too many perspectives at a time. Lose the 90&#x2032;s high school kids, lose the wife with no convictions, cut some of the drawn out scenes, and you might have a movie.While not the worse movie I've ever seen, it didn't have enough action to hold my attention for the nearly two and a half hour runtime.</fullReview>

I have to say that i really liked the movie(excluding the ending). I thought Tom Hardy and Nick Nolte both gave a very effective performance and the movie dealt with some very heavy emotions and connected with the audience fairly well. How ever the movie does get a bit "over the top" in some cases but that aside i have to say that the movie was pretty exciting to watch and be invested in emotionally. My recommendations: I would like to recommend this movie how ever the ending did really ruin the entire experience for me so don't watch the final fight scene that the whole movie has built up to.(if you can).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It has some great fight scenes, but the rest is a manipulative and predictable washout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite what you may have heard or read, Warrior just may be one of the most melodramatic and manipulative films ever conceived. Yes, it is a sports movie and gets a pass from most people because of the genre's varied history. But that is not nearly a good enough excuse for the dreck that Gavin O'Connor has helped concoct with this film. The Conlon family has been irreparably damaged after years of abuse at the hands of the former boxer and alcoholic patriarch Paddy (Nick Nolte). He is trying his hand at sobriety, but his estranged son Brendan (Joel Edgerton) is not ready to let Paddy get too close to his family. Other son Tommy (Tom Hardy) has just mysteriously returned from fighting in the Middle East, and recruits Paddy to help train him as an MMA fighter in order to compete in an upcoming tournament with the best fighters in the world. At the same time, Brendan, a school teacher, begins training to fight in the same tournament in order to keep a roof over his family's heads.Should the trailer not have told you already, it becomes increasingly obvious throughout Warrior's often excruciating 140-minute running time where these two brothers are heading. The film makes no bones about it, and plays through almost every single underdog trope you can imagine and even a few you may have forgotten. The notion of being subtle was apparently lost on O'Connor, and I wonder if the original script played out just as annoying and silly as the film does. The comparisons to Rocky are more than fair, because the movie practically rips off entire segments right out of that legendary Oscar winner without shame. But looking aside from the formulaic and absolutely asinine plotting structure, as well as the clear jumps in logic on the parts of almost every single cast member (specifically towards the end of the film), I think the film is most guilty of being too long, too self-indulgent and just plain boring. Warrior lacks the charisma and finesse needed to really make you forget the predictability of it all and actually care about the plight of these characters. It beats you over the head with moments dripping with pathos and sorrow, but never answers the question of why you should care. It merely goes through the motions, playing out lengthy scenes that could have easily been cut for pacing or reworked to give us a reason for watching the struggles of this collapsed family. It fails to connect on almost every level, and merely feels like a stretched out, half-baked drama that drags its heels getting to the tournament the film is building towards. Even then, it still takes its time getting to the fights. I dig Hardy as an actor and look forward to seeing him truly break out, but he does not really put any effort into Tommy. He is brooding and conceited throughout, hinting at an inner pain that is waiting to be unleashed. But he never really gets the opportunity to showcase any of it. He spends most of the movie not saying a word, and merely looking at the camera or his cast mates with saddened and hollowed eyes. His sad eyes can only do so much, and his dialogue does absolutely nothing. It looks like he took the movie merely for the chance to bulk up and prep for The Dark Knight Rises. Edgerton, who I also look forward to seeing break out, does a little better. He actually puts in the effort needed to be convincing, and even with the atrocious dialogue, comes off as genuine. He takes even the worst of moments in stride, and does almost the entirety of the heavy lifting in the film. Should the film have focused entirely on him and cut out the silly brother subplot, I think it could have worked a whole lot better.Which brings me to Nolte, who gives what is likely his best performance in over a decade. While that may be true, I find it hard to find anything to really praise about it. He appears to be playing a fragmented archetype along the lines of Mickey Rourke's character in The Wrestler. Both characters are washed up shadows of their former selves, and not surprisingly, the lives of the actors playing them mirror the roles. But instead of giving the emotional breadth and genuine authenticity needed for this character, Nolte overacts the entire way through it. He hams it up for part of the film, and in others, completely destroys any semblance of attempting to give a great performance. Instead of letting it flourish, he seems more concerned with ensuring everyone know what kind of thespian he can be when he wants to be, and ends up becoming comically bad in some scenes. When there are people laughing at your character's most deadly serious scene, not because it is funny but because the delivery is stilted and amateur, it says a lot about the character and even more about your work.But for all of its problems and everything it does so horrifically wrong, the fight scenes at the end of the film are simply magnificent. They are raw and realistic. You can feel every punch, gasp at every bone crunching submission, and practically smell the sweat coming off the mat. You can sense immediately that great pains were taken to ensure these scenes looked as authentic as possible. You become immersed in them, and feel like you are right there in the scene. Not surprisingly, I completely forgot how long I had been sitting watching Warrior because these scenes were just so breathlessly entertaining. But after wading through almost two hours of melodramatic pandering, I think they deserved to be.4/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Welcome to one more Hollywood emotional narrowness that apparently works in the American film market today. The story of an angry brother has been seen many times in plenty of forms. I do not really see anything special or different with this one. Movie is very well done, good pace and good film rhythm, very good acting and excellent Nick Nolt, all in all pretty watchable no doubt. But grade 8.3??? Please, be advised that this is a higher grade than for example 'Gone with a wind' has. I do agree that the movie as any other art should be the matter of taste as music for example, but I can't say that Justin Bieber's song deserves higher music grade than Mozart's Requiem only because I am impressed with it (I am not, that was only an example). Sometimes I ask myself is there anyone above 10 years of age on this movie site?</fullReview>

Tom Hardy's acting was extremely unbelievable, in my opinion, and I couldn't connect with his character emotionally; what is up with the teenage boy attitude? His brother's behavior, too, was not very convincing: one minute he is this nice lovable teacher, and the next he is an arrogant SOB who is very picky about whom he chooses to love and forgive. Overall, it was a far-fetched and unoriginal story.Sorry, IMDb. I can no longer trust your ratings!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There really is nothing good to say about this film. The wrong topic and a smidge too much action to be considered a chick flick, but way, way, way too much time spent on characters pouring out their hearts to each other to be considered an action movie. Every time the movie starts to pick up a little tempo, it immediately goes right back to 5-10 minutes of dull/dreary characters trying to talk out their feelings. I counted at least 5 different story lines, and the film never seems to be able to decide which the main one is supposed to be.To top everything else off, the film was 2 hours and 15 minutes long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the typical fight film formula, the underdog fighter comes from the bottom of the heap to make it big. Other reviewers have compared it favorably to two other famous fight films, Rocky and Million Dollar Baby. Those movies had exciting fights, involvement in the characters, and entertaining plots. Unfortunately Warrior has none of these. Most of the fights are really short, usually lasting a few seconds and the climactic fight is not real exciting (but not bad). I couldn't really get too involved with the characters and in fact could care less about them. There's not that much of a plot line and what there is is not that involving.I'm not saying that this movie is a total zero, it's just not that great. If you want to see better fight movies then rent Rocky or Million Dollar Baby.I am aware that many others are giving much more positive reviews of this movie than I am giving it. Rarely do I differ that much with the reviews that others give. I can only describe things as I see them. I can not see how people could leave the theater crying unless it is from being upset after having paid money to see this.</fullReview>
