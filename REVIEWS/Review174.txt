		<shortDescription>Not a mere thriller, but a movie with contents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been to the premiere at the Film Festival in Zurich and I was moved by the movie, not because of the love story, but because of the irrefutable truth. The movie left me thinking and researching about its topic: Colognia Dignidad, a cult in Santiago de Chile. It conjures many ethical questions and portrays what humanity is capable of. The movie grips and doesn't let go of you till the end. The contents is real, except for the love story that forms the golden thread. One has to imagine that the movie portrays the life and the ways of Colognia Dignidad almost like a documentary without felt exaggeration, but it is still a movie with a story. Superb acting by Emma Watson and Daniel Brühl made the movie an even more intense experience. The only criticism I can make is that the love story is average in comparison to the rest. I believe that the characters actions don't always make much sense. All in all, it's one of the best movies I've seen this year and cannot be compared with the commercial films normally shown in cinemas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Particularly memorable Q&amp;A when a German diplomat voiced his opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a German Diplomatic official attends the premiere in Toronto to refute the premise of the film its a sign that the material strikes pretty close to home.Very memorable Q&amp;A at the 2015 Tiff. Hats off to the director that didn't flinch at all when confronting the questioner.Its one of those films that you can honestly say "real life is stranger than fiction"Its obvious that the film makers used this convincing story to attract the very talented cast. Even the despicable bad guys (and gal) were very well cast in addition to our heroes. I'm glad this film wasn't released amidst the flurry of films prior to the awards season. Everyone should take the time and let this material and these performances sink in.Well done. Good work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Colonia" takes a little-known chapter in history and spins it into an interesting and entertaining tale of romance and danger.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A religious cult in Chile run by ex-Nazis?!? It may sound like a bizarre work of fiction, but the location portrayed in the historical drama "Colonia" (NR, 1:50) was all too real (except for the fictional romance at the center of the film). But before I get into my plot summary, I think that a little historical context is in order: In September 1973, a U.S.-backed military coup wrested control of the government of Chile from democratically-elected socialist president Salvador Allende and placed power in the hands of army commander-in-chief Augusto Pinochet. Under his 17-year rule, dissidents were persecuted, arrested, kidnapped, deposed, tortured and murdered. Pinochet's government used the remote Colonia Dignidad (Colony of Dignity) as a place to torture and murder some of the regime's political opponents. The public face of the colony was that of a charitable and educational organization. It was actually a religious cult where former Nazi medic Paul Schäfer imposed a strict Baptist interpretation of the Bible on all of his followers, many of who had emigrated with him from Germany. He forced them to live in dormitories segregated by gender, and with parents separated from their children, whom Schäfer sexually molested.Daniel Brühl plays Daniel, a political activist from Germany who has been living in Chile for a few months working with a group of young people supporting President Allende. Daniel's girlfriend, Lena (Emma Watson), is a flight attendant who takes advantage of her week-long stopover in Santiago to spend time with Daniel. When a military coup suddenly drives Allende from power, the new government starts rounding up political dissidents, including Daniel ? and Lena, who happens to be with him when he's arrested. In a soccer stadium, a man wearing a black hood identifies Allende supporters, including Daniel, who is whisked away in a van. Lena is able to trace the markings on the vehicle to the secretive and remote "Colonia Dignidad" compound, about 200 miles south of Santiago. She makes her way there and asks to join. "I want to know the way of the Lord," she says, wearing a small cross around her neck.In her attempt to rescue her lost love, Lena is sacrificing her freedom ? and putting her very life at risk. A harsh old woman named Gisela (Richenda Carey) takes her to meet the cult's leader, German expatriate and lay preacher Paul Schäfer (Michael Nyqvist). "Once you join us, you must remain," explains Schäfer. Lena agrees, in spite of observing his Christian fanaticism and some of his innate creepiness. Gisela relieves Lena of the small bag she had brought with her, gives her a few items including a set of linen, and assigns her a bed in the female dormitory. Most of the women show no interest in talking to the new arrival, but Lena befriends another young woman named Doro (Jeanne Werner) and, later, another named Ursel (Vicky Krieps). As Lena joins the women in their daily work in the fields and in other food preparation activities, she learns what she can about the camp and keeps her eyes peeled for Daniel.Daniel has survived severe physical abuse at the hands of the Chilean secret police in the colony's subterranean torture chamber, but he is a bit worse for the wear. Besides his physical injuries, his speech is slurred and he now talks and acts like a child. Lena finally catches sight of Daniel when she steals a glance through the window of the colony's assembly hall during a men's meeting and is obviously concerned about his state of mind. Soon after, at a rare meeting with the cult's men and women all together, Lena takes the risk of approaching Daniel, hoping that the two of them can come up with a plan to escape the cult, something no one has done before. But there's much more at stake than "just" the fate of two young lovers. Besides the terrible ways that Schäfer uses and abuses his followers, it turns out that he's also into some other nasty business that further reduces even the slim chance that Daniel and Lena have to get away for good."Colonia" takes a little-known chapter in history and spins it into an interesting and entertaining tale of romance and danger. The story is perhaps best understood as a combination of "The Boys from Brazil", M. Night Shyamalan's "The Village" and Ben Affleck's Oscar-winning "Argo"? if you can imagine that. This film's unusual setting contributes to its originality, as does telling a story in which it's the woman who comes to rescue the man. The actors are well cast, and this accomplished multi-national ensemble consistently offers up lived-in performances. The direction, by Florian Gallenberger (who won an Oscar for his 2000 live action short film "I Want to Be?"), sometimes feels a little disjointed, but he mostly keeps things moving and builds some serious tension into the movie's plot. The script (co-written by Torsten Wenzel and Gallenberger) is creative and smart. There may not be much actual dignity in the Colonia Dignidad compound, but this film dignifies itself with some quality story-telling. "A-"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pretty Great Cult Expose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Colonia was no simple thriller. This gripping movie stands perfectly as a deconstructing look at the sickening evils that really happen in our world. It stands as a great expose of the human mind and the sickening things that we as people are capable of. It is a testament to mankind's evil heart. Standing as an example of the ignorance and violence in religion and cult life. Not only was this film revealing (and therefore shocking) but it was also well written, and well casted, Emma Watson in particular standing out as she usually does. The films director is also a talented man who I hope to see more from in the future. A great example of independent film, Colonia was gripping and kept me interested all the way through. Would highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, people actually do that and others fall for that, just like in the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film attempts to spin a thriller story inside the larger and more important history of Colonia Dignidad, a torture, rape and death place run like a religious cult by a pedophile Nazi ex-nurse preacher in collaboration with both the Chilean and German authorities. It sounds corny, yet it's true. Before and during the brutal military dictatorship of Pinochet in Chile, this guy ran the colony for 33 years, only being accused, then running away, then being caught and convicted... at 84 years old, much too late for anything. His right hand man is still living in Germany, close to his many victims that returned home, because the German constitution forbids deportation of its citizens.The movie depicts the horrors inside in typical American fashion, focusing on what restricts personal liberty and rights, but shying away from actual physical blood violence or nakedness. The scene where Schaefer enters the shower of the young boys and starts undressing for a full second was comically reminiscent of the old movies when people kissed and then there got up from the bed a scene later.Even so, the psychical and emotional torture is shown quite readily, shocking the viewer into asking: how is this even possible? Just look it up: cults sprout all over the place with millions and even billions of people happy to partake in whatever horrible fairy tale psychopaths can imagine, as long as they don't feel responsible.As a movie, though, the film fails in several directions. Many have said that the characters weren't sufficiently developed. The movie was not about the characters, but about the colony, so no, I don't agree. However many dramatic moments seemed crafted specifically for the movie, especially towards the ending. As such, I believe the biggest sin of the film was not deciding from the get go what it wanted to be. We spend the last twenty minutes of this almost two hour movie trying to develop empathy towards the characters that were neglected until then, while the epilogue is the lazy text over saying what happened - or more like not happened - to the people involved.To the question about the reality of the story, the romantic story of the two is fantasy, while the things inside the colony are likely worst than how they have been portrayed. Strangely enough, while the movie made this horror more visible, to actually find well documented articles about it has become more difficult, as many are talking about the film rather than reality.Bottom line: solid acting, horrible reality, kind of bland adaptation. A movie certainly worth seeing, but not a fun one at all. To be recommended at least for making this visible to large audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an intense adventure!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of two German citizens who are in Chile under Pinochet dictatorship. They get locked up in a camp of a religious sect, and get mistreated, abused and tortured. The story is super engaging, keeping me glued to the screen from start to finish! I applaud Lena's courage to go into the camp just to see her boyfriend, though it can also be argued that it is the silliest thing to do. It shows that love is blind, and rational decision is clouded by love. The conditions in the camp is horrible, made worse by the wicked headmaster who wrongly uses religion to control and abuse people. There is one scene that vaguely suggests sexual abuse, but it is so vague that I had doubts until the words appear at the end of the film.The ending is super intense. I find myself grabbing onto my chair, leaning forward and simply hoping that things will work out. The desperation of the characters transmit through the screen to me, and I just hope so sincerely that they will make it.I didn't expect such an intense adventure. I enjoyed watching 'Colonial" thoroughly.</fullReview>

I enjoyed it and definitely recommend watching it. It really is worth your time and chapeau to Emma for this performance! Also it is a real eyeopener that there is so much going on in the world that we (I) am not aware of. The way they portrait it in this movie is just excellent without over doing it. The actor Daniel also is really really good his performance is magnificent. I think there should be a lot more movies with the purpose to make people aware of what is going on in this film. It is definitely not boring in the slightest way and you wont regret watching it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sacrificial torture and secret worlds, there is no shortage of surprises in 'Colonia'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inspired by true events, Colonia is a Hollywood-style thriller about a couple who finds themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time- the torture prison of a religious cult under the influence of the Chilean secret police in 1974. At a time when Chilean youth began revolutionizing in the streets, one man's involvement with the movement along with his girlfriend's association in his anti-government views causes the couple to put their relationship and love for each other to the test. Directed by Academy Award winner Florian Gallenberger (Shadows of War), Colonia opens in theaters Friday, April 15th. Bill Withers' "Ain't No Sunshine" accompanies archival footage of protesters rioting in the streets while the film itself is saturated in prime colors- magenta and royal blue. This juxtaposition of violence and R&amp;B gives an artistic edge to the film's opening scenes, but unfortunately, this visual isn't sustained throughout the film. We meet our protagonist Daniel (Daniel Brühl), up on stage pumping up the masses of people, when, out of nowhere, he spots a bright yellow flight attendant's outfit (like a ray of Mr. Withers' sunshine) from the muted colors of the crowd. The woman is Lena (Emma Watson) and they immediately embrace. Their relationship isn't made entirely clear, but she only has four days in town and they plan on spending it together.While enjoying their time together, Daniel receives a phone call that shifts the political tide and changes everything. This results in chaos erupting in the streets, leading to their capture by the Chilean soldiers. Daniel gets abducted and taken to a hidden cult in a rural area called Colonia Dignidad, run by ex-Nazi Paul Schäfer (Michael Nyqvist). Left with no other choice, Lena willfully joins the Colonia as a desperate, last-ditch effort to find her boyfriend, risking her own life to bring him home as she discovers that those who enter the cult never leave.Emma Watson and Daniel Brühl play Lena and Daniel with an innocence about them that has you rooting for their success. Watson is unquestionably beautiful and smart, her outspokenness gets her into trouble. Brühl takes a more unconventional risk with his character by playing the role of a mentally challenged person in an effort to trick his captors into thinking he is not a threat. Watson and Brühl are crucial to the film's success, but individually speaking, these roles won't likely result in a significant boost to their careers.Colonia can't escape the comparisons to Eli Roth's The Sacrament or the documentary Kidnapped for Christ (if you haven't seen it, it's available to stream on Netflix, and is a MUST- watch), which may hurt Colonia's overall success because it is not as riveting by comparison. Audiences know what they are getting with an Eli Roth film, and a documentary has its own sense of wonderment, but Colonia tends to jump from the political thriller to love story to religious brainwashing in a patchwork way that feels a bit all over the place, and it is this "clumpy" genre blending that may be the film's weakest point. Plus, Daniel and Lena's relationship is never fully established in the beginning of the film, so we are left to wonder why she would risk her life to save this person.At its core, Colonia is an interesting story, but not a very memorable film. It doesn't provide enough tension to overshadow The Sacrament, nor does it have the foundation to be a solid romance. The fact that it is based on a true story is what keeps the film afloat and the inclusion the smuggled archival photos of the real Colonia Dignidad at the end is a much-needed gem. Yet, even with cinema-savvy actors Emma Watson and Daniel Brühl, Colonia can't quite seem to gain the traction needed to be a standout film.For more, visit: www.cinemacy.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A triumph in relevant storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Colonia" or "Colonia Dignidad" is a German English-language movie that premiered last year, but hit cinemas mostly this year, in 2016. It runs for slightly under 2 hours and was written and directed by Florian Gallenberger. Gallenberger won an Oscar in the short film category and has not really been that prolific in the last 15 years since then. And his films always had a foreign impact since then, such as "John Rabe" for example. And just like his Oscar-winning effort, this one here has some Spanish parts as well. It is about a young couple in Chile in the Pinochet years. The political background is elaborated on in the first parts of the film, but the heart and soul are really all the scenes taking place directly at Colonia Dignidad. The characters there also play a much bigger role than the supporting characters early on, the friends of the couple.Lets take a look at the actors. Emma Watson is the lead here undoubtedly. It is her story, her love and her suffering. Even if Brühl is missing during the early scenes of Watson's character's presence at Colonia Dignidad, then he is still a co-lead and he is in over 75% of the film too. The two play their characters pretty well. I am sometimes not the biggest Brühl fan, but here he convinced me and Watson proved that she can carry a film like this as well. The two also had pretty great chemistry. The supporting characters were at least as good. Michael Nyqvist (definitely a front runner for Best Supporting Actor at the next German Film Awards) was a perfect choice as the villain here and he played his scary and unlikeable role so-so well. I guess he was the MVP for me. Richenda Carey works nicely as well and is pretty memorable. The other actors and actresses who played smaller parts were good too and the only reason I don't mention them explicitly is because their roles really weren't that major in the whole scheme of things.Gallenberger had exactly two tasks to succeed here. The first would be depict the historical context in a way that keep audiences interested no matter how vast their knowledge about the subject is beforehand. The second task would be create characters and a story within the historical context that makes us care for them. I believe he succeeded brilliantly in both areas. I applaud him for his effort here. I personally knew the very basic facts about Colonia Dignidad and the way this organization was depicted here certainly raised my interest. I am not sure how accurate everything is, for example I doubt he was really gonna be killed the very day after they fled, but it is not a problem at all if there are sequences that were added for dramatic purpose. Still, a very large percentage of the film is accurate.My favorite moment of the film is probably the two holding hands when they see each other again and Brühl's character showing his girlfriend this way that he has not gone insane. They took the risk to be seen and exposed because their feelings for one another were just too strong to deny them. This moment was a thing that so many romance films try to achieve, but most of them come short: a truly beautiful moment of affection and harmony in a world of drama around them. I found it much better than all the scenes with the two being together later on, but it's not as if these were bad at all either. What was the film's weakness? Was there any? I maybe would not have gone with the super-dramatic ending and the chase sequences at the airport. Possibly one plot twist to many to show us the German ambassador as a fraud. i understand that it is reality, but I still would not have minded without that really dramatic ending. I would have preferred the flight being successful and them boarding the airplane together as an ending, even if it less spectacular. The movie had enough brilliant edge-of-seat moments that delivered more than enough thrill for the runtime of slightly under 120 minutes. But this is just a minor criticism. I think this film here is a really brilliant achievement. I was very positively surprise. You really need to see it, especially if you have an interest in 20th century history.</fullReview>

Not knowing a single thing about the movie or the real history behind it, I went into this thinking it was going to be about something totally different. I was even surprised when at the beginning I saw the name "Emma Watson". I knew good things were gonna happen. So as it unfolded, I thought it was gonna be some political thriller where the boyfriend gets kidnapped by the army goons and then he has to escape. Imagine my surprise when it took a turn to Chilean/Deutschland Jonestown!!! Didn't see that coming! The old hag nazi b!tch was excellent. You just knew right away that you wanted her to get clubbed over the head with a blunt object. Thanks Emma for granting my wish. I didn't care for the love story, but it drove the film. Anyhow, I don't want to give anything away, just suffice to say - this is worth your time watching!</fullReview>

The corruption of that time is unbelievably similar to our time. The only difference is that now, it seems to be a more honorable corruption, known by everyone, legal at this point of view, very well hidden and at the same time we supposed to be more civilized. We just hide this madness better.This movie shows as that corruption exists everywhere, even in embassies. Don't miss it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flimsy, forgettable, account of a true story of atrocity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the post-script information presented before the end credits, telling of the true facts and showing actual photos of the real events of Colonia is for more emotionally affecting and interesting than the film that preceded it- you know you're in trouble.In fact I had completely forgotten I had even watched this film until I came across it on a random film list. Colonia reeks of Hollywood phoniness, especially an overlong and rather unnecessary chase sequence near the end that has no other purpose than to make the film long enough to count as a feature length film.Emma Watson can be a solid actress (see Perks of Being a Wallflower or The Bling Ring) but her performance is nothing more than adequate, and rather forgettable. Daniel Bruhl is solid enough, but it's obvious that both these actors are straining to bring depth and conviction to a flimsy screenplay. Michael Nyquist, however, is certainly chilling and downright loathsome, but even he is nothing more than a one-note villain.It's also a bad sign when there's a sense the director felt the only way to hold the audience's attention is through endless depictions of abuse and horrific implications of child sex abuse, only to cheapen it when throwing in typical thriller tropes for cheap, ineffective, suspense sequences. It makes the treatment of the true story seem exploitative and disrespectful to the actual victims who had to live through this atrocity.Colonia feels like a poorly written blurb you'd find in a history book in high school, and the bull shitted 5 page essay one would write just to get a passing grade. Since I had never seen heard of this true story, I was shocked to see how recent certain aspects of it was. But I'd highly suggest skipping this entirely, and looking into documentaries or online research, as this silly and absolutely forgettable depiction of true events should be skipped.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I decided to watch this movie, I was kind of torn. I don't have the habit of watching trailers cause more than often they reveal parts of the movie that you don't want to see before actually watching it. With the same strategy, I just read the hypothesis a bit and then went straight to the movie. I have to say that the photography of the movie as well as the depiction of this close society was brilliant. I was amazed by the historical value of the movie that I was not aware of and it made me search so much online to get the facts straight after watching it. I think that this fact on its own, shows the great value of movies that go back in time, revealing the inconvenient truths of history. The plot was amazing and the script was unparalleled. I really enjoyed each part and the movie definitely kept me at the edge of my seat for the entire duration. The bad guy was portrayed excellently and the tension towards the end was almost unbearable! Both protagonists were excellent and it's nice to see Emma Watson being so much more than Ermione. Daniel Brühl was also brilliant, or should I say Bruhliant (?) one more time. This is a must see movie for all the right reasons. Have to put on your watch list definitely!</fullReview>

This movie, my dear cinema-lovers will change you as a better person starting now when the titles roll up with the haunting violin serenade behind. A story of courage, sacrifice, LOVE and overall human solidarity is what makes this movie unique. Unsurprisingly, IMDb viewers gave it a low rating, given it did not have nudes or eroticism, but what it indeed have is a message that no matter the adversities, true human will triumphs over all. There are tons of movies out there where you witness atrocities that we humans commit on an everyday basis, make no mistake this is another movie that shall get its awards, its Oscars and then we shall all move on. But, what makes this one stand out, is the jolt it provides, the visual shame of our downfall as a collective being for our greed and hunger for power. If you are reading this, I implore you to watch this, not because you will evolve as a transcended human, but something to leave as a reference for your children to watch when they are of age and maturity. This movie can easily be referred to as an heirloom among the countless treasures that the world of motion pictures have given us. Something powerful, resourceful and honest to pass on when the time is right. Don't miss out on this one because this film just might change your perception for the better forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite having found this docudrama incredibly powerful it did concern me that there were no Chilean actors in the production. Strange really given who Colonia Dignidad affected, and who were tortured, abused, held virtual hostage etc. I was in Chile at the end of the reign of the oppressive regime of Pinochet - and felt the film lacked the sound of the Chilean dialect (of Spanish). Maybe it could have included more of the direct and authentic voice of those who suffered. Or those who lived in the region. There were so many myths about the place in the media, in the streets, within the popular culture. Pity because this was a story that was worth telling.</fullReview>

The movie is taut and horrifying. Scenes at the cult are brutal in their cruelty. The things the characters go through aren't too different that what I'd call torture. The fact that this place actually existed is scary. Watch the movie and then read up about the whole situation later, it will open your eyes to things you never even knew about!I would have liked to seen more of the coup, because my knowledge of that was non-existent prior to watching this.

		<fullReview>Admittedly, I originally only put this movie on out of sheer curiosity and desire to see Emma Watson in an entirely different role than in any of her previous endeavours. I was not disappointed- in fact I felt immediately captivated by this strange, overlooked corner of German/Chilean history told through a Hollywood lens.Indeed, elements of the story have surely been greatly warped to suit the silver screen (I am hardly knowledgeable about the true events on which Colonia is based) but I didn't feel that these changes distracted from the heavy message and dark history of the story. On the contrary, I felt that the movie offered a believable perspective of events while telling the story on an entertaining and multi-faceted level. In other words, Colonia offered the necessary respect for the history without leaving me deeply disturbed. Moved, certainly, but not disturbed as would be so easy with such a gruesome story. I appreciated the combination of action, drama, thrills, and romance. I thought Watson and Bruhl were excellent and well-suited to their respective roles; their chemistry was also good (surprisingly so, in fact). All in all I found the story kept moving and held my attention extremely well. I found myself on the edge of my seat and unable to leave without witnessing the conclusion! I would recommend this movie to anyone with the slightest interest in history, the struggle against oppression, or Emma Watson. ;) (She does does give a very nice performance)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'COLONIA': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A historical thriller flick; about a notorious cult (in the south of Chile) known as "Colonia Dignidad". This film tells the story of a young German woman, in 1973, that joined the ruthless sect, in order to try and rescue her abducted boyfriend. The movie stars Emma Watson, Daniel Bruhl and Michael Nyqvist. It was directed by acclaimed German filmmaker Florian Gallenberger; and it was written by Gallenberger and first time screenwriter Torsten Wenzel. Despite all of the talent involved, the movie received mostly negative reviews from critics; and it's performed very poorly at the Box Office as well. I still really enjoyed it.The story revolves around a young German couple, named Lena (Watson) and Daniel (Bruhl). When Daniel is caught taking pictures of the Chilean military coup, he's kidnapped by the secret police (known as DINA); and sent to "Colonia Dignidad". There he's imprisoned, and severely tortured. Lena willingly joins the organization, which claims to be a charitable mission, in order to find her boyfriend and rescue him. She soon finds out that the sect is ran by a very sadistic preacher, named Paul Schafer (Nyqvist), who has never allowed anyone to leave his colony (alive).The movie is effectively creepy, and quite disturbing. The actors aren't given a lot of moments to shine though, and their roles aren't really that well developed. Still the movie is very thrilling, and quite involving. I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. It's definitely not a great film (by any means), but it's not a bad one either. I'd say it's definitely worth a watch.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/lcZBQp0HBZg</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting and full of emotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want a tense movie you could do more than worse than picking this one. One that is rooted in real life incidents and happenings of course, but also one that might have heightened a few things that actually happened to make it more "movie-like". So this also makes a couple of things more than predictable.If you don't mind this, the movie does have powerful scenes, but also scenes that will shock you to the bone. Even scenes where things are only hinted at (like a certain kind of abuse), but just knowing what happened and what will happen once the camera goes off or the editor cuts, is more than enough to make you squirm. Powerful performances throughout make this an almost must watch</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the most surprising film making, but wonderfully subtle and important</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm taking off a point because there are a few predictable moments that don't quite play as well as they could have. I'm otherwise extremely jealous the film makers managed to combine &amp; juggle the subject matter of western-backed fascist coups in Latin America with the subject of Latin American Germanic Hitler-sympathizers &amp; Nazi exiles. It does so, however, with a subtlety you have to see to realize how artful, not to mention the implications of outside governments complicity in trying to suppress it. I applaud Emma Watson for choosing a role like this in a small movie with such important subject matter, which shows a great deal of character and intelligence compared to much of the industry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was interested in this movie since it was hard for me to believe that Emma Watson would pull this role decently , surprisingly she did it . It is pretty hard to find a decent thriller now-days , everything is either too cliché or not interesting at all . This title is very solid , it has good actors and very well written script , the plot doesn't fail to surprise too. One thing i would say , is that this movie is not for the big screen , i think you should wait for it to come out on DVD or Netflix. Im really happy they put Emma Watson it thins because i cant see this movie seen by people if there were unfamiliar actors like most of the cast .Summing up , you should see this movie it is interesting and better than most of what is now in the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected something very different, I admit. I expected a movie in the line of GARAGE OLIMPO, remember, the terrific movie from Argentina, which described the torture in the detention center during the dictatorship era. This movie made in 1999 was far more realistic, fierce, and certainly not for wide audiences, than this one is. That's the real problem with this movie, it is destined to wide audiences. Too much for my taste. The ending looks like a Hollywood crap. I would have preferred a film genuinely made from Chilia. But the story is of course breath taking, very well done, I won't deny this. Those cruel events have to be known, in any way. But, again, I expected a more minimalist way of making this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fictional love story woven into the historical Colonia cult in 1970s Chile.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this on Netflix streaming. It is based on the real Colonia Dignidad (or Dignity Colony) in rural Chile. It was founded by German fugitive Paul Schäfer who had his followers call him "Pius". He held perverted religious ceremonies and being a fancier of young boys often called the adult women "sluts." At its most populist there were perhaps 300 German and Chilean followers, once a person got into the guarded compound, roughly 53 square miles, no one was allowed to leave, although a small handful managed to escape over the years.The story is told with two fictional characters, British stewardess Emma Watson as Lena has a 4-day layover after a long trans oceanic flight from Germany and in the car to a hotel spots her boyfriend, Daniel Brühl as German activist and photographer Daniel. She gets out of the car to meet him, as the military are starting to round up demonstrators. Because he is daringly taking photos he is rounded up with dozens of others, he is sent away to a place unknown.Lena loves Daniel and is determined to find him. This leads her to the Colonia, where she gets in dressed as a religious person, saying she wants to join the cult.(As an aside, this part seems a bit disingenuous to me. Could a stranger just walk up and be admitted? Maybe, but it seems a bit too easy.)So most of the movie is about life in the Colonia and eventually Daniel and Lena looking for a way to escape without getting shot. Michael Nyqvist is really good as the menacing Paul Schäfer.Spoilers: Authorities tried to get Daniel to talk by torturing him, including electric shock to his brain. Also badly beaten after he recovered he overheard them saying he might be brain-damaged. So he played along with that as a way to get into things without being closely monitored. He eventually finds out that Lena is in there, together they find an escape route through a series of tunnels that have an exit outside the electrified fence. After being there some 132 days. They go to the German embassy to report the criminal activities but instead of being on their side try to have them arrested at the airport. They manage to escape to her old flight crew taking off for Germany and barely elude the authorities trying to keep the plane on the ground.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course I wanted to watch this movie because I am a huge fan of Emma Watson. I love her, she's just darling. I was a little confused in the beginning. I started tipping on the edge of boredom and started to play on my tablet until things took a fascinating turn. By the way, I didn't know this was really based on anything real. So it quickly caught my attention when Daniel was captured and taken away. From then on I was really into it and I am still trying to catch my breath from the end. I had my hands up in the air, so nervous for what was going to happen! Glad I saw it and gave it a full chance. Here I am still thinking about all the prisoners and feeling empathetic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a great adult role Emma Watson movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After recently watching Regression which I felt was a complete waste of time, I was not expecting much out of this movie. I like to see all of Emma's movies because she is so beautiful and I like to watch her regardless. This was surprisingly a great movie. It was suspenseful and the characters were excellent. More religious fanaticism attempting to send humanity back into the insane thinking by the humans in the middle ages. What a waste of brain power and progress it truly is. Note: I did think the Bling Ring was a great film with Emma And Taissa Farmiga, but they were playing high school girls which is why I consider this movie to be Emma's first successful adult movie that I have seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven but complain gloom at political perversion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SUMMARY: Colonia presents a compelling portrait of two people caught in the ideological chess match played out in Chile by communism, democracy and the aftermath of WW II.Chile became a battleground for the ideologies of fascism, communism and US-style democracy. Thus you have the fertile mix of governmental change, ideological interference by the reigning superpowers, hidden liberties taken by fascists now enjoying tropical weather and a youth movement that believed change would be allowed without consequences.Into this historically true environment walk Lena (a flight attendant for Lufthansa Airlines) and Daniel (a cloudy-backgrounded German supporting the youth activists of Salvadore Allende). He's political and more than a foreign functionary but well less a true revolutionary or martyr (and here in lies the first of the uneven story lines). The first time we see these two, Lena's just finished her shift on an in-bound flight to surprise her boyfriend. Abandoning her co-workers to their hotel, she tells them she'll meet them in four days for the flight out.She doesn't make the plane. Paralleling the real events, Daniel is warned about the military coup and they are swept up in the martial law events that occur during the first 24-48 hours following the coup (another unevenness relating to WHY they draw attention to themselves). Daniel is taken to the facility for which the film is named: "Colonia" - The Colony. Lena is released.She seeks assistance in finding and retrieving her lover from the group he'd been associated with only to find the Chilean youths are hunkering down to "fight the bigger fight" now that Allende has been assassinated. Lena is alone in her decision to rescue Daniel.After a brief set of visits to unseen organizations, she finally gets some info and determines he's been sent to the Colony - a quasi-religious enclave run by an ex-pat German in the hills. Suffice it to say this is like every one of these isolationist extremist compounds where some "leader" paints himself as God-on- Earth and takes associated liberties.Without giving too much away, Lena integrates herself into the life that isn't life while searching for Daniel. Daniel is tortured; his future behavior comes as a direct result of his torture.Leading this is Pius. This character, while fictionalized, actually ran the real- world compound. There are men, women and children in this "retreat" - all held separately. Pius meets with them individually, as evidenced by a young boy who leaves Pius' office with silent tears raining down his cheeks (the implication is confirmed in a shower hymn sing- along). Brutality and sexual dominance keep inhabitants in line. Pius, as portrayed by Michael Nyqvist, lays on the misogynist paint pretty thickly: all women are sluts and whores; they "stink" of sin and the Devil within them. Pius never buys into Lena's desire for a godly life but doesn't truly discern her duplicity. What he does show is his close relationship to the junta and Pinochet: the compound produces both knock-off automatic weapons and poison gas for Pinochet.Lena navigates this psychological snake pit until she and Daniel are reunited. In the end, their exit to safety proves nowhere near as safe as it should have been.First, let me say that I enjoyed this film. Despite it's flaws it was thoughtfully done. While not as gripping as the Costa Gravas film "Missing", the feeling of fear is real. My gripes: (1) Daniel, supposedly in country only 4 months, isn't as credible as he should've been in the minutes leading up to their arrest. Possibly having him as a journalist would have made the backstory obvious. (2) Lena's ability to meet with groups she hopes to enlist in finding Daniel during a military coup needed more gravitas. One would reasonably expect foreigners to be under scrutiny and unable to move freely about Santiago without being watched or followed. Lena appears to do so unfettered. (3) Emma Watson, bless her heart, doesn't do pliant or fearful well enough to make the audience believe what she's experiencing in her dual challenges of (a) finding Daniel and (b) believably adapting to a way of life she has no preparation for. Ms. Watson isn't quite fearful enough. There's not enough play-acting to stay alive and in the good graces of the harsh women's matron "Aunt Gisela" and there's not enough sheer exhaustion from the backbreaking work the women do 24-7 (day and night shifts). (4) MAJOR SPOILER ALERT: I like tight plots. This one hangs together well until the LAST 2-3 minutes. As Daniel and Lena are escaping, the Pinochet government shuts their plane's clearance down. Lena, who knows the pilot, holds photos taken at the Colonia that will prove what she's just escaped from. Instead, she just begs the pilot to violate international protocol and take off. Because she asks him to. Not buying it.My kudos:(1) This is an intelligent film despite it's flaws. (2) This film is so relevant as it describes growing pains and atrocities that emerging countries and regions - used to dictatorships - experienced. The similarities between this film story and current events shouldn't be underestimated. (3) There are a number of solid (and really, really creepy) supporting performances. (4) The subtle question - whether foreigners/outsiders have the right to interfere and/or agitate - comes through almost every frame of films. The fascists and the communists aren't the only problems Chile has during this turbulent period - democracies failed them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very impressive docudrama about a truly sinister place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The setting is Chile in 1973. A left wing activist is captured by the forces of the newly elected Augusto Pinochet and sent to a mysterious colony where religious extremism and torture of political opponents are the order of the day. His girlfriend joins the sect in an attempt to find and retrieve him.This very interesting suspenseful docudrama is actually based on true events. Admittedly, the central couple are an invention and are merely a dramatic creation to allow us an easy entry into this real life story. This is forgivable though as in its depiction of the Colognia Dignidad itself the film seems to be playing it pretty straight. If anything, the horrific events have been downplayed, as we latterly learn that the leader of the cult, Paul Schäfer, was ultimately imprisoned for sexually abusing the children under his care; this was something only alluded to in the film, so subtly in actual fact that I completely missed it until the end credits mentioned it. Michael Nyqvist is very good in the role of the highly unsympathetic Schäfer, his is probably the most impressive performance in the film; although Emma Watson and Daniel Brühl are both very compelling in their roles of the main protagonists.I liked the fact that this film cast a spotlight on a part of the world that cinema rarely focuses on. Setting the story around the highly charged early 70's period of political turmoil was also a great backdrop. Admittedly, most of the film takes part in the claustrophobic confines of the very creepy Colognia Dignidad but it is such an interesting and sinister real life place that it absolutely justifies a story fully focused on it. We learn a number of details of the strange daily life of this religious sect, some very disturbing indeed. It could maybe be argued that the film's denouement moves into more standard thriller territory and perhaps this could have been avoided but I thought it was pretty forgivable as this is one of the more intriguing dramatic thrillers of the last few years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Film, but one big issue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film ticks a lot of boxes, fine actors, good story-line, a little-known tale which demands to be told. Set During the 1973 coup in Chile, Emma Watson's character falls for her revolutionary boyfriend who gets arrested during the coup and is sent to the little known 'Colonia Dignidad' a Germanic themed cult with a large compound in the south of Chile and close ties to the Military regime. Watson's character sets off to join the cult to help him escape. So far so good. However, the depiction of Colonia Dignidad is so far off how a cult operates one wonders if the writers have even bothered to investigate how cults work. This was a self-regulating concentration camp with no obvious reason for anyone to want to stay other than fear. Yes, I know cults use fear, but they don't recruit that way. There was no love bombing or giving acolytes a yearning to belong to these friendly people who all think the same way as them. If all a cult offered was misery and endless toil they wouldn't recruit anyone! I believe that if the dynamics of how cults operate had been investigated, it could have turned a very good film into a great film. Sadly the clichéd depiction of the cult at Colonia Dignidad is the only disappointing part of an interesting film.</fullReview>

I like feeling that she is the character and the accepted this movie just because it goes perfectly whit her believes.The script is just right but it won't win an Oscar for that.

		<shortDescription>Could have been Oscar-Material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that this movie was a pleasant surprise and I am quite surprised it has not got much attention and a rating close to 7. The plot is very interesting, partially based on true events and good cast. Emma Stone performance is astonishing by the way. In addition, it makes a lot of people, who have not heard before about it, aware of the story of Colonia Dignidad. And what a story.. For all that I think the movie deserves an 8 and I need to say that I rarely rate movies beyond their IMDb rating. Now, why this movie is not Oscar-material or a 9-10 rated one? In my opinion, for two reasons. Firstly, it contains some plot holes and it is unrealistic at various points. I am not really obsessed with historical accuracy, but at some point the movie defies common logic (or at least mine). Secondly, it lacks a good soundtrack. Every good drama must be accompanied with nice emotional music and here that is not the case. Have you ever wondered how good would be Titanic without its OST?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1973, revolution is in the air in Chile. Lena (Emma Watson) is a flight stewardess. Her boyfriend Daniel (Daniel Brühl) is sympathetic to President Salvador Allende when the military under General Augusto Pinochet stage a coup. The German couple is picked up by the military. Daniel is sent off to be re-educated. Lena tracks him to the religious cult Colonia Dignidad run by Paul Schäfer (Michael Nyqvist) and decides to join. The cult keeps its members especially the women under violent control. They are supported and work for the secret police.It starts with good interest but little nuggets of problems are already laid. It has nice intensity with the political revolution and coup. Lena and Daniel confused me a little. I assumed Lena as a foreigner but I thought she was English. I also assumed Daniel to be a local. The start has a great intensity but it's also a little confused which it doesn't spend the time fixing. Then it goes into the cult which sends the movie into a different space. Finally it goes back into the thriller mode. The different tones and a bit of confusion keeps this from being good.</fullReview>

The few that did were too fixated upon them and essentially didn't consider anything else the film has to offer. Then there were the usual fanboy reviews of one of the film's significant problems - Emma Watson's acting. During the most significant parts of the film, she was stuck. In the less important parts, she was cliché, stereotypical, and showing about as much skill as a teen horror chick.The other problem is that the director also failed in the same way, cliché, stereotypical melodrama hurting a story that didn't need it.Fortunately, the story and most of the other actors overcome the over-direction and naive acting. Not enough, however, to turn it into an Oscar nominee that it deserves to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raw Beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one is a stunner. It's not a teary-eyed love story, nor one with battle scenes and screams of love. What is real love, versus the love on screen? Think of a big blockbuster and look at the love story, and it's the cliché kind of love. This movie has yes, a fairly typical love story; they get separated, one goes after the other, risking everything, and they survive. However, this film goes beyond that. The introduction is pretty hasty, and it is obvious the plot is advancing fast to get to the juicy stuff. Yet, despite the obvious establishment of setting, character, motivation, and the works, the progression is logical and flows nicely. The beauty of it is that everything is condensed to what is necessary. Not everything needs to be shown blatantly, so long as it is understood. The scene in the beginning where the girl is taking pictures of the man's butt, and they're giggling and horsing around, is romanticized, but there's no billowing drapes, no bursts of sunlight, giving an absolutely perfect feel to the relationship. It is established that the dude takes pictures, and he is skilled at it, but it doesn't linger too long on that, and we understand without extra drama added. He's captured and she runs off after him. The typical scene of "should I go, should I not, should I, should I not" wasn't even alluded to. We all know that they will always go. She comes home to his ransacked apartment, and there's no wonder in that scene. It's all, "ok, what do I need to do." She's going after him, but how? We wonder how, and we get our answer. Not directly which is beautiful It is inferred and we see it, but it's not thrown in our faces. The next thing we see is her in a very conservative outfit, obviously in costume to do something, and the cross seals the deal. I watched this movie purely because the title looked interesting, and they got a very famous actress to star in it, so it must be half decent. I was completely unaware of what this was a about, yet I still got the whole thing. I knew it was religious, and I knew that it was what she had to do. There's a lot of scenes in this movie just like that, and things are just inferred but not to the point where you're not sure. I won't hit on everything, but another one of these was the little boys. From the start, the head dude running the cult was obviously doing this more than for just the power and to use God. Her first encounter with a normal person from the cult besides the cranky lady is the boy, and your first thought is abuse. The man, and the door, and you just know he is not pure by any means. Another, beautifully subtle yet easily discernible at the same time was the chorus of half-dressed boys in the bathroom. He conducts them and is very engaged in the feel of the music. He walks up the boys, standing very close, hands on some of their bare shoulders, large belly in the face of those directly in front of them, and he never even looks at the little boys, yet we know. He sends three boys off to shower while the rest sing loudly. The boys systematically showers, and the man walks up to the line of showers, and simply removes his shoes, and scene. And we get it. This movie has flaws like all movies do, and there are some clichés thrown in there, such as the fast introduction, and the typical plot, but I encourage you to watch this with a keen eye. It is a beautiful and haunting story that isn't over-dramatized like many movies are. This one is very to the point and subtle, and you understand it all with no background knowledge. If you're looking for a raw well-done film with a rich historical background, this one is the one for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, somehow "Refreshing" seems to be the wrong word as a summary for such a movie. But, after a day in (my) work - after trying to convince other people at my working place for years to live a more solidarity, more human way with colleagues, by trying that, showing over years a good role model by myself. And yesterday, going out of the working place with the knowledge that nothing has helped - my colleagues still only interested in their own careers, without any empathy for the weak. Nothing can be changed in peoples hearts and minds after they have grown out of their childhood. And then, living in Europe, and recognizing that all politics - from left to right - get's sick and more xenophobic from day to day with the refugee-crisis fueled by inhuman politics... Yes, then such a movie is terrible refreshing. Here a writer, a director, a camera man, a cast prove that at least they care. If I would have a daughter like Emma Watson or a son like Daniel Bruhl I would be immensely proud. Yes it is acting. But, never-the-less you can see and feel - both of them care. It is highly sensible acting. A political statement in itself. Very glad, that my day ended with that relief. There are still some people out there, who care. Thanks, for that great movie. Thanks, for hope.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had too much positive feedback. Makes me wonder if the commentators / reviewers were on the payroll of the production company. It's definitely fishing for an Oscar, too bad they forgot to get a diverse cast. It just wasn't put together well at all. Plot holes abound.Time traveler, Emma Watson, arrives in a 1984 Ford passenger van to visit her boyfriend in Chile in 1973. He's a political activist and photographer who cooks bacon naked. A phone call alerts them to a Coup, they promptly walk right into it and get captured. Boyfriend gets taken to Colonia and Emma fakes joining the cult to be with him. Fortunately the cult leader doesn't suspect a thing when a stewardess in Victoria 's Secret undies wants to join the cult be with him and God. Emma befriends one woman, Doro, then inadvertently betrays her. Emma makes a new friend Ursel, who is the daughter of the den mother. Emma, boyfriend and Ursel attempt escape. Of course Ursel gets caught on a stick underwater causing a dramatic rescue scene. Ursel causes more trouble by getting herself killed by a booby trap. Our heroes escape naturally.Betrayal at the German Embassy leads to much running on stairs and hallways even stealing a luggage hauling train. Ultimately they escape from Chile and tell their story to the world, nothing happens. Aside from the where are they now captions of the major players.For what was supposed to be an historical drama this movie explained very little.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can we all just tell the story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a compelling, horrifying true story that should be told. However, Colonia was so badly done, with so many obviously fake dramatic turns that impact of the real facts is completely lost. How much stock can one put in the brutality of the torture and the complicity with the Pinochet regime if we have a fake couple, a unbelievable "rescue", and an escape even more outrageously silly than the film that it copied from??I've bought into 70's scream flicks with ketchup blood more than I did into the Colonia plot. At least in those films - incredibly stupid decisions have consequences.Wrapping a moronic and poorly told story in true events and adding some real pictures at the end does nothing to improve a bad film - it just dishonors the true heroes and victims.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If it wasn't based on a true story ....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A kind of film you want to fast forward in some places , It started good then you'll feel bored if it wasn't based on a true story I would probably just stop watching , Since I like movies based on true stories I had to wait until the end to write a review. If you are a Watson fan its fine to watch as she did fine in her performance in this movie and I wish she'll do better in future choosing a good scripts that fits her more in order to improve her acting skills , If you're not a fan of hers nor a true story movie, I really don't recommend it so only because its a true story I'll rate it as a watchable and my watchable rates starts from 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colony of abuse and lies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my review of Colonia (spoiler free)** (2/5) Cast: Emma Watson, Daniel Bruhl, Michael Nyqvist, Richenda Carey, Vicky KriepsPlot: A young woman's desperate search for her abducted boyfriend that draws her into the infamous Colonia Dignidad, a sect nobody has ever escaped from.Set in 1973 and inspired by true events you would think that this movie would have some kind of drama and/or story attached however it does not the only thing that lasts throughout the film is Lena (Watson) and Daniel's (Bruhl), chemistry but that is all that stands out. This film started as a pretty entertaining drama which escalated very unfortunately it escalated into a torturous diabolical white-knuckle entertainment film and things still take a turn for the worst. The film got its first appearance at Sundance in September 2015 and since then has had several nominations for German film awards what were they thinking? However since then it has had backlash mainly at German director Florian Gallenberger who was under wrath by Japanese Ultra-journalists by exposing, in 2009's John Rabe, the atrocities committed by the country's army in the 1937 Battle of Nanking. However since then he has been a little quiet until he released this atrocious drama. The only thing that is good about it is it has an interesting cast and great chemistry between two characters mainly Lena and Daniel but soon turns bad when Lena enters a cult, a religious cult of all things. Run by vicious antagonist Paul Schafer (Nyqvist) and then on things take a turn for the worst as this film adds torture and promotes abuse. The real Paul Schafer was imprisoned for 33 years for thousands of accounts for sexual abuse on women and children, he was imprisoned until his death in 2010. Another thing that is good about the film is the acting even though this film is absolutely terrible the acting withstands through. The best performance comes from all three main actors Emma Watson who hasn't had a big movie in a while and this is certainly better than Regression (2015) well not much. Daniel Bruhl has come heaps and bounds over the past few years mainly known for playing Niki Lauda in Rush (2013). Michael Nyqvist whose known for The Girl series the Swedish crime, drama and also Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol (2011). However this is not the film to remember them by because it's not entertaining except perhaps the beginning and the end. This film will not be receiving any Oscar glory because even the Academy have taste. Other than forcing women to women to strip, calling them whores and sluts and even calling them c**ts among other things. This film also has no character development it leads the fact of you have to research the characters but no one can be bothered to do that so this film f***ed up as it is, is lacking in the one main thing that will make it that little bit better, and entertaining is that it is missing a story, well a good one anyway and also character development we just know their names and what they do that's it. Sorry to say this but it could have been a better if not for the director and of course the cast, because they do not make it a better experience and maybe that's because the director wasn't willing to make it better and his research is terrible. So as you can see this is just an experimental drama that is trying to be better than it really is.Here are some points as to why this is a poorly made drama: Poorly directed: The director even though he tries his hardest the film just lacks potential and also drama which has been said before but it might be because his research his terrible or he hasn't got any character development attached to this pitiful mess. The lack of direction just proves that he wanted to get this out quickly and instead of actually focusing on story he focused on the try-hard drama which fails to pull through after the first ten minutes he focuses on white-knuckle entertainment which is neither white-knuckle nor entertaining. Poorly executed directions. The one thing that you can praise about him is that he managed to say what happened to these characters in real life but the only good thing about it.Poor story: If there was one the story would actually be the best thing about the film unfortunately there is no story well if there if there is it is certainly hidden and also incoherent. Poorly executed story which could have been better if it was actually there. However it is a good subject to base a true story because the subject of Paul Schafer is really hit and miss so that is another thing to praise the film for however that is all it's good for. So poor story but good subject.Pointing out that this also has the exact same ending as Argo (2012) and The Last King of Scotland (2006) where they escape a dreadful place and a plane journey home it's exactly the same. Apart from the good subject and the good acting the film lacks in all its other things that it's supposed to be good for but is not. Again what were the German Film Awards thinking?Verdict: Notwithstanding any drama or engagement this is a poorly executed film with an interesting subject, the director decided to chose the darkest episode in life and put poorly executed characters and torture in the mix.4/10 appallingly put together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story that should be a part of the history like WW1...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the movie and I am speechless, for 2 reasons:I've had basic History lessons (Europe, Belgium) and never heard even on whisper of the Colonia Dignidad. I am happy they made a movie about something that isn't well known to everybody. This story is like 'Schrindler's list' but in a smaller scale and even more modern times. 2nd I completely disagree with the people (and especially one comment (the one who rated 1/10)). This movie should not be rated below 6/10. I putted 10/10 and can understand you go lower but below 6/10 you really don't have respect and you are probably not someone who likes movies similar to this one. For the guy who reviewed with a 1/10, I think you are a bit simple. Your review is just a summary of the movie in a 'ridiculous' way. Actually it just adds nothing to people who want to know how the movie is.For me the movie was really great, the actors were good and the storyline was putted together very well. Just watch the movie and you will see it is persuading on itself how good it is.Maybe I exaggerate for some people, but it is my own opinion like I respect the opinion of the college with review 1/10.Thank you for reading, I hope you will watch the movie for sure after reading this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stereotypical and shallow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The background story about Paul Schäfer and his cult like community is intriguing and fascinating in so many ways. Wenzel and Gallenberger manage to drain their story from any depth or nuances.This is a straightforward stereotypical and shallow story about the all conquering love of a beautiful heterosexual couple, the inexplicable cruelty and grandiosity of a disgusting cult leader and the submissive ninnies who follow him.Instead of engaging character development and a curious investigation in the psychological mechanisms behind this kind of extremely controlling groups, we are served a bunch of clichés on the straight road of predictable events.</fullReview>
