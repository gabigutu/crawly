		<shortDescription>A movie with a gentle but long-lasting impression.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense enjoys being playful with our imagination. What your eyes see is not exactly what it is. What your mind paints is not exactly what there is. In the world of The Sixth Sense logic is your worst enemy.There are obvious (and sometimes less obvious) hints right in front of you but you don't grasp them because of your preconceptions and premises. I once read a novel called 'Somewhere carnal over 40 winks' which used similar techniques found in this movie, but in writing. I'm sure you will enjoy this book as much as I did, if you like to be intellectually surprised.If you haven't seen this movie, don't read reviews and don't talk to your friends who have already seen it. The movie is very much susceptible to spoilers. It is suffice to say that the ending is just shockingly delightful.I don't consider this movie heavily philosophical or thought-provoking. Having said that, it is one of the movies I love to watch again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that will not be outclassed in its genre for years to come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw The Sixth Sense, I didn't know what to expect. I guess I was looking forward to a good scary horror flick. I was very surprised. I found that the purpose for this movie was far greater than just trying to scare the audience. I found this movie was showing not only the emotions of fear, but also faith, commitment, sadness of loss, and love. The end was so surprising, I had to see it again. The second time I watched it, I did it from a totally different perspective (this is a very rare quality for any movie), and I enjoyed it just as much, or maybe even more. I also, as many viewers have, tried to detect fallacies in the story. I couldn't find one. In addition, for those that appreciate great soundtracks, the music only helps to heighten the experience of the movie.I believe that a great movie is one that helps the viewer perceive life and the world differently. The Sixth Sense is one of those extraordinary movies that does that to me. This movie reflects on some difficult subjects that will make the viewer walk away asking eternal questions. Questions about death, about letting go, about eternal love and commitment, about the love between parent and child, and between husband and wife. Maybe I read too much into this very wonderful film, but I believe it will be difficult to find a movie that has touched on these subjects so poignantly and so well for years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is a brilliant film, plain and simple. It is unique in that it relies on imagination and psychology to scare you and make you think twice about the world around you. The director did a fabulous job constructing the imagery of the film, and I genuinely did not know about the ending until it was revealed. Quite a shock! The Sixth Sense goes in my book as the single greatest psychological horror film I have ever seen. Anyone who bashes it are simply not giving it a chance or don't fully realize the complex dialog and imagery around them. Brilliant</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an incredibly powerful film. Awash with emotion but never stooping to sentimentality this is the story of one frightened little boy you will never forget. All your worst childhood nightmares: the noises in the attic, the intruder in your house, that cold breath that makes your hair stand on end are here and then some.Bruce Willis gives one of the best performances of his career as the child psychologist trying to get himself back on track after a violent encounter with a former patient and it would be a crime if Haley Joel Osment were overlooked at coming awards ceremonies for his powerful performance here. It has been a long time since a child actor displayed such maturity in a role. Cole's innocent little face hidden behind his absent father's large-framed spectacles betrays a child coming to terms with a terrifying secret in the only way he can.You don't need to go and see this film again to realise why the end is such a surprise but you will rush out to watch it again purely because it's an almost perfect example of it's genre.Laugh, cry, jump a mile out of your seat, sigh with relief - but not too early... We did!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An appropriate spoiler-free review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The surprise ending to "The Sixth Sense" has gotten so much attention that it threatens to overshadow the film. I occasionally hear people say things like the following: "The 'twist' was so obvious that I figured it out in the first five minutes!" Some of those people may even be telling the truth. There's no way to know. But there's a lot of condescension in such remarks, an implication that anyone who didn't figure it out must be a really dumb sucker. At least in my case I have an excuse. When I first saw this film back in early 2000, I knew nothing about it other than that it was about the relationship between a psychiatrist played by Bruce Willis and a child with some sort of psychic power. I didn't even know what that psychic power was, and an early scene led me to think it was telepathy. In short, I had no idea even what the movie's subject was until about the middle of the film, so I was completely adrift as to solving the movie's mystery.Still, to anyone who did figure the secret out quickly, I have this to say: you may be smarter than I am, but that does not make this a bad movie. Hitchcock went to great lengths to keep the ending to "Psycho" from leaking out. Many people who watch that film today figure the twist out (probably because it has been imitated in countless thrillers since then), but the film is still a classic that holds up well today. Surprise endings are, ultimately, just clever contrivances, extra layerings on the cake. They do not constitute the difference between a good movie and a bad movie. A movie must work on its own terms before springing a surprise.Nevertheless, there can be no denying that the twist in "The Sixth Sense" is particularly clever. It's no virtue if a twist is impossible to predict. It is just as important that the twist be logical as that it be surprising. Plenty of thrillers feature twists that are arbitrary, where the plot fails to provide enough hints. Even a clever thriller like "Fight Club" requires a bit of a stretch to accept the ending. What makes "The Sixth Sense" impressive is that it never cheats by suggesting that earlier scenes were imaginary. Everything we see is real, and only our assumptions fool us. If, however, you weren't fooled, all the better: just because you figure out the magician's trick does not make it a bad trick.Consider what appears to be happening in the film. Willis plays a psychiatrist who has received accolades for helping children with problems. We see a romantic evening with him and his wife at home. Then he gets into an ugly, violent confrontation with a former patient. Willis believes he has failed, and he wants to make amends by helping a new child (Haley Joel Osment) who appears to be having the same problems (and perhaps the same abilities) that his former patient once displayed. But just as he thinks he's making progress with Osment, his marriage seems to be falling apart. His wife isn't talking to him, and is beginning to see another man.However these events may be reinterpreted by what is revealed later, the movie is effective because it works on this basic level. In a key scene, Willis asks Osment what he wants most, and Osment answers, "I don't want to be scared anymore." It is not always clear that Osment is really facing a mortal threat. But because the movie establishes that he is undergoing a scary experience, by the time the movie reveals what it is that is frightening him, we have our emotions invested in the character, and the terror is very real to us. This is a step that most horror films neglect, the recognition that the most powerful fear may be the fear of fear itself.When I was a teenager, I assumed that all good horror films had to have an R rating. Even as an adult, I was surprised that a movie as frightening as "The Sixth Sense" received only a PG-13. In hindsight, however, most of my favorite horror films, whatever their rating, have relatively little violence. Like all good horror films, "The Sixth Sense" allows the suspense to build and does not rely on either excessive violence or cheap scares. The ending adds an additional level of intrigue, but it is not necessary to one's enjoyment during the first viewing. Still, if you have not seen the film by now and remain woefully ignorant of the surprise lurking in its plot, I urge you, before someone ruins it for you, go and watch the movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is one of those films that rarely happens these days. In other words, I knew so little about it before sitting in the cinema that it wasn't ruined before it started.I don't want to ramble on about it so I'll just say... absolute perfection. An incredible story that had me and my friends gripped from start to finish. The twist in the tale was totally unexpected as well.After it finished we sat through the whole of the credits and talked about how fabulous it was. If only more films were like this. I can't remember the last time we did that!Congratulations to all involved in this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes this film so wonderful to watch is not simply the acting, or the terror it instills, or even the plot itself. It is the way in which the writer/director M. Night Shyamalan takes his vision from the page, and carefully crafts a tale that completely absorbs the viewer. As a result, we are treated to a wealth of emotion: fear, sadness, joy, confusion, and humor, each one a compliment to the other.Haley Joel Osment delivers, plain and simple. By now, so much has been said about the young actor that any more would be repetition. Needless to say, his portrayal of Cole Sear is remarkable. His ability to communicate, through a simple look or gesture, the depths to which his character's soul has been thrust is what truly carries the film. He succeeds at this task beautifully, convincing us while never going over the top; indeed, by the time Cole utters his now-famous line, you not only believe him, you are chilled by the fact that Osment the actor may actually believe it himself.Bruce Willis turns in a stellar performance, complimenting his young co-star while never overshadowing him. It is a tribute to his respect of the material in so much as he fine tunes his delivery to seem reserved, yet not too toned down.The Sixth Sense is more than simply a wondrous two hours. It has, in effect, created a new genre of filmmaking... the film is neither drama, nor horror, nor action. Rather, it is a seamless blending of all three, a film that encompasses the best aspects of each genre, without being limited by the worst. Hollywood has taken notice of this, and one can only expect a series of poor imitations to follow. But at least they'll always have The Sixth Sense to guide the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the films of the Nineties</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is perhaps my film of the decade so far. The reasons are too numerous to go into in such a short critique. Surely there have not been too many films that can take you through the range of emotions that the Sixth Sense does. The prime emotion; fear, is a difficult emotion to generate in a modern audience that has seen it all before, but this film succeeds where others fail, praying on your imagination and generating suspense from subtle devices rather than blatant horror.It is such a relief that the performances of Willis and the excellent Osment live up to an excellently directed quality storyline. I will be disappointed if the youngster doesn't receive at least an academy nomination.I seldom go to the cinema twice to watch a film, in fact I cannot remember when I have done it before. Tonight I am taking an old friend to see this film as it will be a tragedy if he doesn't see it on the big screen. He has heard so much about it that he is reluctant to go, as I am when something is over-hyped. Just for a change though, here is a film that lives up to its billing and has you thinking about it for weeks to come. As for the twist at the end? Well it totally disorientated me, my mind spinning back throughout the whole film. A fantastic punchline to my film of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death, Lfe, Fear and Hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: The Sixth Sense, Director: M. Night ShyamalamAs a film which has undoubtedly caught the eye of the film going world, it was difficult to avoid the surrounding hype and publicity. Luckily most of the people I had spoken to who had seen the film did not spoil the 'twist' at the end, which, although is rather a laboured point by now in reviews, certainly adds to the "Oh, I see now" factor.The story revolves around a child psychologist played characteristically by Bruce Willis. I say characteristically, because although his portrayal is quite real, and at times touching, there always seems to be an unnerving 'Die Hard'-ness to his speech, lending the dialogue some comical qualities. Having said that, his overall attempts at revealing the vulnerable and disturbed psyche of his character achieve good results. As the psychologist, he is plagued by a particular event in his professional life which he perceives as his personal failure, and sets out to redeem himself by righting the wrong and wiping his failure from his conscience. This opportunity presents itself to him in the form of Cole Sear, played devastatingly well by Hayley Joel Osment. Cole has a problem, he sees dead people. To the outside world he is seen as a loner, a problem child, and has become increasingly isolated. Hence the need for a child psychologist. Once we have been introduced to these two central players, we are taken on a journey of discovery, as both of these characters in the space of the film will learn a great deal about each other, themselves and human nature.It is this particular point which the film attempts to address so strongly - human communication. That when this breaks down, an inevitable cycle of interpersonal destruction takes course, sometimes irreversible. This is framed within the context of a superbly told ghost story. The sheer truthfulness and honesty with which the concept of fear is expressed by all the characters, is breathtaking. Cole's' experience of the walking dead, appearing out of nowhere, Malcolm's fear of a deteriorating marriage, and Cole's' mother's fear relating to her own existential angst. All of these are played against the backdrop of the often difficult but finally warm relationship between Cole and Malcolm. Eventually, and against the odds, each character displays courage and bravery as they face up to their existential and supernatural fears.There are one or two niggling problems plot wise, but in a film where the overall atmosphere created is one which encompasses death, fear, and finally hope, it is impossible not to overlook incongruencies. Superb direction, acting and ambience lead me to think that M. Night Shyamalan has really succeeded in telling a chillingly touching story about the triumph of the human spirit.February 14, 2000 Harshad C. Keval</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wanna See Dead People?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I see Dead People!" Sixth Sense is well worth the ticket price. It's a tight story and the acting is outstanding. There are a couple of good scares, rendered more effective because I dropped my guard. My sixth sense says such was the Writer/Director's express intention. :-)It's a ghost story yet doesn't rely on special effects and computerization to chill your bones as the Haunting tried to do. The scares come from the sliver of possibility "what is happening may be true." Well that, and the dropping your guard thing.Everyone in the cast is outstanding. Bruce Willis is at his best since Die Hard and The Last Boy Scout. His patient is 33 years junior to him ( played by Haley Joel Osment) is outstanding. Truly. I was mesmerized by his ability to get into this "sixth sense" possessed character. Malcolm and Cole helping each other resolve their problems occurs with good chemistry, and is believable, despite the heights you have to take your mind to believe the story's premise. I am sooo tempted to give clues on when to grip the one you're with or arms rests a little more tightly; but alas, cannot in good conscience (or for fear of hate mail!) And out of respect for M. Night Shyamalan for a very good script and story thesis.Summing: if you're "only" looking for the Chill Factor, take in Blair Witch over this one for those final 10 minutes. The reality factor is stronger, both despite and because of the low budget factors. But if you want to see one of the best Hollywood manufactured horror films in a long time, give Sixth Sense a chance. I enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprising masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometime Bruce Willis can make some bad films, like HUDSON HAWK and MERCURY RISING. And other times he can make some films that change the film industry and blow the audiences away (i.e. DIE HARD triology, 12 MONKEYS, and PULP FICTION). Now Willis' new film, THE 6th SENSE falls in the latter catageory, as a surprising masterpiece that will leave images stuck in your mind for quite sometime. Willis plays Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist, who is quite good at his job, he has a loving wife named Anna (played by the beautiful Olivia Williams), and he just got awarded by the mayor of Philadelpia for his excellent work. Then one night, Malcolm gets a terrifying unexpected visit from one of his former patients. The visit is so terrifying, that it haunts Malcolm later on. Months later, Malcolm's job is going downhill, and his marriage is falling apart. Then his life is changed around when he meets Cole, a eight year old boy who is considered a "freak" by everybody but his mom. Cole is usually alone, scared, and has cuts and bruses on his body. The doctors and social workers think the injuries come from his mom, Lynn Sear (Toni Collette). But Lynn loves Cole too much that she wouldn't even think of harming him. The truth is that the injuries that Cole has are from other people, people that Cole only sees, people that are dead. Cole sees dead people walking around with the living, and only Cole sees these ghostly figures. Malcolm tries to help Cole with his unique gift, and to also find out what these ghostly figures want with him. When I saw the trailers for this movie, it looked like a o.k. movie. Acutally, the preview didn't have any effect on me at all, as for seeing this film. But when I saw this film, I was blown away on how excellent this was! This is a highly entertaining film that is scary, sad, funny, and even touching. The plot is brilliant, it has intellegence, and shows the personalities of the characters well enough that you feel like that you know them after the movie is over. The acting is also great, Willis does a good job as the doctor trying to help poor Cole. Toni Collette is also great as the suffering mom who's very worried and protective over Cole. Oliva Williams is good as well as the suffering wife of the doctor who feels that she's losing her husband more and more everyday. But the real surprise is Haley Joel Osment, who plays the little boy, Cole. For a child actor he's excellent! He shows potential to becomming a great actor in years to come. He's the next promising child actor that will hopefully do well like Elija Wood and Anna Panquin. Overall, THE 6th SENSE took me by surprised, and I ended up loving this film. I would have to place this film as one of the best films of the year, as well as for the summer films. And for a PG13 rated film, it's quite scary! This is one film that no one should miss!!! ***** (out of five)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Very Good Even When You Know The Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was hyped big-time when it came out and, if memory serves me, was a good conversation piece among those who saw it at the theater.I didn't see it for a few years afterward, on tape and now on DVD. It was very good but I didn't find it as "the greatest movie ever" as some did. It is an involving story, however, and I've come to appreciate it more with multiple viewings. I've seen it three times, the last one looking for mistakes to disprove the surprise ending....but couldn't find any. The filmmakers covered their tracks. However, a couple of scenes were misleading. Those who have seen this movie know what I'm talking about. For those who haven't, I'm not going to spoil it here.I enjoyed both Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment as the two leads. Willis has had many action-packed, profane macho roles in his career but I like him best when he's low key, as he is in here (and in "Unbreakable," to name another fairly-recent movie) The story is slow-paced but it sure is not boring. In a way, it's nice to see a slower-paced film be a big hit, as this was.Osment, meanwhile, is a terrific child actor, as he has proved in other films. He's simply one of the best of his young generation. He and Dakota Fanning are the two best child actors I've seen in many years.This isn't just some supernatural-horror movie. It's a nice human interest story. There is one scene late in the movie in which Osment's mom is having a talk with her young boy in the car. It is an extremely touching scene that brings tears - a great moment in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film For Thinking People</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A child psychologist, played by Bruce Willis, tries to help a troubled boy, played by Haley Joel Osment, who says he sees ghosts. This film could easily have been one of those dreadful fright night horror flicks played for cheap shocks, aimed at a juvenile mind. Instead, the film maker chose to tell a story of fragile human feelings, and hidden assumptions. "The Sixth Sense" thus appeals to a more mature audience.This film is carefully constructed, and deliberately slow, so that we can absorb the excellent cinematography, and have a chance to find clues that will help us avoid preconceived ideas. But our assumptions are hard to overcome, and most of us are headed for a surprise ending, an outcome which is made possible as a result of superb film editing.And the acting is well above average. I would not have cast Willis in the role of the fatherly psychologist, but he is more convincing than I would have predicted. Osment's performance is as good as I have ever seen for a child actor. And Toni Collette is totally convincing as the boy's mother. Both Osment and Collette deserved their Oscar nominations.This film may, or may not, have a subtext. I found what could be one, but then I may have been reading too much into the story. Sensitive, thought provoking, and well crafted, "The Sixth Sense" is one of the better films of the last ten years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't really want to talk a lot about this movie because I could spoil the effect. Instead, I'll talk about this filmmaker's first movie. THE SIXTH SENSE, also by M. Night Shyamalan. I first saw it in December 1999, on a 20-hour flight from Chicago to Hong Kong. My only flight out of the USA. The film really pulled me in, which I suspect is particularly difficult on an airplane. Then, the ending. Based on the article you just read, we can say that some viewers weren't surprised. Me, I was blown the heck away and wanted to see it again. Years later I finally did. I taught movie classes, this is a film I chose, and I saw it about a dozen times, fully aware of the ending. It had a bit more going for it than that. My only complaint is with people who think Bruce Willis was the star. The star is Haley Joel Osment! I may have missed out on "the surprise ending" because I was watching the kid instead of the shrink. Bruce Willis could probably star in a few more movies after he died and we'd never notice. But I digress. THE VILLAGE is about a pilgrim-style village. Some place quaint, rural, close knit and low tech. Nobody from the village goes into the surrounding woods lest they encounter Those We Do Not Speak Of. The acting was flawless and the scenery most certainly created a mood. Shyamalan is a masterful writer, director and producer. But I had trouble caring about what happened to his characters. That could've been my fault. Saturday morning at 8, Jan was working, and my goal for the day was to pack for our impending move but I was too drained to begin. The neighbor had loaned us this DVD back in February, so I figured watching it and returning it to him was a good start. (The same bad attitude that I brought to THE SIXTH SENSE, right? One of these days I'm going to watch a Shyamalan movie in the right frame of mind.) "The ending." How would you like to be a filmmaker judged solely on "the ending?" In the case of THE VILLAGE, it worked for me. I thought about this film for days after seeing it. Actually, I was trying to decide what to write in this review. How about this? "Shyamalan is a filmmaker of bold originality surviving in a commercialized medium." That's a good thing, no matter what your opinion of each individual film is. I believe some critics are panning him, but I'm not panning this one. I'm glad I saw it. I've missed a few films between THE SIXTH SENSE and THE VILLAGE, and there will be more after THE VILLAGE. I'll watch them all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Award winning child psychologist Malcolm Crowe is confronted and shot by an ex-patient. Years later he has recovered from this experience and begins to treat a child who suffers from similar problems. The young boy, Cole, claims to see dead people and requires Crowe's constant attention - to the detriment of his marriage. With Cole becoming increasingly scared and withdrawn, Crowe is his last hope.This film is an old-fashioned ghost story, replacing gore with a genuine spooky atmosphere. The story is deceptively simple and plays almost innocently for the whole film until Cole's visions are revealed. The true genius of the story isn't revealed until the final twist when we see how we have been duped by a good director! Even without the twist, this is still a good film - the story of Cole is well done and is chilling and frightening sometimes. However it is also quite human, as it is essentially the story of Cole overcoming his fears.Willis delivers a careful, understated performance. His choices in recent years have been remarkably good (with some exceptions). This is just yet another great role from a man who's career looked like it was dying after "striking distance" and "colour of night". He hits just the right note here. I'm not a big fan of child actors as a rule, but Osment is really good here - never falling into the "cute child" category. I don't know if he should have got the Oscar, but he's still good. The rest of the cast are good, but really it's the central relationship between Willis and Osment that makes this film.The plot may have some holes in (some ghosts hang around where they died, one comes to find Cole etc), but overall this is very good. The director weaves an interesting story that stands on its own, but makes it even more memorable by challenging how we accept and assume things in movies by delivering a great, clever twist at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghost Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shymalan's 'The Sixth Sense' is one of his two best movies. The skill by which the development and resolution of this bizarre and chilling classic make it a modern landmark. Just by this movie alone, Night established himself as Hitchcock's successor. To describe anything more than a bare-bones rendering of the plot would be irresponsible, but here it goes... Malcolm Crow (Bruce Willis) celebrates with his wife a recent award achieved helping counsel disturbed children. Soon he meets up with the weaknesses of his past and must suffer the consequences. For the rest of the movie he has to make it all up with a new client, Cole (Haley Joel Osment) and balance his desire to make his wife his main priority. The juggle isn't easy, and he falters, but is honest, in both attempts to make up mistakes for his past. The causality of another dimension presented is disturbing, yet fascinating. The tension of the story is counterbalanced with a heart that makes more than one plot accessible and enthralling. The performances are superb with arguably Willis' best ever. Osment, for his part, plays a prodigy as a prodigy in what has to be one of the best (if not "the" best) childhood performances on film. The supporting cast is remarkable as well. Perhaps critics have given 'The Sixth Sense' grudging praise, for it means to unveil the supernatural in a way that is meant to mirror the real world in an unflattering way. (Psychology is rendered at least overrated.) Shymalan is effective like few directors are with a film that is edited for every second to wrap around the other expertly. I see talented people...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cole is keeping a secret from his psychologist Malcolm. This secret is huge and it has to do with more than just mood issues and schizophrenia. Over the course of the movie Cole learns to trust Malcolm and tells him the secret but there is more to this secret than Malcolm really understands.I thought that this was a pretty good movie because the plot is excellent and it has a really frightening theme to it. Every time someone turned around it was pretty scary to see what was going on. It has a lot of those "jump out" sort of scares. Plus this movie is pretty excellent at building up the tension especially near the ending. It's a great movie for Halloween night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan has created something that will not, can not be outdone. This film is so simple, yet so complex. It is so out there, yet one gets a strange feeling from the film because it seems so real. The acting is amazing. Bruce Willis has never been better. Toni Collette is at the top of her game. Haley Joel Osment was robbed at the Academy Awards, because he gave in this film the single best child performance and one of the greatest performances of all time (adult or child) in this movie. The only child performances that rival his in this movie are Osment's other performances. And let's not forget Olivia Williams who had perhaps the hardest time since she had to play the part that can be viewed on two very different levels. *hint hint* Perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A perfect balance. Sad, but not self-pitying. Triumphant, but not cheesy. Frightening, but never grotesque. Shocking, but not gimmicky. Touching without being cheap. Visually it is stunning. There are some truly amazing shots, the attention to color is appreciated. Haley Joel Osment as Cole is extraordinary. What a promising career ahead of him. Bruce Willis, as a workaholic child psychologist, ought to be extremely proud of this, as it may be some of his best work. Tender, brooding, regretful, determined. Perfect. Toni Collette, is really phenomenal. I think she gets overlooked, but with any less talented actress, the film would have certainly suffered.I watched this film again recently, absolutely certain I would have lost some of the awe I had for it since last watching it on the big screen seven years ago. I was pleasantly surprised. It was just as moving, eerie, and beautiful. An obvious top five film of all time for me. Quite the freshman effort from Mr. Shayamalan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is M. Night Shyamalan first big budget and best film. It's a film that heavily relies on the creating and maintaining of a certain atmosphere. It has a psychological tension that's only broken in a few scenes( Magic trick scene ao.). A little comical relief( although there are only 2 such scenes) is very welcome to not make the story too heavy (so everyone can enjoy it). Films tend to get boring if the story is too linear.The Sixth Sense has a surprise ending ( many films will use this in the following years) but it's not all about the ending ( in contrary to certain other films that I will not name to avoid spoiling). The story on itself is very interesting but the ending is the cherry on the pie. Many who saw it the first time were in disbelief: is this right...? After re-watching it several times...yes it is. The plot is almost watertight. I suppose if you want to you can always find tiny little mistakes but I haven't found any big ones. The Sixth Sense is unbelievably well cast: Bruce Willis delivers his 2nd best performance( 12 Monkeys is his best), debutant Haley Joel Osment is excellent( his performance in A.I is also excellent, other movies of his were mostly disappointing performances), Toni Colette delivers the first in a long series of Oscar-worthy performances (also see The Night Listener, The Hours, Little Miss Sunshine ao. ) and the performance of Donnie Wahlberg musn't be forgotten even though he only gets 3 minutes of screen time. Olivia Williams may be the only lesser performance in the lead cast but she still does an OK job. We can see several Shyamalan's trademarks for the first time: He uses very natural colors( brown, white, gray, beige, green) in the interiors and clothing. Another trademark for his work is the fragmentary use of a rich red color to break with the dull colors in the background. He doesn't overuse the red so it preserves its power. We can also see Shyamalan's excellent use of colors in The Village ( even more then in the sixth sense): red stands for evil,misfortune and fear while yellow stands for weakness. The Village is M. Night's third best film in my opinion (Unbreakable is the one that closest approaches TSS brilliance). It's also unbelievably well-acted, the story is strong, the settings are beautiful...definitely worth watching ( if hope you have seen it but if you haven't...you know what to do). It's a bit under-appreciated on IMDb but don't let that fool you.I'm no direction expert but I found it to be brilliant. The brilliance lies in the details; the excellent use of mirrors and shadows, the lighting, eccentric camera viewpoints,...it's a delight for a filmenthousiast( like yours truly) to watch. You can feel Shyamalan is both writer and director; he knows exactly what to do with the material and which camera shot would be best for which scene.What makes The Sixth Sense into a brilliant film( what distinguishes it from other great films)? It's hard to explain but it's a magical film to watch. Certainly one of my personal favorite films. 10/10 for this flawless piece of brilliance !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon first watch of The Sixth Sense, I was hooked and shocked at the same time. I expected a complete horror story, mixed with the usual gore and stomach-churning scenes we ordinarily witness in other movies with a similar theme. The Sixth Sense is anything but. It details the emotional aspects of love and devotion, as well as having to cope with being an outsider.The purpose of The Sixth Sense is to captivate us into looking and evaluating our own lives, on how we treat ourselves, our husbands and wives and our parents and friends. It details these points to graphic effect.Young Haley Joel Osment is terrific as Cole, the young boy who sees 'dead people', and portrays his emotions and his mind to an easily captivating audience. Also wonderful to see Bruce Willis turn away from his usual 'action man' sequence to allow us into the equally troubled mind of Dr. Malcolm Crowe.A divine and heartwarming film combining elements of horror and suspense has made The Sixth Sense an engaging film that is simply unforgettable. It's another firm favourite of mine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all know the ending by now, so I won't pretend no one knows how it ends. A suspenseful return back into the world of ghost stories carries The Sixth Sense, the first major film success by M. Night Shyamalan. The film revolves around a child, Cole Sear, who is socially awkward mainly because he can see ghosts and struggles with that each day, played by Haley Joel Osment in an Oscar Award nominated role. Bruce Willis plays Malcome Crowe, a child case worker who invests all of his time into Cole. As he investigates what is happening, he finds that he has come across a case similar to Cole's in the past, but is no nearer to figuring out how to help him. The human drama of a case worker trying to figure out what is wrong with his patient keeps the movie going, allowing Shyamalan to drop the clues throughout the movie about the ending. I have to admit I was blown away by the ending, but looking back, I should have known better, and many audiences were able to figure it all out. Some say that if you look at the movie logically, it does not hold water, but that is not the point. The movie is not about logic, but rather the experience as a viewer, watching what the director gives us, as we only see what he wants us to see. The Sixth Sense also boasts a strong soundtrack and looks good, setting a mood that gets the audience in the right frame of mind to be spooked, though it's not a horror movie. Suspenseful, smart, and well directed, The Sixth Sense is an achievement not to be underestimated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cole (Haley Joel Osment) is a young boy troubled by an affliction, he can see the dead all around him, for much of the time and he is labelled a freak by everyone except his mother. Haley Joel Osment puts in such a fine performance in this role, it is hard to believe he is a child.Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a highly acclaimed child psychologist, who's relationship with his wife is in trouble and his ability in his profession is diminished as a result. A different role for Willis, but he proves he doesn't have to be all action all of the time, with his remarkable performance.Crowe becomes Cole's therapist, and is faced with personal demons from a previous patient of his, a very similar patient to Cole, and Crowe has to figure out how to help him, however horrific the truth is.M. Night Shyamalan both wrote and directed this movie, and he helps provide an Ora that is extremely tense and spine chilling throughout.All in all the movie was very good in every way and would have scored 7 or 8 as a supernatural thriller, but then came the ending, well it's more of a revelation. It is simply wonderful, and you will want to see the film again, to find out exactly how they hid it from you, and the fact is they hid it well and didn't cheat in the slightest.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I've read a few comments about the pace of this movie being too slow. I sort of agree with that, but I think it's refreshing to have a movie which takes its time and builds things with subtlety(although here, as I said before, I think it took a little TOO much time). And I think it was realistic at how long it took for the boy to learn to trust the doctor and for how long it took the doctor to discover what was really going on.Having said all that, in addition to the pace, there were some times when I felt a little queasy, like I wasn't sure what exactly the movie was trying to say. At other times, I was caught up in it, especially in the performances of Willis and Osment. Then came the famous twist ending, and I will tell you that I was quite surprised, and it's making me turn the movie over and over again in my mind. I probably will have to see this again. Overall, while I don't think it's the best of the year, it is a good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is one of those movies that once you've seen it the first time, you're never going to be able to watch it the same way again, due to the gasp-worthy twist near the end. So, in that sense, it's sort of a one-time deal. I still remember how I actually did gasp, and feel this jolt of shock go through me, when watching it at the cinema and realising the truth of the situation. And while I can never recapture that feeling when watching this film again, I do still get a lot out of it while re-watching.I love Bruce Willis's role in this film, in that it's so unlike any of his other stuff that I've seen (i.e. not action). And although now whenever I hear Haley Joel Osment's name I think of Supernatural (heh), I still think he was incredible in this movie. He put the Harry Potter kids to shame, and it's hard to believe he could be so amazing at the age he was.Amazing film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth sense has been hailed by some as one of the greatest horror stories ever put on film. But I must disagree. I won't deny that I enjoyed the film, but to compare it to Rosemary's baby, Psycho, or The Omen... well, it just can't be done.The Sixth sense revolves around a psychiatrist(Bruce Willis) who is asked to investigate a disturbed child named Cole(Haley Joel Osment). Cole has been having some odd behavior, and the reason why is that he is haunted by ghosts.The Sixth sense, if you've never seen it, has a brilliant twist. Unfortunately, most people have probably blown it for those who haven't seen it. But at the time the twist was brilliant. Also, I loved the ending, and the overall message. And the film has got some chilling moments, and very good performances. Osment obviously steals the show, but Willis is strong too.But you can't sit there and tell me that this film was Oscar worthy. There were plenty of films in 1999 that deserved it more than this. Magnolia, Being John Malkovich, Election, all great films. You could probably sit M. Night Shamylan down in a room and watch Magnolia and he would probably say it was a ton better. And thats because it was.The Sixth sense is a good film, but its another Oscar nominee that just doesn't deserve it. Osment deserved a nomination, and Toni Collette, who was snubbed, would have deserved one too. But the rest is unnecessary. Good, but overrated.B+</fullReview>

The ending if you have not already found out from someone is shocking and unforgettable. The movie is also terrifying so i do not recommend this movie for the faint hearted! Haley Joel Osmont was simply excellent in this movie. It is a shame that puberty really was not good on him but his performance was impressive and convincing as the boy with 'the sixth sense.' For those wondering what the sixth sense is, well it is the ability to see dead people! Toni Collette was also very convincing as the mother who is left confused and suspicious of her son and his secret. All the other support cast are very good as well. (Look out for Mischa Barton from the O.C.) Definitely a must see. And for those who have seen this see my review for 'The Others' another top notch thriller!</fullReview>

Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment play the most believable characters in this film. We follow the story of a young boy, an "outsider", open up his story, fear and trust to a distressed child psychologist. You will be amazed as you follow the boy deeper and deeper to unveiling his secret.The acting is amazing, and the plot is thick which will literally make you sit on the edge of your seat.But at all costs, do NOT watch it on television.

Look at the clothes, hear the music, the references to Pedia Ease and the musical Cats!!! In the bathroom, Vincent tells the Dr. he has waited 10 years since he was treated by the Dr.! The gray hair is too obvious. But, the Vincent and Cole characters have the same "sense" as well as both say people see them as freaks. Also, both characters plead with Dr. Malcolm not to fail them. Just before Dr. is shot, he tells Vincent he wants a chance to help him, then he is given the opportunity after his death. Ultimately, he does help Cole/Vincent. Cole helps Dr. Malcolm say what needs to be said to his wife as well. With each script, M. has become less dense. I do not know if that is bad or good. But, I am a great fan of M.'s work. Sixth Sense is his richest screenplay and film.</fullReview>

Of course, the twist at the end *SPOILER*(with Crow being dead)*SPOILER END* is one of the most startling revelations a movie has shown me plot-wise, and I know only maybe two people who predicted it would happen (one of which is my mother.) A really great movie, highly suggested for Thriller lovers and who are new to Shyamalan's work. If you don't like gore, not to worry! Hardly any gore here. P.S. Look for the color Red!</fullReview>

After Vincent shoots Crowe in the stomach and kills himself, Crowe can't stop thinking about it. A few months later he is hired to help a troubled boy named Cole Sear, who has many of the same problems Vincent had. Crowe sees a chance to redeem himself, but doubts his ability to reach the boy, particularly when Cole claims to see ghosts who don't know they're dead.Right off, I'll say this is one of the best films ever. It currently ranks #3 for M. Night's films. I love this movie because it's a really good ghost story and has a thought-provoking plot.Yeah, this film was famous so I already knew the ending before it even happened but that didn't distract me from watching the movie. Throughout the movie is a masterpiece.The acting by Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, and Toni Collette were all fantastic and some like Olivia Williams and Donnie Wahlberg were all great, too.If you want an intelligent ghost movie with some scares and twists and turns, this is the movie for you. It's not just a plain old stupid scary movie. It has a story and great acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense was deservedly a surprising Hollywood sensation. It is of course remembered for its amazing and shocking ending. I can tell you though, there is much more to this film than just the ending.People who say The Sixth Sense is rubbish because the ending is obvious and they figured it out are just being stupid and they don't know what they are talking about. I have watched films before knowing the ending, and have still enjoyed them as much as anyone. The ending is there for you to see throughout the film, but it is still hard to figure out - a bit like the twist in Fight Club. Even without the great ending though, this film would still be excellent. Bruce Willis has proved once again that he has many more strings to his bow than just action hero John McClane that made him famous, as he puts in a wonderful performance as a doctor haunted by his past. The script and direction by M. Night Shyamalan is also very good. Despite these two great performances though, the stand out has to be Haley Joel Osment as the disturbed young boy. He is really freaky, and he really captures how scared his character would probably be in real life.The huge twist ending does divert attention from the rest of the film, but the rest of the film should not be forgotten. If you haven't watched this yet, you will not just be sat there waiting for the ending, the whole storyline is a compelling and disturbing drama. It is a film to watch more than once, as the ending does fit in perfectly with the storyline before it. The ending of Unbreakable is about as shocking, but I don't think Shyamalan will ever make another film as good as this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd be the first to tell you that I avoid thriller or any movie that even smacks of suspense. I don't handle it well and I'm not particularly fond of blood and gore. (I almost passed out when the doctor needed a blood sample.) It's not that I don't appreciate a good suspenseful movie, but current movie tend to be more than I can handle. But The Sixth Sense is a movie that kept the suspense and didn't have the gore. I was riveted from the moment it started. Bruce Willis was great as the doctor and the rest of the cast was outstanding as well. However, what makes the movie great were the writing and the direction. The story keeps you interested and on the edge of your seat. I don't believe in esp or ghosts, but the writing made the concepts seem realistic and believable. There are few red herrings and the surprise at the end of the movie really was a surprise. The direction of the movie probably was the strongest point. The movie is quiet with few loud, screeching moments ? like many horror movies, such as Halloween or any of the many Friday the 13th flicks ? which makes it even more suspenseful. This is a must see for any suspense fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Sixth Sense" is the first horror film I know of that also works as a tear-jerker. A "creepy weepy," you might even call it; the darnedest thing about that combination being how well it plays here.Child psychiatrist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is trying to recover his professional equilibrium after one of his most traumatic cases came to a fatal end. Enter Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a young boy who struggles with his peers, is called a "freak," and draws horrible images until he is called into a meeting about it. Now he just draws pictures of rainbows, not because his heart's in it, but because "they don't have meetings about rainbows." Underneath the surface, it's anything but rainbows for poor Cole."The Sixth Sense" has become a prisoner of its popularity the same way "Titanic" and "Jerry Maguire" have, marked for ridicule by those who think themselves better than the hoi polloi who made it such a hit. Even people who haven't seen "Sixth Sense" know its catchphrases and storyline, and with that familiarity comes contempt, especially as its director, M. Night Shyamalan, has struggled in recent years to repeat his success. In such an atmosphere, it's easy to overlook that the one thing that makes "Sixth Sense" so popular is that it's so incredibly good.The art of storytelling is at the heart of the film, the way it quietly unfolds at its own pace, pulling you in with eerie moments and occasional shocks to a place that gets deeper as you get closer. Cole explains at one point to Dr. Crowe that the trick to a good story is that it have "some twists and stuff." People who downgrade "The Sixth Sense" do so on the basis of the twists, which was what got the film so talked about in the first place. But it's the other "stuff" that makes "Sixth Sense" so lasting and compelling for its fans.Take it from me: I watched "Sixth Sense" for the first time just over a year ago. By then its much ballyhooed "secret" was out of the bag for me, just as it probably is for you even if you haven't yet seen this film. The film took me for a ride anyway, because of Shyamalan's soft-yet-penetrating eye; incredible acting led by Osment, Willis, and Toni Collette as Cole's mom; and its sentimental-yet-spooky atmosphere.Every scene is shot with a certain style that makes it compelling not just as horror but as a slice of life, and this constant balance makes the film such a marvel. Even as it slips out of everyday reality into the utterly fantastic, it does so in a way you never notice your feet leaving the ground. Moments of fright are alleviated with humor and warmth.Something else needs to be said of "Sixth Sense," that despite its horror theme it's a positive, inspirational film, one that on its own terms gives "Passion Of The Christ" a run for its money in terms of connecting to the deepest feelings of many of its viewers.Yes, Shyamalan does gild the lily too much at times, tying up things that don't need tying up, and you can feel your heartstrings being tugged at a little too much at points. There may be a couple of minor plot holes visible on a second viewing. But still, at the very least the end result is one terrific piece of entertainment, and probably very much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a great psychological thriller! The acting, directing, and script will really make you think. This is one of Shyamalan's best, he makes the story twist and turn like never before. It is about young Cole Sear(Haley Joel Osment), a boy who can see and talk to spirits who are left on earth unseen until they discover they're dead. Cole meets Dr. Malcolm Crowe(Bruce Willis), a child theripist who tries to help Cole when he finds out his secret. This story is so unpredictable is will keep you at the edge of your seat. It made a whopping 293m$ at the box office, the critics rave about its intense story and superb acting. Highly recommended to anyone who likes mystery drama thrillers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and Terrifying.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unknown director M. Night Shyamalan's third film surprised everyone by becoming one of the most successful horror/thriller movies of all time. Bruce Willis ('Die Hard,' 1988) plays Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a disheartened child psychologist who can no longer talk to his wife, and is haunted by the memories of a former patient he couldn't help.When he discovers young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment, 'Artificial Intelligence: AI,' 2002), a child with strikingly similar psychological problems to the boy he had previously failed, Crowe is determined assist him. However, Cole harbours a terrifying secret that is simply too shocking to believe: he can see dead people!Shyamalan's beautiful and terrifying masterpiece was nominated for a very respectable six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress for Australian Toni Collette ('Muriel's Wedding,' 1994) as Cole's worried and confused mother, and Best Supporting Actor for the brilliant Osment, at the age of just 11. Willis is also very good, turning in an appropriately understated performance that often eludes critical recognition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a Philadelphia psychiatrist meeting with Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a boy who can - OK, I'll say it this one last time - see dead people. While too many horror flicks have relied on gore, this one relies on the subconscious, and other things that we don't realize. And of course, there's the ending. I literally did not see that coming, although there were a number of clues throughout the movie. All that I can say is, you are going to have your mind blown. M. Night Shyamalan truly created an impressive piece of cinema history here, and of his later movies, only "Unbreakable" came close to equalling this one's quality.On another note, I think that it was appropriate that "The Sixth Sense" came out in 1999, when I was 15. It was named by Entertainment Weekly as one of the many movies that year that revolutionized the movie industry (along with "Election", "The Blair Witch Project", "American Beauty" and "Being John Malkovich"). Similarly, in 1967, when my parents were 15, movies such as "In the Heat of the Night", "Bonnie and Clyde" and "The Graduate" - all revolutionizing the movie industry - were released. Some things just work out perfectly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those things only work, and only matter, because they serve a story in "The Sixth Sense" that is genuinely emotionally affecting. You care about what happens to Cole Sear, so hauntingly played by Haley Joel Osment, and you want to see Dr. Malcolm Crowe(Bruce Willis, in arguably his best performance) help him. You believe every second of Toni Collette's brilliant performance as Cole's mother, a woman pushed to her limits of worry and grief. In short, "The Sixth Sense" is that rare Hollywood thriller that isn't about the plot so much as it's about the characters, and that's why it works.</fullReview>

I recently bought it on DVD, but I haven't watched it, as it is very hard to start, and nearly impossible to stop.

Movie totally got under my skin, and hit that one nerve capable of stirring the sleeping primal fear. It's all woven around a very interesting and convincing drama, the scariness complimenting the drama and vice versa, just extremely well done. Bruce Willis is one of those guys that you know is a total cheese ball, yet most of his work is pretty damn good. He's great, the kid is great, the two female leads both excellent. All around top notch, no criticisms whatsoever. Oh yeah, the famous ending is probably the best twist since Dr. Calgari. Rod Serling would be proud.

With this magnificent movie, the concept of psiychological terror is reinvented, through the eyes of the amazing Haley Joel Osment, which drives the movie forward.

He's also in the midst of his most difficult case yet in trying to get through to a troubled, introverted young boy (an exceptional Osment) who lives in fear and trauma of his uncanny ability to see the dead. One of the most effective thrillers of its time: gripping, suspenseful, flawlessly performed, and extremely well-crafted, with sure-handed direction that allows for plenty of spooky, spine-chilling moments on its way to a startling and awe-inspiring finale.

The surprise ending really IS a surprise, and works even better on multiple viewings. I think that this film really is about the profound human need for communication, connection, and most of all for compassion. The Sixth Sense transcends its genre, as do most classics, and I do think that this one is going to a classic. Bruce Willis proves once again that he can act, despite what his detractors would have us believe. Haley Joel Osment-- in one of the truly great child performances-- is wonderful. Bravo!

		<fullReview>First off, I think this is a great movie, and my opinion of it hasn't diminished with multiple viewings. It's a shame Osment only nabbed a Best Supporting nod; whatever you thought of his performance here -- and the praise seems pretty unanimous -- he certainly carried enough of the movie to be considered in the Best Actor category.Now, as for all these complaints about the supposed plot/logic holes in the movie...*** SPOILERS ***I can't believe how many comments here have echoed the same complaint: "How could Malcolm not know he was dead? Didn't he ever try to eat / talk to his wife / change his clothes / go the bathroom / etc?". I thought it was implicitly understood that Malcolm saw whatever he wanted/needed to see, in order to maintain the illusion of his former life. Whether he subconsciously knew the truth, I don't know, but it's the only explanation for how he could have ignored the above issues. In fact, the end montage showed an example of this, when Malcolm finally noticed the desk blocking the basement door (the same basement he'd been coming and going from every day).Sure, it's a catch-all solution, but I don't think it's a cop-out; it even makes sense within the context of the story. Otherwise, as everyone's pointed out, how could he *not* know he was dead? He'd have realized something was wrong the first time he tried to talk to anyone, or touch anything.And as for being able to break the window that one time... I thought the ghosts all had limited physical ability when they were under stress? Isn't that how Cole got his scratches and bruises?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh dear I was so looking forward to being scared and surprised by this movie. I knew it was a huge twist at the end movie but sadly I figured it out after the opening scene. Once you have figured it out you can't go back and enjoy the movie. It is wasted on you and you're left wondering why the twit next to you can't grasp it. The whole movie is very carefully put together to hide the ending, every word and movement has been painstakingly choreographed (especially in the restaurant) but all I wanted to was shout " don't you get it, **** ********* *********!!!!!" Still there are a few creepy moments and the spirits range from scary to gross to downright hilarious looking (the cyclist made us laugh out loud, what an expression!) Collette is very good and a scene towards the end is beautifully played by her and the kid who is also great. Bruce's wife in the movie is painfully underwritten once the movie gets going but maybe they had to do this as it was the scenes between her and Willis that were most likely to give the gme away. Bruce is okay, but you do expect him to go and shoot some ghouls at any minute, no action in this though. All in all not a bad movie and if like most you remain in the dark you should get a pleasent surprise, but shame on you for being so slow in the first place!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sixth Sense phenomenon.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Child psychiatrist Malcolm Crowe takes on the case of a deeply troubled boy named Cole Sear. At first Cole is reluctant to be helped, but as Malcolm gets closer to the boy, Malcolm learns the root of Cole's fears, he claims he sees ghosts.The Sixth Sense was a monster hit back in 1999, a deftly crafted ghost story with a kicker that was talked about by all and sundry, the box office bulged and the critics did rave. Nowadays you will find hundreds of people proclaiming that the film is boringly formulaic, that they worked out the films premise easily in the first quarter of the film, or that the film is a mere clich, funny how I don't remember it like that back in 1999! The box office bulged because many went to see the film more than once, they went {myself included} back to see just how director M. Night Shyamalan {Academy Award Nominated Best Director} managed to bluff us and pull the rug from under our feet. I remember vividly both times I saw it in the cinema, the crucial turning point of the piece bringing a collective audible gasp from the viewers sunken in their respective seats, that's the sort of impact that carries a films reputation far and wide, and that's the reason why I will never rate the film lower than 10/10.Repeat viewings of The Sixth Sense obviously dim its star appeal because we know the tricks of the directors trade, but the film still ranks to me as one of the best of its type for so many other reasons rarely mentioned. The writing from Shyamalan {Academy Award Nominated Best Screenplay} is surprisingly complex, the piece masquerading as a horror picture is emotionally charged, linking children with the paranormal thru loss and a need for understanding, the need for closure of unresolved differences, but chiefly and crucial to the films heart is the message of connection before it's too late.The performances are incredible, Bruce Willis as Malcolm Crowe is perfectly understated, all the pointers for the denouement are there for us to see, but such is the actors performance, and we now know he is cutely having to play his cards close to his chest, are hidden from us until the revisit of the picture reveals it all. Hayley Joel Osment {Academy Award Nominated Best Supporting Actor} is wonderful, for a child performance in a film of this type to not be over sentimental, is quite an achievement. Sympathetic Cole may be, but Osment never lets it become less than the accepted level of child vulnerability. Rounding out the great trio of leads is Toni Collette {Academy Award Nominated Best Supporting Actress} as Cole's mother, Lynn, fabulous in portraying the love and confusion in Cole's troubled world, this story arc between the two is expertly realised. The direction from Shyamalan is very restrained, forgoing out and out shock value for periods of disquiet, he uses sounds to make the audience sense the unease unfolding in this creepy tale, while his camera work, full of draw ins and pull outs-and subtle side shifts, is adroitly in tone with the narrative. The score from James Newton Howard flits beautifully between the uneasy periods and the sustained moments of query, while Tak Fujimoto's cinematography puts a gorgeous funereal texture over this part of Philadelphia.If you haven't seen it then don't believe the naysayers, because The Sixth Sense deserved every penny/cent it made, its a wonderful, creepy, and yes, at times, a beautiful picture. A film that still ranks as one of the best ghost stories ever crafted. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is set in Piladelphia where child psychologist Dr Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) &amp; his wife Anna (Olivia Williams) are enjoying a quiet evening in when one of Malcolm's former patients Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg) breaks into his house &amp; shoots him... Jump forward to 'The Next Fall' &amp; Malcolm has a new patient, a young troubled boy named Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) who is withdrawn, isolated &amp; seems unhappy. As Malcolm befriends Cole &amp; earns his trust Cole confesses a shocking secret that may well have a great impact on Malcolm himself...Written &amp; directed by M. Night Shyamalan The Sixth Sense was a huge hit back in '99 with 6 Oscar nominations &amp; it became only the fourth horror film to be nominated for best picture, as a film it is as good as ever. The script is somewhat slow &amp; deliberately paced, The Sixth Sense relies on quality storytelling &amp; strong character's for it's impact &amp; entertainment value rather than the recent trend of Hollywood horror films that want to incorporate as many fancy expensive computer graphics as they can. The much talked about &amp; often spoiled twist ending is highly effective especially if you are unaware of it. The character's are well developed &amp; you actually care for them which makes the film what it is, the dialogue is good &amp; I can't remember a single swear word in it. The Sixth Sense is a fantastic modern day ghost story that hits all the right notes &amp; may even bring a tear to a few people's eyes. The only negative is that I don't like long films which The Sixth Sense feels like, that's not a specific problem I suppose as it's a personal preference that I just don't like long films as I lose interest very quickly &amp; that's just the way I am so if your looking for explosions, fights &amp; car chases every five minutes you'd best give this one a miss. When all said &amp; done for what it is it's still a great film though.Director Shyamalan does a functional job, there's no flashy camera-work here but again this is a film which relies on good storytelling &amp; character's that is set in the real world. Keeping things very low key works well. There's a good atmosphere &amp; some pretty creepy scenes.With a supposed budget of $55,000,000 I don't quite know where the money went &amp; The Sixth Sense doesn't look like it cost 55 big ones. It's flawlessly made &amp; has great production values. The acting is fantastic &amp; everyone puts in a heartfelt performance.The Sixth Sense is a great horror film, there's the odd scare, some great performances, an absorbing &amp; engaging story together with a classic twist ending. Well worth a watch, definitely recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here comes Bruce Willis again in the skin of a rescuer! But unlike "the fifth element" and "armageddon", he mustn't save the whole wide world. Neither, must he save a group of persons from a terrorist threat as it was the case with "die hard. No, he simply must save a little boy called Cole, haunted by morbid visions and Willis, a reputable psychologist tries hard to heal him... With "fight club" and "the blair witch project", "the sixth sense" ranks among the best movies made in 1999. It also ranks among the movies that you must watch several times before really appreciating it. If you're watching this movie for the first time, you might be disappointed because there are numerous details that can escape your attention and however, they are important for the development of the story. The same thing can also be said for a few scenes, especially the one when Willis is in a restaurant with his wife facing him... Because the main strength of the movie is its screenplay. Rarely, a movie has been so well served by a watertight screenplay. It's disconcerting, disturbing and however perfectly coherent. For a long part, the movie is a beautiful "trompe l'oeil". On another hand, it's a pleasure to see Bruce Willis get out of his usual roles where he mostly plays the he-man. In "the sixth sense", it's obvious that he's between the hands of a conscientious and well-organized director. But he isn't the main center of the movie. This place goes to Haley Joel Osment. His performance in the role of a tormented and neurotic boy is extraordinary. Besides, he can be considered as a faraway cousin of Danny, the little boy in Kubrick's "shining" because they've got a common point: an odd power supernatural and all in all, the dead people who haunt Cole aren't so terrible as they look like: they're simply asking him for help... At the end, a fascinating movie held up by two great actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the ultimate twist ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This might be the spoiler to beat all spoilers- Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), one of the two main characters in 'The Sixth Sense,' is actually dead through most of the movie and the audience doesn't know it. Thanks to an extremely clever and manipulative plot and a spectacularly successful twist ending, most people ended up going back to see 'The Sixth Sense' a second time, just to pick up all the 'clues' they missed the first time, and which are indeed there for anyone to see. The thing is, hardly anyone does. The movie was M. Night Shyamalan's breakthrough success, grossing over $600 million worldwide (all those second and third viewings helped big-time) and one wonders if it wasn't at least partially a fluke. With the exception of 'Signs,' none of his other films has been a success, either critically or at the box office. The approach that worked so well in 'Sixth Sense' does not appear to be readily transferable to other material. But 'Sixth Sense' is a certifiable masterpiece of horror and suspense. It benefits greatly from young Haley Joel Osment's totally believable performance as Cole Sear, the nine-year-old boy who "sees dead people." The state of anxiety and fear he lives in is transmitted to the audience beyond the point of feeling sympathy for him; we actually come to feel the emotions he feels. No one except Cole can see the dead, but Shyamalan does not resort to trickery or suggestion in this regard: the deceased are right out in the open for the audience to see. One might think this would be the film's fatal flaw. It is certainly audacious. At one point in 'Sixth Sense,' when Dr. Crowe asks Cole if there are any dead persons present, the boy says there are, and sure enough, in the background are three gruesomely made-up figures hanging from the rafters. Similarly, later on, when a cyclist is killed in an accident and Cole and his mother are stuck in traffic as a result, the dead cyclist is shown standing right outside their car, peering in the passenger window. Cole's expression seems to be one of "here we go again," and is almost grimly humorous. But it all works and somehow proves to be very frightening. This straightforward approach to things that are usually only hinted at or seen in fleeting glimpses (one might contrast this with the first 'Alien' film, where the creature is never fully seen till the very end) turns out to be quite refreshing and most effective. Bruce Willis underplays his character, which is essential for the ending to work. Throughout the film, we are led to believe that his marriage is at the end of its rope, and that his wife's refusal to speak to him or even acknowledge him is simply a manifestation of that fact. All of this is masterfully played out and when at the climax, we learn his wife has never answered him because he hasn't been there, it comes as a complete shock. If AFI ever does a list of '100 Greatest Surprise Endings,' 'The Sixth Sense' will surely top the list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did nothing for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching The Happening and declaring that one of the funniest comedies to come out in the past 10 years, my brother practically begged me to watch this so I could understand what people are talking about when they talk about how M Night Shyamalan was a director that quickly became less and less good. I'll say this is a lot better then The Happening (in the sense if I was entertained, it would be by things that were intentional) but... I didn't really like it.After a child psychologist is shot by a previous patient he tries to make up for that mistake by trying to reach out to a troubled kid named Cole, everybody at his school calls him a freak and he is pretty distant from everybody else around him. The psychologist does all he can until he finds out he can see the spirits of ghosts.Okay, most people remember this movie for it's twist ending and simply put, if you know the twist before seeing it, this becomes a very shallow experience, I could say I saw it coming considering signs earlier as well (in order to not be an asshole I won't say what those signs were). It was almost exactly at the point where Cole says he can see dead people I thought back and guessed it.Oh and... This movie isn't scary either. It's most known for being a ghost story but there are no jump-scares, no atmosphere, nothing to keep an audience member on the edge of their seat until he says "I see dead people" when the movie is a little under halfway through. I also don't see the point of the "Stuttering Stanley" scene, it just gives us context for the scare when Cole sees the hanged people.Okay onto what I liked. First of all, the idea is very good. Haley-Joel Osment is very good in this movie and so is Bruce Willis, definitely showing more dramatic range then the early stuff I've seen of his pre-Die Hard. I will say I did like the clues leading to the twist.Okay, this is something I know of the reputation and huge popularity it has but honestly, while I will say this is Shyamalan's better of the 2 of his movies I've seen, this just did nothing for me. I'd say maybe check it out but for me, aside from the twist there isn't really that much here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I'd love to ask if we're seriously supposed to expect any surprise ending. Frankly, that's one of my biggest disappointments in the genre of mystery/thriller. Maybe I'd be so experienced to such plots. But I was able to estimate what would occur at the end of the movie from the first scene of it. It didn't surprise me at all. Yet, it could be a success. However, the young man in the beginning, the little boy who can see and communicate with the dead, even Malcolm's wife... All didn't make sense. If we have to exaggerate, what about Malcolm's being a psychologist? Its scenario actually moved on and ended like The Jacket (2005), Jacob's Ladder (1990). I didn't see any difference between the three of them; "A dead man's mind plot". In order to summarize; high expectations, full of disappointments.</fullReview>

If this film had been made in Britain or Europe with actors who can act, it would have been wonderful. Brucie is a 'deez' 'dem' 'doze' guy. He's always in an action film no matter what he does. He can barely read the script. The young boy in the story and his mother are great, but Willis' presence knocks them down every time. He turns what could be a nice scary thriller into comic book stuff. He's especially awful during his scenes where he has to show some emotion. One can only think of the line about early Hepburn, "Let's go see Katharine Hepburn act the gamut from A to B." Willis is more like 'A to A minus'. He's terrible when he talks. Imagine Stallone playing a psychiatrist and you get the picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is the movie that put certain M. Night Shyamalan to the map. I heard that this is an amazing movie and maybe my expectations were a bit high cause I didn't enjoy it.It's about a boy who sees terrible visions and a child psychologist who is trying to help him. I didn't like the story. I know Shyamalan tends to have twists in his movies, but the twist in this one didn't impress me. Maybe I spoiled the viewing experience for myself since I knew to look for the twist. Maybe I should have seen this movie when it came out to enjoy it more. Much of this comes down to my personal preference. And to be honest I don't like Shyamalan's directional style. The long takes were not that good. I didn't like his framing either.The movie was okay on the acting front. I liked Haley Joel Osment's performance. Bruce Willis and the rest of the cast were okay. M. Night Shyamalan made a brief appearance, which didn't really make me hold my breath.The good thing about the movie is it's overall creepiness and sense of fear. There were couple of jump scares that made me cringe. Having too much jump scares isn't necessarily a good thing, but the movie doesn't rely on them. Sometimes this movie reminded me about Shining with the hallucinations and everything. And no surprise here: I thought Kubrick did it much better.Some things don't appeal to everyone and this movie is an example. I just couldn't make myself to like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoy ghost movies, and this one has to be one of the best.I knew that Bruce Willis's character was going to turn out to be dead -- from the moment the kid announces that he can see ghosts. I thought that his character a bit one-dimensional, though. I'm not sure whether the acting or character development is to blame.The movie is pretty good on the whole, but the amount of inexcusable gaping plot holes is ridiculous... such as: - How did he go one whole year without speaking to anyone or being acknowledged by anyone (except the little boy), and not figure out that something is wrong? - He lives with his wife, and... for a whole year, they manage to co-exist in the same household -- without interacting? Not believable.- So Bruce Willis is a ghost, so why can't he see other ghosts? - The boy knows that his "therapist" is a ghost, but he doesn't tell him, and he's not afraid of him the way he is of all the other ghosts.- How did he get assigned to treat that kid? Who'd hire a ghost? How did he collect his salary? How did he interact with the kid's Mom, and whom did he pass his assessments to? - How did a ghost manage to use audio tapes and a PC? We see that he writes and prints out reports. How is that possible for a ghost to do? Basically, there are MANY a plot hole here...But! It doesn't alter the fact that the movie is entertaining and enjoyable. The kid's acting was impeccable. I have never seen such outstanding performance by a child actor (or even a professional adult actor). I was very impressed.I think the movie deserves the high rating. Definitely far superior to the lousy "Paranormal Activity" franchise. The latter is just a lame joke compared to this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would say The Sixth Sense in one of the best Horror movies ever made without trying to use a lot of special effects. MNS really tries to create tension in your mind through some mind-boggling scenes that what would happen next.Bruce Willis has been shown as a child psychologist who has recently won an award and is celebrating with his wife at the beginning. He meets Haley Joel Osment who is a kid who believes he sees dead people walking and trying to communicate with him. At the end of the movie a big suspense is revealed making the viewer shocked. Watch this movie for a brilliant mix of suspense and horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A boy with a haunting secret seeks help from a child phycologist" "I see dead people".I don't usually enjoy all these paranormal ghosty stuff but this is one of my all time favourite films. When I first saw this film, it was halloween which added to the suspense of an already very suspense filled film and I have to say I was expecting a clichd teen thriller with blunt acting and a meaningless storyline- I couldn't have been more wrong!The director's camera shots, lighting and music were perfectly placed to make this an enjoyably terrifying 107mins.i think what really made me want to review the sixth sense was the broad range of genres that were skillfully included;thriller, horror, paranormal, romance,drama, comedy which generally incresed the all round impact of it.Chilling, haunting,eerie,well written and with an amazing storyline that has you thoroughly gripped all the way through.The only criticism would be that i would have liked to actually see more of the ghosts. Of course i must mention the brilliant acting skills of Bruce Willis in his prime, Haley Joel Osment and Tony Collette whose acting helped keep this film fresh and engaging in a sinister way. M.night Shyamalan, in my opinion is a genius and a true master of screenplay and I feel I couldn't write a review on this film without mentioning what i think is one of the most immpressive, shocking twists in cinematic history perfectly timed to shock you just enough for this to be an all round brilliant film. Like a lot of reviewers i tried to find a storyline error or a plot hole(without success)although it will blow you away, unlike a lot of other films, the twist does not make you feel cheated, just impressed and stunned.I would definitely recommend it to people who are in to thriller, drama and mysteries as i doubt that there will be a thriller or any movie as skillfully written as this for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sixth Sense ? A powerful suspense with an intriguing story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sixth Sense has a powerful suspense to its story, with eloquent visuals, and great acting.You will be immerse in the drama right away, even if I consider the opening the weakest part of the movie. At first, the subject matter is pretty innocuous and Bruce Willis easily carries you into the thick of it with Haley Joel Osment along for the ride. The boy's role then turns quickly into the linchpin of the suspense, with a number of nerve jarring surprises.Once you're over the horror hill, and you think the movie is over, there's the final piece of the puzzle waiting for you. The only real downside of the whole thing, is that once you know the ending, it looses a bit of its luster, but I still enjoy watching it on a regular basis.A must see. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sixth Sense is a well written movie that hits you from every end, here is a movie that tests your wits, you find yourself struggling to understand the character's predicament, and trying to see why things seem out of place, then you get to the ending of the film and M. Night Shyamalan trait of surprise ending hits you flat in the face and you go? "OH! That's why"Sixth Sense is a movie that is so great but sadly it is not a movie for retakes, since the entire suspense is revealed in the end, the actors in the movie also performed well, especially Joel Osment and there is Bruce Willis, showing off his prowess as one of the great actors of our time. To me Sixth Sense is the best movie I have seen him in, although the Die Hard series are exceptional, this movie just stands out in your mind and heart.Sixth Sense is a psychological horror film about the perils of a young boy Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). Cole lives an isolated life, finding it difficult to mix with others; he sometimes sustains injuries on his body, which he gets when attacked, by the people he sees and talks to, people whom others cannot see. Cole sees and talks to dead people.A child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) with troubles of his own comes on board to try and help Cole deal with his problem, all to find revelations about his life that he was not expecting.Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, the movie script was first purchased by Disney before it was sold to Spyglass; Disney's president believed the movie was not going to be a hit. The movie production budget was 40 million and it was a financial success making over 600 million in the box office and the movie's tag line, "I see dead people" is a popular catchphrase, used by many other movies, TV and songs.Sadly though this classic was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture but won none, this doesn't take anything from this movie as it remains a classic in every way.This movie is a masterpiece introducing Shyamalan for a great writer and director, this and Signs (2002) (with Mel Gibson) stand out as my favourite of his films. There is no need to spare any cash, just dash to the DVD store and get a copy of this masterpiece if you have not gotten the privilege of seeing it yet.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, the movie I just watched was "The Sixth Sense" Many people ask, why is M. Night Shyamalan still directing and writing movies, when everything he makes now is crap. Well the answers to this, is because of this movie. By far one of the greatest Thriller movie of all time.It's about a young boy who has the ability to see and communicate with Dead People. This little boy's name is Cole Sear, played by Haley Joel Osment, and for you gamers out there who absolutely love Kingdom Hearts, he's the same actor who does the voice of Sora. After an accident that happened to a Child Psychologist Dr. Malcolm, played by Bruce Willis, whereas one of his former patient had shot him, because Malcolm wasn't able to help him. He decides he needs to do what's right, and he find Cole, who had the same symptoms as Vincent, the boy who shot Malcolm.This movie has drama, funny moments and it's an extremely emotional movie. The acting is so good and so pure that you can't help but feel like you're right in there in the movie. The child Haley Joel Osment has so much talent in acting, that at the time he was 11 and does way better acting than most actors who had 25+ years in the trade.The story is overwhelmingly good and the development and psychology in this movie just gives you goosebumps all over the entire movie.Why M. Night Shyamalan...how did you produce something so good an pure, and throw us crap with your other projects. I'm guessing the guys at Hollywood think "We have faith that this Shyamalan will somehow bring us gold one day.And the ending! It made me stand up and yell out "Oh My God! This is genius!!!" I give The Sixth Sense, a 9.5/10 Officially one of my personal Favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic start to M. Night Shyamalan's career in filmmaking!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I saw some of Shyamalan films except "The Village", "The Lady in the Water" and "The Happening" three films in which I have yet to see even though they got mixed to negative reviews, I looked past at his very first film that started his film career known as "The Sixth Sense", a tale about a child psychologist who receives an award on the same night that he is visited by a very unhappy ex-patient. After this encounter, Crowe takes on the task of curing a young boy with the same ills as the ex-patient. When it happened, the boy named Cole starts to see dead people and Crowe spends a lot of time with him while Cole's mother plans with his increasing problems and it's up to Crowe to cure him since he is his only hope.When I saw the entire thing, I was really creep-ed out by it and I realized that M. Night Shyamalan had created such a compelling film it became an epic start to his career in filmmaking history which is why I'm giving this an 100% rating. The story is well-written with a nice ending twist and has some brilliant atmospheric moments that would not only haunt you, but creep you out in the process. The music from James Newton Howard is great and fits really well for the emotional scenes in the film along with M. Night Shyamalan's solid directing which has a lot of focus with the tone of the movie. The pacing is brisk and it has some great character development especially the chemistry between Crowe and Cole. In fact, the acting is excellent. Bruce Willis did wonderful, Haley Jole Osment did such a compelling job as a frightened 10-year old, Toni Colette did fine as the boy's mother and Olivia Williams did great as Malcolm's wife.Overall, The Sixth Sense is a classic and it has been a long time since the quote "I see dead people" became so popular since the film's release at the late 90s. My advice to those who have not seen the movie: go watch it before Halloween starts. It is that good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sixth Sense Deserves The Highest Rating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is a psychological horror film that features Bruce Willis,Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette. Added to that,it was written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan.The movie tells the story of Cole Sear, a troubled, isolated boy who is able to see and talk to the dead, and an equally troubled child psychologist who tries to help him that established Shyamalan as a writer and director, and introduced the cinema public to his traits, most notably his affinity for surprise endings.Dr. Malcolm Crowe is a child psychologist whose new patient has a problem far outside his usual area of expertise. Cole Sear is six-years- old and claims to see the spirits of dead people all around him. It seems that Cole has psychic powers and can channel the ghosts of those who were troubled. Cole doesn't understand his powers, and he has little control over them; he's constantly terrified by what he sees, and Dr. Crowe is the only one with whom he feels he can share this secret. However, as the doctor digs deeper into Cole's strange powers, it leads to strange and unexpected consequences for both of them.An excellent premiere for new director as he packs a punch with a great story, excellent directing, a great cast, great performances, and a surprise ending that will leave you breathless for days on end. Osment is excellent, as is Bruce Willis, as a melancholy child psychologist scarred by his failure with a similarly haunted youth, and Toni Collette, as the boy's fiercely loyal mother.It was a twisty ghost story with all the style of a classical Hollywood picture but all the chills of a modern horror flick that deserves the highest rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this movie came out, it garnered a huge amount of hype and acclaim, and I regarded this film as something of a masterpiece. It represented a type of quality filmmaking and storytelling that only men like Hitchcock seemed to master. It was one of the few films that initially established M. Night Shyamalan as a promising director of quality substance (a reputation that would only last for his next two films, Unbreakable and Signs; the rest of his work became arguably weaker and weaker, until reaching rock bottom with The Last Airbender).The story is pretty evenly-paced, but it is a slow-moving one. There's not a whole lot of conflict involved with this, but it's built pretty sturdily on the occasional paranormal fright scene and plenty of mystery.What really matters here is the story, and it is perfectly constructed. It's most famous for its twist ending, but it's not just an arbitrary narrative trick; in this case, the whole movie was built around that twist, so that it holds up on multiple viewings and gives new meaning every time. With quality characters that you can actually care for, and some strong themes concerning people and their gifts, the rest of the story stands strongly on its own and has plenty of insight.This film is immortalized with solid photography and editing. Acting is extremely delicate and subtle, with great nuanced performances by Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment. Writing shows some penchant for a little too much exposition (a standard complaint for most of Shyamalan's work, and it really only shows when compared to his later features), but is otherwise very good. This production doesn't have anything lavish, but it makes good use of its utilitarian sets, props, and costumes. Music is nice.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Perfect | Film: Very Good)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only good movie M. Night Shyamalan has made to date.The flow and timing of this movie is fantastic, which makes it so good and easy to get into not to mention the punchline in the end. Bruce Willis fits the role well, and the little kid (Osment) is great. What should be notice even more is what an extraordinary job Toni Collette did in this movie. The scene where they (Osment and Collette) are in the car and he says to his "mother" that he is a freak, Collette's emotional reaction is so realistic. I have the greatest respect for her talent after that. I think she deserves greater roles.Shyamalan hasn't been able to make or write a single piece of good movie making ever since, which makes me suspect he had a lot of help on Sixth Sense. Someone with real talent and skill would not just sink from great to rock bottom. I almost want to attribute the Sixth Sense to someone else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is an extremely interesting story glued together by great acting, and directing. This isn't a hardcore R rated slasher. It is a ghost story that doesn't rely on gore or cursing a lot to tell a story. It really is the spiritual successor to "Poltergeist". The suspense is powerful. When scares come they are very scary. Acting is great. The most credit in acting should go Haley Joel Osment who knocks it out of the park, and gives one of the best child acting performances ever. M. Night does a great job putting this thing together. Too bad he went from this to "The Happening". The story is one of coolest ghost stories ever told. This is a very good plot.

		<shortDescription>An absolutely brilliant masterpiece in every aspect it utilizes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are only a handful of movies out there that have everything in it. Thankfully, this movie is one of them. What I mean by that is it has the horror (the absolutely creepy/terrifying type, not the crappy something-pops-out-and-startles-you junk), the sadness (Jesus, I pretty much just end up feeling sorry for every character), the happiness (and when the happiness comes, you feel so genuinely happy and warm that you could cry), and the best part- the twists (the kind that hits you like a ton of bricks, not some stupid, run-o-the-mill misleads and whatnot). But that's not all. The acting was beyond superb. Bruce Willis was spectacular as the main character, Dr. Malcolm Crowe. I honestly think an Academy Award nomination should have been given for him. But the Academy made up for that in giving, first off, Toni Collette a nomination. She had such a great performance as the distraught mother who only wanted a normal life for her son. But the real praise should go to young Haley Joel Osment, who also had an A.A. nomination, but should have won in my opinion. I will not go into depth because there is just not enough good things to say about his absolutely brilliant performance. The only thing I will say is that he had one of the most convincing and emotional performances of anyone I have ever seen, and he was only 11 at the time! However, a lot of the applause should go to M. Night. Shyamalan, whose writing and directing just goes to show that when he has the right material, he can REALLY make it work! I really hope he gets more opportunities to show off his talent, let's just hope he doesn't do anymore TV show remakes (The Last Airbender was just plain awful). This movie is such a beautiful masterpiece, and that's saying something considering it's a horror film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The standard for the twist story genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider this the very best twist-story I have ever seen, followed at great distance by The Others. That I am not the only one, of course, is best shown by the great spin-off, included those by the same director. And even more the fact, that none succeeded to equal, let alone surpass this movie. The movie is compelling and keeps you intrigued to the end, and the end, well, it is legendary. To me it is so brilliant, like you have seen two good movies in one. Many movies of the twist-genre, if I may call it that, do not respect the checklist for endings. And ending should wrap things up, tie up loose ends, without tearing the story we have seen so far apart (in the worst case telling the reader it was all a dream). The sixth sense does this better than any movie before or since. But before I get to that, let's start at the beginning. It started with Bruce Willis getting shot by his former patient, now a grown man still troubled by apparently non-existing phenomena. It gives the right background, since we are introduced to the main character, Bruce Willis, being a child psychologist, who has dropped the ball somewhere along the line. Or not? Was that patient mad? The rest of the story is about Bruce Willis' character seeking redemption for his failure, as he feels it, by trying to do it right next time. That chance comes with the gifted child that is showing the same problems. But before that, remember the cut? After Bruce was gunned down you see him suddenly sitting, the next fall, on a couch outside, waiting for the young boy. It struck me as lonely, and strange. Of course, in hindsight, it was all deliberately put there including the clever camera work and fall setting, as any good story should only contain things that belong there for a reason. I thought: where is the hospital, where is the wife? Why is the atmosphere so lonely, and deserted? Well we know now why, but I did not then, so this was one question, one unsolved delayed bit of information ? always a good thing to keep the reader, or watcher, hooked. Also his contact with his wife: distant, short visits, monologues rather than discussions. I thought they are in a fight, but about what? The end provided the explanation: they were not in a fight, but she could not see him, and she looked sad since she was mourning about her dead husband. A very smart way of twisting a story. It is very hard to do, especially since the whole movie you have seen stays intact, even after the surprise. All you saw happened, only from a different perspective. Just when I started to think the start was too weird, I was intrigued just in time by the ghosts that came along with the little boy Bruce had as a patient. I thought it would end up like Poltergeist, the spirits entering the real world, Bruce having to sacrifice himself, redemption, end. But the real horror came from the people themselves, with of course the climax the video of the dead girl, showing she was poisoned by her stepmother. A very different approach and hard to do, but this movie succeeded in being scary without showing the obvious spooks alone, but with staying in the real world. Take 'The Others', for instance, that movie had the advantage of the claustrophobic effect you automatically get when you choose an isolated place, like the estate they were on. The Sixth Sense only had the open world, a city, as we know it, and the heroes could walk anywhere. Not easy to create a scary atmosphere, there, since the characters could just go away when things got scared, right? But they couldn't , since the ghost where all over the place, too. All the questions I had during the movie were all perfectly wrapped up in the end. I thought: why would Bruce find out now, not earlier or later, he was dead? Well, he had come full circle, he helped the boy where he could not help a boy in the past. If he would let go now, his wife could move on and she was ready, having a new boyfriend. The time was right. The boy, he came full circle too: by listening to the ghosts, he would find out he was no freak since they did exist. They were there and by listening to them he could be of use to the people that they left behind. Also his mother understood her son was just gifted and not a freak, by the somewhat over emotional scene with him telling about her dead mother showing up at some high school event, something he could obviously not have known. It is extremely hard to wrap all things up this perfect, and the reason this movie does it nevertheless, is because it showed a carefully constructed story which was possible to interpret in two ways all the time. By diverting me to the ghosts themselves, I totally forgot to bother about what was going on with Bruce Willis' character himself and his wife, and why it did not fit. It stayed in the back of my head, but the ghosts were even more dominant. Brilliant, you can only do this once. Furthermore I can add the acting is very good, and the camera-work also, especially the scene with the stepmother. So all the way to the end, the movie is surprising, intriguing and scary. It left the Poltergeist or Exorcist approach and by staying in the real world it made the ghosts even more scary, or exciting if that is the word. The end itself is the biggest surprise any movie has shown, and manages yet to leave all you saw intact, even adding a depth to the story. Perfect. A perfect story, made into a perfect movie. Ten stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haley Joel Osment sees Dead People for M. Night Shyamalan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Child psychologist Bruce Willis (as Malcolm Crowe) reaches a career peak when he receives the Philadelphia "Mayor's Citation" for professional excellence. Celebrating with beautiful young wife Olivia Williams (as Anna Crowe), Mr. Willis gets drunk, and does "Dr. Seuss" impressions. The happy couple retire to their bedroom, where they prepare for sex. But, after Ms. Williams begins a playful strip, mysterious sounds are heard in the bathroom. It's Willis' former boy patient, Donnie Wahlberg (as Vincent Grey), all grown up and stripped to his underwear (briefs). Obviously quite deranged, Mr. Wahlberg sobs, "You failed me!" and shoots both Willis and himself.The next fall, Willis has apparently recovered from his gunshot wound - but, he feels guilty about failing to help Mr. Wahlberg overcome his childhood psychosis. Willis gets the chance to help another emotionally disturbed boy, unhappy Haley Joel Osment (as Cole Sear). Young Mr. Osment reminds Willis of the man who shot him. Osment is having trouble in school, startling teachers with bloody drawings and psychic abilities. Osment is bullied by his peers, who consider him a "freak". His mother, Toni Collette (as Lynn Sear), is struggling to make ends meet, after a messy divorce. After a few sessions, Osment reveals his anxiety producing secret, "I see dead people." M. Night Shyamalan, who also wrote, does an admirable job directing this unpredictable ghost story; he, with photographer Tak Fujimoto, works storytelling wonders with the camera; even before the revelatory last act, witness how effectively the camera sets each mood. And, the "Best Director"-nominated Mr. Shyamalan elicits wonderful performances from his cast, especially from Osment; his is one of the era's all-time best kid characterizations. But, what a subtext - if you want your kids to grow up sane, without being repeatedly scratched and welted by abusive ghosts, don't you dare get a divorce! ********* The Sixth Sense (8/2/99) M. Night Shyamalan ~ Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am from India and my family and friends are lovers of English Films, they are also good critics and have a stern opinion which can seldom be changed. I had heard from them about Sixth Sense and that this movie was made by a person of Indian ethnicity. I decided to watch the movie and see how it was. The movie was broad casted on a television channel, and I started watching it with my family. It is really joyful experience when you watch a movie with your family, the shrieks, the laughs etc make you more involved. And that day while watching the movie my family was all silent, they were thinking inside, they were so involved that their eyes were not blinking but were filled with all sorts of emotions. It was really like sitting in meditation.And at the end, when the twist is revealed, I was shocked to the core. I was at loss of words for few minutes and then I became very cheerful as I just saw the movie which I which so fulfilling. It was a journey into the world of brilliance. The boy acted so well that he deserved the Oscar. Bruce Willis was excellent. M. Night Shyamalan did a very good job transforming words and thoughts into a world of reality.Brilliant Movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazingly deep story and a must see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie originally in the theater when I was 17 or 16 back in the summer of 1999. I remember being scared by the ghosts and dead people and that's about it. I even went to see it a couple of times including one night when I went to see it at the Drive-In with a friend and didn't get home until about 1:30 am. As I entered the house that night I couldn't help but hear Cole's voice in my head saying "I see dead people" and I ran to my room trying to keep myself from screaming out in terror. I remember that this was the first movie with a major plot twist in it that I remember really striking me as noteworthy. I'm sure I had seen others before but this one was kind of a hype for a little while. "Did you see 6th Sense? How about that twist? Wasn't that crazy!" Despite that, I remember that I didn't really understand it completely. I guess you could say that I was kind of immature both in life experience to be able to draw the conclusions I was supposed to about the characters and I was also inexperienced in the art of following a movie plot beyond the complexity of good guy has conflict, adventure, solve conflict, the end. So as a 16 year old I enjoyed having the pee my pants scares and that is why I liked this movie.After that I didn't really watch the movie again. I saw it a few times in the theaters and a couple times through the next year or so on DVD. Recently however, I bought a copy and its been sitting on my shelf waiting to be watched. Tonight I finally got around to popping it in and giving it another go. I can't believe how much there is to this movie that I never quite understood before. OK yeah Bruce Willis is a ghost and the kid can see dead people. But there's so much more than that. You have a little kid who can see dead people but who is terrified of them and is also terrified of telling anyone about his secret for fear of being called a freak and taken to the funny farm. He is conflicted by these two fears for most of the movie. You have his mother who loves her son so much and does all she can to try and help him but just doesn't know what he needs. And then you have a child psychiatrist who, due to a failure to help a similar child before, has been killed and doesn't know he is a ghost. There is drama, suspense, and yes even some terror along the way as Dr. Crowe tries to help Cole find out how to deal with his problem. Cole is able to learn how to speak to the dead people and help them to take care of the unfinished business that is keeping them from resting in peace. The scene where he gives the father the video tape of the mother killing poisoning their daughter isn't actually important as far as any of the details of that particular instance rather it is important in that Cole is helping the dead person connect with the living. This draws an interesting parallel when we find out that Dr. Crowe is a ghost too. This ghost was killed by a former patient who could also see dead people and whom Dr. Crowe failed to help. Since then, he has not felt confident as a child psychiatrist anymore. Then he finds a new case like that of the boy that shot him. It is pretty much identical. And his unfinished business is both to help this boy where he failed before, and then the boy's job is to help him with his unfinished business by helping him figure out how to communicate with his wife. I don't know what that is called, kind of like a paradox or a catch-22. Character A is supposed to help character B but the only way for A to help B is by letting B help A. Kind of like the chicken and the egg. Paradigm? Anyway, with things starting to change for Dr. Crowe, he goes home and begins to speak to his wife as she is asleep. This is when he realizes that he is dead due to the fact that she is holding his wedding ring. He remembers being shot, he remembers dying, he begins to see things that he didn't see before such as the bookcase blocking the door that he has been trying to open. And now that he sees he is dead he is able to tell his wife what he needs to and move on.I don't know about you but to me that is a great story. There are wonderful tidbits in the details of the story as well such as the scene with Cole and his mom in the car when he tells her about seeing his grandmother. That scene almost had me in tears this time around. The acting and the writing were wonderful all around in this movie. The story has so much more to offer than I ever knew it did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sixth Sense still grabs one in unexpected ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Approximately nine years after seeing The Sixth Sense, I recently viewed it at home via DVD and a high-resolution, wide-angle monitor. I turned the chroma off to watch it in black and white. I've never forgotten the poignant twist at the film's conclusion, but The Sixth Sense remained frightening and revealed itself to be far richer, emotional and satisfying than I had remembered. The quiet nuance, the performances, the directing, the photography, the timing, the editing, the looming fear and the humanity of the story took my breath away. Wow! This is a horror movie that compels one to get it right while alive and to listen closely to those who may or may not be in touch with the pain of souls who may or may not be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best movie I have watched in a long long time. Shyamalan is definitely an artist par excellence as shown by his control over the script and direction. By far 'the best' acting by a child actor in any movie that i have seen so far, simply brilliant. As for Mr. Bruce Willis, isn't he one among the very few actors who can act really well at the same time had a great stint as an action hero, kudos to you Mr. Versatile. I would rate the movie 9.5 on 10 [0.5 i have to take out because nothing is perfect in this world ;) ]A definite recommendation to every movie lover. For the sheer brilliance of the movie in its simplicity, nothing out of the world targeted or overt cheap scare tactics or stuffs like that. An extremely well controlled script with some superb acting by the two lead actors separated by huge age difference and experience but together bringing an absolute movie goers delight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best physiologically films to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bruce Willis (Die Hard) stars as child psychologist Malcolm Crowe, a man with a good working history, until one night an ex patient causes havoc, and Malcolm seeks to put his career and life back on track by helping a young boy come over his fear of seeing ghosts.Nominated for 6 Oscars including Best Picture, The Sixth Sense delivers a chilling and dramatic tale of life, going through the difficult and the joyous turns of life, which is justified through some strong performances, exquisite writing and stunning direction.Willis gives one of the strongest performances of his career as the psychologist, with exquisite quietness and humbleness to the character, which is only second to Haley Osment' s Oscar nominated role as Cole, one of the best young performances of all time.Osment delivers a chilling performance as the bullied boy who sees dead people, which has turned into a landmark in the horror genre. His likable character goes through typical stages of life, including self doubt, imagination and conflict, a true justification of the young mind, with an amazing shocking twist to match, in that he sees the dead, which provides twists and turns in a highly dramatic plot.The writing is exceptional, with the right amount of realism to reflect the drama of situations, and the use of seeing the dead goes a long way to build up to a stunning and gripping finale, one which will make you question the entire plot and watch it again straight away. The open ending leads to many questions and when watching it again, you may question certain aspects.The drama is pitched spectacularly well by the actors and deserves praise, particularly Toni Collette (Little Miss Sunshine) and Osment.Having the use of real life scenarios including parent and child relationships juxtaposed with fantastic ideologies such as seeing ghosts creates a world of possibilities, and Collette and Osment have some great on screen moments together, perfect realism and perfect fantasy, and one scene will have you in tears.Shyamalan's Oscar nominated direction helps achieve the right mood, being chilling and yet realistic in its own context.Not particularly jump behind the sofa scary, more physiologically scary, and plays on your mind for a while after watching, which makes a true horror classic</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the smartest horror/thriller films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sixth Sense gives that uncomfortable feeling that no one likes to get when watching horror flicks. You start sweating and and heart races kind of fast, and your head goes crazy and you don't know what to think. That's what I was going through when I first watched this. Well you might think my actions are a bit over dramatic, but I was only eight. The Sixth Sense is not a stupid horror film. It's smart, moves along well, and it's not going to disappoint. The acting is acceptable and the directing and the feel of the film just makes you feel like you're there with the boy, facing his fears, and feeling what's going through his innocent and limited mind. Bruce Willis is very good in it, and he's a great character, being a psychiatrist for kids. You'd never guess he was John McClane. This film is a revolution to horror scenarios. This horror film doesn't depend on images to scare you, like The Exorcist, and it doesn't fully work with you mentally like The Silence of the Lambs to scare you out, but rather it uses something different. It attracts your Sixth Sense, and gives you another kind of scared feeling. Watch this movie, and make sure you finish the whole thing straight, not stopping it, or you won't enjoy the film like most people who watched it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Sixth Sense" is about a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe who is assigned to help a child through his mother's divorce. Whilst helping, he learns that the child has an interesting gift, or a curse: He can see ghosts. Now, Malcolm Crowe must help him through this, while going through some marital problems of his own.All I can say is: This shocked me! M. Night Shyamalan does a great job with keeping you focused on this movie, because this is a movie that you have to keep your full attention on. I won't give away the twist, but trust me, it's a good one. It will surprise you in the end, unless you've look it up on some spoiler website.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" I see a great movie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't much keen on seeing this movie until one day it came on the television and I felt extremely delighted to have switched to that channel than watching the usual trash. THe thing that manly clicked about this movie was the smoothness at which the director/writer Mr. Shyamalan tells his story in just about 2 hours, which is well paced yet not too fast, unlike some movies that are very well made, but extended too much even after you feel that the story should have got over.I was utterly shocked during the end of this movie when I watched it the first time as I never thought of such a thing as most of the Bollywood movies are not thriller and very few of them have a mastermind of a writer like Shyamalan to have such a mind- boggling ending. That's probably one of the reason that he was presented the Padma Shree or Padma Bhushan award in India. I haven't seen his other films except for the Village which too was good but after this movie, I feel that he has rightfully been handed this award, unlike some people in India who expressed their displeasure when he was given this award. The reason why they felt it was unfair was because they had not seen this magnificent masterpiece.I was glad to know that it was a small budget film and did not contain exorbitant furniture or other accessories just to advertise the products or even a huge haunted mansion that would have made this a typical horror flick. This movie haunted me from within, than scaring me from outside or making me sick by showing people cutting other peoples' flesh etc. It was a wonderful psychological thriller with no fancy items to show how expensive the movie is. This movie had some of the most memorable scenes in cinematic history, like the sick girl's story and the iconic climax. It also had one of the best performances given by the actors. I would especially like to mention the little kid who acted so well that I was completely in amazement that he did this at the age of eleven. Bruce Willis too has done a commendable job and I thought that he would be worthy enough to get at least an Oscar nomination, which he didn't. The kid's mother too has done a very good job, especially in the emotional sequences but I felt that her make up was overdone and it made her look like an evil character.I think I'll sum it up by saying that this is one of the best thrillers I have watched. I'll give it a nine out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I benefited a lot from revisiting it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film a few years ago and remembered a few scenes, but not the majority of it. The one big problem being that one of the things I did remember was the twist. So going through this re-watch it all seemed very, very obvious but that probably has a lot to do with the fact that I knew what it was. Either way, it's a good story; compelling and incredibly unique that I was able to enjoy a lot. I quite enjoyed Shyamalan's use of the color red (his use of colors in all of his films is quite extraordinary, really). The twist is a good one and adds a lot of depth to the characters, especially Malcolm, obviously. I really like the idea of him being around for the sole purpose of helping Cole learn to live with his sixth sense after being killed a year ago because he failed to help someone with the same gift. That's the twist that really made an impression on me and stunned me for a second; the fact that the man who murdered him was such a nutcase and killed him due to the fact that he had the same gift Cole has and Malcolm couldn't help him with it. I liked that complexity in the character a lot. Some of the scenes are very melodramatic and overdone and I really, really hated the editing (it was just too abrupt and out of place) but overall I thought it was compelling and the ambiance was very well structured. Toni Collette was pretty great also, especially in her final scene where Cole tells her about his gift; she was really heartbreaking there and had my eyes watering up. I think Shyamalan's masterpiece comes in his next feature, Unbreakable, but this is still a solid film that I'm glad I revisited.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare 'twist' movie that holds up to repeated viewings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone knows that this movie has one of the best 'twist' endings in recent film history. Hopefully you haven't had it spoiled for you because seeing the movie for the first time wouldn't be the same if you knew the ending beforehand. That being said, if you're revisiting the movie then I think you'll find that it holds up surprisingly well, even though the element of surprise is gone.The main reason for this is that you can now appreciate how the film was constructed in a way that concealed the twist in plain view. There are various clues throughout which take on a second meaning on repeated viewings. In my opinion there are maybe a couple of questionably 'cheap' tricks but it does all fit within the logic the 'twist'.Another thing that keeps the movie entertaining is the atmosphere. This is unquestionably Shyamalan's best directorial effort, effectively building a sense of mystery and dread, all without resorting to the over-the-top gore typical of horror films. James Newton Howard's eerie score is also an essential ingredient in building atmosphere.The acting is good all around but, for the most part, unexceptional. In my mind Toni Collette gave the best performance, one that was justly rewarded by an Oscar nomination. Haley Joel Osment also nabbed a nomination but I wasn't that impressed by his performance, though it was definitely above average for such a young actor.If you haven't seen this film already try to catch it before the 'twist' has been revealed to you either by someone else or by a cultural reference. If you have seen it, watch it again to gain an appreciation of the film's construction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Manipulation of Fears "Par Excellence"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Little Cole Sear (Halley Joel Osment) is a child that seems apart from the current world, called "a freak" by his companions and always distracted and reluctant to connect to the others. Dr Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) intends to help him in order to redeem himself from a bad past experience. But as Dr. Crowe deepens into the interior of Cole, he will uncover his most profound and frightening secret.At the moment it starts, Shyamalan jolts with an uncanny music, formed by the precise scratching of superb violins. All throughout the movie the music will be vibrating, exhilarating, electrifying and yet oddly repulsive and leaving a sense of dismay and creepiness. Counting on lofty performances, emotional and groundbreaking by Halley Joel Osment, Toni Collete and star Bruce Willis, Shyamalan will clear it's field to proceed with his cunning game of manipulating the fear of the viewer. He will show you simple things, he will input the terror on ordinary stuff and common and daily elements: he will terrorize you with the using of a tape- recorder to hear whispers, he will play smartly with the shadows, mirrors, claustrophobic spaces to gasp the audience, and the use of an eerie wind always blowing to give the sense of distance and cold. He will give you a little space to start, then the fear will start erupting inside your mind.The photography by Tak Fujimoto is intense and subtle, never approaching with direct focus but with transversal, lateral imposing lens and toying softly with the use of reflections, rolling cameras and visuals in odd places that give the film superb aesthetics. Overall, the technical aspects contribute on leaving on the viewer a feeling of dread and restlessness, awkwardness.Shyamalan is genius at creating this suspense, avoiding blood and imposing a sly fear. That is why he became so popular.He also delivers a lot of psychological substance, a lot of profound lines of thinking. Joel's Osment relationship with his father is portrayed with great touches, like the glasses with no crystals and the watch not working he received from him. The Indian Director also exposes his viewings on explaining a story within his sublime script. At one point Malcolm tries to tell Cole a story: -You never told a story before right? You have to add some twists and stuff.Well prepare, because it is highly auto-referential. The script also brings forth bewitching descriptions of fear "like falling down inside but you are standing still". And then prepare for the twist. It will shake you to the ground and burn all of your movie principles. It is the Twist, what made the movie genius and so iconic."Sixth Sense" is a cinematic bulwark, standing on an eternal and sublime direction. Its ending is emotional, and touching. This, in order to make contrast to the excellent creation of suspense and fear that bulges through the movie. Masterful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film focuses a child psychologist named Doctor Malcolm(Bruce Willis).One night, when the doctor and his spouse(Olivia Williams)find themselves their home, they are visited by a nutty patient and the tragedy take place. More later, the Doctor sees a traumatized young boy named Cole(Haley Joel Osment), he communicates with dead people who don't know they are dead. Cole's mummy(Tony Colette)is worried about her terrified son's nightmares ,increasing problems and episodes of acting out. Because of this, Cole is named geeky in the college where appear various dead people who ask his help.The film provides creepy scenes, a well-knit drama, grisly terror when the living dead appear and suspenseful throughout.The flick contains the more famous plot twist from cinema history, because the ending leads to a breathtaking and unexpected outcome on what's happened before. For that reason , gets a highly original and imaginative script by Night Syamalan,-also director and secondary actor, as usual in his films-, and has been copied and imitated several times, such as, Stir of Echoes(David Koepp) and The others(Alejandro Amenabar). Acting by main actors is top notch, Bruce Willis is magnificent as restrained psychologist and Haley Joel Osment is awesome as traumatized little boy, carrying the movie on his frail shoulders; furthermore, appear future promising actors as Mischa Burton(OC) and Trevor Morgan . Mysterious and sinister cinematographic atmosphere is well made by Tak Fujimoto and eerie soundtrack by James Newton Howard, both are Shyalaman's usual collaborators. The motion picture is produced by famed Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy(Spielberg's producers) and stupendously directed by M. Night Shyamalan.</fullReview>

Bruce Willis is effective in one of his non-macho, non-action roles, playing a psychologist who becomes involved with a troubled young boy played by Hayley Joel Osment. This is also Hayley Joel's best film and the one that made him a top-notch child actor. Those halcyon days are probably gone for him after the abysmal Artificial Intelligence and later films.One has to be careful describing too much of the plot of this film so I'll avoid doing that. Suffice it to say that this is a film that really holds your interest and the relationship that develops between Willis and Osment is very touching. The climax of the film is justly one of the most famous in all of film.</fullReview>

Haley Joel Osment is awesome as Cole Sear, the little boy who can see dead people.Cole's visions are disturbing, but the film is not scary or suspenseful. What gives it the edge and my thumbs up are the fantastic performances. Osment and Toni Collette are both Oscar material.

		<fullReview>This movie has been out for six years. Although this appears to be a story about the supernatural, it is really about our hopes that we never are completely separated from those who love, or loved us.After a traumatic evening with a man breaking into their house, our Hero's life goes into a tailspin. He cannot seem to connect with his new patient, a young boy with similar symptoms to one he could not treat. His wife is distant and uncommunicative. He often has difficulty keeping track of time. And on top of all this, the patient claims to be able to see dead people. Sure, here's an easy case to solve in a stress filled life.This often has parallels to our own lives, as those who love us come closer and farther in a gentle, undulating wave. But we are not prepared for the separation that no amount of work can undo. It is this poignancy that the movie captures so expertly. Granted, it is couched in supernatural terms, but the lessons for us mere mortals should be clear.The soundtrack is superb. James Newton Howard has made several mediocre movies quite bearable, and here he makes a good film into an excellent one. The track is truly one of the important characters in the film, and does its job by staying in the background without interference.There are some moments of startling horror. I have seen this movie many times and I still jump at places.The pacing is well done, and the characters are all developed sufficiently for you to care about them. After six years, I still recommend the Sixth Sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Sixth Sense," introduced the world to M.Night Shyamalan and his infamous twist. You know the kind: where you are still sitting in your seat for moments, shaking your head and wondering how you couldn't see it coming.The film starts with Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis),a child psychologist who is celebrating with his wife Anna (Olivia Williams)on winning an award. Their celebration is cut short when Malcolm is shot by Vincent (Donnie Wahlberg, in a creepy performance), who accuses him of failing him and turning him into a freak.Sometime later, a disillusioned Malcolm meets Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who seems to have some problems of his own. From one point of view, he is seen as a disturbed kid (cuts and bruises, and disturbing drawings). However, we soon discover the reason behind his behavior: He sees dead people (One of the most quoted lines in film history here!). He is terrified by what he sees (especially when the people he sees have died violent deaths)and doesn't know how to handle it. He can't even explain what is going on to his mother Lynn (Toni Collette), who is trying desperately to help him.For a while, Malcolm has his doubts. And his relationship with his wife since the shooting has gone downhill, but after listening to an old therapy tape with young Vincent, he begins to believe Cole.With his help, Cole learns how to deal with his gift and to help others. By the end of the film, Cole communicates his secret to his mother and Malcolm communicates with his wife, but when this is done, lives will be changed forever. And both scenes are so incredibly powerful: Cole's conversation with his mother brings me to tears, and you can see the weight life off him when he shares his secret to his Mother.And this is the moment when you are still sitting in the chair, shaking your head in total amazement.This is an excellent psychological horror film and all of the performances (Especially Osment)are incredible. You get scared and teary eyed at the same time.</fullReview>

This may have been Bruce Willis's finest acting role. I wish he had been nominated for this. At least the kid got nominated even though he didn't win. Willis is Malcolm Crowe, a gifted child psychologist who is shot in his bedroom by a deranged former patient. A few years later he encounters a young kid named Cole, who is experiencing similar symptoms and appears to be harboring a well kept secret that he doesn't wish to share with anyone. But Crowe keeps pushing to discover what is troubling the boy as his marriage gets worse and worse. What could it be? The answer is as frightening as it is uncontrollable.

		<shortDescription>It pulled me in, big time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read many comments, both ways, about this movie. This movie sent chills down my spine and called me. I watched it a second time and was still enthralled. I knew I was watching a movie but for one of the few times recently, I was THERE, with them, the actors and the story line, you know? Hanging on each word, trying to understand the inference of each statement. I read the one and two star reviews. I am biased, but the low reviews seemed petty. So what, they figured out the ending ahead of time. I saw the ending and watched it again. I think I feel sorry for those reviewers, I somehow wonder if they are tuned into the complexities and emotions of life. Don't get me wrong, I don't believe in the afterlife, spirits, god or almost anything but love. Despite that, this movie held my eyes glued. The dialogue and mood music and ideas and half completed thoughts gripped my senses, all six of 'em.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M. Night Shyamalan's first movie is a brilliant psychological thriller with a fantastic twist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring: Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment Director M. Night Shyamalan pretty much came out of nowhere. We weren't expecting him or what he was going to bring to us, but then, he was there. And he left a huge impact on the film industry.His first film, The Sixth Sense, which he wrote and directed, and played a small role in, is an eerie psychological thriller. It's the horror movie that isn't a horror movie. It doesn't make you jump out of your seat and crap your pants, but it leaves you with this creepy, eerie feeling.Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Willis) is a child psychologist. After winning an award for his work, he comes home one night to find that one of his old patients is waiting for him in his house. With a gun. The patient shoots Malcolm and then turns the gun on himself.Several years later Malcolm comes across an interesting case. Cole Sear (Osment) has a problem that he doesn't want to tell anybody about. Cole starts talking to Malcolm, and Malcolm slowly learns more about Cole. He discovers that he has cuts on his arms, that he kleptos from churches, that he speaks Latin. He wears his father's old glasses and watch. Malcolm decides very quickly that Cole is a very interesting, very bright, but very disturbed child.Eventually, after Cole feels that he can trust Malcolm, he tells Malcolm his secret. He sees dead people. People who walk among us, not even knowing that they are dead. Nobody else can see them, but he can.The movie has several very creepy moments when dead people with pieces of their head missing, or massive cuts, or vomiting, appear to Cole and try to talk to him. Cole cannot figure out why they come to him, and they scare him to death.Malcolm eventually helps Cole realize that he is the only that can help these people. Cole learns how to conquer his fear and talk to the dead people and to help them with their issues.Osment does a superb job of acting in this film, especially considering his age. Willis also does a fine job, but the spotlight is always on Haley.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is absolutely outstanding! It's not often that I rate ANY movie higher then a seven. This film is clearly an exception. The Sixth Sense promises to be a classic! If you like horror/thriller, I higher recommend seeing this film. (just not necessarily before bedtime)There are so many twists and turns that even if one was to attempt to guess what the finale holds, one would likely fail. It's best to just play along with the script. The camera work and sets are expertly designed. It's almost impossible to find a mishap in this regard. Another rarely: This film is able to keep one attention on the screen even when it's already been viewed. I have seen this film at least 5 times since its' release in 1999 and it never fails to send a new fright. The wide screen version is definitely the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the surprise packet movie of the Year - and I do not mean just the ending. It held your interest from the very start, and the ending was incredible and completely a huge surprise. Joel Haley Osment as the boy "who can see dead people" showed a talent well beyond his years, while Bruce Willis (who has never beeen one of my favourites) did a great job. Even after seeing the movie, I tried very hard to remember if there had been any mistakes or clues that gave an insight into the memorable denouement, but the continuity and attention to detail was 1st class . All the supporting cast were excellent, and I would have to rate this film as one of the best of the year - BUT, if you have not seen it, DO NOT let anyone tell you the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inspiring thriller full of plot twists...brilliant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is one of my favorite movies. Everything about it was amazing-the acting, the dialogue, the plot, the effects. I have been writing many short "horror stories" for a long, long time. This movie inspired me to keep writing and to use its plot and characters as role models. Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis were astounding, believable, and as I said before, brilliant. Though it didn't have numerous action sequences, the plots many twists and occurrences were perfectly done (not dramatized and/or overly exaggerated.)The biggest twist in the plot (I'm not going to spoil it for those of you who haven't seen it) wasn't obvious at all, but supported by other details in the movie that led up to it. All in all, I loved this movie and could watch it over and over again without getting tired of it!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&amp;#65279;trying to redeem a past mistake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>&amp;#65279;Malcolm Crowe is a child psychiatrist who, at the beginning of the film, has just been awarded a citation for professional excellence by the city of Philadelphia. When a former patient, Vincent, breaks into the house, he learns that his excellent work has not done all the good that he'd hoped, in fact his promise to a young patient that everything would work out alright, has not come true, and results in the young man's suicide. He tries to make sure this will never happen with another patient.Later that fall, he finds Cole, a boy who is suffering from the same symptoms as Vincent. Cole spends his free time playing in a church, so the ghosts won't frighten him. As Malcolm studies the case further, he finds connections between the two boys, and figures that by helping Cole deal with his problems, surely stemming from his father's abandonment, he can redeem himself from his failure with Vincent.Eventually he figures that Cole is telling the truth, that he can see beyond what is apparent in this world. It is by allowing him to face his fears, and use the gift he's been given to help the departed rest in peace and comfort those still living, that he can himself live without fear. He doesn't need to hide in either a church or a tent in his bedroom filled with religious statues.Malcolm didn't think that something glibly promised in a session with Vincent would come to such a drastic conclusion. He didn't think that Cole could actually see dead people, and was suffering from severe pathology and school-age schizophrenia. He didn't think there was any realm beyond the five senses. He wasn't counting on a little boy, like a boy he had counseled years earlier, had a sixth sense that enabled a person to see beyond what is normally perceived, to the world of souls who had not realized that their bodies had died when they had work still to do.Likewise, I didn't think that the movie would have such a startling conclusion. I hadn't seen it coming, and had trusted that what I'd seen naturally led to the conclusion of Malcolm's restored marriage, since he'd alienated his wife by being obsessed with Cole's case, and find faith in himself, that he was a good doctor who could heal children's troubled minds and really deserved an award for excellence. Without that ending, it would've been a good movie. With it, it was a great movie. If the mind can be tricked in this way, within the span of two hours, it might also be tricked about preconceived ideas about what happens after death, to consider the existence of spirits lost on their way to the afterlife.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one movie everyone should watch over and over. "The Sixth Sense" had everything from a plot to a great cast and awesome performances. "The Sixth Sense" was so well thought out it made me really think about what came next. This truly is a thrill ride that will leave everyone on the edge of their seats wondering what will happen next. I'm very glad to see that I was fortunate to figure out what the movie was about the first time I saw it. I have since seen several times and it keeps getting better each time I have seen it. The plot is laced with twists and turns that will keep the mind working well after it is over. Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment kept me on my toes wondering what would happen next with each scene they were in and each word they spoke because it was a clue to the finale. "The Sixth Sense" was so powerful and thought provoking that I wanted to be in it because I wanted to find out what it was like to be in one of the year's best movies.I can't give enough praise to the young actor Haley Joel Osment who gave one of the best performances by an actor young or old. Bruce Willis has finally found has made the best decision of his career by selecting the role of Dr. Malcolm Crowe. Bruce Willis makes me glad I watch movies because he is just so good. I was surprised to see how good Olivia Williams was in this film. I saw her in "The Postman" and she was not quite used to her full potential. I'm glad that this role allowed her to flourish as an actress. She has proven to be a hot commodity in Hollywood and deserves to be in more movies.I'm proud to say that this is one of the best movies I've seen in my whole life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies this day and age are often hard pressed to be creative and original, seeing as (for the most part) everyone has dragged through the same stories and concepts before. Same plot. Different characters. Varied acting abilities. A new twist maybe, but essentially the same thing.That's why this delightful little thriller is so fantastic.Just when you thought classic movie-making was over, M. Night Shyamalan comes in and proves all of us wrong. Movies still *can* be original. Movies *can* draw a crowd without writers throwing in graphic sex scenes, pointless nudity, gut-wrenching gore and everything else that draws a crowd these days.Here we're given something far better: Feeling.Every emotion in you is squeezed out to the surface. One minute you're freaked out like nobody's business, the next you're laughing hysterically. One minute you're letting out a terrified squeak, the next you're letting out a heartfelt sob. It's a brilliant experience, to say the least.I've always thought that the really good movies were the ones that brought out every little feeling you were capable of feeling. This movie is one of a select few that pulls it off to such a successful degree. The acting is fabulous (Toni Collette steals the show, hands down...) the story remains fresh and intriguing the whole way through, and believe you me... the ending did indeed throw me for a loop.M. Night Shyamalan is definitely one of my favorite directors, and this is truly his masterpiece.Get's the clowns_n_cookies seal of approval!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film that I saw two years ago in the local cinema in Cutral Co, Argentina, just on my birthday was this amazing film written and directed by M Night Shyalaman, starred by Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osmeid and others. Since that moment I've turned into a fan of The Sixth Sense and why not of Shyalaman's scripts.The film takes you about two hours and a half to watch, but it will take you nearly a month to understand. The Sixth Sense, which is set in Philadelphia -land of the most popular boxer on the screen "Rocky"- is a dramatic and suspense movie with a bit of horror.Bruce Willis as Malcom Crowe and Joel Osmeid who starred Cole Sear are the main characters. They stay together and need each other during the film. The Sixth Sense is the story of a boy who can see dead people that talk to him asking for help, but Cole Sear is scared and he won't control this gift unless he lets Malcom Crowe help him with this phenomenon.I was very surprised about the ending of the film (which I'm not going to reveal!!!), because Bruce Willis gives a dramatic, emotive and unexpected way to his character, as well as Osmeid, who despite being a young actor, seemed to be an expert one.I liked the acting, but without organisation and leading this would have been nothing, which means I liked the direction too. Make-up artists and dressers made a fantastic work, also costumes helped the photography director to highlight his job in the horror scenes.I think the sound technicians made a perfect work because the music was very good and the sound fused fantasy with horror.If you like films difficult to understand, and to see them again and again and again, this one is for you: you'll have to see it at least twice to credit that you've understood this exceptional film.Marcos Istueta, 15, Cutral Co, Argentina.</fullReview>

He becomes self obsessed and only cares for his work, when one day an intriguing child enters his life.Child prodigy Hayley Joel Osment, who you will have seen earlier as Forrest Gump's son, plays the child who has a strange secret. Doctors think his mother is abusing him, yet his mother believes his so-called friends are bullying him.The film slowly introduces us to the Childs problems in a way, which sends shivers down your spine. The child with the hole in his head, the vomiting girl all create sickening images which startle you while u are watching.The use of music can be soothing yet chilling; the lighting can be warm and then cold. The images which are being thrown at us give us clues all the way through yet subtly enough to keep the secret until the final moment, a moment which I must admit I had never thought possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Last masterpiece of the 20th century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really shows, that today's movies don't have to be mainstream, not-innovative, pseudo-intellectual and flat-plotted. Instead it shows, that good film-making also can be achieved by stuff, producers normally would go mad about - such a movie as "The 6th Sense". With no big publicity at all (at least here in Germany) this film started in December last year and went straight to #1, leaving "block busters" as Schwarzenegger's "End of Days" etc. far, far behind. The story is awesome - M. Night Shyamalan did a great job and the way HOW he tells the story and brings it to the audience reminded me of the perfection of Alfred Hitchcock; even when Cole and Doctor Crowe stand in front of a door with a knob, you just see Cole being mirrored in the metallic surface, although Crowe stands right by his side. And when the plot reveals that Dr. Crowe actually died right at the beginning of the movie and you resume Cole's words of "I see dead people..." it makes you shivering although the movie ended - and the impact is even bigger while watching the movie a second time. Its "silent" horror combined with a tragic story of both Malcolm and Cole and Willis' and Osment's overwhelming acting makes this film a real masterpiece. Not honored by the Academy at all, it just shows that the movie is too good for the Oscars - it is just not mainstream, not-innovative, pseudo-intellectual and flat-plotted, and with all these points it's no real film for the Academy; normally I see Oscars in important categories as a warning that the film is bad, and once again I have been encouraged to keep this another year; last time it was this lame mainstreamer "Titanic" and this time we had "American Beauty". Poor Academy! Maybe next time. For me the winner of the Oscar for at least "Best Film" and "Best Supporting Actor" is "The 6th Sense" and Haley Joel Osment.</fullReview>

Or perhaps, just perhaps, there really wasn't as much that was special, different, or outstanding in this movie to validify all the acclaim it has garnered. It was boring in places, overly drawn out throughout, and had no outstanding performances by any of the actors. There were many, MANY plot holes that were simply left to fester, and the end was a little to reminiscent of 'Ghost' for my taste.

		<shortDescription>Overall, it was great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first learned what the film "The Sixth Sense" was about, I did not want to see it. I thought it was a horror film, and horror is not my cup of tea. However, when I began reading reviews about it, I began to reconsider and finally got the courage to see it. It was a good thing I did, for "The Sixth Sense" is really a fine film.Since everyone by now knows about the film, I will not go into much detail about the plot. Bruce Willis plays Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist who was a great success -- with all but one former patient who later accused him of having failed the patient. The former patient then shoots Crowe and kills himself. The sense of failure devastates Crowe and strains his marriage. So, Crowe decides to help Cole Sear, played by Haley Joel Osment, a boy who reminds him of the former patient. But Crowe gets more than he bargained for. Abnormal sychology is little help in this matter, and eventually Crowe must abandon his preconceptions in order to help Cole -- and eventually himself.The film is great. True, it may seem slow to some, but it's simply taking its time to create the proper atmosphere.The actors are what make the film great. Olivia Williams, as Crowe's wife, does a fine job with what she has. Toni Collette also does a fine job as Cole's mother, who truly loves her son but does not know what's wrong with him. Her love is why Cole can't confide in her until the end. Since I never saw the "Die Hard" films, I don't have any preconceptions of Willis as an actor, so I thought he was just fine as Crowe. His performance was understated, and by the end of the film, you see why it was that way. And it was a pleasant surprise to see Shakespearean actor Greg Wood as the father of the poisoned girl. (I'm a Shakespeare nut.)But the best performance has to come from Haley Joel Osment as Cole. He was terrific! That was probably the main reason why the movie was as unnerving and as great as it was. He really made me feel Cole's terror whenever the ghosts appeared. He stole the show, and indeed it was best he stole the show, as the movie would've suffered without his acting ability. I hope he wins the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, as I believe he truly deserves it.One final note: the ending is really great! It explains a lot that might have been confusing to some.So, I suggest you see "The Sixth Sense", even if you have to rent it on video or buy a DVD to do so. It is really a great film, as its six Oscar nominations indicate.</fullReview>

I'm not going to critise anyone involved in the film as the direction was exellent and Bruce Willis put in a very good preformance, the kid, whatever his name is, was believable and on the whole the story was well told.But so what, the script was nothing more than another quirky idea from Hollywood and really didn't drag you into the situation, it was nothing special and the reason it did so well was because it posed as an intelligent film with blockbuster selling points. Add to this the fact that the cinema was more popular than ever this year and people aren't wanting to see ***** in another "I have more guns than you have" film and it was bound to be a huge hit, but it didn't really deserve it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Spoilers**There's nothing particularly awful about this film, there's just nothing particularly great about it either. About 10 minutes into it, the ending is painfully obvious and the climax - where Cole finally reveals his "problem" to Malcolm - has been given away from the very start by the overzealous trailers. What we're left with is an hour and a half of tedious plot exposition and a denouement that is so contrived it makes you wonder what the point of the entire movie was. Then the "surprise" comes and you realize that the entire point was to fool you with the ending! If you were fooled then the movie worked; if not then it probably didn't.On a positive note: the performances were very good - notably, Osment and Colette - and the cinematography was excellent. Ultimately, however, - unless you are terrified even thinking about ghosts - the Sixth Sense is only mildly entertaining and, upon a second viewing, even less so. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think the surprise ending hurts the overall greatness of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film months ago when it first came out, and I never stopped thinking about it. It is the only film of this year that deserved to make a lot of money (The Matrix and The Phantom Menace disappointed me terribly). It is unlike the rest of the movies Hollywood throws out. Unlike the empty Matrix and the Phantom Menace, the Sixth Sense is a character driven drama. It comes to a conclusion that no other ghost movie (that I've ever seen) has touched on. I think the film has a good chance to snatch up some Oscar noms. I think it deserves nods for script and definitely Best Supporting Actor in Osment (though he really is the main character, he is pushed to second string because of the bigger star). I wouldn't even be offended if Willis got a nom, seeing that this is his best film besides maybe 12 Monkeys and Pulp Fiction. Now for the ending that I mentioned in my summary. Most people will know about it this late in the game, but I won't tell. I think it pulls attention away from the true greatness of the film, which is the characters. It is what we were talking about after we left the theater, and I'm disappointed at myself for doing so. Sure it was neat, but I have gone through it in my mind several times, finding flaws within the film. Surprise endings are almost always detractors. If you remember a film just because of its surprise ending, it is a worthless film, just like The Usual Suspects, a very bad film if anyone would actually think about something besides the ending. overall 8/10, being a 9 originally, but losing 1 point for its supposed hook.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying that Sixth Sense is not a "bad" movie, instead it is an average movie. The whole film was built ground up from the ending, and no film has ever made it so painfully obvious that the ending was written first and then a story was added to make it long enough. Also I have a terrible bit of information to tell everyone, Bruce Willis is really bad at acting like he cares. It didn't work in Armageddon, it doesn't work here, and it's not going to work the next time he's cast as a truly caring man. Though in all honesty if you think about this film in great detail you realize he does not care, and is simply incredibly self-serving. Despite all my personal distaste for this film, it is not one of the worst movies ever made, but it is nothing more than average. The plot is relatively simple, and if you go into the theater actually thinking you'll know how the movie is going to end within half an hour. The only real reason to see this movie is so that you can see if you can figure out the ending before the end of the film. After you've seen this once and seen how it ends, it is incredibly unlikely that the weak plot line will be enough to draw you back for a second time. This movie can be fun as a one-time mind quest to figure out the conclusion, but once you know the ending, this movie really has very little, if anything to offer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is one of those movies that will appeal to the mainstream viewer: nothing in it is shocking, there's nothing particularly menacing about it and everything is wrapped up in a nice, sweet, little package by the end. The performances by Osment and Collette are excellent but it doesn't make up for the tedious pace of the plot. Two-thirds of the movie deals with exposition which, in this case, is devoted to the interaction between Cole (Osment) and Malcolm (Willis). Cole's got a problem and Malcolm is determined to help him - as his problem is similar to one that another patient of his had whom he couldn't help. The problem is that we already know what Cole's problem is so we're left with an anti-climactic climax. When he tells Malcolm that he sees dead people, there's no shock value or significance. That leaves the resolution to Cole's problem as the focal point of the movie; however, it's so tame it makes you wonder what the big deal was in the first place.The movie works best when Cole and his mother (Collette) are together. There's a particular scene at the end when they are in the car that is incredibly touching. The movie breaks down when it tries to be scary, though. There are a few startling scenes but, overall, it's devoid of any real terror. How it was labeled as a horror movie, I'll never understand.Overall, it's a pretty decent movie - much better than what Hollywood usually puts out - but, in the end, it's nothing to write home about. In my opinion, of course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The so-called great "twist" is very obvious early on and causes the rest of the movie to seem incredibly drawn out and long. There is no real suspense, and other than Toni Collette, the acting is very one-dimensional. The ending really offers no permanent conclusion. This is definitely not one the best movies out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(This might be considered a minor spoiler, I guess.)Yet another summer 1999 movie that just doesn't live up to it's own hype. This one was not as disappointing as The Matrix, but it's disappointing nonetheless.Having seen the preview, and hearing that there was a surprise ending, I was able to deduce exactly what it was. As will anyone who spends 10 seconds to think about it. Come on! This one is a no-brainer! Even if you can't puzzle it through before going to see the movie, you get pounded over the head with it enough to figure it out in the first half hour or so.Ever since Braveheart won the best picture academy award, I've been convinced that there must be some mind-numbing chemical in the American water supply or something. When the Sixth Sense is called an "intelligent" movie by critics, something is very very wrong.Having said that, it's not an absolutely horrible movie. The acting is passable, and the story is somewhat interesting. The slower pace is admirable in a time when most movies seem to be focused on special effects like exploding tits every thirty seconds, and it worked well toward contributing to the aura of the film.But the film wasn't really scary. A couple of "Boo!" type scenes, but nothing that really got inside me that much. I hate to make the comparison that everyone else seems to be making but I've got to say that "The Blair Witch Project" was infinitely more scary and effective.If you want to see a couple creepy surprise-ending films, go rent "Jacob's Ladder" and "Angel Heart" both are much more scary, interesting, and smart, and both deserve your attention much more than "The Sixth Sense."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find aspects of this story well-conceived, but the film has many loose ends which could have been tied together by enhancing the screenplay and the direction. I have a theory about the popularity of this and similar movies: Many people want to know what happens (or what might happen) when life in the human form ends. As a clairvoyant able to see into different dimensions of reality, I have appreciated various screen presentations of non- ordinary reality. The essence of this story aligns with what I can see in other dimensions. But, oh, for more masterful story telling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My friends had all told me that the Sixth Sense was an incredible movie.Some even told me it was better than Blair Witch Project.So, since I had some free passes to the movies, I took my friend Cathy to see it last night.The first 100 minutes or so passed at an incredibly boring pace. Nothing much seemed to happen at all.After being shot by a former patient, child psychologist Bruce Willis decides to help a child who shows the same symptoms that this patient did. At the loss of his family life, he throws himself into helping this boy who can see dead people. That's the basic premise. Boring, I say.The movie plods along at a snail's pace, and the lines are tired cliches, ie: Bruce Willis: "My plan is blah blah blah". Boy: "Will it work?" Bruce: "I don't know..."Give me a break! Come up with something original! The idea of seeing dead people is pretty interesting, and they could've done something cool with it, but instead you get 100 minutes of boring film stock and tired cliches for dialogue and plot movement. The filmmakers even employed the standard "shocking" music to get you to jump at the slightest "gross" thing, things that weren't even scary.In the final 2 or 3 minutes, the film pulls itself together and comes up with a completely amazing ending that made me not hate the film. It did, however, make me angry for not hating the film, and left me wishing that I had left in the middle of the movie so I could have been left with a feeling of utter disappointment.In a summer of movies like American Pie, Blair Witch Project, South Park, Eyes Wide Shut, and Austin Powers 2, maybe I just had too high of expectations. Don't waste your money on this crapfest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story moved like molasses from the opening title screen on. I was having trouble staying awake for most of it. Little and no musical accompaniment didn't help. There were about 3 'gotchas' when considering the length of the movie, there could have had at least 10. I figured out the 'surprise' ending less then half way through the film. The only bright point was the acting in the kid. A couple of scenes were overacted just a tad, but this little guy is overall a fine actor. The mother did a good job too in a working-class role. I did love the shots of Philadelphia. It was nice to see Bruce Willis without a gun in his hand. I feel he did an adequate job in his role. I think the only reason people are raving about it is because he has had so many macho roles that people had typecast him. I think most people liked it because they didn't foresee the ending. For those of us that did, the movie wasn't nearly as fun. My recommendation is if you have to see it, wait for it on video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another great script idea blurred and ultimately mangled by p**s-poor direction. I was thrust into skepticism even during the initial shooting sequence. Was I being too cynical or overly probing when I balked at the New Kid On The Block in the bathroom? Who sought vengeance on Bruce Willis, the child shrink who "failed" him by managing to convince him that the dead people he saw walking around all the time were merely outgrowths of stress sprouting from issues surrounding his parents' divorce? Who happened, after X years of torment by these wandering spirits, to break into Bruce Willis's house on the very night he was commended by the city for his work with children? Commended with a plaque shiny enough to have filmed the scene prior almost entirely in its reflective surface?Maybe I was. But after numerous scenes in which every line uttered by every character (and I use the term loosely) was so clearly meant to advance the plot (used even more loosely) that a kindly old narrator such as Burl Ives (or his claymation counterpart) might as well have been reading the whole movie off a clipboard, I found it difficult to sustain my disbelief. Or interest, for that matter. Yes, there were a few effective (but cheap) scares, and the ending was quite cool. But hardly a payoff worthy of having to endure a child actor as insistently bad as any I've ever seen, a mother who seemed to be peering at cue cards over her son's shoulder, and the incomprehensible stoicism of poor Bruce Willis, way out of his (fifth) element, rolling out every stupid child psychology trick save pulling a coin from behind the kid's ear (there is a coin trick, though), all of which are inexplicably and immediately effective. If only it were that easy to pull one over on the audience... oh, wait, it is. That this film has received so many positive reviews is baffling.Olivia Williams is very easy on the eyes (but has nothing to work with as obligatory wife-person), and there were some lovely ironies available, notably in the mutual confession scene in the hospital after the kid has his pseudo-seizure, but the film attempts to drive home its points like a careless carpenter with a throbbing thumb. I'm extremely weary of films that collapse when I pay too much attention to them, and likewise wary of those who suggest that in order to enjoy these films I should not pay so much attention.3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem I, and everybody else in my party, had with this film, was its' apparent inability to decide what exactly it was trying to do. Was this a psychological thriller? Was this a ghost story? Was this a horror film? A scene that featured a young teen with the back of his head blown off as he turns away from the camera seemed to suggest this was a horror/ghost story type of film, but the script verged on more thoughtfullness than that. Pensive performances punctuated this schizo feeling. The film had dangling story lines throughout - but we all admitted, the twist at the end of the movie salvaged it. We saw a sneak preview, and the audience, too, seemed to agree with us. Some fool brought their 7 year old child to the screening, and the kid, seemingly bored out of his mind, started tossing his hat up into the air. Somebody hollared out, "If your bored, why don't you leave?" Uh, nobody said he was bored, but it was a good supposition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before seeing this movie, I had heard there was a surprise ending. I knew no more than that and was able to come up with a nice twist ending before seeing the movie. True to my instincts, this movie ended exactly as I predicted. Because I had already figured out the ending, the clues in the movie seemed so obvious to me, I wondered why people were not figuring it all out. But people are surprised are by the ending, and I can't understand why. This movie might be worthwhile if you can't pick up on clues. But I could not enjoy it. Some reviewers say once you see it once, you have to review the movie to understand everything. Well because I had already guessed the ending, I felt like I had already seen this movie and every scene just led up to an already known end. I don't know whether to be proud or disappointed. Proud as in I guessed the ending before seeing the movie or disappointed as in the writers couldn't come up with anything better. I was left with a "that's it?" feeling. So if you already have an idea as to what the "surprise" ending is, then do not go see this movie, you're probably right. But if you can't even fathom a guess or don't like to think during a movie, then by all means go see it.At least the actors were good...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With all of the good commentaries I read about "TSS" I expected much more out of the film than I got.The main problem with the film is its persistent slowness and confusing development. Some of the supernatural the child "sees" is given without any explanation, like the "ghosts" in the story have no other purpose but to frighten the viewer. The film suffers from a short attention span, jumping from one storyline right to the other with no explanation. The film also focuses too heavily on the score; there is a point where Willis and the boy are sitting in a room by themselves for about a half minute, not saying a word, while the film's music is playing at full forte. Had there been an important plot revelation at the time it would have seemed sensible, but the attitude was more like, "we spent x number of dollars on this score, so we darn better well use it anywhere we can."The ending of the movie is genius (which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of one) but by the time I reached it I was so bored and disappointed that it did not have much of an effect on me. It seemed like the writer dreamed up of a perfect ending to a movie but could not put anything worthwile as filler. If the movie was more like an hour-long "Amazing Stories" episode, it would have been perfect; but as is it was a little too drawn out for me.***/out of ten</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot twist in this movie doesn't really come as a surprise nowadays. Who doesn't know it? It's kind of like Darth Vader being Luke Skywalker's father; an obvious known fact to everyone even those who haven't seen it. Was the plot twist spoiled and somewhat disappointing knowing it beforehand? Yes of course. But did it spoil the entire movie? No.The story was very unique with brilliant writing and an amazing performance by the child actor Haley Joel Osment. It was truly remarkable to see the skill and depth of talent from a 10 year old. The relationship between him and Bruce Willis's character just worked perfectly. The film was haunting and sentimentally touching, though it would have been better if it was mysterious too (because I already knew what was going to happen). Overall a combination of great acting with a captivating story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSLet me say at the outset that I watched this movie in 2014 and not in the year it was released. By all means, this movie is past its shelf life and is best avoidable; especially so if you are a regular Hollywood movie watcher. Twenty minutes into the film and I could see the twist at the end of the movie. They show the psychologist being shot at almost point blank range and then the same psychologist is shown moving with a child that can see dead people. To add to this, we see the psychologist being ignored by all, except this child! Does it take anything more for one to guess the twist? But one needs to appreciate that the movie was made in 1999 and definitely this twist would have been a real shocker in those days. Technical aspects of the movie have been very well attended to by the makers and they definitely need to be applauded for this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are over 2000 IMDb reviews for "The Sixth Sense" so I don't think I can add anything that hasn't already been said. But in case someone has already spoiled the ending for you (like some dumbbutt did for me and the entire office back in 1999, causing me to avoid this movie for 15 years), never fear... it's still VERY MUCH worth watching.The cool twist is, of course, the main punch of this film. But it's the kind of film you have to watch twice. Once for the story and once for the poetry. So to all my fellow film lovers who happen to have friends &amp; coworkers with big mouths, this film is still a real treat on a poetic &amp; artistic level.M. Night Shyamalan is one of the few directors who deserves the hype and popularity he gets, at least for this film (I haven't seen any of his others but soon will). Everything is meticulously planned, every camera movement, every shadow, every color and every editing cut, almost to the point of obsessive mania. In the DVD extras he and his crew explain why they did everything the way they did; for example they do a lot of long takes because their philosophy was that rapid cuts tend to disrupt the viewer's thought process. So instead of showing a dialogue between two people in a volley of closeup cuts, the scene is done with 1 camera filming them from the side, slowly, almost hypnotically moving between both of them as it gets closer over the course of perhaps 2 minutes.I could go on for ages about such scenes, but you probably get the point. If you enjoy the classic directors known for their careful &amp; deliberate approach to filmmaking, directors like Orson Welles ("Citizen Kane"), Otto Preminger ("The Man with the Golden Arm"), Kurosawa ("Seven Samurai") or even the younger crop of great directors like Steven Soderbergh ("Traffic") and Alfonso Cuarn ("Children of Men"), you definitely have to check out this movie and other works of Shyamalan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fair enough, but not the work of genius some claim</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to be a party pooper, but I really can't see what all the fuss is about. The Sixth Sense is an entertaining film, better than some, not as good as others, but it is most certainly not the masterpiece many seem to make it out to be. (Nor, for that matter, is it as bad as many here suggest.) If anything it is an intriguing story, and not original at that - read The Third Policeman - which is realised in a somewhat perfunctory way by Shaymalan. If anything it could have been done better. When I was considering my view of the film, the word 'ponderous' occurred to me more than once, and I think that is about right. The Sixth Sense needed a more delicate touch and, well, it should have been spookier. Having said all that the young lad who portrays young Cole, the boy who can see the dead, give an outstanding performance, and for once an American director has successfully resisted the temptation to make a child more cloying than a mug of treacle. His mother also does well as a harassed single mother, and Bruce Willis shows that there is more to his ability than shooting guns and posing in sweaty T shirts. But I have to repeat: The Sixth Sense is great for a night in but not the earth-shattering Meisterwerk others claim it to be. If anything, there is any number of plot holes which become rather glaring once the film has finished and overall it doesn't quite stack up as it should. But what the hell: that would be serious is it came anyway close to being a work of genius. As it doesn't, those plot holes don't really matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is this so good?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The answer: everything. This movie has all the elements that make great movies, classic movies. It has believable characters, phenomenal actors, great directing, and that ending. Oh man, that ending. If only M Night Shyamalan always made movies this good. While he still made some very good movies, notably Signs and the Village, he never again reached the height of The Sixth Sense.One of the things that surprised me most was how good Bruce Willis is. Granted, he was good in Die Hard, but I had pinned him as just an action movie star, not someone who can actually act well. My doubts were all dispelled by this film. And how about Haley Joel Osment? What happened to this kid? This has got to be one of the best child performances I have seen in a movie, bar none.This movie also has the creep factor, without going over the top. It is chilling, without actually being straight up horror. When young Cole utters that famous line while lying in a hospital bed, it still sends a shiver down my spine. The movie has a certain atmosphere to it that is never broken, from the opening five minutes up through the shocker at the end. This movie is exceptionally dark for a PG-13.Shyamalan's directing has a fierce relentlessness to it. Even if the rare occasions when not much is happening, there is the constant feeling that something is about to. This is the movie that showed Shyamalan was a genius. I honestly wish he would show this side more often, as opposed to the side that directed Lady in the Water or is directing Avatar: the Last Airbender. That is one movie I know I'm going to miss once it's opens.If you want a phenomenally well made creepy picture, without having the actual pants scared off you, this is the movie to watch. If you want one of the most well-directed, all- around best movies of all time, look no further. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

The script is flawless and the character development is second to none.All the actors and actresses perform their role to perfection. Hayley Joel Osment is a wonderful actor and gives his portrayal of Cole Sears a maturity in terms of depth and emotion that many actors years older than him would struggle to match. I am not usually a fan of Bruce Willis but his performance in this role is flawless and wonderfully done. Toni Collette gives perhaps her best performance to date in her role as a deeply loving single mother and the rest of the main and supporting cast portray their roles beautifully as well A great movie with many intriguing twists and turns that I highly recommend</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sixth Sense An Effective Thriller With A Good Twist Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is an effective thriller with a good twist ending from director M Night Shyamalan whose admirable in making this movie which was his first back in 1999. His other films that followed haven't even been on par with this one but thats okay. The cast are good in their roles including Bruce Willis, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams, and especially Haley Joel Osment as the boy who can see dead people. The rest of the cast are okay in their limited screen time. Its best to see this without knowing too much about the film because that will ruin some of the surprises including a revelation about one of the main characters. This film does have a little suspense and creepy moments but there could have been more of them. This film felt a bit like a drama with thriller and supernatural elements which wasn't a bad thing. The music by James Newton Howard seems to sync very well with the tone of the film and what was happening on the screen. The creepy moments usually involving a dead person being seen are well executed and paced. This is a movie you'll want to see twice so you can pick up on things you didn't notice before the first time around. The pacing was a little slow at times but the rest of the movie made up for its few flaws. Overall The Sixth Sense is a solid thriller with some suspense, creepy moments, drama, a little humor, and exceptional performances by the cast who make this movie worth the time to watch.</fullReview>

Not since The Usual Suspects have I seen such a twist at the end of a movie. This movie definitely had me pondering over it in its totality long after it was over. Along with the spectacular ending the movie was just spooky enough to keep me alert looking for what would happen next. It takes brilliance to make a movie scary without the use of rampant killing and bloodshed.

		<shortDescription>A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sixth Sense" (1999) is generally regarded as a ghost story and that is what it seems to be during the first viewing. There is also an obvious subtext about the nature of our fears as well as themes concerning courage and communication; elements often incorporated into the genre. Most viewers will be conscious of this stuff during the first viewing but will mostly be focused on sorting out the story and processing the intriguing conclusion. But with subsequent viewing(s) the fear factor diminishes and you become aware that this is not a ghost story so much as it is a film about grief; particularly the grief than comes from regret. With this realization comes the awareness that the real power of the film comes from a viewer's subconscious connection with this underlying theme. The object of the film is far more than just giving the audience a scare although it does a first-class job of doing just that. It can also alter your perception of the process of both living and dying. The spirits that seek out young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) do so because there is something they regret doing or not doing during their lives; something that will ease the grief of their passing (for both them and their loved ones). You have Krya's little sister asking Cole if Krya will come back and Cole answering "not anymore", after he has helped Krya. And then you have the grieving Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and his grieving wife Anna (Olivia Williams): "Once upon a time there was this person named Malcolm. He worked with children. He loved it. He loved it more than anything else. And then one night, he found out that he made a mistake with one of them. He couldn't help that one. And he can't stop thinking about it, he can't forget. Ever since then, things have been different. He's not the same person that he used to be. And his wife doesn't like the person that he's become. They barely speak anymore, they're like strangers. And then one day Malcolm meets this wonderful little boy, a really cool little boy. Reminds him a lot of the other one. And Malcolm decides to try and help this new boy. 'Cause he feels that if he can help this new boy, it would be like helping that other one too."The climatic scene in the car between Cole and his mother (Toni Collette) ranks up with cinema's all-time best.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And all nine lives...Willis delivers again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By far this is my favorite Haley Joel Osment role that I have seen him play. M.Night is sensational directing this onion-skin of a thriller story, but who doesn't realize that? The bedroom scene with the doctor and his wife was what a shocking good thriller is made of. Donny Wahlberg is a terrifying short detour in this right-made enthraller that packs a whopping cast that has authentic developed personalities with an eerie undertone. Bruce again shows that he is the right choice for a major story that captivates from the start to the end. You feel for Malcom Crow, as he seems to be searching for truth and help for this young boy. The mother has a real appeal in that (Toni Colette is superb)the actress is a well crossed role player that seems like there is just no-acting there. She is on it. All the while, there are scenes that are not 'shot' impatiently. I think that so much of Hollywood is cutting, cutting, cutting to make the scheduled time box that the formula fits into. The visual chemistry woven is done almost with a cinematic respect for the classic film noir, they are held in the length that makes them perfect grippers, you see what's happening and it gives enough 'pause' then makes you feel the chill across the back of your neck. When the story captives and the performances are cut to fit as right as this is, you know that not all movies are even. Not by a long shot. Bruce Willis has a definite old world quality of acting, in a new world format. This movie unfolds with precision in story telling and character development with the good Doctor and the boy and then when it goes to the end, it twists and you are left feeling that cold chill once again. I only had one question that I would like to ask 'M' about the plot. Other than this, I am well pleased with "The Sixth Sense".For what a superb thriller should be, this one is a top pick. It's 'incredible' the success that The Sixth Sense has had, it is no wonder to me and millions of fans, and in that, Willis with his contract and profit agreement took away with him One Hundred Million Dollars. Some might say that he isn't one hundred million good. Some might say, the Razzies gave him three awards for worst actor just the year before, I say, none of that 'banter' will change a wit about Bruce in this film. Recommended for M.Night Shyamalan and Willis fans, even if you aren't it really makes no difference in the end you will know why. (*****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie if a little over-hyped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sixth Sense" is a good movie but perhaps a little overrated. I believe that those who don't like it are in minority. Part of this explains its success.The unfortunate reality is that this was the only Haley Joel Osment's successful movie. He made a reasonable number of very good movies and none of them was a success: "Pay It Forward", "Edges of the Lord" and "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence".Ironically at first nobody didn't expect that "The Sixth Sense" was going to have half of this success. This means that, if it wasn't a success, then Haley Joel Osment wouldn't have had a single successful movie.Now let's talk about the movie itself. Sometimes this is classified as a terror movie, but for me this isn't really a terror film. This is a combination of supernatural, drama, tension, suspense, thriller and instrumental (but suspenseful) music, without the use of special effects. Its simplicity works out well. This motion picture is also emotional, funny at parts and only in brief moments there is some terror.Haley Joel Osment plays a difficult role for a child, but with his incredible talent he steals the show. He was the first child actor ever nominated for Best Actor. Too bad he didn't win (not only for this, but also for his other movies I mentioned).Bruce Willis is surprisingly good in this. He is usually a very limited actor, but in this he's just as good as Haley. Plus, unlike his other films, Bruce plays a likable character here.Aside some absolutely unnecessary scenes, this movie is generally good. One of the best parts is when Cole (Haley Joel Osment) finally reveals his secret to Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis). That part is breathtaking, highly emotional and intense. Cole's facial expressions say all and some of the movie's best quotes can be heard in this sequence.The idea of this movie inspired the TV series "Ghost Whisperer" which stars Jennifer Love Hewitt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It just wasn't believable I watched this movie last night for the second time, and all the time I was thinking how does this guy not know he is dead? He spent a year thinking he was alive but dead. Not believable at all and I just couldn't take it seriously.I know a lot of movies don't make since like freddy krouger etc, but I just felt different about this movie. I mean I don't even believe in ghosts in the first place but I'm not complaining about that. I think they could have possible not started out a year later, that way it wouldn't seem like such and obvious plot hole.Still a good movie though</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Twist Like no other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an incredibly powerful film. Awash with emotion but never stooping to sentimentality this is the story of one frightened little boy you will never forget. All your worst childhood nightmares: the noises in the attic, the intruder in your house, that cold breath that makes your hair stand on end are here and then some.Bruce Willis gives one of the best performances of his career as the child psychologist trying to get himself back on track after a violent encounter with a former patient and it would be a crime if Haley Joel Osment were overlooked at coming awards ceremonies for his powerful performance here. It has been a long time since a child actor displayed such maturity in a role. Cole's innocent little face hidden behind his absent father's large-framed spectacles betrays a child coming to terms with a terrifying secret in the only way he can.You don't need to go and see this film again to realize why the end is such a surprise but you will rush out to watch it again purely because it's an almost perfect example of it's genre.It is a near perfect 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Every Gift Is A Blessing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story takes place in modern day America where a child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is looking for redemption for a former patient's suicide. He finds a young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) and along comes a bonding relationship; a man torn and broken and a collapsing marriage, and a boy terrified to wake up in the morning and classed as a freak by his peers. Directed and written by M. Night Shyamalan, it's clear that everyone on the set has worked extremely hard to make this movie what it is. But to have written such an elaborate and well thought out story is quite remarkable also.Haley Joel Osment delivers an astonishing performance for such a young actor, it's clear that he has a bright future ahead of him. It also refreshing to see Bruce Willis take a different role not the whole stereotypical Hollywood action film hero. He actually keeps his shirt on and he's not wielding some kind of firearm nor does he have a woman leaning on his chest saying how much she loves him. In this film he's really shown that he can do so much more than take out a gang of mobsters and be the hero of the day, in this story the hero takes a completely different role.It's very difficult to talk about the film without saying anything to spoil it but as Malcolm and Cole finally start to connect, Cole wants to tell Malcolm a secret and he says, "I can see dead people." Probably one of the most chilling and memorable lines in movie history it also had a big effect on me to see now what the child was going through. All these years of suffering and torment, and now he's finally being able to talk to someone about it.Toni Collette also delivers a fantastic performance as a regular 'super' mum; her husband has passed away and she is now working two jobs, constantly trying to protect her child. In one particularly well acted piece of drama Cole is unwell and faints; she takes him to the hospital and is accused of hurting her child as markings were found on his back. As she looks away towards Malcolm in disgust a tear falls from her eyes, But the unexplained issue is what gave Cole the scratches, a group of children could not have given him that. Nor can his mother understand why was he screaming, it just constantly builds up to the film's climatic and dramatic ending.Another well-acted minor role was Vincent Gray (Donnie Wahlberg). He was only on screen for about three or four minutes but you could see all the emotion and drama that was put into that short while on screen. But the minute he appeared there was a lot of eeriness and feelings of despair, and he was a completely unpredictable character.As the plot gets deeper the actors immerse themselves in the characters and really start to show their emotions, this is cleverly portrayed by several tear-jerking moments. Credit to Willis and Osment; they really make it the great film it is but my greatest amount of praise would have to be awarded to Shyamalan as for coming up and directing such a spectacular film nearly flawless in every aspect. I think it's clear that The Sixth Sense is one of the genre defining movies of the 20th century. 8/10. A genre defining thriller, really one of the must see movies, all I can do is praise this film, its blockbuster genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I See Dead People</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It isn't often a new director rises so quickly to the top of the "A" list with only a handful of films. But M. Night Shyamalan does exactly that with the surprise hit, The Sixth Sense. The tale is of a popular, but egotistic doctor (Bruce Willis) who sincerely believes in his award winning psychotherapeutic abilities and looks forward to a prosperous career with the mentally ill. But failing to secure a proper treatment for a suicidal patient, the doctor finds himself with yet another troubled, but far more mysterious boy (Halley Joel Osment) who possesses the power to communicate with the afterlife. Together they discover their own fears and a need for mutual understanding and trust. The film is a frightful combination of sights, sounds and illusionary symbols which creates terror and suspense with each new scene. The Director, like other famous movie artists, makes a cameo appearance and it up to the viewer to locate him during the unfolding drama. Fancible enough to be hauntingly interesting, the film is also a masterful canvas of photographic magic. Audiences everywhere will agree, this film will become a classic for the director and it's stars. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I See Dumb People</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me say, hitting the spoiler alert for this movie is akin to telling you that Soylent Green is people. Secondly, I didn't read every reader comment, but virtually every comment I read raved about the surprise ending. I'm not a smart guy, I assure you. But, I didn't figure the ending out after the first five minutes. I figured it out with two pieces of information - a kid sees dead people and there is a really surprising ending. Think about it. What could that surprise ending be? Hmmm, maybe that the kid is really dreaming? Oh yeah, that would leave the audience enthralled. Maybe he only saw people who were neurotic and thought they were dying? I like that, but it's a bit too sophisticated for Bruce Willis. Could there be any other surprise ending than that Bruce Willis is dead? What made me want to see the picture was to find out how a dead guy can't figure out he's dead. Did the director do such a masterful job that you couldn't go back and catch on? To answer that question...no, it's painfully obvious that Bruce Willis is dead, right from the moment you see him being ignored by everyone around him. I guess the point is that dead people are as dumb as the audiences who go to see films about them. Even if the movie had done a little better job of hiding the fact that Willis is being totally ignored, common sense would tell you that there would have had to be some interaction as he was recovering from his gunshot wounds. And, where was he during his funeral. Okay, I'll admit, I turned the movie off after about 30 minutes. So maybe these issues were dealt with, but I'm willing to bet that even if they were, they weren't dealt with in a very convincing manner. Anyway, I think the movie stunk, or is that stinked. After all, I ain't too bright myself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautiful acting, lovely atmosphere but the kind of "then I woke up" storyline written by an 11 year old. After being shot we are re-introduced to Bruce Willis's character "in the fall"..right. And it's not until the end of the film - after all the discussions with the boy - that he realises his wife isn't speaking to him. Mmm. Bit like the 'here it comes' ending to the Village. There's no major benefit building a whole film round the last five minutes and when the audience is lied to then it's even more unforgivable. Very few films build a case for spending 2 hours setting up the punchline - Usual Suspects springs to mind - but Sixth Sense isn't one of them. A cheap trick in a pretty dress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Sixth Sense' is a horror film about a young boy who has the power to see the ghosts of people who have passed away. The boy gets help from a psychologist and tries to learn how to fit in and know a normal life. The film succeeds in playing the horror as well as cinematography and a plot that makes the audience think. Most of the horror in the film is portrayed in a way that gets the imagination to work and plays on suspense. The plot is engaging and it also makes the audience think. However, I thought that it was predictable and knew what was happening before the end of the film. The performances are done well, and this film does have several strong points, but as a film overall, I think that it was average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a well-made movie in many ways but the great annoyance is when the punchline is revealed the basic flaw of the movie became obvious to me as well. How could he go so long without realising he was dead? No talking to people, not eating, etc. What a shame to have such an almost brilliant ending, but dumb. I give it a six because it was very entertaining. The kid was really good, Bruce was excellent, though he is a one or two role actor. I must say though I still get wound up by the major logic flaw I did not see it because the twist was so well covered up. This movie worked much better than unbreakable which I felt was a great half-movie, just when it was getting good it ended!</fullReview>

I can truly say this is the only movie in years that "GOT" me. I figured out the "Others" moments into the movie, but I didn't figure this one out until the doctor figured it out. It stunned me. Seeing it the second time was better because then you see there is no interaction between Bruce Willis' character and any other characters around him. Take another look at the wake of the girl poisoned by her mother, and the scene where Cole's mother is sitting across from Bruce, again there is no interaction, they don't see him. This is truly a CLASSIC for your DVD collection.Other recommended movies "Angel Heart" and "The Usual Suspects" these are two other great movies with a twist at the end.</fullReview>

Personally, I saw the ending coming with about half the film still to go, and i spent the rest watching just to see if I was right. I had the same problem with the Village, but unlike the Village, The Sixth Sense was made out to be some sort of ending that will shock you. It's worth seeing, if you don't know how it ends just to see if you can figure it out. If you do know how it ends but haven't seen it, rent it just see see Bruce Willis (among many others) give really great performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE SIXTH SENSE Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSWhilst recovering from a recent trauma, a child psychologist (Bruce Willis) helps a little boy (Haley Joel Osment) who claims to see ghosts.Released the same year as THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (1999), another 'spook' movie which divided audiences and reaped dividends at the international box-office, M. Night Shyamalan's breakout feature THE SIXTH SENSE plays much better on TV than it ever did in theaters. With its slow tempo and stately visuals, the movie takes a mature approach to its supernatural subject matter, revealing Osment's ultra-creepy 'secret' in piecemeal fashion, one scare at a time. Former tough guy Willis plays a vulnerable figure whose bond with Osment provides a level of stability absent from his personal life - devastated by an incident in the film's opening sequence, Willis' wife (Olivia Williams) seems to be drifting into a relationship with a young family friend (Glenn Fitzgerald) - and while Osment is the primary focus of Shyamalan's screenplay, it's Willis who holds the material together. Some viewers may be distracted by the film's deliberate pacing, while others will be affected by the gradual accumulation of creepy details, spiked by a couple of really good jolts. The much-lauded twist ending might have been more effective had it not been mentioned in EVERY SINGLE REVIEW (including this one!), making it possible for many people to guess the 'surprise' long before Shyamalan reveals his hand. Australian actress Toni Collette is superb as Osment's harried - but deeply loving - mom, and there are cameo appearances by Shyamalan himself and an unrecognisable Donnie Wahlberg (BAND OF BROTHERS).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan's thriller 'The Sixth Sense' strikes a cord, being a very good modern thriller/horror with good acting a key a lot of thrillers lack.  Haley Joel Osment breaks into acting playing Cole Sear, a boy who we find out has a "sixth sense"-a gift(call it what you may) that makes him se dead people. Bruce Willis plays his Psychiatrist, who is trying to help him as a way of making up for a past patient who killed himself. Not only does the film feature an edgy feel of mild horror, but also a touch of thriller, drama and even mystery. The chemistry between the genres introduces us, the audience into a new kind of movie. Unlike cheesy horror/drama/thrillers before, 'The Sixth Sense' also offers us good acting, which even earned the 11 year old Haley Joel Osment and Oscar Nomination for best actor(which ended up going to Russel Crowe for 'Gladiator', a movie I personally thought was dumb). Bruce Willis also adds his acting skills to the movie, in one of his best dramatic performances ever. After this movie, not only did it boost the movies actors higher in staredom, but also the director, M. Night Shyalaman. Since I have seen his directing skills in films like 'Unbreakable'(which starred Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson) and the upcoming Mel Gibson movie, 'Signs'. If you like drama, horror, mystery, and/or thrillers, you will thouroughly enjoy this movie. Although it's not one of my favorite movies, it is a great movie, with great acting and directing skills. If you haven't already seen it, rent it. 3.5/5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how on earth this film reached 32 (at time of writing) of the top ever films. I've probably seen over 200 films better than this one and the awful unbreakable. I can only assume either (I'm not a horror movie fan), that the supposebly overwhelming atmosphere of Bruce Willis talking to some messed up little boy entertained people, much like horror films or either the modern cliche of adding a big twist on to the end of film to try to make sense of the piffle before it. The latter seems particularly lame, as there is some credit due in the former. I don't see why this makes a film a good film because your bored to death with a nothing storyline for however long, just to be told something to make you feel good when you finish the film. Most of all considering the director did EXACTLY the same thing the doubly pathetic Unbreakable to churn in some money for piffle - pathethic flawed storyling, big twist at end - really shows the lack of imagination and credibility of this film.Warning: Only watch this film if your an atmospheric lover or part of large simple-minded cinema going folk - who loves the big blockbusters and not the more credible imaginative and orginal films such as Dogma (1999) and Traffic (2001) to name some good recent films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie twice. First off, I don't think it's the number one thriller ever, mostly because it's not a thriller. A thriller needs a good villain, and this movie is lacking one, as a matter of fact it is lacking a villain altogether. It was a little slow moving, but that's expected from this director. The biggest surprise was the ending, but only in the first viewing, then it becomes useless for other viewings. This drama (not thriller), is just average when you get down to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since I just saw this movie but knew the outcome, it was probably not as much fun as the opening weekend audience experienced. I am willing to admit that that might have taken away from the whole thing. But I still don't think its a very good movie. The whole thing with the color red seems very cheap and obvious.The best scene was the 'communication' scene between Osment and Collette in the car. I could have used that scene a lot earlier, though. Both actors were very good and deserved their nominations, but I am not so sure about the other nominations. I think this has been a little over-hyped.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies you have to see in the theatre to fully appreciate them. I recall when I went to see Dances With Wolves in the theatre. I was in complete awe of the landscape and the beautiful scenery in the movie. I just recently watched my copy of it at home, and felt nothing like I did when I first viewed it. I'm hoping that those who saw The Sixth Sense in the theatre saw something different from what I saw when I rented it. Everyone I knew was raving about it. Maybe it was just me, though. I can't picture putting any type of horror movie, psychological, supernatural, or any other type, on my list of top movies. I would be hard pressed to give this movie a 5. What ever happened to the classics, what ever happened to the movies like Double Indemnity, and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, or incredible films like The Best Years of Our Lives? Maybe it's just the modern viewer, and his inability to appreciate film. Today people just want to be entertained, they just want to use everyone and everything (including movies)to get their quick fix, and tomorrow they forget about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie undermined by a colossally bad ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is hard for me to really comment on this film without talking about its ending (I won't). For about an hour and a half, this is a spectacular movie, well-acted, with excellent script and dialogue, and moving at a good pace. I think it's something of a cross between film noir and thriller, and it has that eerie "Silence of the Lambs" feel to it (though much tamer).This movie lasts one scene too long. I heard someone remark once that some movies "are great or awful depending on the ending". The very last scene in this film is absolutely preposterous; instead of wrapping up the story neatly, with maybe a tiny plot hole, the last two or three minutes brought to mind at least 20 or 30 gaping plot holes immediately. I have a friend who told me he could guess the film's "secret" thirty minutes in. Things like that usually don't surprise me, but this was so unbelievably, outrageously stupid I had no idea. I felt like screaming at the screen and demanding my hour and a half back based on that scene alone.The only reason I don't consider this movie among the worst I've ever seen is because it is quite good for awhile. Haley Joel Osment is excellent, and the only good reason to see this movie. Other than that, I can't believe this thing was as popular as it was. The ending left me feeling so cheated, I wanted to break the screen in two.</fullReview>

I watched the DVD (I, surprisingly, had not heard about the ending) and cannot understand the uproar and acclaim this movie has gotten. I found myself bored with the plot and the characters most of the way through and the ending, though somewhat surprising, didn't make up for an overall average film. I kept waiting for the plot to get interesting to justify all of the acclaim and it just never happened. Solid acting, average script and a surprising ending do not make a classic, this was definitely not one of the top 5 movies of '99 (how this was nominated and not Magnolia is beyond me) and certainly not in the top 20 of all time (as IMDB voting would suggest.)</fullReview>

It emerges as a slow moving film with a few high points and several lows, Bruce Willis acts tired and the lazy screenplay relies too much on its over confident ending. Don't get me wrong, The Sixth Sense is a good film, but not a great one by any means, and has no right to be regarded as a horror masterpiece, that is just absurd.

The twist at the end is nothing more than a cheap gimmick, it doesn't take much to throw that in the script, whether you saw it coming or not. The acting is ok, but at the end of the day there's not much depth or substance to this. People don't see dead people, if they did, I could easily imagine just about any other film taking the subject further. I believe to a point it even detracts or mocks a real situation where young children develop mental illnesses.</fullReview>

Also notable were the use of color and temperature for thematic purposes. Haley Joel Osment delivered an excellent breakthrough performance and was nominated for an Oscar. However, the surprise ending was actually rather predictable, mainly because of the hype surrounding the twist which gave people almost a year to think about it if they didn't see it in theatres.

Alright, not a bad movie like Armageddon (which was 'bad' in the worst meaning of the word). This film is just out of place. Nice but cliche idea, that would make a perfect 30 min. episode in the Twilight Zone. But pulling this pale story out to a full length movie? Please! The most annoying thing about this is the 8+ rating of the movie and all that hype! Best movie ever? Best plot twist ever? Oh, no! This movie was so boooring! So, Bruce Willis gets killed in the first five minutes... Why is everyone behaving so silly? Don't they know that he is dead? And that's when (about 30 minutes into the movie) you realize that you've just spoiled the movie. That should have been that awesome plot twist at the end! You silly! Since it is evident that Bruce is dead, it is rather frustrating to watch the scenes in which the director is trying to foreshadow the dark twist at the end. Banal, cliche and childish. Yawn! At least Bruce Willis is not wearing a bloody shirt this time, nice try though... I wouldn't say that this movie is bad, if only I hadn't seen some other good movies with really good and unpredictable thrilling plot twists. Yep, it can be done, if you just put a little more work in the movie instead of the commercials and adverts. If you want a good plot twist, go and watch Jacob's Ladder or Brazil or L.A. confidential! From this movie you can at least learn the Spanish for: "I don't want to be bored to death!"</fullReview>

Does that sound odd? Oh well.The focus of the movie seemed to be more the Bruce Willis character than the boy, but they both helped each other out. So it was cool. In a way, even though Bruce (first name basis) was the focus, the boy had the most important part. I think that made sense.I'm sure if my enjoyment wasn't slaughtered by previous patrons of the movie, I would have given this movie a MUCH higher rating. Alas, I'll never truly know how I would have viewed it, had I been ignorant.All in all, an alright flick, but I said it before, and I'll say it again, should have been more dead people.2.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The 6th Sense" was a big hit in 1999, Oscar nominations, the lot. Now I finally seen it and I must say that with the benefit of hindsight, the only startling thing about the film is the introduction of the sensational Haley Joel Osment. Plus, a terrific performance by Toni Collette. Other than that, the film is a mess. Am I wrong? A clever designed twist at the end seems to justify, clumsiness of major proportions. Just look at that wake where Haley reveals the message from the dead girl. Unforgivably lame. All the jolts are underline by a vulgar strike in the music score department. Really bad. Mr Night Shaymalan got very luck in 1999 and has not been able to repeat its fortune since, no matter the obvious, desperate attempts to grab another jackpot. "The Happening" was unwatchable, "Lady In The Water" the work of someone with a an alarming mounting ego. "Signs" another clumsy, half cooked semi idea. Strange, how time puts things in perspective. I was recently reminded that "The Towering Inferno" was also, in its day, nominated for an Oscar as the best film of its day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Sixth Sense" was a huge disappointment. If it was supposed to be a thriller, it was the dreariest thriller I've ever seen. Truthfully, I had to make an effort to stay awake during the thing so I could see how it ended. Maybe I should have seen the ending coming like a lot of other people, but I didn't. I think the reason is that it didn't make sense. I'm about to ruin the ending for you if you haven't seen the movie yet, but I know you've already seen it. So this kid who is terrified of dead people, even though you'd think he'd be used to be them by now, deals with his fear by spending all his time with a supposedly brilliant dead psychologist who goes for a year without knowing he's dead even though this troubled child is the only person he communicates with. That's the whole plot.Besides the inconsistencies in the plot, there was nothing about the movie that was the least bit scary. Yes, I get that the kid could see dead people. But that's all. They weren't trying to drown him or eat him. They were just there. One's ability to be scared by this hinges on their belief that death is in and of itself scary. But if you're not really afraid of death, which I'm not because it's inevitable, then the only thing that will sicken you will be the unrealistic, mind-numbingly dull dialogue that has become a trademark of all Shyamalan films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An original new kind of horror movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the coming of "The Sixth Sense" M. Night Shyamalan (how to pronounce it, I have no idea!) introduced a new kind of horror. The kind of horror that is more psychological than it is scary, although "The Sixth Sense" still has some good scares! The movie inspired many other movies like for example "The Others" with Nicole Kidman but also M. Night Shyamalan kept making movies in this new kind of horror style, movies like "Signs" and his most recent one "The Village".It's hard to say what it is that makes this movie such a masterpiece. It might be because of the superb mix of drama, thriller and horror elements. A thing why all these elements flow so well isn't only thanks to the directing but also due to the acting. Bruce Willis shows that he is a good actor and can also play a character without guns. Toni Collette is also good and warming as troubled mother but real discovery of the movie is of course Haley Joel Osment. He is more than just a child actor, he is a real actor! He really deserved his Oscar nomination for this movie and I wouldn't had mind him seeing winning it. Oh well, his hopefully his time will come, after all he is only just 16 now. The movie got nominated for 5 more Oscars including best picture and best director. The movie eventually went home empty handed, a shame because the movie deserved at least an Oscar nod.Already trademark M. Night Shyamalan element in a movie is the surprise ending. "The Sixth Sense" does have a good surprise ending, it's a kind of ending that makes you want to see the movie again after you finished watching it for the first time. Although not my favorite movie surprise ending of all time, it sure comes close to it!See this movie for the tension the drama and the surprise ending.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILER Let me start by saying the Sixth Sense is a good movie. A GOOD movie, not a great one. I'm not sure how this one got so big, I mean, yes it's got that nice twist, but it's also somewhat predictable and (SPOILER AHEAD!) comepletely ludicrous if you think about it. Think about it! seriously. This movie reminds me of Arlington Road and Reindeer Games in that the movie doesn't make sense if you sit down and rationally think about it. I mean, Bruce Willis has been dead for a year, an entire year. Don't you think he'd notice, particualrly that NO ONE talks to him, NO ONE except Osment! At one point, he says he "barely talks" to his wife anymore. Well, "barely" is different than "none" which would be the reality. Maybe I'm being too critical, but to me, a GREAT movie, like voters here have determined this is by putting it in the top 50 of ALL TIME, should really hold up to repeat viewings. I really have a feeling time is going to trivialize this one and reveal what it really is: a smart, but slow, effective thriller.One final note: while the Sixth Sense got way too much hype, UNBREAKABLE didn't get nearly enough. UNBREAKABLE is a far better film, although it has its flaws as well. Instead of being a solid genre piece like THE SIXTH SENSE though, it really is amazingly original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains SpoilerThe Sixth Sense is a good horror film if viewed only once. Additional viewing's unveil numerous inconsistencies and the blatant manipulations of the director. Really now, are we to believe that the main character, as played by Bruce Willis, is oblivious to the fact that since his traumatic experience of being shot, no living person is aware of his existence? Where does he get the referral for the young boy at the start of the film? Another disembodied dead psychologist I guess. Bruce Willis's character laments that he rarely (actually never) converse's with his wife or anybody else for that matter. We're supposed to believe that for a full year he wanders through life oblivious to the fact that no one acknowledges his presence. Horror films such as Psycho, Rosemary's Baby or The Shining stand up to repeated viewings because the essential story line of these films remains consistent and plausible within the world created by the director. There is a richness of ideas in these films that can be continually unearthed. The Sixth Sense is a one shot wonder, a good one at that, but it does not stand up to subsequent viewing's.</fullReview>

The kid is good but Bruce Willis doesnt show any emotions at all. A good performance they all say - what did he do but walk around solemnly. What is so good about this movie? The ending they all say. SPOILERS: So Bruce Willis never once had a shower in sixth months and noticed the bloody-big bullet hole in his chest rubbing that stinging soap into his gaping wound? He never once went to buy some groceries and wondered why the shop assistant didnt demand or take his money - just ignored him? He never talked to his wife once? He didnt think how rude Toni Collette was for not talking to him? She let him into her apartment and sat opposite him not doing anything at all. Either Willis is retarded or this movie blows. I think the latter. Ive given a low rating to bring this average down. Its not that i rank this movie alongside Streetfighter, Mac and Me, and The Secret Agent club, its not that bad.

		<fullReview>I realize this film had many good reviews. That's why I bought it. But it somehow managed to get by me without hooking me in. Its lack of impact had little to do with the acting, which is pretty good all around. Toni Collette is especially noteworthy. And Willis gives what is for him a subdued performance except, I have to say, that when he tries to grin with happiness or gets misty eyed with love, something within me begins to churn. The kid, Osment, is okay. Thank God he's not a cutie-pie.The direction is deliberate but effective, supported by a semi-somnolent score that throws in a sting from time to time, as when the first ghost appears briefly, to wake the audience up.The plot, alas, is a mish mash of overly familiar themes. Is it RIGHT to try to cure a kid who seems to know more than we do? (Cf., "Equus.") Even if the kid is frightened by the "dead people" he sees, who sometimes scream at him and scratch him? (Cf., "The Shining.") How come the kid speaks Latin? (Cf., "The Exorcist.") Or is this the momentary hallucination of someone who is dying? (Cf., "Incident at Owl Creek Bridge," or "Point Blank.") Who are these ghosts anyway? Why do they taunt the kid? Why does he see only tortured ones, people who have been hanged, poisoned, killed in car accidents, shot in the belly, or who slashed their wrists? Do they see each other? Do they eat and excrete? They seem to have the power to move objects in their environment. They can steal bumblebee pendants or scratch the kid. They can, to give a more specific example, shove a box containing an incriminating tape out from under a bed and ask Osment to show the tape to their bereaved father. Well then why can't they themselves give Dad the box? Or leave it where he's bound to find it? If someone has done them dirt why must they use Osment as the middleman? Why not just kick ass? Oh, and a final question. By the end of the film we know why Osment finally spills the beans to Willis, but why on earth hasn't he told his mother about it a long time ago? "I'm ready to communicate with you," he tells her solemnly when they're trapped in a traffic jam. Well, why now? There is one way, though, in which the plot is cleverly constructed. In fact, the surprise ending seems to have been thought of first and the entire movie structured around this revelation. Yes, the story is as full of holes as a slice of Emmenthaler cheese but the whole point is the onion soup beneath. That climactic twist is a big relief in another way. Now we know why nobody wants to talk to Bruce Willis except Osment. And it's not his aftershave lotion.It's a pretty gloomy picture actually, awfully low key, though the photography of Philadelphia is engaging. Willis and his wife, Olivia Williams, are shown admiring an award he has just won, as the film opens. They're drinking wine and joking about Dr. Seuss, but even then there's no exhilaration on the screen.However, people seem to have given this film a cornucopia of plaudits so the weakness may be mine rather than the story's. There is no statistically significant difference between women and men in the user ratings -- he said confidently after merely eyeballing the results. I would have predicted a greater appeal for women. Maybe you'll get more out of it than I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is not only one of the greatest thrillers ever made but also the occupier of perhaps the greatest cinematic twist in history ... It's just a shame that M. Night Shyamalan went off the rails for a while afterward. But I digress, The Sixth Sense is a psychological film that deals with emotion, faith and mostly people in general. Throughout the film a young boy named Cole Sear is revealed to be able to see the dear departed in their afterlife and It's left to an acclaimed psychologist played by Bruce Willis to help the young boy. It's not only terrifying throughout, but It's also a story of these two figurative characters at the same time. With scenes that leave you jumping out of your seat in shock and ones that give you goosebumps from awe, and as said the twist of Crowe being revealed to actually be dead after a chance encounter with his former patient Donnie Whalberg is so beautifully done. The Sixth Sense is a masterpiece that will most probably be seen by many more generations to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I see dead people! A film of suspense a tease of mind numbing thought.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally after all these years watched the suspense thriller "The Sixth Sense" and I know it's a highly respected film ,yet I for one didn't think it was the best as it's a film with twist that threw me off guard and was tough to find direction. Anyway the story takes place in the city of Philadelphia with Bruce Willis as Dr. Malcolm Crowe an award winning and well thought of psychologist who's assigned to a young man by the name of Cole Sear(Haley Joel Osment)who's a timid and confused eight year old boy who's clearly different as he can see things before they happen even seeing dead people. And Cole has a loving and tough single mom(played by Toni Collette)and thru it all this is a journey to learn what haunts the young boy and his life. As the film becomes a work of flashback and future seeing all while trying to throw it's viewer for a loop. I for one left after the viewing as to wonder and ask does the mind really play tricks on people during life, I think that's what "The Sixth Sense" tries to prove.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A boy who sees dead people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sixth Sense" is a film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan and usually seen as his best work. It runs for slightly over 100 minutes. The director also appears himself in the film again just like he usually does. I personally believe, however, that "Signs" is still his best work to this day. I have to say I enjoyed the first half of "The Sixth Sense" more than the second. It feels more intimate with basically the whole first half (after the shooting) being communications between Willis' and Osment's characters. If you know the final twist, it does not hurt the film at all. It even makes the interaction between Willis' character and his ex-wife more interesting: the Zoloft, her not speaking except "Happy anniversary!"... I've seen this film two or three times already and I always find something new and intriguing about it. The second half with the play and the interactions between the boy and other dead people did not do so much for me.The film scored six Academy Award nominations that year. The only one I'm a bit baffled with is Toni Collette, who I did not find that memorable. And Osment is obviously lead and not supporting. Back in 1999, over 15 years ago, this was the most successful film of the year at the box office, right behind the newest Star Wars film. I felt the film was at its weakest when it tried to go too much for horror instead of mystery thriller. Most of the dialogs were very well written, so no need to include any of the cheap thrills instead.Funnily enough, I watched the Witherspoon/Ruffalo comedy "Just like Heaven" before "The Sixth Sense" and in a way they are both about seeing dead (or almost dead) people. Of course, this one here is much more serious in tone. I recommend it and believe you should have seen it at least once, even if it certainly has more rewatch value than most people will admit, even if you know the final development of Willis' character. (I myself have to say Ik did not see it coming the first time I watched this movie.) Oh and if you liked Osment's work here, make sure to check out some of his other films. He did not have a career as great as this suggested he could, at least not yet, but he is a talented young actor, just like his sister Emily.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent thriller with a predictable ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched this movie later than most of the people did. As a punishment, I knew the twisted ending before I had watched the movie. However, although the idea was decent, there were horrible gaps and inconsistencies in the logic of the movie. Since it is a N. Shyamalan movie, people got used to these gaps and stuff over the years, however sixth sense is one of the firsts and I believe that is the reason for the high score in IMDb. If this movie was in cinemas in 2014 it could not get more than 6 or 7 stars at most.Anyway, our story is about an child psychologist who was shot in his house by a child whom he was not able to help in the past. It is not a spoiler yet because it is how everything started. Then he continues walking around for almost a year (they say next fall, but it means some time definitely passed), trying to help another little kid who claims to see "dead people who do not understand that they are dead". OK, this is also acceptable since it is the basis of many horror stories. Meanwhile his wife is not talking to him, not a word even and we have no idea why. He is the one who got shot, and next scene, wife is not talking to him. At the end, we understood that he is one of the dead people who is not aware of the situation. OK, I can accept this one as well. But how can they accept us to believe that it makes sense when no one is talking to you??? Your wife is not talking to you, even has not a single emotions towards you. Also in one scene, we see our guy waiting with the mother of the child in a living room for him to get back from school. Really? Not a single word with a foreigner in a room? He asked some questions like "hello, how are you? I am your child's shrink" and when she did not reply what happened? He taught that no one speaks with him because he got shot???In my opinion it was a forced ending. People were diverted from the fact by some scenes that makes no sense at all. For people who watched a thriller like "The Others", this movie is full of logic gaps. If you want to spend some nice time, I suggest this movie. However I believe it is not a master piece or worths anything around 8 stars...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the beginning of the story, Bruce Willis who acts as the main character refers to the secret the film has, and says that do not spoil it. Even it makes our expectations rise, the ending exceeds them. It is just fantastic. It is a horror movie. However it describes human relationships just like a human drama story. Each character has distress, and the film describes how they solve their torment and how they help each other. That is the reason this film fascinates us. It is not just a scary film.The framework of the story is polished up well. Before we know the secret, we enjoy the story and finally we are surprised by it. Even after we know the secret, we can watch the film from different points of view, and notice many things we cannot notice before we know the secret. We can enjoy watching it many times, and we will be touched each time by the well-polished up framework.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique concept and approach to old fashioned ghost story telling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Decided to revisit this classic. It was a brand new take on one of the more fundamental themes of the "scary movie" family of genres, life after death. M. Night Shyamalan adopted the always reliable Twilight Zone Gothic approach, but set up an all-time reverse twist finale that would have made Rod Serling stand up and applaud.This could be Bruce Willis's most understated and yet finest performances of his career. No laughing and destroying stuff; instead he approaches his role thoughtfully. It was a new side to him, and he carried himself well. He's a child psychiatrist, with a new patient, Haley Joe Osment, that is filled with angst and makes the claim that dead people are drawn to him like a magnet and talk to him. Osment's performance is emotional and oddly believable. His classic declaration about dead people "don't know they're dead!" is one of the best delivered ever.Ghost visitations are utilized perfectly and just often enough so that every one of them is executed with a dramatic impact and superior fright factor. Low lighting is used almost all the time for a dark, oppressive mood, which fits most of the time. Now the weaknesses. In retrospect, there are some serious lapses in logic through the course of the story. How could the "twist" have been concealed from the protagonist so long, without some character or action revealing the truth to him? The scenes that are meant to address this fail to explain it. There are some very awkwardly slow scenes in the story, and others that just aren't useful. These scenes are constructed to set up the shock value of the final reveal, but most of them are just plain dull.But overall, this is a fine work, complete with fine performances and an original concept that make for a good, scary ghost story.</fullReview>

I've herd so many times throughout the years, about how scary it is that I really expected a horror film. I mean, I guess it is a horror film, but it's a very restrained, very subtle one. In fact, this is my biggest surprise with it. I expected some cheesy stuff, seeing as how Shyamalan later went on to become that sort of filmmaker, but this is some good stuff. Bruce Willis and Toni Collette are both pretty effective, but it's Haley Joel Osment who truly penetrates the mind and delivers some truly haunting, searing work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I See Dead People</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For centuries people have believed that children are better than adults at seeing ghosts. Some people claim its because they are innocent and haven't been coerced by modern thoughts. In this film, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) tells his psychologist, Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) "I see dead people. They want me to do things for them." We learn Cole has powers and can connect with the ghosts of troubled people. Cole doesn't understand his powers, and has little control over them. Dr. Crowe is the only one Cole feels he can share his secret with. However, as Dr. Crowe reaches deeper into Cole's mind, it leads to strange and unexpected consequences for both of them. Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, The Sixth Sense is a thrilling suspenseful ride with an ending you'll never see coming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great masterpiece of a movie with good twist! Not a boring moment, great paced, and quality acting. If you haven't already seen this movie, then stop reading this and watch it now. You won't be disappointed! 'You ever feel the prickly things on the back of your neck? And the tiny hairs on your arm, you know when they stand up? That's them. When they get mad... it gets cold.' This movie isn't a thriller in that sense, rather more a ghost story but done right. It will still have a creepy vibe, and not seem at all far fetch - made even more so by the young 9 year old boy, Cole (Haley Joel Osment), getting treated by a psychologist due to being able to glimpse into the hidden dimensions of the lost and mostly angry dead people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Films in One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this film up until the final scene, which made me love it. I disagree with many here. I didn't see the clues or hints. I didn't see them at all. It completely came as a shock. And when I watched it again, I saw it in a completely different way. It felt like I had watched not one, but two films. Very rarely does a film this perfect come out. A film that hits everything it wants to and possibly even more. From the bright red coloured objects in high strung moments to the scene where the girl's father finds out that his wife poisoned their daughter, it simply gets everything spot on.The fear factor isn't what makes this film good. It shouldn't be compared to other horrors. It's trying to send different messages across. It has very few 'jump' scenes and moments that make you feel cold. It is supposed to make you feel for the dead and become understanding. It makes you feel how the boy, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), feels throughout the movie. And, most importantly, it makes you feel for the doctor, Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), in the final scene. It is a very unique, exciting film.M. Night Shyamalan both writes and directs this nigh perfect film. He makes every scene, every revelation, have the perfect feeling to it. Somehow, he makes us feel how the two main protagonists feel throughout the movie through both the writing and directing. One big problem people seem to have with 'The Sixth Sense' is Malcolm Crowe. People dislike how he could spend years with his wife and not realise that he was dead and she couldn't see him.If you pay attention, you'll see that he skips through his daily life. He misses certain parts, even days, without realising. A big example is when he can't open the basement door. He reaches for his keys in his pocket, but then he's in the cellar. He never got his keys out, he's supposed to have just appeared there without realising he hadn't opened the door. This happens at other moments in the film, if you look closely. He just appears with Cole or his wife, shifting between the two.The film really is a masterpiece. You'll probably miss many rules and clues throughout the movie, as I did, so I suggest you watch the special feature 'Rules and Clues' which is very interesting and explains things you miss or problems you think there are when there aren't. Unlike most special features, this film has interesting ones with Shyamalan and the crew, who also did a fantastic job creating the movie. I highly recommend the features nearly as much as I do the film.Overall, a very nice film made a masterpiece by the final moments. Throughout the entire thing, I felt that Malcolm was helping Cole, but it turns out they were both helping each other, Cole actually helping Malcolm more than Malcolm is Cole. A film that you watch entirely differently a second time around must be one of the greatest. This deserves to be in the Top 100 films, but I'm satisfied with its current placing. It deserves the attention and awards it has got. A true masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, I didn't like Bruce Willis as an actor, that was until I saw The Sixth Sense. I thought he was fantastic as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, whom specialises in helping children with psychiatric problems. The other impressive actor in the film was young Haley Joel Osment who was truly fantastic in a lead role at such a young age. This film goes down as one of my favourite thrillers of all time due to a fantastic plot and a fantastic cast. It is a very moving film that reduced me to tears at the end. Behind every corner there is a shocking twist in the plot as the storyline is so unpredictable. The Sixth Sense is a work of art and is a must-see for everyone, you wont regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I see dead people"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie isn't just thriller in the modern sense, but it is also a ghost story that is fresh and original, even to this day. It has long been believed that children are better than adults at seeing ghosts; in this movie, that holds true. A small boy (played by Haley Joel Osment) solemnly tells his psychologist, "I see dead people. They want me to do things for them." He seems to be correct. Using an "as if" approach to therapy, the psychologist Crowe (played by Bruce Willis) asks Cole (Osment), "What do you think the dead people are trying to tell you?" This is an excellent question, seldom asked in ghost stories, where the heroes are usually so egocentric they think the ghosts have gone to all the trouble of appearing simply so they can see them. Cole has some ideas. Crowe wonders whether the ideas aren't sound even if there aren't really ghosts.Bruce Willis often finds himself in fantasies, action and science fiction films. Perhaps he fits easily into them because he is so down to earth. He rarely seems ridiculous, even when everything else in the screen is absurd because he hardly ever over-acts; he usually plays his characters flat and matter of fact. And in a movie like this, is needs to be played like that because it makes the character of Crowe more believable, and the plot more engaging.Haley Joel Osment, his young co-star, is a very good actor in a film where his character possibly has more lines than anyone else. He's in most of the scenes, and he has to act in them--this isn't a role for a cute kid who can stand there and look solemn in reaction shots. There are fairly involved dialogue passages between Willis and Osment that require good timing, reactions and the ability to listen. I have to admit I was blind-sided by the ending. The solution to many of the film's puzzlements is right there in plain view, and the movie hasn't cheated, but the very boldness of the storytelling carried me right past the crucial hints and right through to the end of the film, where everything takes on an intriguing new dimension. "The Sixth Sense" has a kind of calm, sneaky self-confidence that allows it to take us down a strange path, intriguingly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe everyone has seen random films before, but there eventually you come along and find one that really gets you thinking about the film, how films are made and basically gives a totally different perspective to the naive one you had before. For me, this was that film. It is because of this film that led to watch so many other brilliant films and had the pleasure to experience them. The Sixth Sense had a smooth pace throughout with sufficient action and scares to live up to its horror/thriller genre, outstanding acting by Haley Joel Osment (which is rare in child actors), a wonderful soundtrack and of course, a beautifully done ending which certainly caught me by surprise as my heart plummeted having suddenly understood his wife's actions and had me thinking about it for days on end. This film intertwined romance as well as suspense, horror and action. This is without a shadow of a doubt my favourite film and deserves to be recommended to everyone who hasn't seen it.

		<shortDescription>More Than Just a Brilliant Twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you were to merely mention the name M. Night Shayamalan in a room full of movie watchers, you would either elicit hysterical laughter, or hysterical sobbing. M. Night Shayamalan is the infamous director of some of the worst movies of all time. So one could be forgiven for forgetting that at the beginning of his career, Shayamalan was one of the most promising new directors in Hollywood. The Sixth Sense is a testament to his initial genius.Very little of The Sixth Sense can be revealed without potentially spoiling something (don't worry, I will avoid spoilers in this review). However, the basics of the story is as follows: Brilliant child psychologist, Dr. Malcolm Crowe, is attempting to help a young boy, Cole Sear, whom acts almost jarringly like a previous patient of Malcom's. This previous patient of Malcom's ultimately committed suicide, so in order to redeem himself (and lift the guilt of his failure), Malcom tries to help Cole, though he quickly discovers that this case may be much more serious than he first anticipated.The Sixth Sense creates a chilling atmosphere. It is a bit frightening (occasionally terrifying), but incredibly skilled to be certain. The cinematography (while more than a touch odd- sometimes distractedly so) amplifies the creepiness and the tension. The Sixth Sense is a masterpiece of mood.Of course, the element that The Sixth Sense is known best for, is the twist at the end. In my opinion, the end twist is perfect, and for a large number of reasons. For one, the movie is not about the twist. The Sixth Sense is not merely a build-up to get to the finish. In fact, this would have been a perfectly satisfying movie without the twist. But the last 3 or 4 minutes of the film is really what causes it to rise above so many others.The twist also makes one think. It forces one to reconsider almost the entire events of the film. To replay them in one's mind. It causes one to have a different perspective on everything. It's so obvious. It makes so much sense. But you can't see it coming. There are many brilliant twists in the world of, not only film, but literature and even music. The Sixth Sense will likely remain as one of my all time favorite twists.However, as I mentioned, The Sixth Sense is a fascinating, creepy, and completely gripping experience, even without the brilliant twist. The story is highly intriguing, and as events unfold, things get more and more interesting. Alas, The Sixth Sense is mislabeled as a horror film. And while there are moments of somewhat grisly violence (and moments of undeniable terror), simply calling The Sixth Sense a horror film is a disservice to the film's successful mystery elements. Because at the heart of The Sixth Sense, it is a mystery. A wickedly creepy mystery that seems all wrapped up by the penultimate scene (and easily could've ended there), but the last scene makes is what really concludes the mystery.And then there's the acting, which is excellent. The highlight is undeniably Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear, the disturbed child. His performance is one of my favorite child performances of all-time (closely rivaling my other favorite; Asa Butterfield in Hugo). He absolutely kills every scene he's in. Osment sells the tears, the stress, the anxiety, and the intelligence that's so important to convey in this character. This is not an easy role, but Osment not only succeeds, he triumphs. Osment's performance is so extraordinary, one almost forgets that the rest of the cast also flourishes. Bruce Willis as Dr. Malcolm nails it, by balancing sympathy and wit into a likable and layered character. Toni Collette as Lynn Sear- Cole's mother- is also a sympathy producing role, and is handled with the right amount of strength, and motherly kindness.James Newton Howard's score is mostly atmospheric. It enhances the film, and unlike most atmospheric scores, it has a distinctive personality that one can recognize even without the picture in front of them. The Sixth Sense is both an intellectually satisfying film, and a thrilling one. It's gripping, riveting, and at times, a bit scary. But it's a sensational experience that must be seen to believed. It truly is a shame that M. Night has become one of the biggest jokes in cinematic history, because his earliest contribution to mainstream film is a very important one.</fullReview>

I don't ever recall seeing such a fine performance from a child actor.Bruce Willis is brilliant in this role, such a difference from those we're used to seeing him in, and Toni Collette gives a very powerful portrayal of the bewildered mother.This is such a haunting film, please excuse the pun! But that is the word for it, as it stays in your mind for long after. Even when you know the ending, the whole story is so well crafted and beautifully told, you can enjoy it all over and over.I don't think M. Night has really done anything since that lives up to this, which is a shame as he is clearly a talented director and writer. This film is something special, so if you actually haven't seen it, treat yourself! It's worth every minute!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cole is having visions and Dr. Crowe is to help him, but realizes these visions may be real and there may be benefits to such a special gift</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In The Sixth Sense, Dr. Malcolm Crowe played by Bruce Willis is sought out by Cole Sears' mother. Cole is played by Haley Joel Osmont and is experiencing visions that are worrying his mother Lynn Sear played by Toni Collette. Cole's visions are those of the dead who do not realize they are actually dead. There is ongoing conflict between if Cole is actually having these visions and if he is what is causing them. With Dr. Crowes passion for work, he and Cole develop a relationship. Crowe at first finds it hard to believe the problems that are affecting Cole, but then realizes there may be similarities between Cole and a former patient of Dr. Crowe's. As Cole opens up to Dr. Crowe and his mother about his visions they slowly start to realize that what he is seeing may be real. Cole has to convince his mother by questioning her about a dance recital she felt her mom did not attend and ultimately provides the answer of her question she would ask while alone at her mother's gravesite. Cole's gift was something that was to help those understand the reasoning of some deaths and to help the restless souls find peace and to give comfort to their loved ones that had unanswered questions. In the birthday party scene, Cole wanders upstairs after seeing a red ballon drift to the ceiling. Cole starts to hear the voices coming from behind the closet door and is stuck in shock. Two children then decide to play a trick on Cole and place him in the closet. Cole is then attacked by the dead character that was stating he "did not steal the master's horse. In the scene the relevance of color used and camera angles contributed to the significance of the scene. At the point Cole's mother had taken extreme cautiousness in her son's claims of seeing and hearing things. The sound effects used to depict the undead before Cole's entrance into the closet, and the sounds used while in the closet made the scene that much more dramatic. The pain was so horrifying that the screams could be heard over the loud music of the party and attracted not only Cole's mother, but other party goers. The slow motion at the end of the scene where Ms. Sears is pulling Cole out of the closet gives the dramatic effect needed to show the seriousness of the scene and that Cole may actually be telling the truth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan directed this superbly crafted tale that stars Bruce Willis as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist who has an eventful night where he receives an award, then is shot by a disgruntled ex-patient(played by Donnie Wahlberg). Later on, he is assigned the case of a young boy named Cole Sear(played by Haley Joel Osment) who claims to see ghosts which terrify him(and alienates him from his schoolmates), which troubles his disbelieving mother(played by Toni Collette) while Malcolm tries to reconnect with his wife(played by Olivia Williams). The truth of the situation will come as quite a shock to Crowe by the end... Chilling film with outstanding direction and performances(particularly Osment, who is superb) and a smart script. Astute viewers may see the final twist coming, but that doesn't lessen its impact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I see dead people and I see a wonderful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's sad that the career of M. Night Shyamalan went so wrong . After the brilliant " The Sixth sense" he made great and underrated "Unbreakable" and flawed but good "Signs". He lost his touch with "The village" and every next movie he made was worse and worse. Now his name is some sort of joke and people criticize even his best movies . "The Sixth sense" is an object of many attacks with "overrated" and "boring" being the most popular words from the critics of this movie.This movie was inspired by episode of TV series "Are you afraid of the dark ?" . It's a cross between "The Exorcist" and "Ordinary people" . It explains why the movie is both really scary and heartbreaking. It relies on imagination and psychology to scare you . It's really scary despite the PG-13 rating. Actually "SS" is really a thriller full of many small twists and fantastical finale. Some people say that since the guessed right the finale it means the movie is bad. That's not true (Hitchcock's "Psycho" is a masterpiece despite rather predictable ending). It is impossible to make a twist totally unpredictable. While I agree that there is a stretch in terms of logic the finale is still incredibly clever ? the movie doesn't keep any important facts in secret , it's our point of view that fools us. A movie must work on its own terms before springing a surprise. This movie certainly does.It works as a thriller , as a horror , but more importantly as a drama. You care about what happens to Cole Sear and Dr. Malcolm Crowe . You want everything to workout for Cole and his mother. There are many heartbreaking scenes in this movie ? the broken window in the shop , the talk in the hospital , the talk in the car and the confession from Dr. Crowe to his wife.Bruce Willis gives an great performance against his macho image , Haley Joel Osment is extraordinary , Toni Collette is underrated for her superb performance , and the performance of Donnie Wahlberg mustn't be forgotten.The directing by Shyamalan is superb - excellent use of colors , mirrors and shadows, the lighting, eccentric camera viewpoint, psychological tension? Screenplay is rich , full of great dialogue and incredibly realistic human interactions . Who could forget the famous "I see dead people" line.Don't listen to critics . Great art defends itself. I give it 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece from Shyamalan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing so much hype about it, I decided to watch the movie recently and I was satisfied. I know, everyone spoils the ending, but that doesn't make it bad. Yeah, the pacing is slow, but at no point is it boring. This movie worked on so many levels and I enjoyed the chemistry between Bruce Willis &amp; Haley Joel Osment, which was phenomenal! Just putting it out there before you see it, this is a psychological horror movie, so if you're expecting a gory slasher movie, you'll be incredibly disappointed.The film revolves around a troubled young boy named Cole, who sees ghosts and is very intelligent. Bruce Willis plays his psychologist named Dr. Crowe and was faced with similar circumstances when a former patient broke into his home, earlier in the story. After making that fatal mistake, he is determined to not screw up again, by closely listening to Cole and helping him through his problems.Rather than relying on bloody violence and/or constant mutilation, which most horror movies use as their substance, "The Sixth Sense" keeps you hooked with its unpredictable twists and deliberate suspense that Shymalan puts on the audience. Watch it for what it is and you'll enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It becomes another movie upon a second viewing; and that's great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though this movie has been out quite a while now, I still feel the need to advise you that there will be spoilers in this review.What I loved most about this movie didn't even happen the first time I watched it; it happened the second time! Malcolm, in my first viewing, seemed like a good guy who was using Cole as a surrogate for a mistake he made with a previous child. The movie seemed like Malcolm felt if he could help Cole, it would be like helping the previous child he originally "failed." And Cole, in my first viewing, seemed like a child with a secret that he did not trust Malcolm with. Then we find out that Cole sees dead people, and that Malcolm had been dead for most of the movie.That first viewing was incredibly satisfying. Then, some months later, I watched it with a friend who had not yet seen it. And in that second viewing I experienced a whole new movie. Now it was about a ghost unable to accept the failure that cost him his life, and a boy who did not understand why was trying to understand why this ghost was trying to be more helpful than the other ones; and how they each helped the other to come to terms and accept what they were.Very rarely does a movie give me such an experience, and that is why I have always made it a movie that I have had in VHS, DVD, and now Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant Psychological Horror film that leaves a HUGE lasting impact...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sixth sense is a psychological horror film starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment in the lead. It is a story about a married and successful award winning child psychologist who finds out that he failed one of his patients, he keeps thinking about this failure and tries to correct it and soon he meets another boy who suffers from the same problem as that failed patient and the doctor decides to help him to redeem himself. That is all I can say without spoiling the actual plot.In traditional terms, this is not a full fledged horror flick, there are several dramatic and emotional scenes in the movie, elements of the study of human behavior is also involved. It is more of a mix of drama and psychological horror. The horror scenes in the Sixth Sense rely on scary or dangerous looking ghosts and sound effects, now the sound effects do leave an impact but the creepy looking ghosts in films used to scare me when I was a kid, now that I am grown up this doesn't work anymore. That doesn't mean that the great sound effects won't make you feel the chills and some scenes will startle you or shock you for a few moments. Specially if you are watching the film alone in a dark room.The music in this film is brilliant, I already mentioned the sound effects but the music used for emotional scenes in the movie really helps build up the mood and suits the scenes perfectly. The acting is absolutely fantastic, Bruce Willis who is best known for action roles in films like the Die Hard Series, performs the role of Dr. Milcolm very well, it is not only shocking to see him fit so well in a role like this but act so well. Haley Joel Osment does a fantastic job, his facial expressions and delivery just feel so natural, its amazing how he could act so well at such a young age. Toni Colette and Olivia Williams have limited roles but they do good with all the screen time they get.The movie is deep and leaves you thinking, but it moves at a very slow pace and it may lose the attention of the audience at least in the first half . I also can't help but feel that this film heavily relies on its twist at the end to leave a major lasting impact on the audience rather than leaving that impact as a whole. The twist is excellent and surprising &amp; it definitely adds a whole lot to the plot and the premise of the film as whole. The problem is that The film will only leave a full impact when you watch it for the second time, knowing what the twist at the end will be, only then you will be able to enjoy the Sixth Sense to its fullest and properly comprehend it.Overall Rating: 8.5/10</fullReview>

This movie is perfection! If you like drama, mystery and suspense then this film is for you. I won't spoil what it's about but I will say I've never seen anything like it. The chemistry between Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis is incredible! They need to be in another movie together. The fact that such a young kid can be such a powerful actor is amazing. You should never doubt the youth because you never know what they can do. So check this movie out if you haven't already because it's huge. I've never met anyone who has disliked this film. It's up there with "Titanic" and "Psycho".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen this movie, I recommend you watch it. It has one of the biggest plot twists in cinema and leaves you until the very end wanting more. The acting is phenomenal. Haley Joel Osment makes a great protagonist as Cole Sear, a young boy who has the ability to see dead people. Bruce Willis also does a remarkable job. Making his character seem believable. He plays as Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist who intends to help Cole, after a failure with his former client Vincent Grey. Even though you might've not seen the film but know the ending, I still suggest you watch it. The ending of this film isn't the only highlight of it. If you watch and listen closely, you will understand and see more depth to this film than just the ending. That characters all help each other in a way, they all make choices that develop them by the end of the film. This movie should get a higher rating on here. It deserves more rates.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Value of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about The Sixth Sense, I imagined a movie that deals with the terrifying side of the paranormal. What I didn't expect was the unusually interesting relationship between a young child and man who are going through troubles in their respective lives. Everyone goes through problems, so it's nice to see people trying to overcome such large ones.If you're looking for a strictly horror movie, this is not the flick. I'm sure you can find haunted kids in The Shining or Insidious. The Sixth Sense goes beyond the average thriller since it deals with the supernatural and romance (which some may argue are not two entirely independent themes). I must say that I was happily surprised with this movie. It did start quite slowly but built a strong story gradually that really gets emotional. Rarely does a movie combine aspects of such contrast so effectively, but do in part to the solid acting, this movie certainly delivers a unique twist. All in all, The Sixth Sense was a terrific movie. The whole plot was carefully constructed and managed to turn a common mystery into a life lesson.</fullReview>

The most moving point is that just a little child'strange ability has great mission to tell the truth for people. Moreover, such the child and the adult who has trouble help each other to make up for their fault though there are many terrible and scary scenes the whole time. At the ending, however, I cannot help and stop shedding tears. This is the best thriller film I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching The Sixth Sense for the first time is a seriously creepy experience topped off with one hell of a clever twist. Subsequent viewings might lack the same level of spookiness, and prior knowledge of the ending robs the film of its novelty factor, but hindsight still makes for a very interesting watch: knowing the twist means that the viewer sees the film from a different viewpoint, paying particular attention to the details, thereby driving home what a superb film this is, writer/director M. Night Shyamalan clearly having gone to great pains to ensure that all possible plot-holes can be satisfactorily explained.Bruce Willis, taking a break from his usual tough-guy action roles, is excellent as child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe, but the star's thunder is stolen by 11-year old Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear, the child who can see dead people, who puts in an amazingly assured and thoroughly believable performance for one so young. Also making an impression are Toni Collette as Cole's concerned mother Lynn and Olivia Williams as Anna Crowe, Malcolm's wife.Sadly, M. Night Shyamalan has earnt himself a pretty rotten reputation as a film-maker in recent years thanks to succession of box-office flops, but don't let that put you off checking out this wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupendous surprise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really caught me by surprise! I saw it in a theatre on the big screen when it was first released and only knew that it dealt with the problems of a special young child.I watched the introductory scenes, trying, as I always do, to absorb all of the clues. In a really good movie, every single thing that is presented--whether it be visual, audio, or implied--is an important piece of the puzzle, especially in stories about mystery and/or the supernatural.Having seen all of M Night Shyamalan's other movies, I didn't expect very much. Although his ideas are usually quality, somehow the movie versions somehow always seem to fall short on the big screen. But, this particular story really delivered! A visual artist, myself, I am most often able to "see through" a developing story line by using the above-mentioned clues presented during the story progression. This was just about the only movie that really fooled me. It was so expertly handled that I simply "glossed over" the beginning sequence of events and allowed myself to become swept up by the fairly fast-paced plot and forgot to consider doubt in the general premise of the story.Excellent acting, especially by Mr. Willis and amazing young Mr. Osment, definitely contributed to the story, as did all other actors, who never once phoned in their performances but, also, did not overplay their roles either, making this unusual story seem quite plausible. The sets, costumes, and even musical score were appropriate and added a real air of authenticity. Great direction and production values also contributed to a fine overall production.Just about one second before the rest of the audience "caught on" to the stunning plot twist near the end of the movie, I almost jumped up out of my chair and screamed, "I get it! He's.....! Now, it all makes perfect sense!" After leaving the theatre, all the way to the back of the parking lot, all I could talk about to my companions was my complete surprise and how this quite remarkable movie production suckered me in at the start and kept me guessing until the final scene!Enjoy this outstanding movie in the comfort of your own home, without pausing the DVD at any point and let it take you firmly by the hand and move you through the storyline without discussion along the way. I hope you will be as surprised as I was! 9 out of 10!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the Only One....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the M. Night Shamalyan films that have been made (out of which I've seen five or six) this film (The Sixth Sense) is the only one I liked. Probably because it is the only one with a reasonably consistent plot that has a nice logical (but quirky) ending. All the others are full of loose ends that never come together, are illogical or have endings that are not explained or so contrived that I can only call them 'cop outs'. An example is 'Signs' which ends with a very small alien invasion by creatures intelligent enough to travel from the stars but who cannot figure out how to break into a rickety old barn who get so frustrated that they simply disappear. I suppose they get back into their starship and go home. As to who these alien gents are, where they came from or what they want is never explained and is really unrelated to anything else in the film. Shamalyan's work is very sloppy. What should be clever plot twists or fascinating endings turn out to be foolish tries, very falsely contrived or just too impossible to suspend disbelief. He must think we are all idiots. Guess who I think is the real idiot?</fullReview>

This is about Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis),a child psychologist, who meets a strange, frightened, confused boy named Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). Dr. Crowe is trying to help the boy with his problem, Cole does not think he can help him though. What Dr. Malcom does not know about Cole's "talent" or when Cole tells him, he does not believe Cole about this sixth sense. This is one of my favorite movies of all time because of the dense and quiet atmosphere. This is to date the scariest film I have ever seen because it is very unexpected in what it does. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a good scare or likes a good ghost movie.</fullReview>

I meant kids that aren't kid-like or too kid-like. You know the Home Alone kind of kids or very overdone sentimental kids..""Right. Well it was a drag. Bruce should stick to Die Hard movies or movies like Pulp Fiction. " Henry said."And that is it?" Kristl raised an eyebrow."What else is there to say. Nothing happened, no action. No scary monsters. No creepy situations. And when they finally get to the point where the kid finds out he can help the dead so they leave him be, it is emoted as if he just saw his pet fish die. Let's get another movie.""Uhm. Usually that is my line. You didn't like the way the kid bonded with Bruce?. The way the mother and son relations developed? And the whole time you don't quite know if the boy is imagining things or actually seeing them. It was nice acted, a nice story and a nice script.

Here it just drags on and on and on. People should learn when to quit." Henry said with a certain anger."Wow." Kristl said, ""And all of these senseless things. You know the 'big surprise' at the end. If you look back you see there are so many loopholes and it feels like that bag of Tim's Sea Salt and Vinegar turns into sawdust after you eaten it.

And why did the kid not hide from him?:"Wait...you didn't predict the ending, did you?""Nope..But the strange thing was.. I knew it somehow without knowing it. It was like a big letdown. Like when you watch a detective movie but the most important clue is only revealed at the end by the 'great detective'. It stinks." Henry said, "And it took hundred minutes of boredom to get to that point. It's not a great surprise.. it just unhinges the movie.""Well, I like it.""And I don't.

		<fullReview>The Sixth SenseThe Sixth Sense is a film that is a 'must-watch' Bruce Willis plays his role as a psychologist excellent and aims to help a child that conquers a sixth sense. The film is based in Philadelphia in the 90's and is a mysterious horror film who Dr Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) tries to communicate to Cole who is a young boy who experiences a sixth sense that is differentiating him from normal people causing him to worry his mother. The film has a sensational plot to it as it keeps you hanging off your seat and wanting to find out what will happen next. This movie keeps the audience thinking about not only what will happen next but why the things happened leaving it up to the audience to put the puzzle of the mystery together. It gives an interaction between the audience and the plot keeping the viewer thinking. I believe this is a great movie, with a variety of jaw-dropping moments throughout the movie leaving the audience in a world quite different from their own. In this horror the audience can relate to the characters as it gives a relationship to help interact with the movie and feel what is actually going on. There are also some thrilling scenes in 'The Sixth Sense' is quite frightening with some supernatural creatures that are terrifying to see, but still enough to keep watching the movie. The young boy, Cole, is considered a freak throughout the film and plays the characters role very well making the audience believe he is a freak as well. Cole is the person who experiences the 'Sixth Sense' and this is why Dr Malcolm appears to help him with his issue but Cole denies help. For the rest of the film supernatural experiences happen to the world they both live in and it all becomes a mystery.I enjoyed this movie, and believe it is an excellent movie for ages 13 years and older. This is a PG 13+ movie and but may be quite complex and misleading so some thought needs to go into what is being watched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did watch M. Night Shyamalan's first movie, The Sixth Sense - that got nominated for six Oscars including Best Picture of 1999 - for the first time over a year ago, but I have not watched it since then. So, I re-watched it again and I still loved it ever since the first time I watched it.STORY: One night, child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), is confronted by a former patient named Vincent (Donnie Wahlberg), who shoots Crowe in the stomach and then he kills himself. Months later, Crowe is visited by Cole (Haley Joel Osment), a 9-year-old boy who communicates with spirits who don't realize that they're dead. So, Crowe tries to help Cole to deal with his problem the best that he could.MY THOUGHTS: The story to The Sixth Sense is extremely well-written by Shyamalan. It was smart, keeps your interest the whole time right until the movie is over, and it never fails talking about the certain themes dealing with communication, child psychology, and life and death. There were also some scenes that were eerie (especially when Cole is seeing these ghosts). The dialogue in this is very intelligent.The direction by Shyamalan is simply excellent. He captures every emotion and everything that was symbolic on the right note.The music by James Newton Howard is terrific and fits the scenes well. Even if there are emotional, it still fits them well.Most of his movies are known for having a twist ending. The twist where Crowe was a ghost and was dead throughout the entire film was greatly-executed and rather shocking.THE ACTING: Bruce Willis delivers a fantastic performance as Crowe, the psychologist who tries to help Cole with his problem. Haley Joel Osment received a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance as Cole. I wish he could have taken home the Oscar because he did such a phenomenal job playing him. His emotions were believable and his most famous line, "I see dead people" gives me chills down my spine. Toni Collette also got nominated for an Oscar (Best Supporting Actress) for her performance as Cole's mother, Lynn. I think he does a very believable job. Olivia Williams does a good job as Crowe's wife.IN CONCLUSION: The Sixth Sense is a fantastic movie, and a great start to M. Night Shyamalan's directing career. It had great acting, a well-written story, believable characters, a great twist ending.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrifying and Tragic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This tragic tale of spirits and psychology weaves together in an overall decent film starring 'Die Hard' star Bruce Willis in the role of child psychologist Malcolm Crowe who is shot by a psychotic ex-patient. He recovers soon after and heads back to work on a case involving a little boy who "sees dead people" (the boy is played by a young Haley Joel Osment). As the terror increases, Dr. Crowe soon realizes that nothing in his world is as it seems. The director manages to incorporate several terrifying twists such as the film's dramatic climax when Willis' character discovers the truth. However much of the film is clich with the spirits that pop up to terrify Osment's character and his mother throughout the film. The truly fabulous moments in the film are the opening and closing scenes of the film where the viewer gets the background and the tragic conclusion of this story. In all, it's a decent terror ride for audience members at least 12 and up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a student film and a made for TV film, M. Night Shymalan made his first blockbuster, the Sixth Sense. It is often regarded as one of the greatest thrillers of all time, mostly for it's creepy atmosphere, dark story, and twist ending. While I would consider this to be Shymalan second best film, it doesn't quite match Signs for me personally.It can be a bit slow at parts, almost pretentious at times. Also, I wish the film had had a bit more comic relief, I know it's a dark story, but it's so depressing that I almost hate watching it at times. Not as bad as Unbreakable but a little bit more comic relief could have helped.Yes, the twist ending is great, now the twist was actually spoiled for me before I saw the film, but what's great about this movie is that you can go back and watch it and look for clues to find out the twist ending. It's downright scary at times. The acting is fantastic, Haley Joel Osment giving one of the best young child performances in the history of film. And the direction is fantastic. The use of the color red to show when a ghost is near, the great framing of shots, everything is great. And it doesn't explain everything for you, letting you figure out some stuff for yourself.The Sixth Sense is a great movie, and easily one of Shymalan's best, it doesn't rank quite as good as Signs, but it's a damn creepy film with great direction and acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know many people will think different. Maybe because this movie was so surprisingly good, the author might be afraid of screw up the reputation by making a not so good sequel. I doubt it, I guess Mr. Shyamalan will not be reckless to do that. My humble advise: just keep the standards. Why a sequel others might ask? Here is my point of review. Malcolm (B. Willis) did help the kid's (H.J. Osment)issues but what about the tormented should who actually was Malcolm's helpless patient? And the kid continued seeing ghosts. There are many opportunities and fans will love to have the pleasure to enjoy a sequel of one of the best thriller movies ever. Come on, let's do it!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The incredible hype surrounding M. Night Shyamalan as the next Alfred Hitchcock is a bit premature in retrospect. He has turned out to be another Orson Welles(Citizen Kane) instead. I wasn't crazy about Welle's so called masterpiece, and although I was entertained by The Sixth Sense, it is nowhere near my favorite films of all time. Bruce Willis is a psychologist who is shot in the stomach by a former, disgruntled patient. The guy then shoots himself. Months later, Dr. Crowe(Willis) treats a new patient, Cole, who has similar problems to the man who shot him. Cole tells him that he sees dead people. Through a series of events, the doctor is convinced that the kid does have a unique ability, and he tells him to use it to help others. The boy solves the crime of a little girl poisoned by her mother. Other strange visions occur until a big surprise ending, which I did not guess. The movie is very good, but not as great as advertised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Child psychologist Malcom Crowe is one night visited by an ex-patient named Vincent, angry, enraged. He wounds Crowe, then kills himself.A few months later, Crowe is visited by a 9-year old boy named Cole.He says sees dead people who do not know they are dead. Because of this, he is called a freak in school.Crowe, at first thinks he is seeing things, but after spending a lot of time with Cole (much to his wife's dismay), he discovers Cole may be telling the truth after all.....First things first, this is an amazing film, but it never has the impact on you like it did the first time you ever saw it.To be honest, I never knew the twist right until the very end, and it took my breath away. It was something that had never been done before, and 1999 this was classed as a Bruce Willis movie.But as you get older and wiser, you become aware of the massive plot holes that cover the narrative.How was Malcom discharged from hospital? How did he get Coles notes? How did Coles mother let Malcom in the house? How does Malcom feel about his wife never speaking to him? These are endless questions that could bug you, but you find yourself never asking them whilst the film is on because it's truly gripping.Willis is as excellent as ever, and the creepy sense of unease you get, is sometimes unbearable. The line 'I see dead people' always brings a tear to my eye, and it's a shame that Osment never really took of, because he is phenomenal in this.The rest of the cast are great, and the film can be very uplifting as well as scary, and this is the high watermark in Shyalamans career.Close to perfection.</fullReview>

The part which one is make me cry, Cole: Instead of something I want, can it be something I don't want? Malcolm: Okay... Cole: I don't wanna be scared anymore. Seeing him I wanted to hug him, protect him from all unrighteousness. Because I do not wanted to see his fearful eyes. Now I want to talk about importance of this movie for film history. This movie is like a milestone. Because this is the first time, audience can not guess the final of movie. My suggestion is everyone should put this movie in own archive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror at it's finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't usually like horror movies, for most of them (at least the newest ones) are more sick and disgusting than scary and intriguing. I was, therefore, a bit skeptical about The Sixth Sense... but the movie paid off. Very few horror films have made me feel like this one... and even fewer ever made me think like this one. That feeling when you watch a movie, and with every scene you become more eager to know what will come next is priceless, and you experience it on this film constantly. If there is anything at all bad to say about M. Night Shyamalan's masterpiece, it's that he only made one movie on this level. All of his other works are much inferior, but "The Sixth Sense" belongs on the top of horror film ranks, among Kubrick's "The Shining", "Hitchcock's Psycho" and "Silence of the Lambs"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ron Edwards: The Sixth Sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about a Dr. Malcolm who is a very successful child psychologist who fails to help one child, an that one child drives Dr.Malcolm to help another child who is like the one he failed to help. Cole, the young child Dr.Malcolm is now set on helping has the same conditions as the child he previously could not help. Dr.Malcolm faces what seems to be a struggling relationship wit his wife due to his obsession of helping Cole. Cole is also facing a similar battle, not being able to communicate with his mother Lynn, who is very concerned for her son.Courage, fear, and the strength to over come seems to be the main themes during this movie. Granted "The Sixth Sense" does a great job of covering not just one, but a variety of major themes during the movie. Such themes can be viewed just about the whole movie as Cole faces his own fears, Lynn also overcomes her fears for her son. Similar to the "The Haunting" (1963) this movie deal with the dead and the unknown, and the characters have to adapt in order to overcome their fear in order to be free.The lighting through out this movie really sets the mood for the scene itself and what potentially could happen. The angles that the director chooses to shoot during this movie really adds to the drama through the film. The different angles that are shot add suspense to certain scenes and in some cases fear is intended for the viewers. Overall "The Sixth Sense" is good drama that really get your emotions going and makes you wonder about your own courage, fears, and what you would do to overcome them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this for the first time today. I know there was a lot of positive things said about this movie through the years, so I figured I would give it a view. Haley once again gives an outstanding performance. Bruce Willis was his typical very well liked self. The concept of the movie was odd, the plot was different. It does hold your interest very well and it does feel like a complete story. The acting deserves a 10, yet I am all over the place in my mind of what the story should rate, maybe because one person watching it with us didn't like it at all and said so through out the movie. Plenty easy enough to follow with an odd twist, certainly very likable but shy of outstanding. If it sounds like something you might like then it would be a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is by far the best movie M. Night Shyamalan has ever made. Osment's chilling performance is great because it never fully convinces us of the character's moral values. His performance is so cold but so heartwarming. Director Shyamalan fills the film with a moody atmosphere and keeps us pondering about what is going to happen next as the plot twists unfold step by step. It never loses interest even when it starts asking us to be sentimental about the supernatural. A very good film full of powerful plot twists and strong performances alongside great filmmaking. Osment's breakthrough performance makes this his greatest hour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry to disagree with most of the known universe, but I had a few problems with this movie. Firstly, the good things - the plot and the reveal were quite inventive, the photography was superb, and Bruce Willis &amp; Toni Collette were excellent as usual. I'm not so sure about the child actor Haley Joel Osment, to be honest I found him irritating. And Olivia Williams is the quintessential plummy English actress, why on earth did they make her speak in an American accent (or choose an American actress, if this was required)? My biggest issue is all the padding which seems to go with these psychological chillers. There is not a huge amount of action, we spend a lot of time gazing soulfully into people's eyes while moody music plays to illustrate the troubled theme. The boy states that he sees dead people "all the time". Unfortunately, we don't. We get a fleeting glimpse of about five dead people. The movie could have been so much better, with some really frightening scenes, and a tense build up to the finale (as in "The shining", a superior movie in every respect). Instead, all the tension is released long before the end, which comes as a let down. There could have been more development of some minor characters like the teacher, or the people at the funeral. A great opportunity missed, in my view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The rampant notion that horror means something that makes you pee your pants is grossly misinterpreted. Horror does not necessarily mean ghosts, possessions or exorcisms. Horror is a feeling that eats you from inside and conveys that something is extremely wrong. It doesn't need to make you jump in your seat. It is meant to last long after you are done with the movie; an unpleasant memento you carry with you. Horror exploits your worst fears. It frightens you of dark corners, unknown noises and invisible things behind your back. This is also what The Sixth Sense does.The movie begins on a rather happy note. Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a content man. He is married to the woman he loves, is a reputed child psychologist and has won the Mayor's citation for professional excellence. The happiness doesn't last. An old patient shows up; a man the doctor had failed. He is scared, angry and troubled. Before the doctor can reason with him, the man shoots him and blows his own brains out. Next fall. The doctor is sitting on a bench, overlooking a child - his next patient. It is the second time he is handling such a case. Having failed the first time, he believes he will be forgiven for his past mistakes if he gets this one right. This is his chance at redemption.However, the kid, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) steals the show. The movie is centered around him and his problem in life. Everyone has a predictable reaction, one of disbelief. His mother, the doctor, and other children - everyone is skeptical. At a tender age, with his frightening inconvenience (the trailers reveal what it is. I won't. It would be an injustice), Cole is cast alone into the horrifying world, especially so for him. Harry Osment plays this role sublimely. You can notice fear in his prepubescent feminine voice, in his movements and on his face. Osment gives one of the best child-performances I have seen. His acting is nonchalant, yet brilliant. He even outdoes Bruce Willis with his performance, something that is truly commendable.Bruce Willis looks pale in comparison to Osment. This isn't anything wrong with his acting, but it just appears feeble. He makes a good child psychologist and Cole's only companion, along with dealing his own troubled married life. But he does seem out of place at times in a non- action movie. Maybe we have grown just too accustomed to seeing him save the world as John McClane. The movie has been shot in dim light, which speaks of the gloom and melancholiness prevalent in the film. The foreboding atmosphere is one of the factors adding to the horrors of this film. The tension too has been built up really well. It grips you, engulfs you, before shocking you.Relationships have been portrayed in a beautiful manner. The mother-son relation between Cole and his mother is touching. She does her best to make Cole lead a normal life. Yet at times, she loses control, skeptical and tired of Cole's problem. Cole doesn't bother her with it. Without a father, he understands the situation they are in and the difficulties their two-member family is facing. He does not want to add to it.The relationship between Dr. Crowe and wife too plays an important role. Initially things are good, but as Dr. Crowe gets overwhelmed with his new case, they begin drifting apart, or so it seems. He tries bringing it back together but fails repeatedly. She does not talk to him, celebrates their anniversary alone and also seems to be seeing a new guy, with Dr. Crowe watching all this helplessly. Watch over this closely, for the end to be even more rewarding.However, easily the most effective relationship is that between Dr. Crowe and Cole; the former a middle-aged man, the latter just an innocent child. The contrast between them is clearly visible through a single dialogue exchange:Dr. Crowe: You are not a freak. Okay? Don't you believe anybody that tries to convince you of that. That's bullshit. You don't have to go through your life believing that. Okay? Cole: You said the 'S' word.Yet, he is Cole's only hope, the only person who even tries to understand him. Despite his troubled married life, he gives attention to Cole. And that is what is so wonderful about it. It can be best summed up in the words of Cole himself, when he says with tears in his blue eyes 'Don't fail me. Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.'The build-up of the movie is thoroughly gripping. Though it appears to be proceeding rather slowly, it adds to the depth of the film, letting you ponder as it moves. The film seems rather hurriedly wrapped up towards the latter part. But the absolute end is sheer genius. The Sixth Sense has given birth to one of the most iconic endings ever in Hollywood. That is the cherry on the cake.</fullReview>

Even looking from a detective's perspective, you won't be able to guess what the end could be like. In total there are two secrets in the movie, the 1st one is obvious to the viewers, but the second one comes at the end and is totally surprising. Great acting and dialogs by the Doctor and the child. Time and attention given to the very details of emotions of love and fear.

		<shortDescription>a true classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I revisited the sixth sense today. I can't think of too many people who haven't seen this flick at this point, but there is a whole new movie watching audience growing up right now that may have never even heard of this "classic". So the first time I saw this movie I didn't know the secret, but I knew there was one and figured it out about 10 minutes into the film. If you are young and don't know why someone just said "I see dead people" this movie is where that great line came from. This is also in case you don't know, pretty much the only film M. Night Shamalan did that isn't crap (I also liked unbreakable). So was this movie as good as I remember, well it was even better. I didn't spend the whole movie trying to solve a puzzle so I think I was able to really enjoy what a good story this is. For all you youngins' out there in the year 2100 who come across this as an archive, well for one greetings from beyond the grave, and secondly check out the sixth sense it's awesome. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is good, but it's all atmosphere. You need to get into the feel of it to enjoy it. If you don't like the atmosphere you don't like the film, it's as simple as that. I personally found it quite boring in places due to me not getting into the atmosphere. They took ages to say things or do things, like in the scene where the boy gives the father at the funeral the tape.The acting of course is brilliant, you can't help but love the strange boy. He seems so innocent yet all the time is seeing these horrible things that come across quite scarily when you don't understand what's going on initially. Bruce Willis is good but I feel sometimes all he does is whisper and look depressed. I suppose that is his role but he could have put a bit more presence into it.At for the plot it's great but takes a while to get going. The huge twist at the end I never saw coming because of the way they carefully interwove Willis' character into scenes. I never suspected it for one moment. So yeah, atmosphere but not much else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Milestone for Psychological Thrillers and a Masterpiece of Suspense and Drama ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The amazing climax of the 90's have enriched our cinematic knowledge with extraordinary movies, from the immersion into a parallel universe named "The Matrix" and the unforgettable heart-breaking "Green Mile", to the powerful social commentary of the pre-millennium consumerist society in "American Beauty" and "Fight Club", not to mention the resuscitation of the legendary "Star Wars" saga ? and still, only one movie managed to get so rapidly and deeply rooted in Pop-Culture: M. Night Shamalayan's "The Sixth Sense", one of the most memorable movies of the last 15 years.What makes this achievement even more remarkable is that "The Sixth Sense" didn't use breakthrough visual effects contrarily to its contemporary films. It had quite a minimal cast, and a very sober directing, yet it managed to create a particular atmosphere that seemed to belong only to this new classic. I don't think any other horror film reached such a level of originality since the 1970's. Indeed "The Sixth Sense" creates the reminiscent feeling of Friedkin's "Exorcist" and seems to remind us how horror is one of the most likely movie genre to create unforgettable films, when handled correctly. I mention the 70's as the decade that preceded the slasher era which made gore so ordinary and laughable it killed all the purpose of a horror film, which is all about a psychological dosage of expectations and thrills. And this dosage works in "The Sixth Sense" : there's a whole feeling that something is going to happen, yet it takes its time, time for us to get into those characters, to discover Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) the no-emotion child psychologist, and Cole Sear, the enigmatic kid who inherited a strange power, a sixth sense that looks more like a doom than a gift. The movie is renowned for a revelation featured in one of the most iconic quotes of the last 20 years, thus revealing this power is not necessarily ruining the premise of the film, but anyway, I will focus on the cinematic achievement aspect responsible of the extraordinary rebirth of the horror classic genre. And again, I think the comparison with "The Exorcist" is relevant since the movie approaches the genre with a long build-up in an ordinary family house setting, which gives enough time to approach the characters and their background, so we can identify with them. And step by step, the supernatural elements are patiently introduced, with an efficient timeliness, leading us to an unforgettable climax.The supernatural elements are perfectly handled thanks to the amazing Oscar-worthy performances of Haley Joel Osment, as Cole Sear, the kid who's not a kind of know-it-all smart kid or a whining victim, but an innocent doomed little boy, Toni Collette as Lynn, the supportive mother who suffers from the torments of despair and powerlessness to help her little boy and her struggle to bring back some ounce of normality in Coles 'life is particularly heartbreaking. The mother and son relationship is the heart of the film when the dorsal spine is Dr. Malcolm Crowe's back-story with Bruce Willis in one of his most underrated out-of-character performances as a mysterious doctor who tries to help and assist Cole in this painful experience, which seems to be a two-ways therapy inhabited by a profound will of redemption. Carrying the whole narrative structure of the film, Willis' job looks like a psychological investigation, that gives a movie a sort of noir feeling and the film is an intricate puzzle that respects the audience's intelligence by letting enough hints to guide us to the climax but not obvious enough to decrease the sensational aspect of the ending. The last minutes, the last ten minutes of the film are so emotionally rewarding that you can't help but feel like watching it a second time. It's one of the few films where the experience of the first viewing is so harrowing you can't perceive yet the intelligence and cleverness of the script, only after a second viewing.The script is certainly the strongest element of the film, too often overlooked in other horror movies, here it works because of the realism of the dialogs and the directing that makes the story scarily believable. The film would never have been so memorable if it only relied on special effects and cinematography: the viewer can be fooled by what he sees, but fooling him with words, with verbal interactions, with actions, looks and silences is a challenge that have been successfully achieved by talented directors like the master Hitchcock ("Psycho" being the most obvious example) but the director was not Hitchcock, M. Night Shamalayan was a young dbutant who would never have been thought to make a movie so iconic and so rapidly. Yet, if it didn't win the Best Picture Oscar, it definitely was the movie that impacted the viewers the most. No wonder "The Sixth Sense" made it in AFI's Top 100, as a recognition of the significance of the film and the revolutionary aspect it had on cinematic storytelling by paving the way for movies with long build-up and spectacular conclusions, an impact, even the director could not match it with his later films."The Sixth Sense" is a heart-pounding thriller like any other one has been made before. But don't expect countless deaths or disturbing gore, instead you'll have an extraordinary atmosphere, amazing performances and an intelligent script. Expect another viewing, expect some scary moments and some deeply emotional ones, and if you don't say a big "Wow" at the end, either this film has been spoiled for you, either you're one of the most exceptionally intelligent people that doesn't get fooled by little cinematic hints. In both case, it's unfortunate without prevent you though from enjoyment, because "The Sixth Sense" still works on the emotional level, thanks to the amazing performances of Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sixth Sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense tells the story of a unique boy name Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) who carries with him a very dark secret. A child psychologist by the name of Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) meets with Cole and Malcolm soon realizes that Cole has the same characteristic traits as Vincent Gray (Donnie Wahlberg) a previous patient of Malcolm's who shot him while he was retuning from a night out with his wife Anna (Olivia Williams). Learning from his past experiences with Vincent, Malcolm made a promise to himself to not make the same mistakes with Cole. It took some time for Cole to trust Malcolm, and when we finally did he shared his deepest darkest secret. He can see dead peoples.The Sixth Sense displays some very strong themes. The first being "Afterlife," which is a topic everyone have difference of opinions on, but in the movie you will see ghost appearing to Cole, the reasoning behind ghost as many of us believe is having unfinished business, and the only way to move on is for the business to be completed. At first Cole was terrified of the ghosts, not understanding what they wanted from him, but Cole gained "Courage" which is another theme in the movie, he decided one night to speak with one and finds out what it wanted and began to help.The lightening of the film is very dull and dim, and color of The Sixth Sense is very dim, no actual coloring used in the movie except for the church scenes, you can see a few hints of red on the Jesus icon as well as the candles, and what's also interesting is majority of the movie is taking place at night, to reinforce that gloomy feel."I see dead people. They don't know they're dead. They don't see each other. They only see what they want to see." (Mercer, 1999). Is a pretty powerful statement, and just going off that statement alone without watching the movie, how do I know I'm not dead? I know it's a crazy question, but think about it.According to the movie your "Afterlife" is what you make it, here you see Malcolm throughout the entire movie believing he's still married to Anna, doing his same daily routine activities, just living "life" and it took a boy to tell him that hey man, your dead. But my only question is, if ghost exist due to unfinished business, what was Malcolm's unfinished business?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan introduces himself to the world with a bang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1999 director M. Night Shyamalan introduced himself unto the world with The Sixth Sense. With this film we were introduced to Shyamalan's twisted, dark, and yet highly creative mind. We got a taste of his skilled storytelling ability wrapped in his tight artistic direction. We also discovered the man's knack for twist endings. And what a twist it was. The Sixth Sense really focuses on two characters and their relationship. One is Bruce Willis' character, Dr. Malcolm Crowe, who is a psychiatrist whose current patient is a disturbed little boy named Cole Sear, played by Haley Joel Osment. Crowe makes it his mission to help this boy, while at the same time he is trying to cope with his deteriorating personal life. It's emotional, thrilling, disturbing, and beautiful all at the same time. It's really not like anything you've ever seen before.Now sadly, I already knew about the shocking twist ending going into this film. You can't talk about movies for seventeen years without someone spilling the beans. But that didn't make the film any less enjoyable. The movie is great without the twist, but the twist and the end really adds a whole new level to the film. It changes the face of the film and when you get right down to it, it's what makes the film so unforgettable. That and the famous, "I see dead people," line. However, everything else in the film's story is great. It is something so unique and haunting that it really gives this film a different feel than most horror or thriller films. The film is also paced very well in the most somber and low key way. This movie has a hypnotic quality to it. The emotional prowess of the film mixed with some very chilling moments sets it apart from anything else.One thing so remarkable about the film is the great equality in talent of the two leads, despite the age difference. Bruce Willis is as good as ever in this film. His quiet, somber attitude gives the film its mysterious feel. Eleven year old Haley Joel Osment drives the emotion of the film and puts forth an astounding performance. His character and his performance isn't a typical child actor role. His character is a very strange one with a wide range of personalities as well as maturity levels. He is undoubtedly a kid but there is much more to him than meets the eye. Toni Collette plays his mother who is another very important character and her performance doesn't quite reach the levels of Willis and Osment, but is very good nonetheless.Towards the end of the film I began feeling like it wasn't really going anywhere. I sort of began to forget the goals of the characters in the film and I felt like it was losing its footing. But as these feelings began to escalate the twist occurred and the film ended, leaving me very satisfied. I can't help but wish that there would have been a little more clear cut direction towards the end of this otherwise great film. There is also a lack of resolution in the film. It isn't something I hated, but I couldn't help but notice. The film feels like it is lacking a well rounded ending until the twist. And while the twist is remarkable and it ends the film very strong, it doesn't account for everything. The Sixth Sense got a little bit tripped up towards the end, but not enough to ruin everything else great about the film.The Sixth Sense is a very different kind of film and I was very happy with it. It is unlike anything I've ever seen. The look and feel of the film doesn't line up with the subject matter, but not in a bad way. A movie about a disturbed little boy who sees dead people could have easily been a cheesy slasher with corny lines and characters. But instead Shyamalan made it into something much more sophisticated and beautiful. This isn't a loud and action packed film. It's something much different, and much better. I was very impressed by The Sixth Sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not read this review if you haven't seen the movie, please.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie blew me away. I never saw the ending coming, but maybe I should have, because even before reaching the half mark past I had already noticed something odd about it. And I had come to the conclusion that for the first time maybe I was able to resume a film in one simple word: disconnection; that TSS was a faintly veiled parable on the paradox that, as humans become more and more communicated by Internet, I-pods, cellulars, etc, they become more disconnected from each other. Of course I noticed that nothing was being shown or detailed about the drifting away of Malcolm &amp; Anna and also the unusual thing that, up to that point there had been no verbal exchange whatsoever between Crowe &amp; Lynn, even when their lives had come to revolve around the same person; but I assumed that such a thing was being done precisely to emphasize the point. And as I didn't know a single thing about TSS beforehand--nobody warned me about the "twist"--I was caught pants down. But it was better that way at the end, as I got in the chin the whole emotional effect of the final revelation and for that I thank Mr. Shyamalan.But he cheated. What really threw me off was what Lynn says when Cole arrives home--"You got one hour"--which I assumed was being said to Crowe, as she even glances in his direction?as Anna does in the resto, after signing the check! Anyway, it found the film greatly entertaining. Superb acting work from the leads--I never imagined "Die Hard" Willis capable of displaying such subtlety and such wide range of emotions and that he could be able to do it in such understated, low key fashion. As for Collete, she made me remember once again her Muriel--and forget her participation in that LMS crap fest. And Williams is sublimely somber as the lonely, grieving wife. But the true star here is HJO. Superb cinematography also and a musical score up to task, conveying all the sadness and melancholy of the story in its notes, as if telling us the outcome in advance, drop by drop.With all that out of the way I'll refer now to a criticism I see in many reviews, on how unlikely is that Malcolm could have gone months without realizing he was dead. A true story: Years ago I was studying Autocad in some institute in which I came to live something like an episode out of Ghost Whisperer with noises coming from nowhere, sudden changes in Temp., the whole package. Just by coincidence(!) I came to make friends then with a female classmate who told me that she could see the dead and that the one doing the racket was a poor guy who had been shot dead in the place years before. Now, you may believe this or not--I don't care--as all I want is to explain how TSS is right on the money concerning the way ghosts behave--according to people supposedly on the loop, as this woman said she was.The initiate--let's call them that way--say that those who have sudden, traumatic deaths, fall in a state of great confusion; they feel lost and disconnected. But most of all, they stay utterly convinced they are still alive and this is a situation that may last decades for them. They're able to see people ignoring them, also that they cannot hold, push, material objects but for some strange reason that is not enough to make them realize the truth. In that regard Malcolm's behaviour is typical, a textbook ex. of how the ghost of someone who was shot dead could act?Shyamalan knew exactly what was he talking about when writing the script; which is logical after all, considering his cultural and spiritual background. They also say that these ghosts don't keep a regular, flat line degree of materiality, but one that fluctuates; they may go from thin air physicality--so to speak--to almost being material human beings, i.e. with bodies (those who saw King's The Shinning could see this happening at the film's climax). It's only when they achieve extreme "body consistency" that they may actually do physical things--to knock on walls, open doors or throw rocks at windows, as Malcolm does. They don't feel physical needs but that doesn't seem to give them any clue. They also "fade away" from time to time, which makes even possible that the only "conscious moments" Malcolm experiences are those we see him on screen (!).Back to TSS: After a first viewing I concluded that once the shock of it wears off the movie will be easily forgotten. But watching it for a second time I realized that, even knowing the ending it still makes for a superb film, that there's a lot more to it. I realized that I may have been right in my first appraisal, that this could become a classic as a parable of human isolation and alienation overcome by moral strength and solidarity (see how Cole is crowned king after he starts helping people!). 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very Underrated Thriller that plays with the Mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the Sixth Sense two months ago, thinking it was going to be a boredom of a film from start to end but boy was i wrong here. The film was nothing that I had expected. Bruce Willis &amp; the kid (Don't know his name) who played Cole did a sensational job at their roles besides everyone else.Besides there being an excellent plot and suspenseful effects in Cole's Sixth Sense Vision, everything was good. I could say there was nothing wrong this film.I couldn't get the ending at all but when somebody told me what really happened, i was stoked as. But i ain't giving anything away...All in all, hands down, The Sixth Sense plays with the mind and as we watch the film as the minutes tick away, we start to think and think about what's happening here... I think this is highly recommended to those who don't only love Suspesnful Horrors, but to those who will go the distance to be scared in anyway possible. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delicate and restrained</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense, was, as I first thought, a ghost story, but I was wrong; the movie is centered around human morals and emotions. Throughout the movie, there are only a few scenes that could be said as 'scary', however for the most part, the audience, is skillfully directed between the dialogue and emotions from Dr. Malcolm Crow and Cole Sear. The film for the most part is delicately restrained, and at times when the film climaxes it could have turned into a blood fest, however M. Night Shyamalan skillfully restrained this. Shyamalan creates a wonderfully dark yet surreal setting to the movie, introducing the relationship and trust between Dr. Malcolm Crow and Cole Sear developing at a realistic pace.What I liked about this movie was that apart from several scenes, there were barely any scenes that were horrifying, but instead, Shyamalan focuses the film instead on the dialogue between Malcolm and Cole. The film, moves at a slow, steady pace - just enough for the audience to totally absorb what's happening, and want another scene. The movie has stellar acting by Bruce Willis (as the slightly depressed child psychiatrist) who played his role perfectly. Another stellar performance was by Haley J. Osment, as his role of Cole. His maturity for the role, and well delivered lines are a far contrast from the typical whiny/annoying kids who act now - the line between cute and funny, to whiny and annoying is now very, very small.This film, which moves at a steady pace, will be extremely rewarding to anyone who wants to wait the one hour fifty minute duration time. The main story and the ending were well written, and acted. This film highlights a beautiful haunting score, by James Newton Howard, brilliant directing and a magnificent script by Shyalaman. This movie strongly deserves a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the film that rocketed M. Night Shyamalan's reputation as a promising writer-director. Nominated for 6 Oscars including best picture, The Sixth Sense is a brilliant film that shocks, and mystifies viewers. Well-known for its unexpected yet satisfying twist at the end, the film boasts a refined performance by Bruce Willis, and supported by "I see dead people" Haley Joel Osment effective portrayal of a boy who, well, sees dead people.The Sixth Sense is very suspenseful, filled with Shyamalan's hallmarks - sudden sounds accompanied by frightening images. The score by James Newton Howard must be commended, enhancing the film's 'mysterious appeal'. This is a film that documents the questionable existence of ghosts, and how most of them are not necessarily evil. It's brilliantly conceived and written by Shyamalan, and is unlikely to be matched if he keeps producing films like the awful Lady In The Water. The Sixth Sense is a roaring success!

I'm also a big fan of Bruce Willis so thats another reason why I saw this. This movie is a great thriller and I now know what the hype is all about.This is about a child psychologist who is experiencing family troubles. His job is too straighten out this kid who is different than other kids.The acting is very good especially by Willis and Haley Joel Osment. These two have very good chemistry.Now this movie has many twists including a big one. I was really shocked when I saw the twist.Overall, this is an above average thriller. I was also surprised to see this picture was nominated for Best Picture. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie shocked and spooked me throughout the whole way. Dark moments and scenes here and there, but still remains to stay calm when necessary. Its one of the rarest films by M. Night Shyamalan thats actually good. Not to be offensive, but most of his movies suck. But this one was quite decent, a masterpiece at best.Bruce Willis is a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe who helps out a disturbed child, (Haley Joel Osment) who has visions of dead people. By doing this, his wife becomes depressed over his absence, (or at least thats what he thinks) which causes him to decide between helping the kid, or his wife.The story itself is excellent, opening with a bone chilling scene. Not to mention a surprising ending that will leave you haunted for days. The acting performances are phenomenal, mostly Osment, who received an Oscar nomination. Also includes Toni Collete, Olivia Williams, and a cameo of Shyamalan as a doctor. The music by James Newton Howard gave me goosebumps for the whole movie. One of his best scores ever in my opinion. Unlike Ghost, which is a little similar, this one doesn't have crappy effects thrown in it, but rather suspenseful situations based on sense, given this movie's title.This film couldn't have been any better. Everything work perfectly. The only reason for not a 9 or 10 is simply based on movie type. But all together this film was excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense was the film that sky-rocketed M. Night Shyamalan's career and well, he hasn't been able to escape it since. Before hand he had made 2 films; Praying with Anger which it was rumoured that Shyamalan tried to suppress it's existence like Stanley Kubrick did with Fear and Desire; and Wide Awake, a family comedy that was a commercial flop. He also helped write Stuart Little before his big break came with The Sixth Sense, at the young age of 29.Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a successful and rewarded child psychologist, but suffers guilt about a former patient Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg) who breaks into his house. The next year Crowe wants to do right when he works with a 9-year-old boy Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) who suffers from the same symptoms. Both have major problems, Crowe is distance to his wife Anna (Olivia Williams) whilst Cole's mother Lynn (Toni Collette) does not know how to deal with her son who is anxious, isolated and considered a freak by other school children. But Cole's biggest problem is that he can see ghost who have suffer some of the most horrific injuries and harm the small boy, making him life of fear. Both psychologist and patient needs to face up to their demons.Shyamalan show he was once a writer/director of great skill and both a great supernatural thriller and a horror film. Shyamalan makes a dark tone and lit film with brilliant camera work: Shyamalan loves using single take shots with the camera either following people or moving around the room to give the film an unbroken, organic feel. It's a skill other great like Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese, Darren Aronofsky and Alfonso Cuaron, so it is of course good enough Shyamalan. Shyamalan also blends together the supernatural element of ghosts with how people from the real world would deal with it, from a scared young boy and how to it damages his psychology, to school children who see him as a freak, to a psychologist who does not believe him. There are also real world issues involving crumbling marriages, bullying and a mother-son relationship. Shyamalan also delivers on effective on horror, from the psychological fear from a character we can care about to subtle scares involving ghosts running in the background. With Shyamalan's camera work and tone The Sixth Sense is better then most horror films.There is a great cast and they work with a terrific script. There are characters you can sink your teeth into. Willis shows he is more then an action star but also a serious actor and gave a good performance. Osment showed that at the time he was one of the best child actors around for his time. He gave a sincere, believable performance as a scared child and was deserving of an Oscar nod. But he was a weird kid. The actresses of the film were also good, both being very real in their performances.The Sixth Sense has an excellent, well thought out script with great ideas about people, family and the dark afterlife. This is clearly Shyamalan's best film and his career has been going downfall ever since. Unbreakable and Signs are still good films but he hasn't made a good film since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot can happen in 10 years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ironically, I have viewed The Sixth Sense for the first time exactly 11 years after it opened. I remember distinctly when it was first released and the amount of buzz and tension it caused those who saw it. Unfortunately, I was not one of them but I am certainly glad that I have gotten to it now.In many ways, this has become a film of iconic proportions. Only saying the words, "I see dead people," gets a response out of most people. This film is also one of the reasons Bruce Willis is a star and the reason Haley Joel Osment is a household name. Beyond all that however, what it really comes down to is the potential shown by this film for a newcomer named M. Night Shyamalan, who might be today the most hated director in Hollywood. The reason for that is because he showed such talent and poise both in writing and directing and to see such marvelous talent go to waste on projects such as Lady in the Water, The Happening and The Last Airbender is the true disappointment.Without going into details, I must say to anyone who hasn't seen this film yet (and there are probably few), that this is filmmaking of the highest order. Shyamalan here shows impeccable timing and great ability to use editing, lighting and an incredible score by James Newton Howard to create true and genuine suspense and terror in multiple scenes. Knowing the major plot twist only because I have lived in America for the last ten years, I was still drawn into the story due to the emotional content involving Malcolm Crowe and his wife as well as the relationship between Cole and his mother. The most tantalizing scenes are when things happen to Cole and it is remarkable how Shyamalan stages and crafts each and every frame.So, ten years later we find Shyamalan with five more films under his belt with only two being well-received and the rest either panned or hated soon after. Is he still a talented filmmaker. I believe so but it is astonishing to see his descent since and one can't help but wonder what went wrong. I don't know but something did and I pray and hope that somehow, someway, Shyamalan will find his way back to the type of material and style he used to make this such a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do not read this if you have not seen this movie. Unfortunately someone asked me a question about Sixth Sense before I had seen it and I missed out on the experience that this Masterpiece delivers to its viewers. I'll never know if I might've "had a clue." This film was brilliantly conceived and pieced together by M. Night Shyamalan. It was perfectly cast and Haley Joel Osment became a star through his work in this film. Bruce Willis was never better and Donnie Wahlberg was magnificent in a brief, but key role. Toni Collette and Olivia Williams and the rest of the cast all make it work so well. Being the creator of the Great Character Actors Web Page, I very much appreciate supporting actors who rarely get the credit they deserve. Finally, I see M. Night Shyamalan as the "new" Hitchcockian director. Although some of his more recent efforts have not been well received, I think he has a lot more surprises and "treasures" in store for us. Hitchcock had his "Marnie", "Topaz" and "Torn Curtain" yet he gave us "Psycho", "North by Northwest" and "Frenzy" just to name a few!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See sense, see The Sixth Sense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror - a genre often overlooked, looked down upon or cast aside with something bordering on contempt by a number of cineastes. So when a film that does it's job so well and is so marvellously constructed as The Sixth Sense comes along it often upsets people who like to see their genre movies staying within certain confines/limitations. Hence the "supernatural thriller" tag.Bah. The Sixth Sense is a class act through and through AND it's often very, very scary thanks to Shyamalan expertly using every trick in the book to provide just the right audio/visual stimulus.Bruce Willis plays Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a celebrated child psychologist who has his entire world rocked when assaulted by an ex-patient he thought he had managed to help. He now has the chance to help young Cole Sear and redeem himself by getting things right this time around. But Cole's main problem is a very startling one . . . . . he sees dead people.Despite the time that has passed since this movie's release I refuse to reveal any major twist or details in this review, it really is a much more enjoyable experience if you go into the film knowing very little about what's coming. I already feel as if I have revealed too much but the trailer and tag-line and publicity already showed that much so there really must only be a handful of people left who are completely unaware of certain aspects of this film.On top of the supernatural element, however, this movie is very much about communication and how important is. Cole has a very good relationship with his mother (played and played well by Toni Collette) yet there are still things he feels unable to tell her until just the right time. Dr. Crowe feels things turning bad between himself and his wife (played by the lovely Olivia Williams) and doesn't know how to talk to her about things. Then there is, of course, the relationship between doctor and patient; a number of scenes in which man and boy size each other up and try to decide whether or not being more communicative will actually help either of them.Shyamalan, as divisive as he can be, gives us a modern classic directed with a surprisingly assured hand. He impresses with things like his use of sound and silence and his well thought out colour palette.But the undeniable triumph of the movie is Haley Joel Osment's central performance. Rarely has a child actor made such an impact, mixing the innocence of youth with the wisdom of experience, and his performance is moving, captivating and more than a match for any of the adult stars on screen. The revelatory scene containing the line "she wanted me to tell you she saw you dance" is, to me, an indelible classic moment of cinema and one that gives me goosebumps every time I see it. That's all thanks to some great writing and the performance of the immensely talented Haley Joel Osment.See this if you like: Stir Of Echoes, Ghost Town, Unbreakable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For The Benefit Of The Korowai And The Munduruku</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regarding the famous twist ending of M. Night Shyamalan's "The Sixth Sense" (1999), I will try to be coy here for the benefit of those who have just come out of a decadelong coma, and for those Korowai tribesmen of New Guinea and the Munduruku dwellers on the Amazon who may be unaware of it, but who may be reading this posting on their BlackBerrys (and in today's modern world, who knows?!?). For all first-timers (like me) who see the film fully aware of the picture's startling denouement, the question must be "Can one still enjoy it with such a movie-spoiling foreknowledge?" Well, as anyone who has ever seen "The Sixth Sense" more than once knows (and I can't imagine anyone seeing this film for the first time who would NOT want to watch it again immediately!), the answer is a resounding "yes." In it, Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist in Philly who attempts to help 9-year-old Cole Sear. Cole's problem, as he famously puts it, is that he sees "dead people." Anyway, the always likable Willis gives a nicely restrained performance here and, as "DVD Delirium" puts it, "manages to keep his trademark smirk hidden." And young Haley Joel Osment is superb as the troubled Cole, effectively communicating, with his whispered delivery, the fear that is his daily bread. The film is a quiet and understated affair, building suspense and scares through a gradual accretion of detail. It has been expertly lensed by master cinematographer Tak Fujimoto, and Shyamalan's direction is quite ingenious in the way it skips around the edges of the film's big twist while still playing the game fairly. By that famous ending, young Cole seems set to beat Jennifer Love to the punch as a "ghost whisperer," while Malcolm comes to see himself for what he truly is. It's some brilliant stuff, and I for one wouldn't even mind a belated, latter-day sequel....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good thriller, fine Haley Joel Osment. Script feels slightly contrived</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Time has robbed this film of it's sheen. It's still very watchable but the script feels a trifle contrived. Those who guess the final twist beforehand won't like the film. Others will probably be thrilled and see it again. Bruce Willis plays a psychiatrist who tries to help a young boy (Haley Joel Osment) with a terrifying problem. Both give fine performances. Willis is however a bit too muted. Osment is very effective and won an Oscar nomination. Toni Collete is excellent in a brief role. The film is creepy but not very scary. The ending doesn't fully explain everything but is emotionally satisfying.Overall 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I see...a great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts off with Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) celebrating his achievement with his wife, Anna (Olivia Williams, who looks an awful lot like Liv Tyler in this picture). When they venture upstairs, they are met by a man who has broken into their home in the hopes that his former doctor will finally help him. Malcolm realizes too late that the man is Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg) when Grey pulls out a gun and shoots Malcolm in the torso.The film flashes forward to show that Malcolm is trying to rectify his mistake with Vincent by helping Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). Cole initially doesn't want help from Crowe, but reluctantly allows him to help. After Malcolm learns that Cole can see ghosts, Malcolm figures out that Cole needs to help them. Malcolm is clearly having issues with Anna, she seems to ignore Malcolm at every turn.When Cole helps a girl (Mischa Barton) tell her father that her mother killed her, Cole gains the courage to tell his mom of his gift - his curse. The confession brings them closer together and Malcolm realizes that he's done what he set out to do and doesn't need to stick around anymore.Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, it's the first big blockbuster in a large list for him that ends up being one of the greatest films of all time. The choice of Haley and Bruce to star was an excellent choice and I can think of no two actors to replace them, even if there could be a remake in the future. Psychologically, the film gets under your skin and visually it chills you to the bone. I remember the first time I saw the movie, I was freaked out for days after viewing it.The visual and special effects are phenomenal and the thrills that the movie gives you are not in the same league as to what the scares and the chilling twist gives you. You'll watch it again after the first time just because it's that entertaining.In the first and second viewing, it's a totally different film each time, so it's a wonderfully crafted masterpiece which will be remembered for a long, long time.</fullReview>

When he meets up with young Cole Sear (Osment), a confused child with a similar condition, Dr. Crowe sees this not only as an opportunity to help Cole, but to also to redeem himself, he just isn't prepared to what truly haunts Cole.M.

		<shortDescription>Whatever You Do, Don't Blame It On The "Night"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So you wanna know who's responsible for the disgusting glut of weak-ass, PG-13-rated bundles of porcine fecal matter trying to pass themselves off as 'horror movies?' Well, folks, just blame M. Night Shyamalan.No, let me take that back...Let's not blame 'Night', but the sorry excuses for writers, producers and directors who called themselves attempting to surpass the brilliance of Shyamalan's best movie so far...THE SIXTH SENSE.With a smooth effortlessness that's just about as terrifying as the movie itself, Shyamalan brings us the damn-near perfect story of Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis in a role that shattered everyone's prejudices about him as an actor), a child psychologist who is shot by one of his former patients (an almost unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg), who then commits suicide. Sometime after this ordeal, feeling that he failed his late charge, Malcolm attempts to find redemption by helping out a distressed young boy named Cole Sear, (Haley Joel Osment's career-making performance). who can "see" dead people and communicate with them.At no time are you ever unaware of how much you care for these characters, and how extreme the situation is for them, which makes the shocks and scares twice as intense as any you could ever find in a PG-13-rated flick before, (except maybe for POLTERGEIST.) Plus there are fantastic performances all the way round by Willis and Osment, backed up by great turns by Toni Collette (who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress as Cole's tough- but-tender mom) and Olivia Williams as Malcolm's former fiance.Even after multiple viewings, the storytelling skill that Shyamalan has is faultless, and still leaves you scratching your head as to how you could've missed the clues that lead to one of the most spellbinding, jaw-dropping endings to come along in many moons. Some people might figure it out in the first five minutes, but I will confess - Night so thoroughly pulled me into his world, that I wasn't one of them.SENSE was both a blessing and a curse to Shyamalan, since newly-won fans now expected ALL of his movies to have that tricky "twist" ending to stun and surprise them. Because of that, the quality of the movies that followed SENSE was inconsistent to say the least. People still debate about the merits of UNBREAKABLE and SIGNS, or even if THE VILLAGE should've been made at all.Personally, I like everything he's done since, flaws and all. But as far as his career is concerned, THE SIXTH SENSE is like his "CITIZEN KANE," and considering the genre, is every bit as monumentally good as Orson Welles' towering achievement.THE SIXTH SENSE is without a doubt a "must-have" for your DVD library.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heyy :] For me a great film is one that helps the viewer perceive life in a different light. 'The Sixth Sense' is one of those extraordinary films that does that for me, as all the conventions have been sculpted to manipulate the audience.This film reflects on some difficult and what would've been 'dodgy' subjects that will make the viewer walk away asking loads of questions about death, about letting go, about love and commitment, about the love shared between parent and child and husband and wife. I think it will be difficult to find another wonderful film, which has touched on these issues so expressively, for many many years to come.i enjoyed it so much, i just had to watch it over! xx</fullReview>

And he just can't quite work out why.He then meets his next client, Haley Joel Osment (Cole) a small boy who never talks to his mother about anything, if he won't say anything to his mum, why on earth would he tell a stranger anything? Bruce Willis plays an amazing character, who doesn't quite understand Haley Joel Osment's character, but still wants to believe everything he says.After a few sessions Dr Malcolm and Cole start to grow trust between each other and Cole starts uncovering more secrets, some more shocking than others.With an amazing twist to end it with, The Sixth Sense leaves you satisfied with an amazing movie with an amazing ending. If you're expecting a scary thriller to creep you out, you are in for a much bigger treat, in many ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An instant classic of a supernatural thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can easily say that "The Sixth Sense" is an instant classic because it really has a very unique story-telling and approaches the ghost-human beings conflict in an original way.Dr. Malcolm (Bruce Willis) is trying to help a young kid, Cole (Haley Joel Osment) with his psychological problems and, at the same, trying to fix his relationship with his wife who has become quite distant lately. The story mostly revolves around Cole who claims to see dead people. But it is also about Dr. Malcolm who helps Cole to cope with his unusual gift. And in return, he learns something important about himself.The famous twist at the end is quite shocking but there are some clues during the movie which are intelligently concealed. The Sixth Sense is a GREAT movie and a must-watch for all audiences. It has been nominated for 6 Academy awards including the best picture, best screenplay, best director (M. Night Shyamalan), best supporting actress (Toni Collette)and best supporting actor Haley Joel Osment, at the age of 12.</fullReview>

Anyway, this film has some very creepy scenes in it. The poisoned girl, "stuttering Stanely, "I see dead people", Cole trapped in the cupboard, and the twist end. That's right, the twist end. I sure all of you know it, but I'll tell you anyway. Willis was actually a ghost! When he was shot he actually died! Overall, this is a good thriller.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, because is believable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a must. Not only cause the performances are excellent, not only cause the script and direction are great but also because it makes you believe in Ghosts. The plot takes you to the patient doctor relation between: Bruce Willis (Dr. Malcolm Crowe) &amp; Haley Joel Osment (Cole Sear), which is beautifully done. But nothing is what is seems. Cole is not just a crazy child, with a tuft family past: he sees ghosts; and nor his mother neither his doctor can't believe him. The process that takes place till Dr. Crowe realizes that the Kid is not telling lies is masterly developed: thrill, drama and the boy's explanation of the supernatural submerge the spectator into the history forcing the catharsis. The experienced viewer can resolve the ending before it happens, only if he is analyzing instead of enjoying and even though it thrills you. The movie's success relies on a seriously developed plot that considers actual life experience and its relation with the supernatural (understand as common things that can happen to anyone). This key factor is the reason why scary movies are great or just ridiculous entertainment, is what separates The Sixth Sense &amp; The exorcist from Freddy and Jason for example.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Answers to eternal questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sixth Sense" is a powerful movie starring Bruce Willis as a damaged child psychologist attempting to treat a young misfit played by Haley Joel Osment. Willis' Dr. Crowe is certain that Osment's fatherless, tormented Cole is suffering from delusional paranoia and because he has failed a previous patient with similar ills, he is more determined to cure the boy's emotional and psychological hauntings. Crowe has his own internal misgivings for his wife is painfully estranged and appears to ignore his very existence. Cole's mother is unsettled by injuries and events that the child says are caused by ghosts. This film also contains a secret within its finely tailored plot that contributed to its huge mass and critical appeal. When I watch this film , I too get caught up in trying to have its secret revealed to me visually and/or verbally. But the "gimmick" or secret is so exquisitely crafted that its divulgence comes as a complete surprise chiefly because the writing and the acting are wonderfully first rate. The play upon our human vulnerabilities such as death, loneliness, fear and separation glues us to this "ghost" story. Although we may not trust nor agree with Shyamalan's ideas, this film will capture those who see it as a plausible, nonsecular representation of death and the afterlife. Shyamalan's direction is unfrivolous and well-paced. Osment's Oscar-nominated performance is genuinely heart-wrenching. A superb film.</fullReview>

You might be able to figure it out, but I certainly didn't. I think not knowing made it all the better. I found the end kind of sad, but very well acted and written. Haley Joel Osment was spectacular. He was so young, but he has such talent, he made it seem like no big deal! And he's got that line that's probably as well known as "They're here." It is the famous "I see dead people." If you are into supernatural movies, you should definitely watch it! If you want to be surprised, DON'T READ PAST HERE! The only thing that I didn't understand was if the psychiatrist guy was dead, why could Cole's mom see him?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most famous movie lines in history - 'I see dead people', comes from this movie. I had always knew why when I first saw this like four years ago back at school (it was after our exams), I will get freaked out at times.Because, I am the sort who does at times believe that ghosts, may be lurking around us but we just don't know it. Call me superstitious, but then I had never did anything serious to believe that. It's just, me.Child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) realises that his young charge Cole (Haley Joel Osment) actually has the ability to see dead people. Thus that famous line in the movie.About every corner and turn, it's just suspenseful, and scary. It may actually really scare those who are not really into movies like this, but it's worth a watch.

		<fullReview>Apart from that Bruce Willis remains to be one of my favorite actors, I had to see The Sixth Sense out of the urgency that had arisen from seeing the trailer. So I went to the movie theater expecting a great suspense thriller and left my seat at the end of the movie feeling that I had seen something that totally transcended my expectations. I was totally stunned.While it can be compared to the archetypal horror film because of some of its arguably shoddy scares, the denouement gives it a totally different, much greater magnitude that sets it apart from all mediocre Hollywood horror movies. It meant something more special to me because I didn't go as far as interrogating why Malcolm Crowe was being ignored by his wife and went ahead and assumed that they had a bad breakup or something! The ending gave it all clarity, and it was a darn good twist. It left my mouth hanging open for a few minutes. My friends and I were like, "Are you?? Oh my?" It was great. I think Haley Joe Osment's acting was excellent also. His eyes were so expressive, I could feel every bit of his terror! This movie haunted me and my friends for months. Every time we had a sleepover after seeing that movie, we would relive our memories of it and freak out all night long. LOL. This did stick with us, it's amazing.

		<shortDescription>Excellent film to add to any ghost lover's collection.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shyamalan has done it again! This is top notch entertainment. For lovers of the scary and supernatural, this fits the bill. The plot builds nicely from the moment strange things start happening in Lynn Sear's kitchen to the final moment when Cole convinces his mother that he really does see ghosts. This film is destined to be a classic.Young Osment does a top notch job as Cole Sear the boy who sees dead people everywhere. He is at once frightened and confused, but bravely tries to keep his mother from knowing his real problem.In a standout performance, Willis has broken away from his portrayals of tough guys and baddies. Here he gives a sensitive, compassionate performance as the acclaimed child psychiatrist, confused by his wife's chilly behavior and the baffling case of the troubled Cole Sear whom he is treating. When he sees his wife in an apparently compromising situation he takes his anger out by destroying the shop window.Yet he genuinely loves his wife and is nearly distraught by her behavior both by her apparent lack of interest in him and her actions (locking the basement door, pulling the check away just as he reaches for it).Even Angelica Tom, who plays Kyra's disturbed and dangerous mother does a good job in her short time on the screen.Having filmed what is probably one of the greatest ghost stories ever written, Director Shyamalan appears briefly (as the doctor who treats Cole), as he does in all his films, as a tribute to his idol the late Alfred J. Hitchcock. If you are a fan of ghost movies, this is one you should not miss.I also recommend you see ALL of M. Night Shyamalan's other films. They are: Signs, Unbreakable, The Village, and Wide Awake (which is by the way a comedy, not at all like his other films and is ideal for the whole family). This effort is certainly in the same class as THE OTHERS directed by Alejandro Amenabar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Really Captured My Attention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this and watched it around midnight a couple years ago. This film, like "Poltergeist," has contributed a line to the eternal world of cinema: "I see dead people." I will not spoil this for someone that has not seen it. My comments are on the craftsmanship that is this film. It starts with Haley Joel Osment, who will go down as one of our great child actors. He has the vulnerability and pain that expresses itself so well. His continual bouts with his "gift" bring him more pain. He gets an ally in Bruce Willis's character, and they begin to face things together. Unfortunately, like most movies that present something supernatural, a set of rules apply to the world and it these rules that make it fairly easy to pull this down. However, I would rather have them craft it as best they can than try to keep consistent in every aspect. Like "Memento" which I saw pretty close to the same time, I don't want to think too much or the fine fabric of the film starts to unravel. How's that for cowardice?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looks like lot of viewers did not understand this classic *** spoilers ahead****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>my god, looks like most of the viewers here have not understood he movie at all ********** spoilers *************** well the boys sees dead people, and this is the summation of the movie. bruce willis is "KILLED" in a freak accident involving his ex-patient who also kills himself.i was so surprised that most of the viewers here does not understand that bruce willis is already dead and he can only be seen by the boy and no one else. this fact is also understood when the widow of brucewillis celebrates there anniversary ( marriage) alone and crying in the hotel.well its too much for a thriller and kudos to the director M NIGHT SHYAMLAN for making such a movie. the boy was too good.10/10 for the director, its a 100 % directors movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much more than a thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The power of the Sixth Sense lies on its critics. The rush of so many people to ascertain they had got it, shows how brilliant the script and the direction was. When the credits rolled we all felt fooled by Shyamalan, we all thought there must have been a flaw we haven't noticed. But no, the story is flawless, the hints were there and everything does make sense in the end. Basically, it's so intelligently made it's intimidating, hence the reaction. Shyamalan doesn't fool you, he simply outsmarts you. To paraphrase a quote from the movie, he makes you see only what he wants you to see. This is why you have to watch this film at least twice in order to appreciate how masterfully crafted it is.Now the acting. A movie can take pride if one of the leads throws an exceptional performance. When you have two magnificent, Oscar caliber performances, what more can you really ask from your actors. This is both Bruce Willis' and Haley Joel Osment's best role to date. And it makes the Sixth Sense the only movie after Leon that the adult/child relationship really works.Let me finish by saying that I consider a major spoiler even the title Sixth Sense. In order to truly enjoy this movie, you shouldn't know it has anything to do with supernatural. What's the fun when you know even before the first minute that this is about ghosts? Not to mention that the word twist is a spoiler by itself! Once more, I urge everyone NOT to read reviews before going to see a movie and if they have to take advice only ask if it was either "good" or "bad". That's it. Nothing else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies of all time,the greatest horror movie of all time and the highest grossing of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is one of those rare gems of a movie.A movie that is slow paced and brooding with chilling atmosphere.A movie that is both scary,chilling and emotional and has the best child acting in any movie.SPOILER WARNING.Did I mention the blow you in the face oh my god twist ending.My god the first time I saw it i could have fainted in a heart-attack but my friend was experiencing the same type of trauma.It even surpasses the way I felt about the Usual Suspects but I think the ending in this film surpasses that one because primarily that was a whodunnit.I mean even if Singer was misdirecting the audience with McQuarrie's tantalising script there was just something about Spacey that didn't feel right and you felt like he was the unusual out of the Usual Suspects but anyway back to this film.Its just the greatest cinematic experience I have ever had when watching a movie of this calibre.The acting is top notch.Willis pulls in a powerful performance and what can be said of Haley Joey Osment's scary but subtle delivery of his lines always delivered in near whispers typical of Shyamalan films.The success of this film is unparalleled.I mean it grossed gigantic millions at the box office and it earned several academy award nominations.It propelled Shyamalan to the top of Hollywood.It was just a great year for him and I wish him best with his future projects.Anyway to end this comment.How can you give this film less than 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie: Shyamalan's a talent. You can find out everything at the end. I felt shivers in different moments of it. He created well the sense of waiting in some scenes. I was scared sometimes and I cried at the end. I think it is a good thriller but a very touching and delicate movie at the same time. Love for another person that go on living over Death (at the beginning Malcolm doesn't resign himself for being death)and the ability in feeling over our normal senses is the message i got. I also think that James Newton Howard's Music contributes to give us the "right feeling of a sixth sense" in the movie.</fullReview>

The last child role that had this type of power was probably Tatum O'Neill in Paper Moon.the dark style of this film lends itself to the story and style wise there was really nothing around like that at the time. Then all of a sudden copy cat movies started coming out with a similar style.Not much more can be said - its a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>15 or PG? Not my kind of 'horror' movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read a lot of good comments for this movie but I must admit that it was not my kind of 'horror' movie. Whilst other people seem to have gained a lot of insight into the underlying themes of this film, such as it's emotional intensity and unexpected twists, I was watching the film in the hope of being scared by it! As it turned out I was bitterly disappointed. I used to consider myself a complete woos where horror movies were concerned, but having made an effort to watch more of them recently I now find them throughly entertaining, although as yet non of them have really 'scared' me, as it were and 'Sixth Sense' was the worst of them all! That's not to say I didn't enjoy this movie to an extent. I enjoyed it for it's originality, handling of emotional issues and occasional shocks... the ending was totally unexpected. However when it came to the 'scare factor' this movie is totally lacking. My friends found it hilarious when I asked them what they thought about it one day and concluded in my opinion that this film should be a PG not a 15!!!! I understand that there are a couple of what could be described as mildly graphic moments in this movie... but seriously I have seen PG's more gory than this and U's that are a lot scarier... I mean what the heck is going on in 'Alice In Wonderland'? In conclusion this is not a movie I would recommend to any hard core 'horror' fan. If it didn't scare me when I first saw it then it wouldn't even scare a 3 month old (I used to be a total woos!!!!) I'm now looking forward to getting to grips with real horror movies such as 'The Shining', and won't be watching 'Sixth Sense' again anytime soon... I hope!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful and unusual thriller with chilling depiction of classic horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies from the 1990s and all times. I had received very good reviews, so I went to watch it by myself (it's not the first time that a below average movie is unfairly overrated, and the opposite thing as well): I was far away from being disappointed. The beginning appears to show just another ordinary story, but that's just one of the cheating things from the movie (another one is the ending, but of course I can't reveal it). It's got all the ingredients for a perfect combination between drama, horror and thriller. I remember the fears of the boy (perfectly performed by Haley Joel Osment, who, by the way, was a few years older than his character Cole as well as the desperation of his mother, who can't understand what's happening to him (even when he tells her what happens), and just can't believe he contacts spirits (she things he's only victim of school abuse). I also remember the restless psychiatrist, trying to help the boy as well as he tries to save his marriage, but it's only at the end when he realizes what ACTUALLY happens. The great interaction between both characters, trying to help each other, is priceless. The dramatic story of Cole's grandma and his contacts with her spirit, which are only believed by his mother at the end, when he reveals a special thing. Well, just watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is a film based on drama,mystery,and thriller. It is directed by M.Night Shyamalan,in 1999,it stars Bruce Willis and Maley Joel Osment and was filmed in Philippines. This is an incredibly film.this is the story of a little boy you will never forget.All your worst childhoods nighmares:the noises in the attic,the intruder in your house,that cold breath that makes your hair stand on end are here and then some. Bruce Willis gives one of the best performances of his Carree as the child psychologist trying to get himself back on track after a violent encounter with a forget patient and it would be crime if Haley Joel Osment were overlooked at coming awards ceremonies for his powerful performance here.Cole's innocent little face hidden behind his absent Father,s a child coming to terms with a terrifying secret in the only way he can. the acting in general is excellent Bruce Willies and is totality convincing as Dr.Malcoln Crowe and Cole Sear. The plot is a little difficult to follow and the dialogue is brilliant. The soundtrack which was really great. This film is amazing but in addition to is thrilling. It made me fear. My recommendation is to go and see the film but is very interesting.</fullReview>

It just has a few disturbing images,but nothing you should be afraid of. A child phyciatrist gets a new client, Cole. I forgot to study the actors/actresses names so I will not be posting them.The REAL movie after about 10 minutes starts to get good. Cole comes home to find his mother and his phicyatrist sitting across from each other in the living room... Silent.. They say there greetings and Cole is asked to play a game. The rules are that the man has to guess things about his life, and on about 1st,2cd,or 3rd guess, he becomes concerned. He asked if he had a secret but didn't want to tell him, he nodded.Then they go everywhere together, except school. And you have to watch the rest to find out the VERY good ending.

		<fullReview>This movie is definitely the best m. Night Shamalan movie I have seen yet and i love him. This was an amazing movie and its "magic" was Haley Joel Osment. He is an amazing actor and definitely the best child actor of our time. He WAS the movie and I don't understand why he was seen as the supporting actor and not the main actor. but actual i do understand. It is because they look down on children, which i don't think is fair. Bruce Willis was very good, but I could imagine a lot of people in that role. I can't imagine anyone else in Haley's role. This movie was amazingly written and the music was phenomenal. I hope everyone in the world gets to see this movie because it is one that you don't want to miss.

		<fullReview>Sixth Sense(1999)-Haley Joel Osment, Bruce Willis, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams, Mischa Barton, Trevor Morgan and Donnie Wahlberg.All I can say is Wow! This is great. The beginning starts off with complete darkness and no music and gives you goosebumps. You are immmediately pulled into great music(It's really good and catchy, and also very sad and dreary). It starts off with Bruce Willis(Malcom Crowe) and his wife (Olivia Williams) celebrating over Malcom being a good psychiatrist. A former patient is in their bathroom and shoot Malcom and then shoots himself. It goes to a year later and Malcom is miserable and meets a boy(Osment as Cole Spears) that has a horrible secret of talking to the dead. It has some scary moments and is groundbreaking. when it is at a slow part, it has scary music to make you interested. Just a great film that is very sad. I won't tell the ending, but in my opinion, it's a tear jerker. My rating: 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is the story about a young boy who lives with his mom that has troubles in school, and troubles interacting with all of the spoiled rich kids that he has in his school. He talks with a psychologist played by Bruce Willis. The psychologist tries to figure out what kind of problems the kid has, but then it turns out that the kid sees dead people.The movie isn't scary like everyone says, but it is very intriguing movie as you see what the kid sees, you see why he's so horrified, and you see how he handles his fears. The ending is probably what the film is known for(don't worry, I won't go anywhere near spoiling it for you). You would probably never guess it, but unfortunately, some jerk spoiled it for me. Hopefully no one ever does the same to you.This is a very intriguing movie, and is also very original. In some ways, I think that M. Night Shyamalan was inspired by the creepy movie Pet Sematary. If you watch both films, you might also notice a similarity. Watch The Sixth Sense at all costs, it's worth it.</fullReview>

The first time I saw it, I knew that I had to see it again and did. With great anticipation, I recently watched a video tape of it and found myself as drawn into it as the first time. I was very disappointed, however, in the ending on the tape because it is not the ending I remembered from the film. The end of the movie brought tears to my eyes.

Full credit to the writers and actors of this nail-biting thriller. As a psychologist juxtaposed alongside his grieving wife, the plot slowly begins to unravel.Along the lines of 'Fight Club', this film is worthy of viewing and is a guaranteed KO in entertainment value.

Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, and Toni Collette all give great performances. The fact that Bruce was snubbed by the Academy for a nomination should be a crime. The entire movie is brilliant and should be put on many top movie lists and should probably be higher on the top 250. This is by far the best movie from this director who ended up making only disappointing films after it. This is a must see because of its great writing, directing, and acting. Plus the ending is so unexpected that you will fall over the first time. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

Haley Joel Osment as Cole is a revelation and gives one of the greatest child performances ever, he should have got an Oscar for this for sure, his performance is truly awe inspiring it leaves the audience amazed at how this kid can engross you, the way he is immersed into his role is a way in which only Hollywoods elite like De Niro and Pacino etc can do and at only 11 years of age when filming this it is amazing. He will develop to be one of Hollywoods best on the evidence of this. *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I hear one more comment about how 'This movie wouldn't have been the same without the ending' or 'It's a movie reliant on the plot twist' I fear my head may well explode and I'll be another of the young Cole Sear's visitors.Where to begin. This movie is more than a twist ending. It's how movies should be made. From the beautifully haunting score by James Newton Howard, the unbelievably sophisticated performance by Osment (I hate pretentious child actors doing scary, ie 'The Ring', but this kid is special), the dark,moody directing of Shyamlan, Bruce Willis's excellent tortured performance (fast believing he's the best at tortured expressions in the business. See Twelve Monkeys &amp; Unbreakable) and the unsung hero or heroine in the form of Toni Collette (easily the pick of the performances. Haven't seen her mentioned much. Watch the movie again and just focus on her).So what's bad about this movie....ummmmm. Give me a minute or two. Nothing. Not a thing. Its a masterpiece. Need more evidence?Focus on the little subtleties in the movie. I'm not talking the 'Rules and Clues'. I'm talking human eccentricities. Those things that breathe life into a character. I don't care about the horror. My favourite bits:The 'step backwards' scene. The camera from Cole's POV zooming out. The fact Cole wears his father's glasses with the lenses taken out. His father's watch he found in the drawer. The fact he pays the kid to pretend to be his friend for his mothers benefit. The line 'They don't have meetings about rainbows.' The 'shopping trolley fun ' scene.Obviously I still like the obvious scenes (the twist revelation, the 'revealing to his mother the truth, Watching it again and missing the clues) buts it's the human characteristics I like.There's so much more than just a twist movie here and it pains me to think that people that think otherwise should have a voice on here. Then again everyones entitled to there opinion. Even if it's the wrong one...which I guess is subjective anyway.Anyway, I'm rambling. Go watch it now...I don't care if you've seen it. Watch it again....and again...and again.This is how to make movies.Welcome any feedback/criticism. The e-mails there.</fullReview>

It still remains an astonishing breakthrough feature for an almost unknown director, and showcases one of the best child acting turns ever. I know his movies make you want to bite rope now, but go back and look - he's good in Sixth Sense. And it's about so much more than the twist. Cut off the twist, and you might not know you were missing anything - up to then, his relationship with his wife has been a sub-plot. Having said all of this, this is not my favourite M Night Shyamalan film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is one of the absolute best movies I have seen in a LONG time. Bruce Willis was fantastic--his character was very low key, which is kind of unusual for him. And Haley Joel Osement is on his way to being an incredible actor. The plot, the story of a little boy who sees dead people (that's not a spoiler if you ever even saw a preview for this movie!), is interesting, a little scary at times, just a touch gory at others, and very creepy a lot of the time. A sub plot, Malcolm's marital problems, ends up being very important to the overall story.I don't think this really counts as a spoiler---at one point Cole tells Malcolm that "you know how you feel the hairs on your neck stand up? That's them" (dead people). The first time my husband and I watched this, when it got to the ending he turned and looked at me and said "I just felt the dead people!" An exellent movie! NOT REALLY A SPOILER BUT YOU WANT TO SKIP IT IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!!!!I don't know if the video version has the "Rules and Clues" on it--it is a special feature on the DVD. If not, try to check out the DVD version so you can see this feature. It offers a neat explanation of ....well, the "Rules and Clues". It's pretty cool how it showcases all these parts of the movie that made perfect sense while you were watching it, but you come to find out meant something totally different than you thought!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I am not a massive Bruce Willis fan.He is known for his 'Die Hard' movies and of course 'Armageddon'.However in this movie we begin do see that he can be a good actor.Bruce plays a renowned doctor called Malcolm.He is highly regarded after helping many children.He has a beautiful wife,a great home and life could'nt be going much better for him.However one night, a former patient of Malcolms breaks into his house and lets Malcolm know what has really happened to him.Malcolms life turns upside down.His marriage is not what it was.His job is not going as well as it was.Malcolm then has a patient called Cole.He is a remarkable child who seems to have a relative side to the spirit world.Malcolm developes a close relationship with Cole and tries to help Cole fight his fears.Thats all I will say about the movie.I hope you enjoy it because I thinks its great.8/10 - Bruce Willis' best ever performance.Also note a fantastic performances from the kid who plays Cole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy, but also deeply moving.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not very often that a tale of the supernatural is also a deeply moving emotional experience. Usually if a tale of clairvoyance, or any narrative delving into the supernatural is going to be dealt with in a way that is emotionally very moving it is going to be done on a television series, like The X Files or Buffy. Here M Night Shyamalan creates a tale that deeply cinematic, at times unnerving and creepy, but which is deeply sad to the extent it will leave you with a tear in your eye. He succeeds admirably.Having Bruce Willis as a caring type in a film where he tries to protect a child has been done before in the shape of Mercury Rising. That film was not the biggest hit that Willis has had (even though it was quite an enjoyable film). Usually having Willis as a caring, fatherly type is akin to having Arnie or Sly in comedy movies. We just don't really want to see them in a film like that. Willis bucks the trend of doing something different by actually doing it well. Here is superb in a non action role, putting in his best performance since Pulp Fiction. A more restrained role without resorting to using guns or being chased or shouting dialog like 'yippe-ky-yay' is quite hard to believe, but here he pulls it of fantastically. In saying that he is supported by a fantastic supporting cast. Olivia Williams and Toni Collette are fantastic, but everyone is beaten to the acting stakes by Haley Joel Osmont. Never has a child actor put in a role of such maturity or brilliance. Even better, for a child actor, he doesn't try and milk the emotional parts by purposefully playing to the character. His performance is right on the tone of this downbeat and quiet little film. The scenes he shares with Willis are powerfully intense, but in that quiet little way. Likewise his scenes with Toni Collette, who nagged a best supporting actress nod and deservedly so. Anybody who doesn't have the hairs on the back of their neck standing up, but simultaneously moved to tears when Osmont's character Cole tells his mother played by Collete about her mother really should check their own pulse. This, along with the final scene of the film, demonstrate how emotional a horror film can be as when done correctly.Having had the plot twist spoiled for me, I can't say if was a surprise or not, as not having watched the film and not know what was coming cannot lead me to saying. Knowing doesn't detract from this wonderful little film that was quite simply one of the best of 1999. The twist, which should be a horrifying moment, starts of initially as that, but develops into one of the saddest moments I have ever seen in a film. It demonstrates brilliantly what this film stands for. A creepy little thriller with the capacity to move you to tears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best films I've ever seen. Don't even like Bruce Willis normally. So sad. Willis too, walked away like I did, shaking his head. So downright tragic without really being able to pinpoint why I cared SO much about the characters. Very scary, too. Yet, a movie I could see again and again and enjoy more and more, having gotten over a strong initial shock. A GREAT MOVIE! See it and experience a once in a lifetime event. Then see it again without being shocked by the ending and enjoy the story content, as well as the performances---even more!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something you want to see more than once</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie several times and I still think it's quite brilliant. The funny thing whit this one is that when you see this movie for a second or third time you look at it in a different way. When I saw it for the first time in the cinema a few years ago I thought it was quite scary. Not because of big special effects,(because there are none) but because of the pressing atmosphere. I was also completely amazed by the ending of the movie. Something I really didn't see coming, but which rather made sense to me. It explained really everything what happened in the movie. So when I walked out of the cinema I had this instant feeling of wanting to see it again, which I did, on tape about a year later. Natural I now knew the ending, but I still enjoyed watching it, because of the great story. The third time around was a few weeks ago, when I saw it on TV, and I'm almost ashamed to admit that I really cried my eyes out this time. It then hit me that this movie isn't a thriller or Horror movie at all. It's really a very dramatic story about a little boy who learns to deal whit his problems and a psychiatrist who learns about the truth in his "live". And that they only could move on by helping each other. It's a really heartbreaking movie, not at least because of the great acting. I thought that Haley Joel Osment was really brilliant. He is so convincing. He really looked traumatised and scared all the time. I totally believed him. I'm not a big fan of Bruce Willis, but this time around I was quite suprised by his acting. He quite moved me. And also, last but not least, there goes a lot of credit to M. Night Shyamalan. The way he tells this story is perfect. It's slow for a Hollywood movie, but the story is so beautiful and smart, that I wasn't bored for a single moment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very interesting movie with good acting. Reminded me at times of "The Shining".Although very slow at times, the theme is novel and demands the full attention of the viewer.The climax however is rather far-fetched and disappointing as it tends to add just that little too much imagination to the general fantasy.There is a tendency these days in movie making to often exaggerate in order to impress an audience but the achieved result is often exactly the opposite of what the producer or director intended.Viewers in general have become so accustomed to excess that they welcome an uncomplicated approach to a theme.It is therefore regretful that "The Sixth Sense" lost some of its appeal by falling into the above-mentioned trap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sixth Sense, a movie that came out in 1999, is one of my favorites. It is an edge of the seat thriller from start to finish. This movie kept me guessing all the way through. There are many twists and turns that finally lead the viewer up to twisted end. The movie starts out with Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and his wife (Olivia Williams) celebrating his award he won. Dr. Crowe is a child psychologist. When he walks into his bedroom, he witnesses a gruesome suicide of one of his ex-patients, which turns him to redeem himself by taking on a new client Cole (Haley Joel Osment). Cole has a problem that he will not tell anyone about. Dr. Crowe spends the whole movie trying to get Cole to say what he has on his mind. At the beginning, Cole would not even let Dr. Crowe near him because he had a fear that Dr. Crowe was going to harm him. But Dr. Crowe could not figure out why. Progressively throughout the movie, Dr. Crowe kept inching closer to Cole. For some odd reason, Dr. Crowe and his wife was sliding apart. He thought it was because he had been working on the Cole case. But she would cry and not talk to him or even acknowledge he was even in her presence. Before he could figure out Cole's problem, he just about went berserk when he saw his wife cheating on him. Finally he got back to the Cole case.Cole's mother (Toni Collette) at the same time was trying to figure out what was going on with him. Weird things were going on in the house, and she thought Cole was the source of it. She would cry and beg him to tell him what was going on. She started noticing suspicious things around the house that was even scaring her more. Cole's mother was tired of him not telling her about his problems and his peers making fun of him. For the most part, she gave up trying. Then it was in Dr. Crowe's hands to diagnose Cole's problems.This movie unlike most kept its audience's attention to the end. The movie Sixth Sense ended just exciting as the middle of the movie, when most movies slope down toward the end. The end of the movie brings everything together and makes sense to things that the audience wouldn't give much thought to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top Psychological Thriller; When the analyzer becomes the analyzed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamaina's "The Sixth Sense" has come a long way since movies about psychological issues hit the big screen back in 1945 with Alfred Hitchcock's "Spellbound" and shows how much we learned about the subject since then. Dr. Malcolm Crowe, Bruce Willis, is on top of the world a success in his chosen profession, child psychology, and married to a beautiful and caring wife Anna, Olivia Williams. At the beginning of the film Dr. and Mrs. Crowe down in the living room drinking themselves almost drunk with wine. Celebrating Dr. Crowe being awarded the Mayor's Citation for Professional Excellence Award from the city of Philadelphia. Going up the stairs to the bedroom Dr. Crowe sees that the window is broken and there's someone in the house. When he looks towards the bathroom Dr. Crowe sees that the light is turned on and there's someone in there. Dr. Crowe trying to get the intruder who's very emotionally disturbed at ease by talking to him finds out that he was one of his patients that he treated who went wrong Vincent Gray, Donnie Wahlberg. Before Dr. Crowe can go any further Vincent pulls out a gun and shoots him point blank and then turns the gun on himself.The movie then jumps some six months later when Dr. Crowe recovered and back on the job is assigned to his first patient since being shot. He's to treat a six year-old boy Cole Sear, Haley Joel Osment, who's having problems at school and at home. Cole can't get along not only with his classmates and his teachers but also with his single parent mother Lynn Sear, Toni Collette. Cole withdrawn and quite and he gets scared and frightened for apparently no reason when he's looking at seemingly harmless people and places or at nothing at all. Dr. Crowe starts to talk to Cole as he tries to analyze him and to the Dr.'s surprise little Cole seems to come out of his shell. Cole not only responds to him in an unafraid manner to which he doesn't do to any of his classmates and teachers, whom he knows a lot more the Dr. Crowe, he also also confides in him to what his fears are. Young Cole has hallucinations that, as he tells a very interested and concerned Dr. Crowe, he "sees dead people". He sees them everywhere, in school, in the streets even at home. He sees them everywhere he looks and there are some that don't even know that there dead. Dr. Crowe at first feels that he's getting through to young Cole and puts all of his attention and efforts to curing him of his psychosis. What he doesn't realize is that the attention that he's paying to Cole is jeopardizing his whole life by neglecting his wife and his friends. As well any other cases of child psychological disorders that he may have to examine and cure in the future.You begin to wonder why Dr. Crowe is paying so much attention to Cole? Is it that Cole reminds him of Vincent Gray whom he failed so many years ago which ended with him being shot and Vincent killing himself. Is Dr. Crowe afraid that young Cole if not cured will end up the same way? Did that terrible incident at the beginning of the movie damage Dr. Crowe so severely that it completely wrecked his ability as a child psychologist to do his work and made him need psychological help himself? What really surprised me about "The Sixth Sense" was the quality of Bruce Willis acting in the movie even more then the already legendary, although it's been only four years since the film was released back in 1999, surprise ending. Bruce Willis carried the movie with an academy award caliber performance without a shoot-out explosion or car chase or almost any action at all which Bruce Willis movies are noted for. Willis played the exact opposite a role that he would usually play and excelled in it.You also have to give top acting credit to the young Haley Joel Osment who played the young boy Cole Sear who held his own and sometime even eclipsed Willis in every scene that they were in together. If "The Sixth Sense" showed anything besides being a top psychological thriller is that when Bruce Willis is too old and unconvincing to play action hero parts he'll still have a very bright future in films that would only require acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had such a great story, and the best acting I've seen. Haley Joel Osment was amazing, he is soo believable and real! It was totally scary, and soo entertaining. M.Night Shymalan, the director, makes really good movies. It is scary without all that gore and killing. It has a really good plot, and unexpected turns. They did a great job on the "DEAD PEOPLE", they look dead without looking overdone. I love Cole's character, he's so natural, and Haley does a great job acting scared and sad in this movie. It's entertaining to watch it over and over, and it never gets boring. Bruce Willis was great! He worked so well with Haley. They were both really interesting to watch and each scene was done soo well. I like to hear second opinions, so I asked everyone I know that saw it, what they thought of it, and they all loved it too! It got a great rating (8.2/10), and it is definately worth seeing!! I bought the movie as soon as it came out, and it's really one of the great movies people should own. There's nothing like this horror/thriller, a one of kind, wonderfully acted, directed, and written movie. It'll be a classic someday, and it is currently #78 of the top 250 movies at imdb.com. No one could possibly regret seeing this movie, unless it was too scary for them. (It is pretty scary! "Not for me though!".) -Mariam-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was such a good movie. Sixth Sense was not just scary, but engrossing, well written and earned every drop of praise it got. Saw it around the time as "Blair Witch" and though Blair is good(I gave it a 7), Sixth Sense really was, more then good, it was superb and my vote's a 9 of 10. Besides being creepy the movie itself is almost bewitching, it strikes just the right balance between drama and psychological thriller.SPOILERS: What an acting job from Bruce Willis. The "twist" to the movie was surely just that-didn't even see it coming. What is really cool about Sixth Sense and one of the things that makes it an excellent movie, is that it can still be watched after you've seen it once-even knowing what the "twist" is.This was one of my favorite movies to come out around this time period, it is absolutely unique. Not many movies around anymore that can both scare and thrill at this level-EXCELLENT!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the movie cam out in the Summer of 1999 before I had seen it one of my friends told me the ending probably assuming I had seen it. Well while watching the movie that's all that was in my mind but I tried to put it off and I did and when it came I was still shocked cause you didn't expect it the way it happened. The 6th Sense was a great movie. It was a little scary, but had some funny parts. Most of all it didn't drag on but kept moving at a steady pace. No CGI effects were used, none I noticed anyway, but it didn't need them. This was a blockbuster hit and was an instant classic. I love this movie yet you can't watch it to much but I'd recommend it to anyone to watch if they haven't seen it already. ***Spoiler*** I also liked how M. Night used the color red to indicate all of what was happening with the red door handle, sweater, tent in the little boys room, etc. It was great to connect the color red with the ghosts. This movie deserves everyones attention</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is about love, relationships, eternity and faith as much as it is a thriller. It is a very accomplished scare film but if it were just that it could join the hopper of similar forgettable movies made and forgotten every year. "Sense" rises far above the genre, creating people we care about in situations we understand and with a philosophical approach that says much about the way people live. I think it is one of the finest films of the decade and will survive a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PLOT SPOILERM. Night Shyamalan makes a brilliant directorial debut in this chiller-drama focusing on the Sixth Sense of the title. Not only does it bring about the required scares, but also it equally backs this up with some brilliant acting from all concerned. The film has that haunting, suspenseful atmosphere, as you really don't know what will happen next. But the one problem that has occurred in Shyamalan's film so far is the limited re-watchable factor. While at first it appears to be unpredictable and suspenseful, second time round you will notice the long gap between scares and the film loses it's intended atmosphere.But the quality of the acting will never wear thin. Bruce Willis defies his critics and proves that he can act, giving a humane performance as Dr. Malcolm Crowe. Though lacking in experience, Haley Joel Osment is brilliant as the disturbed, depressed kid, and deserved the Oscar which he didn't win. Olivia Williams and Toni Colette make good support in their respective roles. `The Sixth Sense' is most famous for its HUGE twist in the end. In some ways it was good and a smart way to conclude the film, but then again it doesn't make logical sense and is unintentionally funny. I mean, Bruce Willis' character was dead for nearly a year and he hadn't noticed. What a dunce!But in retrospect, `The Sixth Sense' is a haunting, subtle and brilliant piece of work that will live long in the memory. 7.9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>shyamalan has crafted a beautiful film here, that's more chilling than scary. You all know the story by know, and yes, there are then thousand plot holes, but it really doesn't matter when you have film-making of this standard. The direction and score go hand in hand perfectly. While the actors all give their best, most notably toni collette and haley joel osment. Osment is the films heart, with a performance easily up there as one of cinema's best. The scariest thing in the film is how the kid manages to convey his emotions so realistically. When he is scared in the movie, he genuinely looks scared, and that is no easy feat to do with a big camera pointing in your face. Bruce Willis does a good job, proving that he can actually act very well when he wants to. But he is outshone by osment, which is probably best for the movie anyway. The plot is strong, and unwinds at it's own crawling pace, but it pay's off in the end with a touching finale that makes you want to watch the whole film again. And not many films do that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drama / Thriller / Horror / Mystery: yes, all that, but without all those silly FX</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I nearly did not watch this one as I see no future in Bruce Willis categorized as one of those he-men in so-called action films: Seagal, Schwarzenegger, van Damme, Lundgren, Willis and the ilk are patently for underdeveloped fourteen-year-olds. Fortunately several things caught my eye on IMDb and ???It has been years since I last saw a film which might vaguely be categorized horror thriller which so held my attention, indeed so many years that I cannot even recall its title. Evidently Bruce Willis did not do this film for the pay-cheque, as he put all his heart and soul into it, such that he was not just simply bearable but very acceptable indeed. I hope he will do a few more like this film and leave the bravura stuff to the chimpanzees cavorting about the place with nothing to show or tell apart from biceps and fly-sized brains. Good work here, which obviously made or broke the film.But it is Haley Joel Osment who towers over him: an extraordinary performance from this eleven-year-old (when making the film). He has certainly come a long way since his minor rle in `Forrest Gump', and judging by his performance in `The Sixth Sense' he has a long way yet still to go. I would have like to see more of Mischa Barton in this film, but the story would not have handled two big parts from tender-aged actors. After her astounding rle in `Lawn Dogs' (1997) (qv) together with an incredible Sam Rockwell, I had expected - hoped for - something greater than her brief appearances here. However, this is only a small gripe, taking what the picture is worth as a whole.During this film I uttered to my wife: but this is Oscar stuff. So I hopped up to see IMDb, and discovered that indeed the young Osment got a nomination for his rle in this film. I am not at all surprised. Full marks, then, to Mr. Manoj Night Shyamalan for so wonderfully piecing together the parts and getting some really absorbing scenes during his story. One scene has the young boy lying in bed and Bruce Willis at his side: I assure you sparks, flew between the two actors ? not just simply `good chemistry'.Of films of this genre it is definitely one of the very very few I would like to see again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good psychological thriller with a surprise ending...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 3/2/2003 - 7 out of 10(Dir-M. Night Shyamalan): Good psychological thriller with a surprise ending. This is a well-told story about a boy who `sees dead people', and is counseled by the Bruce Willis's character in an attempt to do better than he had done before with a similar child. The best things about this movie are the pacing and the way the director moves us through the story and the performance by Haley Joel Osment as the boy. Willis does his usual good job, but Haley is superb. I won't give away the ending because I shouldn't, but in a way I'm kind of tired of surprise ending that throw the whole story out of sync and this is really my only real gripe about the movie. Other than this, it is a very well done first effort for writer/director Shyamalan, which of course, brought about more to come for him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haley Joel Osment gives an excellent performance, and the movie scares the pants off you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I had seen "The Sixth Sense" all I heard was that it was about it was a kid who saw dead people. It is much more than that. It is a movie about a kid who sees dead people, but it is also a film that shows us how lonely children can be and how a divorce can effect a child's life. Haley Joel Osment plays Coal, a recent victim to his parents divorce. Coal is a very lonely child, as we see throughout the movie he has no friends and he always gets picked on. His mother (Toni Collette) is always trying to comfort him, and talk to him, but Coal does not want to be comforted.The movie starts out with Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) a child phychologist, who has recently won an award for his work in child phychology. He and his wife go up to their room after admiring the award only to find that their house has been broken in to. The person who has broken in is a depressed and miserable man who is a former patient of Crowe's. He states that he was a child of a divorced couple and that when he was a child, Malcolm was sent to help him. He is very upset with Malcolm because Malcolm did not help him at all. When Malcolm offers to help him, the patient (Donnie Wahlberg) picks up a gun on the toilet and shoots Malcolm. We then see the patient commit suicide and Malcolm's wife going over to the bed to help Malcolm.The scene then switches over to Coal again. He is going to be the next patient of Malcolm. Coal and Malcolm get off to a very bad start. Coal clearly does not like Malcolm and does not want him to help him. Eventually Coal and Malcolm get to be friends and Coal says that he has a secret that he has not told anybody. He says he will tell Malcolm. His secret is: I see dead people. This unleashes a whole different problem for Malcolm. Before he was trying to help Coal with his parents divorce. Now he must find a way to make the dead people go away.This is a pure horror film. If you get scared very easily, this is not the right movie for you. It has occured to me that M. Night Shamayalan is the next Steven Spielberg. Along with this movie, Mr. Shamayalan also made Signs (which is as good as this film), another horror flick that shows a stunning reality of what Earth could be like if it was being invaded by aliens. Shamayalan does an excellent job of directing "Signs". Shamayalan also does an excellent job with this film. His casting is right on target. Haley Joel Osment does a sensational job as Coal, and Bruce Willis, once again, gives a great performance as Malcolm Crowe. Shamaylan definetely knows how to scare and when to scare correctly, and he also knows how to direct correctly. The truth of "The Sixth Sense" will blow your mind.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautifully crafted ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was never scary to me. It was always just sad. Don't get me wrong, I really loved this movie. I was just able to allow myself to see deeper than a few scares. Like all good ghost stories, once you peel away the fear of the unknown, there is a story of sadness. Of life cut short. In most good ghost stories, the ghost's need our help and reach out to us. The fear comes from our reaction to them. They are the dead who have no voice and are trapped. This movie is a beautiful portrait of sadness. It also had a wonderful relationship between a mother and her son. She cannot reach him, she is the only person that thinks he's normal, he will never let her know how different he is. They, just like the ghosts, have no way to communicate with one another. There is love and small moments of joy that they share but always under a blanket of sadness. I love this movie because it tells us a story. A good story about a scary subject but puts a new twist on it. It reminds us how sad and lonely ghosts can be, and how much they need us, and how we need them. It shows us that sadness does not end with death, we can carry with us always. Sometimes we just need someone to set us free.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate horror movies as a class. Did I say I hate them? No, no... I mean I HATE them. A barrelful of smart alecks running around with buckets of red paint. No coherent script, no decent acting, no sense of direction.... pretty much wraps it in a nutshell. There are very few exceptions. You've seen a horror movie that's good? It's not a horror flick! When I say these opinions, people always give some good movies' names, like Alien... Alien was a thriller. Not horror... Same goes for Predator, and Jaws. Debatable, maybe... but that's my opinion anyhow.The Sixth Sense is a fantastic movie. I've watched it 27 times to date, and I'll watch it again... I must say that initially I was not interested. I was not in the mood for the 'classic' and dragging story. I just kept my cousin company as we watched it together.Even in my state of partial interest, I could easily see that the direction was superb. Bruce Willis, as expected, gave a very convincing portrayal of the helpful psychologist. But I was short of appalled when he was nominated for Best Actor, and Osment for Best Supporting Actor. I protest. Haley Joel Osment played the centre character here, and Willis, legend as he is, played the supporting role. I was mesmerized by Haley Joel Osment. That kid took on the part that demanded maturity to an extreme level, and he delivered his part flawlessly. Flawlessly!It's really hard to see good child actors these days. Hey... it's really hard to see good child actors these period. And Haley proved prodigious. His performance cannot be equalled in the near future... not easily.Anyway, when the movie finished, my cousin, thoroughly impressed, said,"You weren't expecting that, were you?" I nodded no. We talked about the movie for a while, and he left. Immediately, I saw the movie again. I have great respect for Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan, and for Bruce Willis. But more than that,... for Osment. Well, that's all, folks. I got to while away the time. I think I'll watch some movie now. Hmm... The Sixth Sense Ought to be good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sixth Sense: 10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second highest grossing movie of 1999, the 14th highest grossing movie of all time, and six Oscar nominations are pretty high achievements. And to whom do they belong? M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense.The Sixth Sense begins with simple enough opening credits, and then we see Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) with his wife Anna (Olivia Williams) after Malcolm had won a prestigious award for child psychiatry. However, they hear rustling, and a former patient, Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg), comes in and accuses him of not curing himself. Vincent then shoots Malcolm and himself.Six or eight months later, Malcolm finds a new patient, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). He has problems at home, and so does Malcolm. It seems that Malcolm has put so much time into his work he can't spend any more time with Anna. However, as Malcolm's sessions with Cole become more productive and we find out why Cole is so upset-`I see dead people.' So Malcolm has to figure out why they attack Cole while sorting out problems at home with Anna.There is not one thing I would change about this movie. The acting is top-notch, the chills are supreme and genuine, and I found myself loving this movie.Osment was, for lack of a better word, screwed at the Oscars. He deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar more than Michael Caine (though he also was excellent in The Cider House Rules). Osment displayed solid emotions and really did everything his role required him to do. If Tatum O'Neal can win an Oscar at a young age, so could Osment. Willis didn't say one `yippie-kay-yay' and portrayed his role earnestly and with lots of heart. Williams and Toni Collette (who plays Cole's mother) also did outstanding jobs, but perhaps the most standout performance (next to Osment) was Wahlberg. His part was tiny, but important, and he worked hard for it, losing thirty pounds and displaying true fear, just like Osment.Rather than going for the ultra-gore, Shyamalan went for perfect creeps. With chilling music that gets you at the bone, he uniquely displayed torments to the characters and to us. Although I have seen the movies many times, I was still spooked. I feel glad that he didn't have to go to the lowest common denominator and show blood and brain matter everywhere (during a suicide, he was nice enough to keep it off screen). This is a movie that, if you rent on a Saturday night, you'll be up till dawn.Shyamalan (who also wrote) decided to put in strong dramatic elements. Willis slowly losing his wife was played with great tenderness and not mockery or cruelness. Its ginger display of human life taking a turn for the worse really stood out. That is good movie making when you can combine three things to make a standout movie: acting, thrills, and drama.I actually wanted The Sixth Sense to go on for a lot longer. I wanted to see more of the plight of Malcolm and Cole; I was transfixed. And the ending twist still was somewhat of a shock, even though I know what it was. I couldn't see it even if it stared me in the face, which it did. Shyamalan put in symbolism, which becomes obvious once you see it the second time. Evidence for the twist is so obvious when you are watching it for a repeated time, you'll wonder how you missed it. As I said before: that's great moviemaking.My rating: 10/10Rated PG-13 for intense thematic material and violent images.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense can achieve the title of best horror movie of the 90's with little trouble. Is has an amazing script, a brilliant director, and top-class performances. Haley Joel Osment does a fantastic job and presents himself as a firm promise for the future of acting. This movie will keep you interested to the end and awards should be given to those who anticipated the fabulous plot twist that the final ten minutes of this movie present us. Although this movie was released on what was probably the worst decade for horror movies ever, it will surely take his part in history as one of the best the world will lay their eyes on for many years. This is movie presents enormous maturity and interest and even those who are not fans of the genre will surely appreciate The Sixth Sense. You should take note that this movie is not frightening for its visuals though. It is frightening for its fabulous acting and the psychological fear it can induce on the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie, far from a horror though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers ahead:A cerebral thriller ranking the best of the genre, The Sixth Sense is at its best, though, just that - a pleasant thriller, that doesn't make use of gore, dark sets, twisted angles, profanity; that actually has a beginning, a middle, and a ending (and a pretty good one, actually); that has intelligence and originality, and manages to give a new twist to the ghost legend.But at the end of the day, i think it's unfair to call this movie a 'horror' one. It is in truth a drama, as it tells about a child psychologist, Malcom,(played by an incredibly good Bruce Willis), who has disappointed a former patient, and tries to redeem himself by helping a peculiar boy - Cole (performed by the oscar-nominated Haley Joel Osment) who believes he can see dead people.One of the things i like about this movie, and which i compare toThe Exorcist, is that Malcom, like Father Karras, doesn't jump immediately to the conclusion that the cause of all problems is supernatural, but his opinions are slowly shaped to an undeniable proof, at which point the movie suffers a change.Cole can indeed see ghosts, and Malcom believes all they want is help from Cole - he's in fact gifted, and must now learn to use his gift, which he does by solving a crime. And at the end of the movie, Cole no longer fears the ghosts, but talks with them normally - he's overcome his fears, which is another theme in the movie.By using the supernatural, Shyamalan has thus crafted an original story of learning to deal with what scares us and using our powers with responsability. But i still can't see this movie as a 'horror' one; it is not disturbing, but i also know horror movies don't have to be gory or violent to be effective - but the point is, it never scared me by a moment. Oh, it had me guessing, and antecipating the next scene, and waiting for the end, but i can't say it disturbed me to the point of hiding my face behind my hands, or turning my head the other side.Is it a thriller? No doubt. But would i say i found it disturbing as i did Se7en? No; ironically, though, Se7en in IMDB isn't even considered 'horror' - now that's weird.I guess it's a question of the supernatural - if it has Vampires, Werewolves or ghosts, it can be 'horror', even if it's a movie like Scary Movie...A pleasant movie, The Sixth Sense, it wouldn't be remembered at all though if it weren't because of its climatic ending, which is one of the most intelligent of all times in a movie - what's better, is that the director didn't cheat, as there are clues to solving the mystery throughout the entire movie, and that's something i respect - the ability to have all explicit, and still surprise the viewer at the end.Well, even with all my complaining, i can't avoid giving this movie a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

The year after bruce was shot i had big suspicions, as the film went on my suspicions were proved more and more.Knowing this was a supernatural thriller did not help either. the giveaways were that bruce never spoke to anyone else than Haley Joel Osmond. there was never any interaction between Haley Joels mother and Bruce, his wife never spoke to him, the restaurant scene especially reminded me of ghost, and when Haley tells Bruce he sees dead people that was the final straw. Now if i had known nothing about this film i would have most probably been blown away, this is one of the dangers of being hyped. It was still a good movie though the acting was great, and there was ageneral creepiness to it, and even though i guessed the twist it was still a good idea. i did have problems with it though why did Bruce never wonder why everyone else apart from Haley Joel ignored him,How did Bruce come in contact with him, no one hires dead councellors, why was the girl being poisoned and what was the significance of the red door knob etc.All in all a good movie but the less you know about it the better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't see the trailer and I didn't knew anything about this movie excluding that many have said it's very good. Afterwards I saw the trailer and thought; that's like taking part of the effect out of the movie. Name Sixth Sense was only clue and from the first scene I knew this is going to build up into very pensive and prosperous atmosphere. Movie works extremely well almost throughoutly, but tension suffers in last part. It's not the ending itself, but certain aspects of melodramacy and the story itself is a bit repetitive towards ending. Anyhow that's only criticism afterwards.When watching the movie it takes psychological control over your mind if you just let it to do so. Then it goes on all the way to the end and you should find yourself staring vacantly ending credits with strong emotions on surface. Sixth Sense had the same effect than Jacob's Ladder. Nowhere near same movies, but psychological emotional effect is same. Second time watching this film will be different experience.Story itself is being weaved together almost seamlessly. Shyamalan has certainly put a lot of thinking how to build up the story properly without taking compromises. Simplicity works like a beauty and film maintains calm, even peaceful atmosphere all the way despite of fearful moments twisting your mind and sending cold chills down to your spine.Haley Joel Osment as a little boy Cole does just astonishing job. Not just as a child-actor but as an actor. Toni Collette as his mother does a good job too regardless of few mediocre scenes. Bruce Willis is just a slightly bit too self-sufficient in his acting, but does maybe one of the best roles of his career (12 Monkeys was pretty good too). It's more to do with his general acting-personality-image from other films than acting itself in this film.If you're going to watch Sixth Sense, watch it with open mind, otherwise you'll spoil the experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First I would like to say that this is a great film. Secondly, I Would like to say to everyone out there who says that The Others is a Copy of this film has no concept of reality. The Others was written before this film was, so that argument can be put to rest right here. I really think this film is great, and if it didn't have the major plot holes that it does I would have given it a much higher score then I did (6/10). I have always been a fan of Bruce Willis, regardless of what is said about him I feel he is one of the better actors of the past 2 decades or so. I feel, however, that Haley Joe Osment puts in the best performance here. I don't see his career amounting to much of anything, but I think this single performance will wind up haunting him for the rest of his life because honestly, he will never grow out of it in the eyes of the audience. I feel Haley makes this film creepy, and keeps the suspense stirring throughout. I can see why Toni Collette got no nods for her performance here. Besides the scene towards the end in the car with Haley, I feel she does a below par job in this film. ***CONTAINS SPOILERS*** Ok this is where I feel the film lost a lot of luster. There were some pretty big plot holes. Everyone who hasn't seen it yet don't read on until the end of spoilers. How can malcolm not realize he is dead until the end of the film? Where does he sleep at night? I mean doesn't he realize that his wife isn't talking to, or even looking at him at all? I know they say in the film that the dead only see what they want to, but how does he explain this to himself? The other thing that really turned me off at the end was when cole had told Malcolm earlier in the film that the room becomes very cold when an ill-tempered or mean spirit enters the room. Well then why was malcolms wife freezing in the last scene when he was the only spirit in the room? He certainly didn't seem that angry to me. ***END OF SPOILERS*** Those spoilers are the reason the film goes from an 8 or 9, to a 6. There are some great scenes in this movie, and the concept is exceptional, I just wish they had tied up those loose ends. I also question the message of this film. It definitely comes off as a suspense/love story. I think anyone who likes this film will love The Others. Some people will disagree, but only because their attention span is limited. The plot to that film has zero holes in it, and is just as creepy and suspensful as this film. Overall this film is still definitely worth your time, and should be checked out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A theory (warning - contains spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I missed this when it came out, but enjoyed Unbreakable and Signs in the theatres. Having just seen it on tv, I found I enjoyed it despite knowing about the twist ending - in fact I enjoyed seeing how the trick was worked.SPOILER ALERT I've noticed several people in these comments making the very good point, "how could Dr. Crowe go a whole year not noticing that no one was talking to him, etc?" In fact one might wonder how the other ghosts, some of whom had clearly been dead for centuries, had failed to notice their condition - the gunshot boy looks to be from the '70s and his casual manner suggests he doesn't know anything's wrong, while the servant in the attic has been yelling for help for lord knows how long, as if he were still alive. This behaviour (pretty typical for both fictional ghosts and those described in actual (?) hauntings) suggests that ghost perceptions are not quite those of the living. Crowe tells his wife in the restaurant scene that he's been having trouble keeping track of time. We only see him when he's working on Cole's case or attempting to interact with his wife - that is, when he's doing the things he's been left on earth to complete. May I suggest that the rest of the time he does not exist, or is in some form of limbo he can only remember confusedly afterwards? After all, time doesn't need to pass the same way for a ghost as for a living human. Anyway, given the intelligence of the script, I thought I'd give Shamalan the benefit of the doubt and try to think up a possible explanation. Possibly on the DVD he talks about this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan's crown jewel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan has created a unique and interesting atmosphere throughout The Sixth Sense. This is a film (not unlike "The Usual Suspects")which is often spoken about and critiqued for it's ending, and much is forgotten about it's content. There are genuine spooks and an unsettling feeling that the viewer's feel throughout "The Sixth Sense" and is present on each viewing.I comment on the film after having seen Shyamalan's two subsequent works "Unbreakable" and "Signs". In each Shyamalan attempt's to deliver the message of faith, religion and fate. It is to the credit of "The Sixth Sense" that these messages are more cleverly woven into the plot of the film, without being blatant as we have seen since. Shymalan presents this in a down to earth, low key fashion. It is without a doubt the crown jewel of his work's.All acting performances are exceptional. Some stereotyping goes into each character. Colette the typical single mum and Willis the child psychologist out for redemption. However this works well around the deep and complex central character and theme."The Sixth Sense" can stand it's head above most other film's of it's time. I rate it very highly. It is certainly the best work of most of the actors involved and certainly the director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A child psychologist, returning home after receiving an award, is confronted by a deranged patient who condemns his former caregiver before shooting him in the stomach and committing suicide. Emotionally and physically numbed, the psychologist takes on a new patient: a child who believes he can communicate with the dead. In addition to feelings of depression and self-doubt, the psychologist is having difficulty in communicating with his wife, who has become increasingly distant since the shooting. Gradually the relationship he establishes with his patient draws him into a strange reality. "Sixth Sense" is a character study with profound concerns, on the theme of self-absorption and despair in a spiritual universe. Somber and low-key, it is misrepresented as a suspense thriller. Viewers should be prepared for a counterpoint to the works of Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman: the fundamental conflict in the film is between alienation and awareness leading to salvation. Anyone expecting the more familiar Hollywood treatment of ghosts and the afterlife will be disappointed: there is no series of jack-in-the-box surprises as found in "The Shining" or Nicole Kidman's "The Others". The concerns of "Sixth Sense" are similar to, but significantly different from, those of Robin Williams' film "What Dreams May Come", without the dramatic imagery. While the mood and pacing of "Sixth Sense" are deliberately oppressive, the final revelation illuminates not merely the series of clues scattered throughout the film but the predicament of the protagonist... and by implication that of the audience. This is a well-crafted and thought-provoking film, and the acting, while restrained, is also excellent. Ironically, many viewers have found the surprise ending to be a distraction: some people seem to have sat through the film waiting for "the twist". Paying attention to the characters and the message that is developed in the story will be more rewarding. However if you dislike Bergman-esque films this one is not for you either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched it already the second time on dvd and I enjoyed still many emotional and chilling moments. It was never boring and what I liked the best was the great performance of little boy Haley Joel Osment. Bruce Willis had no doubt his best role in his life. Congratulations to director M.Night Shyamalan who created a masterpiece ? la Hitchcock. The difference between both directors is perhaps that Shyamalan is the master for mystery movies and Hitchcock for thrillers. The soundtrack from James N. Howard was top. At the end of the film I had tears in my eyes. I highly recommend it to every film fan. I gave 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, number one in my book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just watched The Sixth Sense and all the extras, I have one thing to say about my favorite movie. It's brilliant. Every second of the film has a point and keeps it's pace, a rarity in modern movie making. The masterpiece of film which is incredibly moving and monumental, and above all things, GOOD, is ultimate film perfection. M. Night Shyamalan is a story telling genius and this movie is NOT for die hard, spiritual side-less, skeptics of anything remotley beyond only what the eye can see. The story is one of the best and to top perfect direction and storytelling, every single actor can hold a scene incredibly.  Bruce Willis, who is a very good actor, when the scripts give him a chance (Story of Us) is the best he's ever been in here. And Haley Joel Osment is a very good actor, and not just a kid actor at that. I can't think of another one like him, who is an adult actor in a kid's body. Everyone in this movie holds up their scenes with brilliance, giving the audience a movie that I remember hooking me from the first scene. Each time I see this movie I see something new, from the 3 times I saw it at the show and the countless others I've seen it at home, larger than life goosebumps never fail to overcome me in the film's finally moments (tears come also, and throughout the very moving film. The film is just perfect, through and through, with an original (to whoever compared it to Ghost...? Ghost was incredibly corny). The scene with Haley Joel and Toni Colette in the car at the end, is one of the most moving ever to be filmed. There are simply not enough words of praise for this film, it's my favorite ever (sharing the spot with a select few). I love it, I love it, I love it. Oh, and the film is brilliantly scored also. Also, The Sixth Sense is not only about the twist ending, the film before that is more than enough to hold an entire one on, but the ending boosts the film up to perfection. I simply love this movie. It's the greatest. Infinite stars out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captured the essence of the "altered place"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are certain places in this world (you know the ones I mean, for you have all seen them), that though they might appear perfectly normal in every way, are somehow... different. They may be a street near your house, or a disused park behind your office. They may only take on this difference at a certain time of day, or perhaps only you see it. But that difference, that altered state, manifests itself in, to use Cole's phrase, the prickly things on the back of your neck. These are the kinds of places in which you feel compelled to whisper, even when outdoors, and that make you feel you are not alone, even when you are. Somewhere, inside these places, you feel, other worlds must exist.For me, the greatest achievement of "The Sixth Sense" was not its well-constructed plot or its twist ending; both of these lose their punch on repeat viewings, but rather its masterful evocation of that sense of otherness, as if it had managed to turn the entire city of Philadelphia into an "altered place." In the main the man responsible for this is Tak Fujimoto, Shyamalan's cinamatographer, who shot "The Silence of the Lambs." His shots are both hyperrealistic and dark, mixing shade with sudden bursts of colour, creating a feeling of a world decidedly different from our own. Credit must also go to James Newton Howard, whose elegant, beautiful and creepy score was kept almost subliminal, leaving over its notes a wall of silence that ways down on the heart. "The Sixth Sense" is of course, Shyamalan's film, but it was those two who made it immortal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie more than once, and I still think it's great...However, it is not talent that makes this film great, it is the ability to communicate to the audience with body language and signs rather than the use of many words. If you analyze the dialog, the characters don't have a whole lot to say. But, if you're seeing this for the first time, you'll be glued to your seat, in anticipation of what's coming next. That's the beauty!! Suspense. This film has a great deal of suspense. Thus, you may or may not enjoy it the second time around. It's also one of those few movies which everybody has seen...So if you happen to be in a theater watching a random play, and an actor comments: "I see dead people!" Don't be surprised if everybody laughs -- because everybody understands the reference.</fullReview>

Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment proved to be excellent together on the screen, making their budding friendship seem real and believable.

		<fullReview>Bruce Willis gives his most subdued and by far greatest performance in this haunting tale of the supernatural that will stick with you far after the credits role. Willis manages to impress me more each time he is in a movie (with the exception of Bandits). The story starts off with Malcome Crowe (Willis) a great childrens shrink who after getting an award comes home to find someone who he failed to help in his bathroom. We now fast forward to the present where Crowe is having marriage problems and is helping a young child (Haley Joel Osment in his Oscar nominated perfromance) who "sees dead people." Although it is a ghost story it is far from horror, but really a brillient drama that is more about love and friendship more than thinks that go bump in the night. The climax is one of the best I've seen and a brilliant script from writer/director M. Night Shamalyn will keep you guessing right up until the intese ending. I believe Bruce Willis was comptly ripped off for not at least recieveing an Oscar nod for his near perfect performance, who in my opinion was far superior to Kevin Spacey in American Beauty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this film 3 times already and have always considered it a thriller and nothing more. As an expecation for an excellent thriller in mind i saw unbreakable and thought it was pretty good however not as powerful as the sixth sense. With the same expectation i saw a screening for the upcoming movie Signs. After watching it i felt let down that M Night's film seem to move further from my expectations as some critics say a "mind blowing" thriller. I have come to realize from viewing these movies that M. Nights film have a deeper meaning that like very few films has a moral.*SPOILERS IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN SIXTH SENSE, UNBREAKABLE, or SIGNS*We all consider Sixth Sense a excellent thriller, but after thinking about it for some time; one moral/idea that this film has demonstrated was that life is too important to be indulged in trivial things. Clearly shown by Bruce Willis character, that sees his work as priority. Money can always be lost and made, life isnt as flexible. Unbreakable also has these moralistic ideas. For example when it is revealed that David Dunn faked his car injury. Love at times requires sacrifices. Popularity (football) will last a short time and people get hurt and realize that their lives change after one incident, love lasts forever. Signs no doubt has a spiritual presence in hope and faith.After considering all these films, I have come to respect M Night Shyamalan more has a writer, direct, and actor that extends past this orginal preconception of an excellent story-teller for thrillers. Although I love watching the great moments of thrills and suspense shown in few films such as the Sixth Sense. I have learned to expect more from Shyamalans films intellectually rather than a surprising "jump" from various scenes in his movies. I have talked to many people who have felt that Sixth Sense was te last best thriller Night will ever make. In some aspects they might be right but if the audience begins to see Shyamalans films for more reasons other than the great thrills, they will look past this notion that Shyamalan is only known for his suspense and thrills. Shyamalan makes excellent use of suspense and thrills to bring the audience into his films, but i do not see that as his only talent as a director, writer, and actor. His films make you as a viewer think about different things rather than giving 90-120 mins of eye candy to awe at. This i think are his greatest talents, I hope to see Shyamalan become a great writer and director. And that people will not live in the memory of how great the sixth Sense was as a Thriller, but as a film that entices a person to consider different things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you believe in the paranormal, or there is more to this world than the living? Do you believe children are contacted by spirits more often than adults? When you think about scary movies, there is always a child involved. Either the child dies early in the movie, or the child is who the spirit/demon contacts. This is because our emotions will be triggered by this child. The child is an agent used to gain and keep the viewer's interest. In The Sixth Sense, the child is Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). Bruce Willis plays the distinguished child psychologist, Dr. Malcolm Crowe, who had a patient he couldn't cure. Cole is like the other child, and Dr. Crowe is determined to help him. Cole shares his secret: `I see dead people.' The dead people come to visit periodically. Cole's role with the deceased is to act as an agent to help them find peace, and we find that Dr. Crowe is a spirit needing help. The movie is surprising. The unexpected ending of Dr. Crowe being deceased is well planned, and after the movie the director M. Night Shyamalan reveals his secret. Every time a ghost is present, an item on the screen is red. This is a very suspenseful movie, and left me very surprised. If Mr. Shyamalan's intentions were to write a suspenseful thriller, I believe he hit the mark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense chilled me to the bone, with it's excellent performances, brilliant storytelling and wonderful directing by M. Night Shyamalan (who also wrote the screenplay). Malcom Crowe (Willis) is a child psychologist, and Cole (Osment) is Malcom's latest patient. I won't reveal anymore of the plot, as I feel less known about it the better. The film has a tremendous amount of atmosphere that oozes out of the screen, engulfing your every sense. There were at least two scenes that made me jump! And the film also has some rather funny moments, namely the video camera scene. If you never thought Bruce Willis was a very good actor, your mind will definitely be changed after seeing his excellent portrayal of Crowe. Australian born Toni Collette shines as Cole's Mother. And Haley Joel Osment brings shame to almost every other child actor in a film. He truly is a gifted actor, and I look forward to watching his career blossom. Much has been said of the films ending, and I don't dare say anything about it. Only that it is truly amazing. In the future I feel this film will be looked on as a landmark in cinematic brilliance in every aspect. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never before have I ever seen such an awesome suspense thriller. This one had it all: intrigue, of course suspence, eerie atmosphere, great involved acting, and the most unique and creative angle on scary films. Before this film I thought that it wasn't possible to have a horror flick with a plot. Now I can actually look forward to scary films with the hopes that they will have as great -or near- a story line as this one.Bruce Willis captures eerie from his facial expressions to the tone of his voice. I've always liked his movies and this one is no exception. In fact, he's given much more dramatic room in this one. He shows that he doesn't need fast paced action or cop roles all the time.Haley Joel Osment is the best. I've seen several other of is movies at the time of this writing and he never ceases to amaze me. At first, I felt sympathy for this child, then as it progressed I realized that his was the coolest role of all (you'll see). He's been gifted with a wide range of emotional display. When he smiles, it warms your heart. His tears choke you up. And his 'intelligence' is intriguing.Each of the other actors deserve mention here, as well. I just don't want to ramble on and on. The mother was very 'real'. The antagonistic child friends of 'Cole Sear' (Osment's character) capture the essence and cruelty of some kids.This movie started by making me interested, then pulled by right in, and finally made me feel like I was a part of it. I watch it again and again and it never disappoints me or makes me tired of it. If you haven't seen this film, you MUST!!I give it 10/10 for literally EVERYTHING in it. thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I see dead people, and some of them don't know they're dead!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sixth Sense", released in 1999, and starring Bruce Willis, gives a new version of the age old mystery regarding life after death. Does the dead person immediately leave this world, or is there a time when the spirit has a chance to stay around awhile? This film will cause the viewer to ponder that mystery while watching the cast wrestle with that concern, and watching dead people appear, then leave the screen.Bruce Willis plays a child psychologist that takes on a case that involves a child, Haley Joel Osmond, who has a problem relating to peers and his single parent. Willis has recently been involved in a situation that left him wounded, and this is one of his first cases since a shooting that occurred at his home. Willis is able to establish a working child-doctor relationship with Cole, the Osmond character, but at the same time finds his own relationship with his wife chilling, even to the point of not existing. During the film, there are several scenes that involve Dr. Crowe, (Willis) with his wife, and she totally ignores him, as if he weren't even there.The film does hold the viewing public in a suspense-filled grip, with the ending being somewhat expected, but nevertheless, causing the watcher to want to see the film again to see what they missed. A good film to have on VHS or DVD, as there are some excellent commentaries on both formats in regards to the clues that were given during the film. This film was nominated for several academy awards, and while not an oscar winner,it was very much on the minds of the movie public during the end of the 20th century. A good, intense mystery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sixth Sense is really a good movie... at the end. I say this because it takes a while to get into the movie. I watched it... late at night... all on my own with a G&amp;T. I found myself squirming around a lot on the couch trying to get into the movie... but it just wasn't happening. It does take a while to get into this one... so if you are short tempered... this probably wouldn't be a very good one for you.Sadly this was the first time that I have actually seen the movie. I have a good explanation for it. After trying to hire it on DVD about six times... every time I managed to get hold of a copy either didn't work (bad DVD copy) or my PC was on the fritz (before I had access to a DVD player - TV Version). Goose bumps? NOT A CHANCE! I had TURKEY BUMPS at the end of this one. When the twist occurs... that late night scene where Mr Willis comes home to his lovely wife... I couldn't believe what was happening. The writers deserve a VERY LARGE Oscar for the script.Brilliant Movie...7.5 flaps out of 10!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film in the U.S. when I was there, that was for 3 years ago.A new star was born - Haley Joel Osment who does a great performance. You might think I don't say the truth now, but after the film I said he would get nomineed for an Oscar. And he did!M. Night Shyamalan has wrote a very well-written script. I've heard that it has been no changes in it. Only that is worth an Oscar, I think. He is also a very good director! My favorite of all times! I'm looking forward to see "Signs". It might be the film of the year. All his films are that so why shouldn't it?!It feels nice to see Bruce Willis play an other character than some action-figure. Also he is great in this film! As he was in "Unbreakable". I hope Shyamalan and Willis get togheter a third time...Everything is just great in this movie, and I give it 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'll tell you what, for the first hour and 42 minutes I could not understand what the hype was about in The Sixth Sense. But during the last 5 minutes, it completely changed my view and made me leave the the</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bruce Willis plays child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe. He takes on a young patient named Cole Sear (another name you'd only hear in the movies, played by Haley Joel Osment). Cole has some fear that he can't communicate to the world, but it's something that hurts him both physically and mentally and it's up to Dr. Crowe to help him. Crowe needs to redeem himself because a former patient of his didn't get the help he needed, and one night broke into Crowe's apartment, and shot Crowe before turning the gun on himself. So in Crowe's mind, helping Cole is as much about helping himself, as it is helping the child. When Crowe uncovers the mystery of Cole's fear, it makes him come to a terrifying realization about himself that changes his life forever. So like I said before, for the most part, this movie was very slow moving and never seemed to get to the point. Osment's acting was spectacular for someone so young. He truly seemed afraid at every turn and you felt really sorry for him. Willis seemed to be going through the motions in this one, but I think he understood that the movie was about the kid and not about him, so he needed to be a little more reserved that normal. It's not giving away too much to say that this movie has the mother of all plot twists and when that happened, it really made the movie special. Not many times do you leave a theater actually talking about what just happened and trying to figure it all out. That's what made the movie so entertaining, and why it's been making all this money. People leave the theater not thinking about the boring part, but thinking about the ending. The screenplay itself was just ok. Some of the dialogue seemed extremely cheesy and unnecessary. And there was way too much whispering. A few people I've talked to even said the movie was confusing until the very end. For a truly great movie I think it needed to be entertaining right up until the big twist, and then have the twist take it up to a whole other level, rather than being a so-so movie that becomes good at the end. See below.I would definitely watch The Sixth Sense over, and over, and over again.SPOILERThe big twist of course at the end is that Dr. Crowe realizes that he is one of the dead people that Cole can see and talk to. When that hit, it absolutely stunned me. I was not ready for that to be the big plot twist I had heard about. Immediately I think everyone in the theater started to replay the entire movie to make sure it was all possible. And for the most part the screenplay was solid enough that it was possible, especially with the seemingly thrown away line of, "dead people only see what they want to see". It's a line that by itself didn't mean anything, but once Crowe realized he was dead, it all came rushing back. But here's my question. Did Crowe not interact with a single person in this movie? When he was at the hospital, did he not talk to one of the doctors? Did he never try and talk to Cole's mother? Wouldn't he have thought at least that people were ignoring him? There's a scene that starts off by showing Dr. Crowe and Cole's mother sitting in chairs facing each other in her living room. In walks Cole, and Dr. Crowe starts talking to him. What was going on prior to the scene beginning? How did Dr, Crowe get into the home? I know in the movie Cole said that dead people don't think they're dead, but you would think that when one of them tried to talk to a living person they'd realize something was up. Somehow I don't buy the dead people only see what they want to see line covering up the fact that Crowe didn't talk to a single person throughout the film. But otherwise the ending was a very good surprise and completely changed my opinion of the film. So go see it. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was absolutely no surprise at the end that Willis was a ghost; when he slammed the window of his wife/ex-wife's jewelry store (and she saw no one there) you could put two and two together and understand what was going on (based on what happened at the begining.) If `Ghost' had not been released, do you think M. Night Shamaylan (sp - who cares?) would have thought of the idea to make this movie? Now, I'll give credit, although the plot is extremely imitative, the performances were first rate. There was little music. The pace was slow, that added a lot of apprehension. It was easy to be drawn into the movie. It was entertaining. But that's it. Nothing special, nothing new. See `Stir of Echoes' ? although not that original, infinitely scarier, less predictable, and better written.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense had quite a lot of hype before it was released in 1999. The hype was very well deserved.When I watched this film in early 2000, it was the first film in a while that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. When young Cole Sear (excellently payed by Haley Joel Osmont)starts seeing the spirits of dead people it really gets at your nerves and as the mystery unravels throughout the film it get's more and more eerie.Those who haven't seen the film have probably heard that it has a twist ending but I won't spoil it for you. Let's just say that the mystery isn't that hard to figure out if you watch carefully but it still scares you at the end.This was,in my opinion, Bruce Willis's best role in years and he really did a good job. The Sixth Sense is brilliant and far better than that overrated and totally rubbish Blair Witch Project (also from 1999).I strongly recommend this movie-let me warn you though that if you watch it alone be prepared for a sleepless night.</fullReview>

Fear to me in a film, is subtly creeping up and greeting you like an acquaintance would. Utter brilliance in writing casting &amp; delivering us a mane stander! Its nailed on the nose in this film, no ?spooks' the dead look real ?boy do they ever, each one with a fervor and voice all of there own. HELP? I saw this film alone, at dusk, and I was terrified to go to the bathroom. I can't recall a film that has ever done that to me since, Shining.Beautifully crafted (thoughtful) camera angles (See Unbreakable also), seamless integration of the dead and living, I really didn't know the good doctor was in the grips of Rigor mortis till the very end. Set design right down to the miniscule looked totally believable. I cant think of anyone who hassent seen this film yet, but if you have not add it to you're collection ?its always worth a second look. Two thumbs two toes and my hair all standing up on this one.

This was his best dramatic performance since the brilliant and underrated In Country.Haley Joel Osment, what can I say? except to say that he is only going to keep growing in his future roles and I think it's a sure thing that he's going to be successful in front of and behind the camera - like Ron Howard.Olivia Williams gave a stunning performance as Anna and brought so much emotion and pain to her role it was heartbreaking watching her on screen as that sense came out so much on screen that your heart broke everytime you saw her.Toni Collette's chemistry with Haley Joel Osment was magic and this film is a definite must see and seeing all the behind the scenes on the DVD it makes you wonder how you could have missed something when it was so obvious on screen, and seeing how it was done and portrayed you think how did I miss that?</fullReview>

Bruce Willis - with his wooden expression - surprisingly fits the bill too.I think everyone who likes a classic whodunit should definitely enjoy this one.

		<shortDescription>A film about alienation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though marketed as a horror film, this is really a moving drama about alienation. The boy is a disturbed child who's unnatural abilities have caused him to be ostrasized by his peers. The child psychiatrist is also disturbed; a confrontation with a former patient of his has left him feeling guilty and has put his marriage on the rocks. Both characters will seek redemption through each other.I responded very strongly to this film. Anyone who has ever felt alienated from society will identify with Cole Sear and Malcom Crowe as I did. Director Shyamalan creates a creepy and melancholy atmosphere and sustains it for the whole of the film.A word about the famous "twist" ending. It would urge people not to give it away in their comments even after inserting a SPOILERS warning. The film is highly dependent on viewers not knowing the ending. I saw this film on the first weekend that it was released when I didn't even know there was going to be a twist ending. I was completely blown away by it and felt a chill going across my body that lasted several days.Also worth seeing; Shyamalan's underrated followup Unbreakable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fantastic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie! The Sixth Sense features everything that an excellent movie should feature--great acting, writing, directing, and cinematography. Actually, the cinematography was so good, that I actually didn't catch most of it until future viewings of the movie. Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis were both stunning. I was especially impressed with Haley Joel Osment, because he is so young, and so believable.The Good: The plot is incredible. To me, The Sixth Sense has one of the best plots. The writer did a fine job as well as the director. The plot is so disturbing, original, and twisted. It's great. Like I said before, the cinematography is among the best. The Sixth Sense is jammed with hints and clues as how the movie will end, but most people never realize they're seeing them. To me, that's what makes a fantastic movie. Another thing I noticed about this film is that it had great music. The music played a very large role in the way the overall production looked. The music is actually what scared me the most. This movie was good in every way.The Bad: I seriously can not find one bad thing about this movie. There are no holes in the plot and no bad acting. You could really tell the director made every part of the movie as detailed as possible with no loose ends.Overall: 10/10 I cannot say enough about this movie--SEE IT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There were many great movies in 1999 (The Green Mile, American Beauty, The Matrix, etc) but "Sense" is at the top of that list. The film is thought provoking and houses great performances by Bruce, Haley, and Toni as well. The score of the film goes perfectly with the mood of the movie and makes the end truly great. The twist at the end makes the viewer think and want to watch it again to look for clues. M. Night Shyamalan's subtle way of directing is perfect for the film and holds suspense. The first time I watched this movie I was expecting just another horror film, but instead got an intelligent, well put together piece of film making.</fullReview>

A Philadelphia child psychiatrist probes a disturbed child, who may lead him to a discovery of his own. It reaches its audience with intelligence and thoughtful, explicit dialogue, not manipulation. We find ourselves brought in by the deft hand of the director, who culls the best out of his actors.Bruce Willis has really turned in a wonderful performance here, as has Haley Joel Osment.

It is classified as a "SUSPENSE" movie, which in my dictionary means something that is not LIKELY to happen but could and is meant to have some scary moments now and then, but keeps you on your seat and may give you nightmares. But, it is my favorite ghost movie because they took time on it and you could piece together everything that leads to the shocking end. (Maybe not shocking to some, but it sure surprised me).

		<shortDescription>DID COLE KNOW?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSome reviewers seem to think the movie makes no sense becuase of the relationship between the young boy and Willis's character. If the boy knew Willis was a ghost, then why did he not show the same concern as when he saw other ghosts. If he did not know, then why did he never mention to his mother that he was receiving some sort of ad hoc therapy.The answer is of course that the boy CAME TO KNOW that Willis was a ghost. The first meeting between the two was in a church - the one place where the boy thought he was safe. If he thought Willis was a ghost, then we would have freaked out to buggery in the church - and he did not.By the end of the film, the boy is giving Willis advice on how to be happy - ie, talk to your wife while she's asleep. This always seemed like odd advice, and would only make sense if Wilis was ghost. This leads me to believe that the boy came to be aware slowly that Wilis was as ghost.In the latter part of the film, Wilis advises the boy that the ghosts want help, and the boy tries to help them. The boy becomes aware that Willis has some unresolved issues with his widow, and tries to help him resolve these issues - ie talk to your wife while she's asleep. Willis and the boy help each other to come to terms with their issues. It's a real, albeit unusual, partnership. Willis really wanted to be able to make up for not solving the problems of the character who killed him very early in the film. In helping the boy, he made up for this short coming, and least in his own mind. Clearly, the boy was able to come to terms with his 6th sense.Any way, it was a good film, marred only by the fact that alot of people seem to have been able to guess Willis's ghosthood early. But if you're gunna tell a tale like this, and make it have any consistency and honesty at all, then this was always gunna happen. The makers of the movie were quite clever. If you did not guess Willis's ghosthood early in the film, then you've really got to see the film at least twice - or at least that's how I felt. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people have liked the ending and found it quite surprising but if you look closer and see how this twist was achieved I think you'll agree with me that the movie cheated: for example, does osment (the kid) know that willis is dead? If yes, then why when he sees the other ghosts they act zombie-like ,their wound are visible and he clearly afraid of them but none of this applies to willis? If not , then there have been quite an AMAZING coincedences that prevented us from finding out the truth before the end: how come osment didn't mention to his mother that he is being treated by a shrink? It was very lucky osment didnt try to talk to willis when they were riding on hte bus, or to say hello to willis when entering his house and finding willis sitting nearhis mother. there are more unrelated coincedences: like willis' wife taking her hand right when he tries to touch her etc.in order for the ending to work . some pretty amazing coincedences should have happened. which quite frankly, weakens its effect , ,and for me, nullify it completely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't remember the last time a movie was so overrated. I didn't see THE SIXTH SENSE in the theater, but I finally had to rent it just so people would stop telling me, "You have to see it. It's an incredible movie." Well, one thing is incredible: that it was such a huge hit. The performances by Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment, while good and passable, weren't as "outstanding" as everyone said they were. Really, I thought the best acting in the entire movie was by Toni Collette, who played Osment's mom and did a terrific job. The film itself had some nice atmosphere and a decent score by James Newton Howard (far from his best, though), but that was about it. The "surprise" ending is telegraphed right from the opening scene. I knew the moment that scene ended what the "shock ending" would be, and I wasn't a bit surprised to see I was correct. If you want a good ghost story movie, you're better off renting the similar (but highly-superior) STIR OF ECHOES.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, worth watching, but overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good film. I'd recommend it to any movie fan as a worthwhile way to spend a couple hours. Some of the scenes between Willis' character and the boy are touching. Like everyone else I was caught off-guard by the twist ending.But does this movie deserve to be anywhere near the top 50 all-time as the voters on this site have rated it? Nuh-uh. As nice a thriller as this is, it's got too much of the "Hollywood" feel to it, and the twist-ending becomes gimmicky after a first viewing. We already KNOW what's going to happen, so we'd better darn well find out what other merits this movie brings. (After a first viewing, I thought it was neat but I didn't see what all the hype was about. After a second viewing, to see what I may have missed, I still don't get it.) And I just don't see what this movie has that is going to give it staying-power. Will it stand out in 20 years the way that _The Shining_ still stands out today? Don't think so.Of all the movies to get the Best Picture Oscar nomination in 1999, this is the least impressive of the bunch. Surely there were plenty of other movies that year that will outlast this one in terms of lasting contribution to cinema.8 out of 10 for a first-time viewing, and a loss of a point for each viewing after that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing this film back in '99 made me a Shyamalan fan for life. For me it features excellent performances from everyone involved, but especially from Bruce Willis(discovering real acting) and Haley Joel Osment ( one of the best actors in Hollywood). The lighting, colouring and beautiful soundtrack give it a creepy yet sensitive tone. But Shyamalan's direction is what above all deserves credit; he gave it a slow, ponderous pacing rarely seen in a time when many mainstream films come across like pop videos (see The Matrix, Charlie's Angels etc.) The screenplay is truly touching, making The Sixth Sense much more than a mere ghost story. .... oh and the twist's pretty good too...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan's sixth sense!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan (who was born in India and whose real name is Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan begins his career with the making of two minor films: Praying with Anger (1992) and Wide Awake (1998). In spite of its seemingly low-quality structure, these two films have a certain rank of importance, as they were to announce Shyamalan's third film: "The sixth sense". Considerably, this new film has had some influence from its predecessors. Unlike the first two films, "The sixth sense" becomes an instant hit all around the world AND Shyamalan's breakthrough in the film industry. But the success of this film is not just because of the appearance of famous actor Bruce Willis; who was given a leading role. There is so much more going on.For example, the directing of the film. Shyamalan uses the same, remarkable technique Hitchcock came up with 50 years ago. They both manage to let the camera create the sinister atmosphere ... which is of such importance in a thriller. The cinematography of this extraordinary film is absolutely perfect. Although Hitchcock may be a more impressive director, Shyamalan's camera positioning is still quite exceptional.Besides the directing of Shyamalan, "The sixth sense" also provides beautiful acting performances. Bruce Willis gives his best performance ever. His acting has improved by the years. Toni Collette may not be a well-known actress, but her performance as the mother of this special kid is touching. But the greatest acting comes from the smallest actor. At the age of 11, Haley Joel Osment stuns the world with what appears to be one of the greatest performances ever by a kid.But a good film is more than a great director and great actors. It also implies an original story and that is exactly what "The sixth sense" is all about. Notice also how Shyamalan uses spiritual elements in his films. This film and the one before ('Wide Awake': a story in which a child is searching for God after his grandfather died) were both mystical and religious."The sixth sense" is, without doubt, an exceptional thriller and his next film 'Unbreakable' is to prove to the world that he can do it all over again; that it wasn't just beginner's luck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cant say that Im an absolute Bruce Willis fan. In fact, I find his roles before this film one-dimensional: many explosions, uncounted bullets flying around and an ever-winning, untouchable hero .... boring. However, this time Ive been surprised. He did a great job, its just, the kid was even better. Id say, you love this film or hate it; its hard to stay unimpressed (in good or in bad). The finale is not entirely predictable, so it leaves you taste of something unfinished, and yet .... Plot is depressing, but the end...... fabulous. Id like to see more such roles from Bruce Willis. Hes got the stuff to become a first class character actor; if he lets action aside. From my point of view, highest recommendations. Its even better the second time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>10/10!!!!Through the double doors and past the crowds of teenagers on a Friday Night I was trembling. I had just finished seeing `The Sixth Sense' for the first time. This movie, this genius work of cinema, had shaken my `senses' and opened my eyes into a new world of films.Brainwashed by cheesy action and sci-fi films, I had never seen such a melancholy but in some way joyous movie such as this. Everything was perfect. The creepy morbid sounds of the violins in the opening credits made me feel as though some life force was creeping behind my chair. The brilliant story line, dialogue and acting as well as cinematography and original score made this film into a masterpiece.The story line was amazing. This little boy Cole (Haley Joel Osment), an outcast, was tormented by something bizarre and out of this world. Only one person can help him, a child therapist Dr. Malcolm Crow (Bruce Willis). The dialogue and acting couldn't have been better. My favorite scene is where Osment and Willis are playing a game so that Willis can get to know Osment better. Willis pretends to read Osment's mind so he will step forward towards a chair. `You've never been in any real trouble,' says Willis. Osment takes a step back. `We had to draw a picture, anything we wanted,' says Osment. `I drew a man, getting hurt in the neck by another man with a screw driver.' Willis shocked replies `did you see that on TV Cole?' `They had a meeting, mama started crying, I don't draw like that any more,' replies Osment. `How do you draw,' questions Willis. `Kids playing, dogs running, rainbows.' `They don't have meetings about rainbows,' replies Osment. Just the fact that a kid of that age could deliver dialogue like that with such power made me realize how wonderful the acting and dialogue was in this film. Toni Collette also gave an outstanding performance as a Philadelphia mother. I was shocked to hear her English accent when she was at the Oscars because she was so believable as Cole's mother. To be frank I think this is one of the best movies ever made. The two things that really got to me were Haley Joel Osment's acting and the original score composed by James Newton Howard. Many people have argued that the movie relies on its ending to make it a good movie. I was pulled into the movie from the very beginning and I would still have a strong feeling about this movie even if it didn't have such a shocking ending.I am happy that a psychological thriller was nominated for best picture at the Oscars and that Haley Joel Osment was nominated for best supporting actor. Most people thought that American Beauty was a better movie but even though I liked American Beauty, I thought `The Sixth Sense' was a better movie. If you haven't seen this film you must!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Something that seems to pass unnoticed by all of our so-called Critics, is that M. Night Shyamalan makes remarkably subtle films. This is, ostensibly, a horror film. There is a very restrained sense of violence and gore, although both are present. No one seems to notice that people in all three of his films *whisper* their lines... no one shouts in this Night. (Sorry, couldn't resist.)There is always a sense of place in his films. We see a world that is not Hollywood, nor New York. This is a place he has been, and knows intimately. A rare and wonderful thing in itself. The film's pace is deliberate, a Shyamalan hallmark. He lets the story tell itself, at its own pace and in its own style. Rare and wonderful are terms that come to mind, over and again, with each of his films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A psychological/supernatural thriller that delivers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't care what anyone says, this film is NOT a horror!! It's a thriller, and it lends itself more to the psychological and supernatural than anything else!Haley Joel Osment's line - "I see dead People" will go down in history with lines such as "I'll be back" and "You talkin' to me?". This line also sums up the film.M. Night Shyamalan's big screen debut is tense, scary, and very clever -perhaps a little bit too clever?!!With Osment, the casting couldn't have been better. With Willis, you feel he has finally found a director who knows what he is truly capable of. They both give great performance's in this film.******PLOT SPOILERS******When I first saw this film I was scared witless. I also knew there was a twist. My mates said, that I could either figure it out in the first 5 minutes, or I'd have to wait until the climax. Well, when I went in I totally forgot about the twist and settled into the film's unique pace. When the twist came........my God I was crying my eyes out!!!! It was sooo heartbreaking!!!! That one line from Olivia Williams "Why did you leave me?" was perfectly delivered and as Bruce's character Dr. Crowe realises the shocking truth, so do we, and we are left reeling!!!!But, when you really think about it, or watch it for a second time, you begin to see the major plot holes. So he's been dead this whole time? Does he eat? Does he do his shopping? has he not spoken to ANYONE since he's been dead? Why has he noticed his blood stained shirt NOW? there are a lot of questions one could ask that could destroy the whole film. But, I don't hold that against it, for the simple reason that the director has constructed a tight paced film, with a few genuine shocks, and no matter how weak the twist seems after we dissect it, it's still a good one, and I still cry!!! That's a sign of good acting, good manipulation, and a great score.This is a film that is intelligent and knows what it wants to be. The director is also known now for his surprise shock ending's (Unbreakable anyone). If he can keep throwing us off the scent, AND show us the truth at the same time, then that is a good sign that this director knows what he's doing.Thumbs up for 9/10Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like a fool i was suckered by all the hyp surrounding this movie when it was released,but the reality was very different. I have always regarded Bruce Willis as a 4th rate actor whose only ability was to look good in a dirty string vest,and "Sixth Sense" did nothing to alter that opinion,although perhaps it was because he was"nt wearing the vest this time! [Was that a Spoiler?] The plot can be summed up thus "psychologist investigates disturbed kid who sees ghosts" and once you know that, all you have to look forward to is the much vaunted ENDING. Suffice to say i saw the twist 20 minutes before it came and for friends this varied between 10 and 30 minutes! As usual Willis is so wooden i mistook him for a piece of furniture and although Osment is good for his age,this is no reason to shell out hard earned money to watch this drivel. Maybe in "Sixth Sense 2" they could give Willis a string vest and a bazooka?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A flawless masterpiece, that can not be faulted when viewing over and over. A film that shocks and surprises at the same time, and delivers emotional performances from both Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis. Osment is such a brilliant young actor, and I think Bruce Willis has found his best role to date. But if you are watching this film for the first time, be amazed at the shocking twist at the end of the film! I rate this film 10/10, and I suggest watching Stir Of Echoes with Kevin Bacon, as that film deals with similar events.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shyamalan's 'The Sixth Sense' (1999) was nominated for 6 Academy Awards including a nod for best picture. It lost to another great, 'American Beauty', however the two are similarly watchable and boast fine performances from a majority of the principle cast.Cole Sears (Haley Joel Osment - brilliant) is a loner-child who has the ability to see 'dead people'. He tells no-one his secret, not even his Mum (wonderfully played by Toni Collette), until he meets child psychologist Malcolm (Bruce Willis in his best role yet). The two form a trusting relationship and gradually, Cole's horrifying secret/problem is revealed... both orally and visually.Excellent performances, storyline, direction and a hauntingly splendid score make M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Sixth Sense' a must-see. 10/10AAN: best picture, director, screenplay, supporting actor (Haley Joel Osment), supporting actress (Toni Collette), editing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS It's a good enough movie, but the alleged cleverness of the "twist" has been blown out of proportion.Regardless of whether or not you correctly predicted that Bruce Willis' character was a ghost (I did early on), when you think about it, the twist doesn't mean much. Never is a particularly great deal made of why nobody notices Bruce Willis' presence. Never does the fact that he is shot early in the film have any strong effect on his relationship with Cole. This jumble of clues is never presented as a mystery to be solved, and thus, the little paradigm shift in the last minute doesn't really solve anything, and feels tacked on. No wonder why some people didn't see it coming - because the story's structure never even proposed that such a revelation was at all necessary. At least in "The Usual Suspects", the final twist actually answered a question that was posed throughout the entire film. At least in "Fight Club", the revelation near the end gave the movie its meaning.Okay, so Dr. Crowe's a dead guy. So what?Here, Shyamalan's just playing for shock value and lasting impressions. Though when I look at the other comments posted here, I'd have to admit he did that quite successfully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE SIXTH SENSE (1999) Rating: 10/10Man, I love supernatural Horror flicks. And it's finally great to see one that's so well-written, directed, and acted like this one. What's even more incredible about this surprisingly excellent movie is that it's much more than a scary movie or a ghost story. It's a touching drama and a riveting psychological thriller about death and its manifestations.Of course, we all know what the plot is about by now, so saying anything more is unforgivable. This is the kind of movie with a bigger-than-life twist that makes you wanna see it again, as it puts everything into perspective the second time around. Not to mention that this film's twist makes absolute sense and doesn't feel like a trick. The Sixth Sense was written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, a 29 year-old native of India, who shows uncanny maturity and skill. His second film presents us with brilliant filmmaking to the service of a real knowledge of life. The characters are complex and interesting, the premise is intriguing and the film's restrained, smooth pace makes it only more moving and powerful. Shyamalan creates incredible atmosphere through the gloomy cinematography from Tak Fujimoto (The Silence of the Lambs) and James Newton Howard's slightly offbeat score.And then there's the top notch performances. Bruce Willis ruled in actionners like Die Hard, but also showed acting range in such daring films as Pulp Fiction and Twelve Monkeys. Here he's calm and somber. Toni Collette was very worthy of her Oscar nomination as the protagonist's mother. She has to get emotional in nearly every scene she's in. She gets me choked up every time I see the final scene she's in. But, there's no question that the film really belongs to young Haley Joel Osment, who gives the most intense and memorable, Oscar-worthy performance I've seen in a while. You never think of him as a cutsy child actor. He plays a tormented kid who's terrified relentlessly by his gift/curse. He might be shaking or crying, but he's still strong and brave if you understand how disturbing it must be to constantly see dead people walking around, unknowingly from the living population. The relevance of its themes, the effectiveness of the direction and the moving performances contribute to make The Sixth Sense an extremely memorable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS MAY BE INVOLVED:I love ghost and haunted house movies even if I end up picking them apart on the level of paranormal fact and reality. This movie was excellent; it's almost a straight faced version of "The Frightners." Both Willis and Osment do wonderful jobs high-lighted by Shyamalan's directions. The ghosts themselves deserve an A-plus for the atmosphere they imbue, but realisticly, sixth sense perception is not that exclusive. Ghosts are not that invisible or that tangible. Some people do have greater sensitivity to them, but on a whole, ghosts can be seen by just about everyone whether they are psychic or not. The only other plot point I see unresolved is while Willis discovers the truth about himself, did Osment know it all along ? Otherwise, this is great movie for believers and unbelievers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark, yet intelligent mise en scene.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS!!! (Though if you don't know the deal with this one you've been living in a cave)Director M. Night Shyamalan knows what scares us. He knows that fear lies in our imagination and that imagination is strongest during childhood. That's why he uses a child to explain to us that the chills we sometimes get and items we misplace have an ominous explanation. He understands why we are scared as we sit around the campfire listening to a good ghost story. He knows that though we may have become more cynical and sure in the world as we grow older, we maintain enough eidetic comprehension to think that there just might be ghosts.Shyamalan also knows how to scare us. He brings verisimilitude to the project by playing on our personal fears. He makes us recall the long walk down a dark hallway to the bathroom when we were children after waking up and having to urinate. He makes us remember the dilemma of trying to hold it versus stirring in the darkness of our room and feeling our way to the door. By using a situation familiar to all and reprising our childhood bogeymen, the discomfort becomes intimate.That's why this movie works from both the over the top foreboding, such as the disturbed Vincent muttering, `Do you know why you're afraid when you're alone? I do.' to the sine qua non subtleties that are handled with empressment. Most notable among the latter is a crafty moment when the father of the poisoned girl watches in horror as the cause of her demise is revealed on video. In the background we see the folded hands of an unknown viewer that nervously pull apart and tug at the clothing near the throat. What a recherch touch!Shyamalan seems to have the knack for knowing when to show us something and when not to so. Not revealing who opened all the drawers and cabinets, leaving the inmate in the attic unseen, and having Cole glance quickly away from a passing graveyard while on the bus add a numinous appeal. Yet he astutely uses visual shocks to keep us on edge and remind us to be scared in a film that is so easy to admire for its visual beauty and detail: angry ghosts quickly stalk by, hanging bodies materialize, ghastly apparitions appear at car windows, all adding up to a mlange of the supernatural incarnate.He treats the terrestrial characters with equal flair. He is particularly adept at using body language to make a point as when we witness the hand of Cole's mother drop exasperated on the dinner table in an expression of anger that is far more emotive than revealing her face. Another satisfying moment is the humorous `jewelry sale' scene where the couple's faces, enclosed in a tight shot, make the most of human countenance, unfortunately leaving the incisive dialogue an afterthought. And while these brilliant physical nuances ingratiate our subconscious the work's efficacy may actually lie in the tour de force of timing and perspective as is demonstrated in the trenchant `step game' tableau. In this scene camera shots break from Cole's footsteps (back and forth) to a commensurate movement to and from Malcom's face. A simple idea? Yes. A powerful image? Yes!Of course many movies can produce scary moments, but the few that do maintain the pace in engaging the audience via character development. It's become hard to commiserate with the quotidian teenage victims in slasher-flicks, but vis-?-vis the dramatis personae assembled here our empathy is easier to reach. Our cynicism is ablated and we care about these people. We understand the special nature of the already-established relationship between Cole and his mother, evinced nicely by the `what did you do today' colloquy in which her fanciful exaggeration is juxtaposed with his sad dreams of just being accepted by his peers. Conversely we also appreciate the glimpse into the developing friendship of Malcom and Cole as their emerging trust is shown as the former's confession of marital neurasthenia melds with the latter's sub rosa revelation, `I see dead people.'Oh and to all those who claim that they could see the ending coming: give it up, we all know better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably one of the best movies i have ever seen. That's for 4 reasons: 1.The acting is superb! Not only Haley Joel Osment gives a terrific performance, but this is the first movie that made me believe Bruce Willis CAN actually act! Toni Colette and Olivia williams also give good performances. 2.The musical score by James Newton Howard is beautiful(I bought the Soundtrack right after seeing the movie). 3.The writer/director (M. Night Shyamalan)gives the movie a kinda creepy, dark taste. Plus:The screenplay is fantastic. 4.And of course... The ending blows your mind! During the whole movie you will be trying to be smarter than the writer, but you won't succeed: After you've finally stopped wondering about what that surprise ending will be, it suddenly appears and all the pieces come together, You'll probably be thinkin': Damn! I could have thought of that before! It would be a crime to give the ending away right now, so i won't.After being nominated for 6 Academy Awards, it's really a SHAME this movie didn't win any Oscars!!! Haley deserved it more than anyone else. And M. Night Shymalan should have won one too, but nooooooo. I know American Beauty was great and it also deserved a few golden statues,but for a movie like The Sixth Sense to be nominated for SIX Academy Awards and not even win ONE?!!!! Come on! But, okay, i have accepted it now. And I think the movie had already got all the attention it needed by then. So, i forgive the Academy Award voters.One thing:If you expect to see 'One of the scariest movie ever made' you'll be kinda disappointed on that point, but you'll still love it!The Sixth Sense is more emotional and psychological. Though a few scenes will give you chills,the movie isn't really frightning. But I don't think the movie was made to scare the hell into you. It was made to surprise you and to bring a message,"and that message has everything to do with COMMUNICATION," as Haley Joel Osment said during an interview, and he's abselutely right. But you'll understand that after seeing it.Just rent this darn good movie, it will be worth the money!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I don't know if my point of view on this film has more to do with the fact that I am not really used to or keen on freaky stuff like this. What I do know is that I was a bit let down by this one. Indeed I admit that maybe I didn't come to get the whole story. I guess that people who are more into this kind of material may have a better understanding than me, but regardless of that I found this movie a bit overhyped. I don't think Bruce Willis is as good actor as people say. I mean he's not bad, but not this good, either.6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies I've ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you who haven't seen this (probably due to living under a rock for the past few years), you might think "Bruce Willis? This isn't a mindless action flick, is it?"Well, nothing could be further from that.Bruce Willis plays Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist who has recently recovered from an attack by a patient he failed to treat. Needless to say, this leaves him unsure about his skills, but his encounter with Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osmont) gives him a chance to jump-start his career.After a period of time trying to get on Cole's good side, Cole reveals his secret to Malcolm: he sees dead people. (Duh.) This changes their relationship dramatically...the patient is now the psychiatrist, treating the recently dead by completing their unfinished business, with help from Dr. Crowe.The final scene is one of the most impressive twists ever shown in a film, ranking right up there with the Statue of Liberty at the end of Planet of the Apes. I'm not going to tell you the twist, but you might have guessed it by then. (The director certainly expected everyone to.)Overall, this is a tour de force with Bruce Willis in the last role you'd expect to see him in, and a shining example of what modern movies should be.Rating: 5 out of 5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It takes a lot for a film to make me feel scared, and to give me chills. It also takes a lot for a film to make me feel like it can happen to me. Sixh Sense, though, was one of the few films that made me have chills. This movie made me wonder if that i was walking down a street, there was a dead person right behind me. It is really scary one. There is moreto this movie, though. It's one of the films that you have to watch over and over again to really get th story. Me, i only had to watch it once to understand it and be creeped out. It takes a lot for a film to do that to me, but the Sixth Sense is an expection. This was one of the best films of 1999. It's a MUST SEE.I give it ***** out of *****.</fullReview>

If you haven't seen this (and if you're on Earth, you must soon), a boy can see people that don't know something about themselves.

		<fullReview>Congrats to Mr. Shyamalan for constructing a cinematic work of art. Not only is the film entertaining, it is also engrossing and extremely intelligent. You can watch the film in two different dimensions. One, which only happens once, is the first time you see the film. Everything up until the end is basically an engrossing, yet somewhat trite thriller. The SECOND time however, your transported into another world basically as if you're watching a different movie than the first. Everything makes sense. The strange way Willis and Williams interact is masterfully explained. Religiously, the film doesn't have many boundaries, either. Uncanny acting, beautiful artistic camera techniques, smart writing, and an unusual, wonderful pace make "The Sixth Sense" a must-see for anybody. Definitely a close second next to American Beauty for 1999. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no big twist at the end of the film; everything you've heard is a lie. Sorry, but if you're constantly hearing that there is this fantastic ending to the movie, you can pretty much guess what it's going to be ? I mean the story is about a boy WHO SEES DEAD PEOPLE. Don't get me wrong it is really well done and even if you do figure it out, like myself (do I win a prize?), you may well forget it throughout most of the movie.Bruce Willis plays child psychologist Malcolm Crow. After being shot (So, he was shot) by a former patient who he has let down professionally, he is desperate to help a young boy, Cole (Haley Joel Osment), who shares similar symptoms and has a habit of seeing dead people (So, the boy sees dead people).The cast is strong throughout, although at times Willis has a misleading and out-of-place sinister expression.The film isn't traumatisingly scary. The scariest moments are largely thanks to the excellent chilling music score.The secret ending, as I said earlier, is very well hidden if you don't know there is one, and maybe even if you do, thanks to brilliant directing from Shyamalan. The scene at the restaurant is wonderfully done, and the crucial draw back after Malcolm being shot at the beginning is perfect.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-made if somewhat predictable ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good production values, subtle visual effects and underplayed acting (particularly from Willis) go to illustrate an unusual approach to the ghost-story genre, though the ending screams predictability - couldn't believe so many people were fooled by this (see THE CRYING GAME if you like unexpected plot twists!). A plethora of inconsistencies gives the game away almost from the outset. Nearly as much of a letdown as JACOB'S LADDER.The film is over-rated as a result, deserving as it did its lack of Oscar success, though it did lead to a semi-revival of the 'spook' picture (e.g. the superior STIR OF ECHOES, THE HAUNTING), for which we should, for the most part, be grateful.For the most effective treatment of the genre, fans of the supernatural should instead try and catch THE WOMAN IN BLACK, now available on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing in every sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit that "American Beauty" deserved the Oscar for Best movie of 1999, but I also have to admit that this movie came in a pretty close second place(all due respect to Michael Caine, but "The Cider House Rules" was not up to the competition). "The Sixth Sense" was almost perfect in every way- starting with the brilliant plot, the chills, the suspense, the acting, the directing, the editing, need I go on? This movie became a classic as soon as it hit the big screen- and in the same year "Fight Club" and "The Matrix" came out. Admit it- anything that becomes competition to those two movies has to be at least brilliant.First off, there are very few movies which leave you as breathless as this one. And it's not only the ending, but the whole thing- starting with the open cupboards in the kitchen and topping it off with that "realization"(don't worry, i'm not going to spoil it for you, but if you haven't seen this one- rush to the video store!). Speaking of spoiling, this is one of the few movies where you can have the shocking finale and still enjoy the movie more than once. Why? Well, simply because it's a multi-layer, highly developed story which becomes better every time you see it. Mr. Shyamalan achieves cinematography that equals the mastery of Hitchcock and the eye of Orson Welles(although Syamalan doesn't live up to these standards in his later "Unbreakable").Anyway you look at it, the camera is moving and you are following every small motion with a sparkling mind and an enticed eye. Very few directors can control you like that.Mentioning "The Sixth Sense", there is no way you can't credit young Mr. Osment. That kid has the skill that some "A" class Hollywood actors lack(let's hope he doesn't end up like "wonder boy" Culkin). Haley Joel Osment is not afraid of the camera and creates an unforgettable character full of fear, need of protection, and most of all- innocence. There is no way you can hate that kid(unlike young Mr.Vader in episode one), you feel compassion for the character and you can put yourself in his place. That's again something very few people can create.There is another person in this movie that deserves immense credit as well. No, it's not Bruce Willis, but rather Ms. Toni Collette. The Australian actress proved she was up to Anjelina Jolie's competition, but the Academy wasn't very keen on giving her the Oscar. Collette creates the image of a truly caring mother, the type of person Susan Sarandon portrays in "Lorenzo's Oil". She begins as a stereotype, but proves to be more than a face in the crowd(quite like Judy Dench in "Shakespeare in Love")and leaves a lasting impression on the viewer.There is much more to be said, but it would take a rather long time and I would hate to be boring. In conclusion, "The Sixth Sense" is one of those movies that take a part of you for two hours and return a completely different thing. You walk out of the theater and you think: "What people am I seeing?"Living, my friend, living, but they seem so different now...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense! What to start with? This movie is certainly one of the supreme masterpieces of all time. This movie tells us the story of a psychologist Dr. Malcom Crowe (Bruce Willis), who is still trying to put behind him a case of a patient he was unable to help, and with whom he had a very weird encounter a year before the main story takes place. Dr. Crowe is now handed a new case of a kid named Cole Sear which is said to have serious problems, not only at home, but also at school, and with his friends, which call him a big time freak. Cole's family background is not the best his father left and he is emotionally blocked by this, his mother is constantly depressed when confronted to her son's regular problems as well as stressed by keeping her two jobs at the same time. As soon as Crowe starts knowing Cole better, he realizes that he his no ordinary child, he has so much more depth that he could ever imagine, also Cole states that he has encounters and that he is surrounded by dead people. Dead people, How? `They are walking around like regular people, they don't know they're dead (?) Please make them leave. ? I'm working on it.' Powerful and emotional dialogues like this one are abundant throughout the entire film as well as huge tension. If you're in for a good horror/ thriller movie, this one is for you. 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It failed to grab me but that doesn't make it a bad movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm one of those "unfortunate beings" who viewed the movie in video a year after its release when its reputation was still strong among movie goers.My philosophy is that a good movie can be enjoyed and appreciated wether it's seen on the big or the small screen.Before handing out the bad notes, I'll give it the credit it deserves for certain aspects. First, both the photography and camera work are superb. Haley Joel Osment plays very well (his talent was confirmed in the recently released "AI"). Willis is also good but, IMO, he didn't seem to fit well in that part of a child psychologist. I'll blame it on the amount of action movies he played in.The plot is undeniably the strongest element of the movie, it is quite effective (although, I think, it would've made a deeper impact on me if I had experienced it in book form). And most of the technical aspects like lighting, editing and even the soundtrack deserve good marks.So, what's wrong with The Sixth Sense??All through the movie, I had the feeling (not sense!) that I was in a Stephen King movie. And ya know: this story of a little kid who sees ghosts that died tragically (but no one ever sees them) and his worried mother wants to help him get through this psychological problem... Doesn't it remind you of another horror movie by the late great Stanley Kubrick??Well I found that annoying. And that's not the only thing.As I wrote above, the plot may be brilliant but its "well oiled" logic is somewhat flawed.[WARNING: IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET, THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS MAY ACT AS SPOILERS!] Not shouting, just warning.1. If I was in a house where my husband or my wife had been murdered before my very eyes, I wouldn't stay in that place for long. I'd quickly put the house for sale, pack up my things and leave! Move on to another place, as far as possible. Wouldn't you?? So why is Anna still holed up in that house six months after Malcolm's death??(Oh yeah, it serves the interest of the story. She has to have a last minute encounter with the ghost of her husband so they can bid farewell to each other.)2. In the story where the little girl is gradually poisoned by her evil stepmother: it's amazing to see how a small child can effectively hide and position the videocam that records the evidence that will later incriminate the murderess. Everything is recorded at the right angle (the girl probably asked her mother to stand on a piece of tape on the floor while she prepared the tainted potion!!) with the prime suspect never ever suspecting anything (she also never cleaned up her daughter's bedroom or if she did, her clever daughter would already have hidden the camera under the covers!!)If you were guilty of murdering your own daughter, would you go ahead and wear a vivid red dress at her funeral while everbody dressed in darker or somber clothing?? (Ah! But the color red serves a purpose here! It's evidence, cleverly planted by Mr. Night Shyamalan himself to cue us in to important things!!) Yeah, sure. Please don't give me that crap that "people with a guilty conscience betray themselves in such manners".If you're ready to believe that, you're ready for anything. Including the fact that it took Crowe six months and the help of a psychic kid to realize that he was only the ghost of himself. (It took Patrick Swayze less than six minutes in Ghost, I guess Willis must be getting old and a little slow!;-)Anyway, I'll stop here. I guess the reason why I didn't enjoy this movie, as much as the majority of people, is because I was distracted and annoyed by all these details.I know some people saw the movie 5 times and even more. I saw it once and it's enough for me.Hope I didn't offend anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great thriller movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the Sixth Sense in a small theater with my friend, and was very surprised at what I saw. This film taught me that a scary movie doesn't have to be gory and extremely violent to be scary. Frankly, I believe that The Sixth Sense is scarier than many other horror films with killers. Haley Joel Osment's performance as Cole was amazing for a child actor, and Bruce Willis' role was also fantastic. I love scary movies, and this particular one comes down as one of the best I've seen. Everything about it is unique and dramatic; the acting, script, and atmosphere were all perfect for the movie's subject.Another aspect of this film that makes it enjoyable is the clues it gives throughout the movie. I love thrillers like this that give various hints about the movie throughout to see if you can figure out the outcome of the next event. The director did a great job of giving out hints that caught the viewer's eye (most of them I didn't catch when I saw it at the theater, but when I rented it and watched it again I could spot some). Many twists are also spread in the movie that lead to the ending (which was a shock, even though I kind of guessed it half way through).Before I saw this movie, I had heard of it and thought it would freak me out. However, it didn't really. Instead, it amazed me. I never imagined that such a genuine film like this could be made. A few moments of the movie did startle me, however, which made it a little more fun. I like this movie more than other horror films because, instead of a gut-wrenching movie to scare and shock you, this one just moves through you, and makes you take into consideration the feelings of the characters instead of watching them all die one by one.Another addition to the movie that makes it genuine is the music. I don't know who composed it, but it was terrific. It came in at the most appropriate and dramatic parts of the movie, where it was needed most. This movie would have been about 30% less scarier if the music wasn't so good.I suggest for anyone to see this film (if they can take some slight shocks). It will amaze you a lot more than scare you. It is simply the best thriller movie I have ever seen, because it concentrates on the feelings of the characters instead of blood and guts.</fullReview>

Many people say that the twist made the movie, and while it was certainly mind blowing, I was completely satisfied with the film even before it came up. Haley Joel Osment is great in the film and really made me care about him, the always underrated Bruce Willis gives an equally good but much different peformance. Unlike almost every film I see I don't think one thing should have been different, Shylahman obviously put alot of time into crafting the film and it shows. Bravo to all involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a brilliant movie with a very original plot and some great actors.The movie is about a this kid,Cole Sear,who is a problemed boy in the way that he claims to see dead people.And Bruce Willies plays a child psychologist who takes interesse in helping the boy. I must say that I was shocked by how good Haley Joel Osment played his role(Cole Sear),he is maybe the best child actor out there and I can promise that he will star in many movies to come. He plays his role in a way that makes you feel really sorry for the boy.The scenes are wonderful filmed and directed. The ending is superb and shocking in the way that you didn't expect it.This is a true thriller with some really scary scenes.All in all this is a wonderful movie that you will never forget. 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For me, the last great horror film of the 20th century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just for my money, the 1999 thriller THE SIXTH SENSE was the last really great horror movie of the 20th century--forget even the much-debated BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.What makes THE SIXTH SENSE so good is writer/director M. Night Shayamalan's decision to take this story in a manner which is totally the antithesis of today's horror films--i.e., no extraneous blood and guts or nudity--and build a spooky atmosphere. The connection between the psychologist (Bruce Willis) and the young boy (Haley Joel Osment) who sees visions of dead people is one of the more honest adult-to-child connections I've ever seen outside of a Steven Spielberg film. And no matter what anyone else says, the first time I saw this film, I did not see the twist ending coming, nor did a lot of other people either their first time around. That coda is perhaps the best sting-in-the-tail ending since the original PLANET OF THE APES; and somehow, I have the feeling that Rod Serling, no slouch with sting-in-the-tail endings he (see "The Twilight Zone" and APES), would have been proud of Shayamalan for it.Elements of CARRIE, THE SHINING, and POLTERGEIST, three great horror films all, are present in THE SIXTH SENSE--and yet, this doesn't feel too terribly derivative. I'd put this movie very close to the aforementioned three movies in the horror film pantheon because of its deeply penetrating story and its psychological scares, which were all honestly earned. In summary, THE SIXTH SENSE is a winner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the 1st movie of M. 'Night" Schyamalan i have seen...and I AM IMPRESSED.The idea is excellent, it keeps you guessing till the end and the ending is excellent.It focuses on many things including dead people. I liked the fact that it focuses very deeply on child problems and how people, in general, treat children with problems. Children have such difficulty in opening up when they believe that the kind of problem they have will make them look like a freak or may cause anxiety to their parents.Its very noble in a way and shows the purity of the heart and deep caring children have for their parents. Haley Osment is a gifted actor who has carried the role superbly. No need to say how Bruce baby did.. he was flawless as always But it must be said that EVERY single performer in this movie was flawless as well because without that, the movie would never have been so enormously intriguing &amp; yet so moving and absorbing.One piece of advice,.. don't leave this movie for even a minute to get some popcorn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The creepiest film in many years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! What an ending. I don't think I've been this moved by a film's conclusion since the frighteningly shocking end of David Fincher's "Seven." Don't worry because I will obviously not ruin this film for anyone, but suffice it to say that the end of this film allows you to see the entire picture from an entirely different point of view the second time around, and that is simply a unique achievement. In fact, I was more than willing to see this film many more times, just so that I could see it unravel within that other realm. Another thing that stood out for me with this picture was the fact that unlike its trailer, which sells this film as a chilling thriller, this movie is actually more of a supernatural drama with plenty of tear-jerking scenes to boot. And yes, I crumbled under the emotional drainage of the film's players, especially with Toni Collette in a few choice scenes. I would rather compare it to elements of "The Omen" and "Ghost," rather than any thrill-seekers ride, though it has it's share of creepy, terrifying moments.In fact, the film is deliberately paced very slowly, with plenty of time given to the performers to grapple with the powerful material at hand. Haley Joel Osment does an excellent job as the confused young child who is going through things that no child should ever go through, and even Bruce Willis pulls off an impressive steady performance, without a single "yipee-kaya" in the whole script. But once again, allow me reiterate how much the twist ending of this film allowed it to catapult onto another level. Even after the film's credits had long been done rolling, I could not help but discuss the many different parts of the plot that were altered through this amazing ending, and could not help but further my appreciation for this film. Great acting, great style, great score, an instant classic ending, and certainly worthy of being called one of my favorite films. And despite it not being an all-out thriller, believe me when I say that you will be startled in a few scenes, and certainly touched in others. Giant kudos go out to the writer/director of this film, M. Night Shyamalan, for pulling off a very impressive film presentation.By the way, if this film interests you in the least, make sure that you see it before someone ruins the ending for you, because it truly is one to digest firsthand.Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I enjoyed watching the film, there are a few things I don't quite understand. First off, how can Bruce Willis go through a whole year without realising his wife has spoken to him in that time? Secondly, how did Bruce Willis know about Cole? Where did he get the notes on Cole from? Another dead shrink maybe. Lastly, if the spirits of the dead remained on Earth to help people, then what about the poor dead buggers in the school. Who can they help? Well, I guess the imagination can invent it's own answers.Apart from that, this film is more logical than most horrors. The directing is good, the soundtrack (borrowed from the Shining of course) is superb and three main character give off fine performances. I give it 7/10</fullReview>

She gave me the plot line of that story, we watched the movie, and of course, as the plot was lifted from the story, the movie held no surprises for us. That's not to say it isn't a good movie.

		<shortDescription>Definitely Watch This At Least Twice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find this a very difficult movie to review, because everything in it is so tied to the surprise ending that to say anything at all about the story is virtually to give everything away. Believe me, though, that you have to watch this twice to really appreciate it. The first time I watched it I found certain elements of the story to be so confusing that they were distracting. I also noticed a number of plot inconsistencies that bothered me. In the light of the movie's ending, most of it makes sense (although a few plot inconsistencies are actually created by the ending.) In any event, I found "the Sixth Sense" to be far more enjoyable the second time than the first. Without giving the whole thing away, what can I say about this?The performances are very strong. Bruce Willis is excellent as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, the child psychologist seeking to help young Cole Sear with his visions of dead people. Sear, of course, was played by Haley Joel Osment. Osment put on an astonishingly good performance, and was well deserving of the Oscar he won as Best Supporting Actor. Also offering a strong performance in a supporting role was Toni Collette, who played Cole's mother Lynn, struggling to make sense of Cole's behaviour. On the down side, I found much of the dialogue in the movie was offered in rather hushed tones which sometimes made it difficult to follow what was happening. That, however, is a relatively minor criticism. I would rate this movie as an 8/10 without any hesitation at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One told me the brilliant ending and I guess this was what ruined the movie for me at first sight. It was good but not as brilliant as everyone said. But I wasn't sure about my opinion on this film. It needed at least one more view. And now I recognized the craft that is behind this movie. Brilliant timing, brilliant story, brilliant acting. And it was only now that this film really scared me. And it gets more with every viewing. Ten more times and I will end up with a heart attack.This film doesn't need any gore. In fact you see only a glimpse of what Cole has to suffer his whole life, hour for hour. And believe me, it's enough. M. Night Shyamalan takes about an hour to introduce the characters to us. And he does it very effective and carefully. We learn about Cole's fears. A nine year old child, spending his whole life hiding from ghosts, not able to overcome his fear to tell anyone. We learn about Cole's mom who is tired of not knowing why her son shudders, why he is haggard at times. We learn about Dr. Crowe's troubles to create a equalization between his private- and working life after getting shot by a former patient whom he couldn't help. The reason why he wants to help Cole so badly. This takes about a third of the film. But isn't boring a minute. Who isn't touched by the way Tony Collete and Haley Joel Osmont share a scene is definitely in the wrong film and should go see any Dolph Lundgren film of his choice.It's amazing how well this film does in every aspect of filmmaking that even this is scary. Everything, the script, the cinematography, the sound, the music, the directing, the acting. It all builds a whole. A brilliant one.A classic up there with Braveheart.</fullReview>

Haley Joel Osment is a great young actor, who we will probably hear about more in the future. The movie's plot twist at the end is sensational and totally unexpected. Best plot twist I have seen in ages! This movie deals with supernatural fears, just like the Exocist. Unlike the horror slasher movies, this movie keeps one intellectually intrigued. I also like the fact that it was filmed in Philadelphia(my hometown). For once, Philly is getting some screen time besides New York, Los Angeles or Seattle.

It's not a great film, it's good, but just not great.There are too many plot problems which make the picture wobble on its feet. The problem lies in the script, it really required more thought, because I think 75% of it works, but the 25% really hurts it.The performances are superb, the kid is excellent as is Bruce Willis.This is a film which could've been a masterpiece, but the screenplay lets it down.

		<fullReview>To be honest, given some of the work that Bruce Willis has done in the past, I wasn't at all interested in seeing this film after watching the various trailers. In fact, I wasn't even one of the people in line at the video store the first Tuesday it was available. Even more surprising, I didn't see this movie until it was available on video for almost two months! It wasn't until many friends told me I absolutely had to see it that I caved in and rented it. Seeing this film again just last week brought back a lot of memories with the second viewing, and I felt that I should add my two cents (six cents?) into the mix here.This film has one of the best story lines of any film released in 1999. Perhaps the best thing about it is that it isn't a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. It maintains a series of highs and lows, and then works up into a crescendo for the surprise ending. You will think you have it figured out up until the last 15 minutes or so, and then what you expected to happen doesn't, and the experience becomes something else entirely. I thought I had this film pegged... many of my friends had told me to be ready for the surprise ending... and my mouth hit the floor when it became painfully obvious what this movie was all about.Having related what I thought about the story, I'll move on to the acting and more technical aspects of this film. First off, let me say that Bruce Willis simply shines in this movie. As the grounding force in this film, he does an excellent job, perhaps not seen since his work in Twelve Monkeys or Pulp Fiction, in my humble opinion. Usually known for his work in action films, he reminds us here yet again that he can be just as good in more dramatic and complex roles.The award for "stealing the show" in this film must go to Haley Joel Osment, who had not done much of anything notable up until being cast in this film. I'm surprised that nobody else has used the talent this little guy has to its fullest potential. This is probably the movie that will be known as the one that made his career. Recently he turned down the opportunity to appear in the sequel to this film, and rightfully so. I doubt if he could repeat the performance he turned out in this film, that's how excellent his acting was the first time around. In all, I'm sure he made the correct decision, and has chosen to go on to bigger and better things, if that's possible. At any rate, his facial expressions and simple innocence add credibility to the story in ways you cannot imagine. He's unable to cope with the supernatural events in his life, until being helped through them by Willis, who plays his role as a child psychologist almost to the letter.Toni Collette is superb in her role as Cole's (Osment's) mother. I had never seen Collette in anything before this, and I was very impressed. It always amazes me how a director/casting agent can take a cast of (almost) unknowns and put them together in a film where they click and create a movie that leaves a lasting impression on the viewer. In a role where she plays a woman who is nothing if not extremely pained by the problems her son deals with on a daily basis, problems which he refuses to talk to her about, she does a beautiful job. She is a very beautiful lady, and I can't wait to see her in more dramatic roles.While not generally scary, there are some slightly gory scenes, and some which create a feeling of terror deep within the pit of your stomach. Of course, the use of the musical score within the film adds to the tension. I felt as though I was watching something I shouldn't be at some points in the film, and I'm sure you can relate, or will be able to when you finally see it.If you haven't seen this movie, go rent it. Make sure you watch it on a Friday or Saturday night, and late. This will give you enough time to digest the film over the rest of the weekend, before heading back into the week on Monday. If possible, watch it Friday night and again on Saturday night, just to pick up on what you may have missed. After watching it once, knowing the ending will help you make note of a lot more the second time around.Watch for director M. Night Shyamalan in a cameo role as Dr. Hill, who examines Cole after his experience at the birthday party. I must admit, I didn't see him the first time around.My rating: 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to get nitpicky, you can find logical flaws in "Alien." But even the most fervent picker of nits would still get frightened and shocked in Alien's cafeteria scene. Hitchcock's "The Birds" has a ridiculous premise, if you stop to think about it -- but when you saw the blackbirds gathering on the jungle gym, I'm sure you felt fear and foreboding. Well, I won't give you the laundry list, but "The Sixth Sense" has its story faults as well.But that doesn't change the fact that this is a brilliant film. Night invents a new language of film, using the color red. The trick ending caught me by surprise, I didn't see it coming. But even if that part of the movie had never been written in, the movie still bats 1.000. The scary parts are even scarier because they're underplayed. I also loved the very human stories of the boy Cole, his mother Lynn, and his counselor Malcolm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is what all horror movies should be -- thrilling and suspenseful, without the gore and scantily clad babes that generally define the genre. Bruce Willis turns in one of his finest performances as a psychologist helping a young boy who believes he can see ghosts. If you like Hitchcock, you'll like this film.

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Even though the main part of the Sixth Sense is a nicely crafted ghost story, I felt that the ending destroys everything. Why so? Well, if Cole is afraid of those 'dead people' that he can see, then why is he not afraid of Crowe? Those who missed this very obvious plothole can count themselves lucky. Because if you can see any logic in that fact, the Sixth Sense should be very entertaining to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A GREAT movie in spite of the holes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film when my wife rented it. I loved it enough to buy the DVD version with production footage added. It was these that tainted the film for me as I will explain in a minute. Please... DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM!! The movie was superbly acted by both Willis and Osment (Cole). The plot had great potential, but the story flow was flawed. The characters were inconsistent both before and after Dr. Crowe's getting shot: Crowe gets an award from the Mayor for his work with emotionally disturbed youths, and he wants to hang the award "in the bathroom." (Duh!) OK, OK, he was drunk from celebrating, but c'mon! Crowe was a professional. The vulgar side of his character was inappropriate at best. ("Cheese d---"???) He gets shot by a patient he failed, and his wife never calls 911! Instead of running to the phone, she runs to him looking for blood. After finding it, she just lies there with him, crying. Not realistic. The mother of the dead girl near the end wears a RED dress(?!) to the funeral? (This was supposed to be a hint to us that she had a brush with the next world.) It was a blind and no-brainer hint. NONE of the uses of red were clear enough for us see that hinting was even going on! BUT... believe it or not, I am going to close with both my thumbs UP. In spite of the holes, this was one of the best films I have ever seen and I am glad I own. I will happily watch it again and again, holes and all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shallower than it looks, and some irritating slips, but still well worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My big problem with this film is the ending. No, not *that* ending (everybody knows this is a film with a twist, though I certainly mean to respect the tradition of not revealing it for the sake of first-time viewers). It's the gooey, feelgood sentimentality of it. What possessed Shyamalan, who's written a literate, well-paced, thoughtful and heartfelt screenplay, to tack on this gloopy, over-optimistic, neatly resolved conclusion for the young hero Cole? Very disappointing. I also think it was a bad mistake to cut the originally-shot final scene (available as an extra on DVD and at least one VHS release), which rounds out all the sequences we see on video - left feeling rather redundant in the final cut - and provides a more emotionally complex ending. Maybe one day he'll see the error of his ways (and the studio will see an opportunity for more big bucks) and issue a revised Director's Cut restoring his superior first thoughts.Those are the reservations, which I put first because this film was praised rather beyond its real merits by a somewhat hysterical community of reviewers delighted to find signs of intelligent life in blockbuster film-making. Make no mistake, this IS an intelligent, finely-crafted, almost fully satisfying film, developing a premise that has to be one of the best ideas in modern cinema. (There are some minor slips in consistency, however much the film makers may pretend otherwise.) Its biggest attractions are the beautiful cinematography, and Haley Joel Osment in the difficult central role; he's a real actor, a bit of a prodigy really, and gives a strikingly mature performance. Bruce Willis rightly plays second fiddle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary, but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the risk of sounding corny, the Sixth Sense is one of the spookiest movies I have seen for a long time. It aren't disembodied, knife wielding teenage slashers that scare me - Scream (1,2,3), I Know What You Did Last Summer (1,2), or even Michael Myers or Jason or Freddy back in the day left me cold. The Sixth Sense succeeds, because it mainly (not exclusively) uses eerieness, isolation and a bone deep sense of loneliness as it's main tools. Also, it asks: how do we really know we're alive? The acting is first rate, from Toni Colette as Cole's mom and Haley Joel Osment as Cole, the acting is very natural, believable. There's not a bad performance in it. Also, Donnie Wahlberg was totally unrecognizable.The plot twist at the end, is made even more intrigueing, because it makes you doubt who else, other than Willis, is in the same position. Cole? Cole's mom? However, this doesn't work because of inconsistencies throughout the movie, which is a pity, as the movie would have been even scarier because of it (I hope this is cryptic enough).</fullReview>

Night Shyamalan.Mr Shyamalan is becoming one of the top directors in Hollywood.There are some great actors in this movie.Bruce Willis is good as always but it's Haley Joel Osment who steals the show.He does a brilliant role work as the kid who sees ghosts.This 12 year old child genius had his big screen debut on Forrest Gump (1994) with the Oscar winner Tom Hanks.Haley himself was nominated for an Oscar last year but it was Michael Caine who got it.Haley should have won it.There are lots of spooky parts in this movie that keep you scared to the very end.There's a surprising twist in the end.Surprising for those who don't know what it is yet.I recommend The Sixth Sense for everybody.I guarantee you can't sleep after this movie without checking under the bed first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***************************SPOILERS************************************* IF YOU ARE READING THIS TO DESCIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO SEE THE MOVIE AND HAVE SOMEHOW NOT HEARD SPOILER DETAILS ALREADY THEN READ NO FURTHER. THIS MOVIE IS DESTROYED FAR MORE THAN MOST BY SUCH INFORMATION AND IT IS CONTAINED IN THIS REVIEW.All talk was about this movie by the movie watchers and anyone else who had ssen it and there is alot to talk about, it is possibly one of the best first-time experiences, but repeated viewings I believe really wear it thin.I will never know if I could have predicted the ending because it was destroyed for me weeks before I used the cinema entrance. The movie is definitely not run of the mill, more than standard quality but it is clear to see plot faults and severe borrowings in it.Have you ever thought about the idea of a modern day ghost walking around and not realising they were dead, what if Patrick Swayze had gone on longer after he had pursued the bad guy not realising he was dead, or the idea of a person being able to see them like Woopi Goldberg could hear them, how freaked out would you be growing up with that. These are some pretty good "the drive home after the movies" discussions. How could Bruce Willis have gone on after the first night without realising it. Think about the living complications we all experience every day, things we take for granted. Where was he when his body was taken away in an ambulance, or better still at the funeral. And his employers, when they heard about his death how would he have got the file he was reading when he first saw the kid, he must have been issued it.They light-speeded over the "they only see what they want to" didn't they, so if he moves around objects that dont really exist or are'nt really moving like the pen and paper as he was analysing the kid, or the tape recorder, where does the line get drawn, it was an extremely general statement, and if nobody else can see or here the ghosts then how the hell did he get a tape recording of the voice of the guy who didn't want to die, it was a great emotional and shock device but a major implausability in actual screenwriting. The second time I saw this at the movies a few of the holes surfaced to my vision, the third, on video they were as clear as daylight, and the fourth has certified me.And Cole spent half an hour talking to absolutely nobody while his mother was a dozen feet away in another room, why exactly would she say "you've got 5 minutes" to Cole, we were meant to assume at the time that she was talking to Bruce but when the ending comes it just falsifies that part. And when Bruce Willis threw that rock at the jewelry store window, everybody stared, in ghost they had fun with that sort of thing but with the conjured up spirit world in this it once again is a major glitch for it. How could they have seen something that was not there.I actually think the director thought the movie was too dull at final cut and shot the new ending for interests sake, so it is either bad writing or bad editing.Production Values 2/2, Acting 2/2, Screenplay 0.5/2, Quality and Meaning 0.5/2, Originality, 1.5/26.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M.Night Shyamalan is a genius.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen &lt;Cider House Rules&gt;, but I already know that Michael Cane didn't deserve Haley Joel Osment's Oscar...oh, well, the Academy probably felt bad for him or whatever because this was his first... Anyway, although Haley Joel Osment is absolutely amazing in this film, I'd like to say that it's really the writer/director who represented his character who deserves the *real* credit. I say this because I wasn't in a rush to see Osment's next film, &lt;Pay It Forward&gt;. I'm not into long, drawn-out movies, and I can definitely say this one is drawn out. But drawn-out movies that happen to be great ALWAYS work even better the second time around. Seeing it for the second time made me smile more, cry(twice!), and even get scared more easily. I'm sure it's already been mentioned here, but the "ghost" scenes are hauntingly real-looking, as opposed to a film loaded with CGI where I could imagine myself admiring the physical attributes of a ghost rather than being terrified by it. The fact that children are used makes it freaky as well.*********SLIGHT SPOILER ***************I love how after Osment's character gives the video to the deceased girl's father, how 1) what was on that video was completely unexpected and spine-chilling and 2)how the boy leaves without getting involved. He figures he did something he needed to do and that was that, feeling more and more as though this was his destiny.*********END SPOILER!***********I also think it is great how Shyamalan made Osment's character a real little boy. This is refreshing; he is neither one of those smart-ass brat kids who always seem to be used to steal the spotlight from their on-screen parents, nor the pole opposite, a mentally-handicapped, loud and obnoxious kid who are used for cheap comic relief, with extremely bad acting skills and stage presence. While the above norms for child characters run rampant in Hollywood scripts, not so in Shyam.'s. For example I liked &lt;American Beauty&gt; a lot, but hated Janie's character for its type-cast 'spoiled teen angst-driven'ness..(Why did she have to wear black *and* feel spiritually "black" as well? Overkill...not realistic, believe me, I'm 21 and I know teens don't act this rude to their parents for no reason) I also liked &lt;Traffic&gt; but didn't understand why they had to make the daughter's character such a stupid, snotty bitch, the way she spoke to her parents, etc. But Haley's refreshing, *and* he manages to steal the show from Bruce. Bruce's acting was good here, one part I especially liked, but not for the same reason everyone else did was the part where he tells Bruce that................*************SPOILER! SPOILER! SPOILER!******************..............he sees dead people. The first time you're watching it of course you won't realize......but the second time....watch how when Malcolm asks the boy about the ghosts, and the boy answers "They don't know they're dead, they only see what they wanna see", watch Malcolm's eyes as these lines are said. From knowing that he was dead all along, it's amazing to look back and see that his eyes are that of a ghost whose eyes are glazed over in disbelief because he "only sees what" he "wants to see".*************END SPOILER ********************* Another thing I find brilliant about Shyamalan's script is that he twists the story one way to lead you to believe it is going in one direction, then BAM!, we are pleasantly twisted in an entirely different direction. For example, the tape Malcolm plays of his old student makes you believe he discovered something that will ultimately end the movie, but no.............! This is one of the most psychologically scary movies I've ever seen, and it also works one of the most heart-warming dramas ever because every character is given a respective role in the film, and in turn every character is sympathetic and good to each other. It also has a pleasant ending for a girl who would've gotten about a zillion nightmares from this film had it stayed scary throughout!-Sep</fullReview>

The ending made it interesting, plausible and yet, I've seen better endings with similar scenarios...showing my age, I would recommend an oldie..."Woman in the Window" with Edward G. Robinson. In those days, when such a movie was advertised, there would be notices in the newspapers and on the screen,."Please do not reveal the ending" and spoil it for those who hadn't seen yet. WITW, had better acting all around. BTW, with TCM and AMC, it can easily be seen again...but it is vital that you see it from the beginning, or you would miss the point of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film came in with a hype that, in the first glance, made me cautious. But, after reading some trusted critics I decided to go on despite the hype. Well, it paid off. And something more. It was an experience that had little to do with my previous experience - and notice that I have watched a lot of movies the last 20 years. A brilliant script, supported by excellent performances by all the leading actors, a atmospheric, intelligent direction, great cinematography - everything was in tact. And it worked out in the best possible way. Actually it is hard to tell something new in the thriller genre. All the subjects - ghosts, serial killers, vampires, zombies and all the other horror-concepts - have been overfilmed so much, that only a film in a decade makes it to immortality. In my humble opinion, for the nineties the place is taken. By the sixth sense. Plus a few words about the actors: Bruce Willis carries his difficult - esoteristic and emotional in the same time - part with the ease of a great actor. His second great performance after "12 monkeys". Even if he stands in the shadow of little H.J.Osmont, you can recognize great acting. Haley Joel Osmont is quite a change - pleasant - after all those underaged "I know everything I look so cool I am an adult in a child's body" so called "movie stars". Congrats go to the director, who managed to take the best out of the kid. Pretty impressive was also Tony Collete as the kids mother. As a bottom line, to be honest, this film is worth every second you spend on watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nice SFX shame about the film. Nuff said. For all you guys/gals out there with an attention span of more that 15 seconds, let me first say that Sixth Sense achieve what the directory originally intended - to add a remotely intelligent 'twist' at the end for all those who struggle to concentrate and watch a full 2 hr film. I don't necessary dislike the film that much - it's not too bad actually - it's just that when I keep hearing (or should I say reading) those pathetic reviews saying 'Oh this is such an amazing film' 'I've never seem anything like this since Lethal Weapon III' it just makes me sick. For Hollywood, it just doesn't get any better than this, does it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it was over I had to see some scenes again. I couldn't believe I'd missed all of the clues...And this film had my attention, so I thought. This is an excellent screenplay... I'm looking forward to see his next motion picture 'Unbreakable' also with Mr Willis, he is finding his way now, I would like to say to his die hard (just in the meaning of the expression) fans, I understand why you love this actor...Excellent directing...Take your time when the film has ended, because it isn't over when the final end has come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing 'The Sixth Sense' for the first time is an unbelievable experience, but watching it for the second time is equally good. That is probably the greatest thing about the film: it is one that you can come back to, and appreciate just as much as the time before because of it's original concept. Haley Joel Osment will never give a better performance as he did in this film, despite his remarkably young age. The film by writer/director M. Night Shyamalan simply would not have worked if it wasn't for Osment's stunning performance. Bruce Willis, one of Hollywood's greatest actors gave a breathtaking performance, yet was still acted off the screen by the promising young actor. In gloomy Philadelphia, Shyamalan manages to bring across the fear and sheer horror that the film suggests with seamless ease and realism. He is sure to become one of the best Hollywood actors of his time if he continues to produce films as moving and technically brilliant as this. It should not be classified into a specific genre of film, but should be recognised as a film that combines the horror and the thriller genres to perfect effect. Shot with such originality and care, this is a film that everyone simply must see. Acted with such brilliance and scored so perfectly, 'The Sixth Sense' is a modern classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an unmistakably good film. I'm really not familiar with anybad reviews (although I am sure there are some) but I have readpeople's comments attacking the premise. They say, I don't buy it,how could he not have known he was dead? This is why:"They don't see each other. They only see what they want to see.They don't know they're dead." This line is M. Night Shaymalan's justification for any 'plot holes'that anyone might have found in the film. Obviously people haveignored this line in their criticisms because it eliminates allpossible 'plot holes' one might find. So, there you go. Just wantedto clear things up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this movie, having seen all the hype surrounding it. Sadly, I was a little disappointed.As many of you have already commented...the story plodded along for so long, I kept waiting and waiting for a little excitement. As for the "surprise" ending...I saw it coming a mile away. In fact, as soon as the screen said "next fall" my SO asked me... "so he lived right?" As soon as he asked that, well... enough to say that nothing was a surprise after that.Just like everybody else, I think the kid did a great job. Kudos to him. Bruce Willis' part was a bit of a throw away. I would have really loved to see Ridley Scott do this film. He would have really put a lot more punch into it. There was a lot of potential there that was wasted.Also, I have to say, this is not a FEEL GOOD movie at all. I was soooooooo depressed after seeing it. I had to put on "Deep Blue Sea" just for a few laughs. Glad I only paid 99 cents to rent it.Donsgal</fullReview>

That was an excelent movie and excellent acting and I dont mean excellent acting for a kid I mean for anyone. I saw cyder house rules and didn't think Caine did anything above the ordinary as far as acting goes. Anyway what I'm saying is the sixth sense in my opinion was the best movie of the year and had some of the best acting of the year. At the part he was talking about the little hairs standing up on the back of your neck the little hairs on the back of my neck stood up I loved it! I gave it a 9 out of 10 i took the 1 of because as much as i like what the tried to do with the plot twist it did leave a few holes in the plot those who saw it should know what I mean by that. Wow good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan's Sixth Sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan (whose real name is Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan, by the way) begins his career with the making of two minor films: Praying with Anger (1992) and Wide Awake (1998). In spite of its seemingly low-quality structure, these two films have a certain rank of importance, as they were to announce Shyamalan's third film: "The sixth sense". Considerably, this new film has had some influence from its predecessors. Unlike the first two films, "The sixth sense" becomes an instant hit all around the world AND Shyamalan's breakthrough in the film industry. But the success of this film is not just due to the appearance of famous actor Bruce Willis. There is so much more going on.For example, the directing of the film. Shyamalan uses the same, remarkable technique Hitchcock came up with 50 years ago. They both manage to let the camera create the sinister atmosphere ... which is of such importance in a thriller. The cinematography of this extraordinary film is absolutely perfect. Although Hitchcock is, beyond anyone's doubt, a far more impressive director, Shyamalan's camera positioning is still quite exceptional.But besides the directing of Shyamalan, "The sixth sense" also provides beautiful acting performances. Bruce Willis gives his best performance ever. His acting has improved by the years. Toni Collette may not be a well-known actress, but her performance as the mother of this special kid is wonderful. She might even be better than Bruce Willis. But the greatest performance comes from the smallest actor. At the age of 11, Haley Joel Osment stuns the world with what might be the greatest acting performance ever by a kid. He acts so naturally that, if I wouldn't know any better, I'd think he'd already been in a situation like this before. He should have had an Academy Award for his realistic performance in this fantastic mystery-thriller. After all, this is a much more difficult film to understand for a kid than `Home Alone' or `Beethoven' where the characters are so meaningless that any kid could have done them.But a good film is more than a great director and great actors. It also implies an original story and that is exactly what "The sixth sense" is all about. Notice also how Shyamalan uses spiritual elements in his films. Both this film and the one before (`Wide Awake': a story in which a child is searching for God after his grandfather died) were mystical and religious. I didn't see the film `Wide Awake', but I'm pretty sure it's not so different from the ones that were (and still are) to follow."The sixth sense" was the breakthrough-hit for Shyamalan (who was born in India, by the way) and his next film `Unbreakable' is to prove to the world that he can do it all over again; that it wasn't just beginner's luck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I see an interesting plot with a very poor script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why? Why? Please tell me why people enjoy long, boring movies that must have a high budget in order for it to be good. Also, I've noticed that all of the films with the "hottest" celebrities in it, are garbage. The Sixth Sense is proof. I waited until the movie came out on video to see it, so that I could try to understand the movie at my own pace. The nonstop showing of the "I see dead people" trailer forced me to watch it. I waited and waited for that part in the movie where Haley Joel Osment's character finally confesses that he in fact, does see dead people. The part came and went and I was left sitting there thinking, "that was what all of the hype was about?"This film could have been a success (in my opinion) if they would have rewritten most of the movie and eliminated Bruce Willis's character. One of the reasons this film was so popular was because the part of Malcolm Crowe was played by the always talented and big-named Bruce Willis. His part in the making of this was about as useless as the huge budget it had. (I'll talk about that later.) Whenever a movie is released with a big time actor, it's safe to say that the movie will become a hit. Haley Joel Osment was terrific, so why not pair him up with a lesser-known actor. Don't get me wrong, Willis is truly talented, but anybody could have played that role and it wouldn't have made a difference. The characters and actors were good with the exception of....Bruce. Osment shined in his role as Cole Sear. His talent was the only good think about this film. I was very impressed with him, and I think that it would have been hard to find any other young boy to play that part the way he did. For the role he was given, Willis did a fine job as usual. Not a lot of effort was put into it though. A little more could have come from the psychologist's part.Lets talk about the budget. Considering that it was $55 million plus, I would have liked to have seen a little more effects. Nothing ruins a movie more than an overload of special effects. Worse, when they're not even necessary. This movie didn't even come close to having enough. I'm trying to think where exactly in the movie were these heavy duty illusions, and I can't remember. Anyway, that amount of money put into a movie where it could've just as easily been made without any ghostly effects, was a ridiculous waste of money.The plot and intentions of this film were good, but it was down right boring. I was on the verge of falling asleep, but I was so anxious to find out what happened at the end, so I forced myself to stay awake. I read the summary of the film, and it sounded really good. Maybe it was the long scenes that were stretched to the limit so that they could build the story up to the climax. Or, maybe it was the pointless and unnecessary writing that was included in this ludicrous script. Either way, I thought that it was one of the most overrated and silliest films I have ever seen. Once again, the movie might have had a chance if it cut down on the way too long scenes between Malcolm and Cole. ~*spoiler~*What am I leaving out? The ending! The ending was quite a shock, but it left a ton of questions unanswered. We discover that Malcolm is a ghost, but there are too many problems for this to be semi-realistic. It would have been a lot easier for Cole to realize that he's such a whiz with ghostly activities, and think just what if my friend, Mr. Crowe is also a ghost? A little far fetched and I'm getting off track, but the ending that should have been a major high point to the story, was ruined by its lack of creativity and was a total disappointment. Everybody loved this movie for reasons that are beyond me. From now on I think that I'm going to stick with low budget movies and simple plots. And that also have some interesting and exciting parts in it. "I see dead people" was one of the dumbest lines ever created, but it was made into a masterpiece. I have no idea why.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Multilayered Masterpiece (*SPOILER*)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the best crafted movie since the great Hitchcock left the scene, though I might argue it is superior even to the master in that respect. Haley Joel gives what has to be the best performance ever by a child actor, maybe even for an actor period, and Bruce Willis is a great enough actor to get himself out of the way enough to allow the boy's brilliance to show through. There is one aspect of this movie, however, that I have yet to see anyone comment on and which to me makes this movie an even more remarkable achievement. In Buddhism (OK, I admit it, I'm a Buddhist, a monk even), the mind is considered to be the sixth sense, along with the usual five. When viewed from this perspective, how Dr. Crowe creates his own reality in his mind, it becomes quite a different film experience. Obviously many of those who have commented on or reviewed this film have no idea of what ghosts really are, i.e., minds that cannot accept the reality of their own demise and remain trapped on the physical plane until they are released (in this case by an act of restitution for perceived past failures). And no, Dr. Crowe doesn't really interact with anyone other than the boy, not if you really pay attention. He just appears to (red herrings). Also I want to add that Tak Fujimoto is a marvelous cinematographer. I've never seen a movie where I was so totally grabbed from the very first frame, the bare light bulb slowly turning on. Ditto for the music.</fullReview>

C'mon you see him interacting with other characters throughout the whole movie. When he's at the apartment (and I get into this argument a lot) YES he is acknowledge that he is there by the mother. She mentions a "30 minute session." And if he was dead how did he get that kids file? He was looking at it in the beginning so someone must've contacted him. It's like they pulled this ending right out of their ***. This movie has more holes than swiss cheese and even more deceiving than the Blair Witch Project was to people. They could be the same movie actually, both were overhyped, both let me down. But at least Blair Witch project actually had some scary moments.I give this movie thumbs down.</fullReview>

I feel sorry for the people who didn't figure it out or went into this movie with expectations (which no one should ever do.) A lot of cutting went into this one,a lot of it good, some of it malicious! But the movie deserves the praise given it. It's obvious that it's a one trick pony, but it's good one!!!! (Oh yeah, my best friend's gonna kick me in the head!)It should be throughly enjoyed since there's so much good stuff (the writing, the music, the acting, the direction and whatever else.) Today, it's seems I'm bashing editors! If you watch the DVD, look at the alternative ending and think "Who in their right mind would trade this ending for the one given!!!!!!!!!!!"

		<shortDescription>NOT one of the best 30 of all time *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As of the time I am writing this the average rating for Sixth Sense puts it at #28 on the database. I believe anyone who gave this any higher rating than 7 must have only seen it once. This film cheats you into believing something, and at the end you are left with a revelation of sorts that keeps you thinking for hours after you've seen it. I wondered to myself for hours exactly how I had been fooled into thinking Bruce Willis' character, Dr. Crowe was really alive throughout the film. The next day I decided to see it again, and this time I realized how so many people had been fooled into this "revelation." There are a couple scenes that deliberatley set the tone for Dr. Crowe's daily life in between meeting w/the kid. When he is "late" for his anniversary dinner with his wife, we see Dr. Crowe make eye contact with her, she appears to look up at him angrily, sigh loudly and then walk out of the restaurant. In another scene when Dr. Crowe comes over to the kid's house, his mother appears to be knowingly setting up a meeting between the two. She says something to the nature of "it's only a 30 minute session." My point is that although this was a beautifully crafted film, just about anything involving Tak Fujimoto will be, there is a major flaw in the deliberate attempt to misguide the audience. If you have only seen this film once, watch it again for this reason, just try to pick out the times Dr. Crowe is made out to be a normal functioning person. The big "suprise" end will be coming from a mile away the second time. Most great films get better with continued viewing, but this one just gets stale. Overall I give it a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Implicit Ghost Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bruce Willis is in one of his most mature roles of his career as Dr. Malcolm Crowe. M.Night Shyamalan shows some promise as one of the first great horror filmmakers of the 21th Century. It came around the same time as the Blair Witch Project(1999) and in my opinion is a better film. Its more effective at utilizing the psychological aspects of implicit and suggestive horror. This was the second film that Bruce Willis played a doctor who suffers a traumatic experience at the start of the film(the other feature was The Color of Night{1994}). Haley Joel Osment gives the most convincing performance of a young kid since Heather O'Rourke talked to the TV people in Poltergeist(1982). The Sixth Sense is like a puzzle box that needs to be viewed more then once. The color red plays a major importance in the roles of the ghosts. Olivia Williams is lovely as the sad Mrs. Crowe. The Sixth Sense(1999) has the most surprising ending that I've have seen since the unmasking of the mysterious villain in The Usual Suspects(1995).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like that - but ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very difficult to write a good review about "The Sixth Sense" without letting out the ending. To those who haven't seen the film yet: The whole film would be meaningless with any other ending. It was made only because of the ending. Every single scene, every shot exists for no other reason than to give a hint or to prepare the very last scene. The consequence of this is that the film seems very artificial to me; it couldn't be more constructed. Shyamalan shows us exactly as many scenes as possible. Other scenes we expect we do not see because they would tell us too much about the solution.I admit I'm fond of these stories where at the end you sit there with an open mouth, speechless and then you think about the film again and again and you find answers to thousands of questions you didn't ask. My favourite film is "The Shawshank Redemption" because it has the most brilliant point since "The Planet of the Apes". But there they didn't need any talking dead people to tell a gripping story.I mean, this was a nice little movie with an interesting atmosphere, some exceptional actors (I don't mean Willis, I mean Osment and Collette) and a little bit of black humour. But I don't agree with the Oscar nomination for Best Picture and with the hymns of praises "The Sixth Sense" got.And now watch the movie and then read my review again and you'll understand what I mean.</fullReview>

The central premise intrigues, but the twist ending is inadequately set up and plagiarised from Herk Harvey's 1962 film 'Carnival of Souls'; a laconic Willis seems content for the most part to sit back and look as bored as I was by about 45 minutes in. Trite Hollywood fodder laughably described by some as a Masterwork; there are numerous directors with infinitely more talent who could do with this kind of recognition.1 1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this doesnt mean that this movie is the best ever. it just means that i like it the most. this movie got the magic of making you think and think. it deserve the six nominations for sure. and haley deserved to win. his acting cant be described by words. you can even like him more if you see pay it forward. u can see how talented this actor is.the acting in this movie was of a top class. everyone did an amazing job. even bruce willis, which for many, isnt a good actor. he wasnt incredibly good, but he did what he could do. toni collet was excellent, she was so convincing in her role as cole's mother, she deserved her oscar nod. haley.... as i said, words cant describe this kid. he is among my favorite actors with jack nicholson, kevin spacey, and others, although he is just 12. M Night Shaymalan is awesome, he surly deserved the nomination, i not really a big fan of american beauty, so i think the directing in the sixth sense was better. night did a great job, i think he got a great talent, and i cant wait to see unbreakable(his new upcoming movie).what makes me love this movie more than any other movie, is that it got more heart than any movie. it is a must see for everyone. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a brillant movie which deserved all the praise that it got. The story is about a boy who keeps seeing ghosts. So he goes and see a child psychologist. In this he seems to be confront his fear of these ghosts and seem to live a normal live at the end. But this is not another soppy dramatic "live all happily together" movie. Instead this movie is full of scares and spooks, but it is not this that amazes the viewers. Instead it is the ending which completely catches people off guard. The ending is like a "Usual Suspects" type of ending, thinking that it is going somewhere, but instead it takes a sharp turn. This is probably a breath of fresh air for Bruce Willis, who is remembered for his action movies. But the real gem in this movie is Haley Joel Osment who plays the child who sees ghosts. Absolutely amazing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>too fake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers warning!!! Ok. I saw this movie a few months ago, but it's now on t.v. so I thought I would leave a comment about it. When I first saw the movie, I didn't figure it out. the whole surprise that is, until the end. I have to admit, it's tricky that way...but besides that, the movie overall is fake, too fake to enjoy! I mean, come on...it takes Bruce this long to find out what's going on? How does he get into Cole's apartment and all with his mom if she can't see him??? You're trying to tell me he doesn't talk to one person in the entire movie besides Cole, and he never realizes anything is going on?? I just want to know how he get's into places if no one lets him in. Does he let himself in and sit with the mother, thinking she seems him the whole time? No way. The story had too many holes in it this way...you cannot end the movie and say to yourself, 'oh yea, that could happen.' I don't know which was made first, but Stir Of Echoes was released first, and this movie seems to be a rip off of it. If this one was written first, then I guess Stir of Echoes is a better version of the same type of movie. The acting is good, tho Bruce Willis isn't what you would call the best actor ever, the kid in the movie--who everyone rant and raves about is a good actor, but his character--oh man, you just want to kick him in the head he's so annoying.  I'd give the movie 5/10, it's somewhat enjoyable, but the plot holes are too constant to make you actually believe any of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie took my breath away!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching "The Sixth Sense," and I thought it was one of the best movies (scary or otherwise) I had ever seen. The thing that makes this movie work as a genuinely creepy movie is that it's plausible. It's not scary in a blood-curdling-scream kind of way; it's more psychological, and it's more likely to make you lie awake at night and wonder if this might happen to you. After you see "The Sixth Sense," compare it to a traditional horror movie, such as "A Nightmare on Elm Street". Which movie's plot and characters seem more believable?The ending is fantastic, and it came as a complete shock to me. The clues to the ending are laid out in the movie, but you will probably only recognize them in hindsight. This is a great Halloween movie, but it's a great psychological thriller for any time of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most horror movies try to scare you with heads and hands being chopped off, after that has been done 60 or 70 times it becomes stale and boring, the Sixth Sense brings a new and fresh twist, this is by far one of the two or three scariest movies ever made. As a person who has had dreams about death that came true and has had my grandmother come and visit me after her death I related to this movie 100%. The Sixth Sense gives you clues about Bruce Willis during the movie but you are to busy centering on the boy to pay attention. To all the people that did not like Sixth Sense why do you even go to the movie if you cant be happy, I am so tired of people bashing good movies, our world today is so based on being negative.</fullReview>

And when you see it for the second time you recognize that the director has take a deeper look to Hitchcock and Kubrick. But OK, it works! So the director has learned his lessons well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Year after year I go to horror films and get tired of seeing the same blood and gore slasher films. "The Sixth Sense" is a welcome relief. Here is a horror film that builds it's scares on a chilling atmeshphere. Simple images like when Cole see's dead people being hanged and only he can see work alot better then some slasher hacking teens to bits. The film takes it's time to tell the story. People who say they were bored have absolutlly no patience whatsoever. They want instant gratification. This film is proof when you have a good script, good actors and a great director horror films can be scary, insightful, and moving. I like how Malcom asks Cole what he thinks the ghosts want. So many ghost movies have ignored this question. Why would ghosts go to all that trouble to make themselves visible? We never explore their point of view until now. Bruce Willis gives the best perfomance of his carear. He makes Malcom a flawed human being who is beggining to experience failure for the first time. But the film belongs to Harvey Joel. His role requires actual acting, not being cute for the camera. If we don't feel sympathy for Cole then the whole film wouldn't work. Osmand more then holds his own. He gives alot of his performance in a hushed whisper. This shows he is utterly terrified of a gift he dosen't understand. The ending is one of the most shocking and unexpected I have ever seen. I absolutlly did not see it coming. Years later crap movies like I know what you did last summer and scream will inspire laughter, The Sixth Sense will inspire chills.</fullReview>

I know this is sounding like a Budweiser Light 'Contradictions' advert but I really felt like I hadn't really watched a full-length film just a short. This isn't a scary movie, ok I did jump once but it isn't even as scary as the Blair Witch Project (which, lets face it, wasn't that scary at all!) The film is better if you know absolutely nothing about the film not even what the kid can do so don't read the synopsis just watch it! Everyone is acting on best form, even Bruce but especially the kid, they all deserve an Oscar (well ok then maybe just a Golden Globe) And yes, the twist is as good as everyone says it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a super hot monday afternoon when my best friend and I curled up on her couch and watched "The Sixth Sense" on her computer DVD. I had wanted to see this movie because I adore Bruce Willis and I wanted to see how he performed in this movie. I am an actress, and like watching how other actors (and actresses) handle their rolls and lines. I walked away from this movie wanting to be a film director. Why? Because it was the director who made this film incredible! Now, don't get me wrong! Haley Joel Osment was OUTSTANDING!! I want to see him in more lead rolls more often! A kid with that much talent should be around more! Bruce was AWESOME, as always! But the director should win an award. The red factor... notice the red things in lots of scenes? (the boy has on a red sweater at the party,the red anti-depressant pills, and so on...) Also, the way everything is set up so Bruce doesn't have to move or do anything in public.... and the ending! Well, I had known the ending when I watched this movie, but still, it was incredible!!.. I am in love with this movie, in love I am!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The meaning of supernatural thriller is completely re-written by M. Night Shyamalan with the stunningly encompassing Sixth Sense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan returns to directing for his second effort after the disappointing Wide Awake, which he directed for release in 1998. His second film, The Sixth Sense, was a staggering success that rocketed Shyamalan to the very top of the filmmaking world. Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist who takes on the excessively challenging task of helping young Cole Sear (played with amazing skill by Haley Joel Osment), a boy who is cursed with the ability to see dead people. Complicating the plot is the fact that Malcolm once had a young boy as a patient with the same problem, and he was unable to help him, and he is now afraid that the same thing will happen with Cole. Every individual scene in The Sixth Sense is saturated with cinematic trickery, giving even the liveliest settings, a birthday party for example, a strikingly eerie feel. Because of that, even though the film is not non-stop relentless thrills and scares, it never lets the audience relax, which is one of the main things that make it such a good movie. Besides that, not only does the film avoid excessive gore and tasteless violence, it also provides the perfect premise for presenting the small amount of gore that it does contain. Cole is able to see people who are dead, and naturally he sees them as they look when they died. This provides for some seriously scary moments, such as when he is using the bathroom in the middle of the night and the woman walks by the doorway. Very simple, but coupled with the startling sound effects at that moment, this is one of the scariest scenes seen in movies in recent years.The Sixth Sense had a incredibly imaginative and original story, and it was presented with great skill. It has a certain quality that very few movies of this type have. Most movies try to keep the audience guessing (Wild Things), but in The Sixth Sense, the audience doesn't even know that something is amiss. Before the breathtaking plot twist, the ending is not even considered as a possibility. However, once the ending is realized, a number of questions begin to arise. (spoiler) How could Malcolm have lived for so long as a dead person without noticing anything strange? Wouldn't it seem strange to him that no one was able to see him since that one night when he got shot by his former patient? He couldn't possibly interact with anyone in the world of the living. And even if he could, why didn't his fiancee acknowledge him at the restaurant? I mean, assuming that he doesn't know he's dead. Questions like this are usually inevitable with a movie like The Sixth Sense, and I think that they could have been answered if the film would have gone into how it's possible for these people not to know that they are dead, even though the back of their head is blown out, or half of the skin on their face has been burned off. Do they just perceive everything as being normal? I don't know, but either way, despite trivial shortcomings like this, The Sixth Sense is a groundbreaking supernatural thriller, and you see something new in it every time you watch it. That's a rare quality that not many movies have. Don't miss this one.</fullReview>

I'd like to think that if American Beauty had not been made this film would have snagged the Oscar.Of course, the best part of Sixth Sense is the ending, which I hope stays a secret forever. Public revealing of the ending would be worse than genocide, in my opinion. The movie is great the second time around, especially when you're with newcomers, because it's SO obvious to you and you can't believe they don't get it. What an amazing feeling it is when you finally get the ending, it's indescribable. Better than "Rosebud," better than "Luke, I am your father," better than Keyser Soze. You get my drift.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, The Sixth Sense is by far one of the best movies of 1999, in the same class with Fight Club. I have waited a very long time for a movie like this to scare me, and the wait was well worth it. Bruce Willis is excellent as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a distinguished child psychologist haunted by the painful memory of a disturbed young patient he was unable to help. Willis has had some serious dramatic roles in his long career, but none this extreme. Whoever said `Never work with kids or animals' was right in this case. As great as Willis was in The Sixth Sense, 10 year old Haley Joel Osment stole the show with his riveting performance as Cole Sear, a frightened, confused eight year old with a similar condition as the young boy Willis was ultimately unable to help; the ability to `see dead people.' M. Night Shyamalan hit the big time in only his second time behind the camera. Never before has a director been able to portray the type of fear and surprise on camera that I felt when watching The Sixth Sense, and I know that everyone who watched it feels the same. This is one of those movies where the director challenges the audience to `figure out' the ending before it gives it away, and since it is like that, everyone will be on the edge of their seats trying to guess what will happen next. I will admit, and I wasn't alone, I never figured it out, and even after the movie was over and for the next few days, I was periodically saying, out loud, `That's why that happened' and `Oh, now I get it.' This is exactly the reason The Sixth Sense gets a perfect 10 stars from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Haley Joel Osment is truly a boy wonder. His acting really made you feel scared, on top of all the scary visual scenes. I've only known a few kids that young who can pull off a movie role that required a class of acting not many adults can achieve, and to do it so well. Kudos, kid. You'll go far.Bruce Willis wasn't really the actor I had in mind for his role as a psychiatrist. I thought someone like Harrison Ford might be better. Nevertheless, Willis did put in a commendable performance, and because the movie was so riveting you hardly noticed his woodenness sometimes.Although this movie does not have spooks jumping out at you for shock effects, it still manages to put a kind of fear in you that cannot be described. The ghosts weren't really scary, but the setting for them to appear and the music that accompanied it, (and of course Osment's acting) made them something not feared in the normal sense, but feared cos no one wants to experience it at all. Then ending is superb, and I just hope no one spoils it for you cos it's just brilliant.</fullReview>

While it isn't very original, (It is almost the same as Carnival of Souls) it does creep up on you and give you chills, then in the second half it gives you some unexpected shocks.

She is compelling and believable, and richly deserved her oscar nomination. My only complaint is that it copied Carnival of Souls, one of my all time favorites, and people didn't notice.Still, it is one of the best of '99 and has the best plot twist of all time right up there with The Usual Suspects and Psycho. 8.5/10</fullReview>

You must see this movie without knowing anything about it to get the most impact. Then you will absolutely want to see it again.

		<fullReview>I saw this movie months after it had first come out in the US, and surprisingly nobody told me the end: I'm glad they didn't, because this has been the one movie which has kept me at the edge of my seat during the whole time. Bruce Willis does an excellent job in acting, but my applause definitely goes to young Haley Joel Osment.I have now seen the movie about ten times, and even though I know how it is going to end, it still manages to give me goosebumps.

		<shortDescription>Destined to be a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that needs to be seen more than once. In fact, after the first viewing, the movie almost compels one to see it again. And, with each screening, it gets better. The storyline is fabulous -- it is well developed, and the characters are well played. To say that there are twists and turns would be to understate the artistic qualities that make the movie such a hit.At first, the role played by Bruce Willis seems so out of character with his usual persona on screen. But, he is wonderful as Dr. Malcomb Crowe who struggles through the movie, wondering if he could have done more with those he is called to help. Toni Collette, as the mother of young Cole (played by Haley Joel Osment) was nominated for an Academy award. But, Olivia Williams' portrayal of Crowe's wife is the real award winning performance. She plays a woman torn between the work of her award winning husband, and her own life.The building relationship between Bruce Willis' character and that of Haley Joel Osment is well executed. Willis wants to help, then realizes he may not be helping, but then he stays on to help the young man confront and deal with his "secret."This film is on a par with the best Hitchcock classics. M. Night Shyamalan has a gift as a writer and director, and he excelled in this film. As a cinemagraphic work of art, the film is superior. The camera angles and the outstanding use of lighting should be required study for future films. The dialogue is mature, and the storyline is thought provoking. The subtle nuances in the script and props are compelling. The special effects are at times a little gruesome, if not morbid. But then, what do you expect from a film where a little boy sees dead people.For those looking to add to their home video collection, this is a "must have."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie ... but</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think M. Night Shyamalan made a very good movie with his creation and direction of 'The Sixth Sense' but it could have been better. It was like a masterpiece painting but you can't put a mustache on a Mona Lisa and expect it to work ... other's may still find her attractive but I'd be at least mildly turned off.If this movie is viewed from front to back and immediately forgotten all is well and you will feel you've gotten your money's worth, but if you think back you will find many logic holes in the premise. The movies' "rules" (which are explained after the credits in a postscript trailer on the tape by Shyamalan and others) left me with the feeling that there was an attempt going down to distract me from thinking too much about what I had seen, or not seen, in the movie. All the rules were explained except one, and it was "the big one" which others have mentioned in their comments as well. I would agree with anyone who would say that fixing these holes would be a prodigious undertaking but I think it was possible and should have been attempted.From an entertainment perspective this movie was great but that facial hair (logic holes) should have (and could have) been shaved off - and it would have been perfect. Overall I'd recommend it ... just don't think about it too much afterwards and you'll be OK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would have been better without the trailer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is clearly one of the best horror films ever made. It accomplishes good fright without a lot of gore. However, it has some weaknesses that still bother me and clearly do not make it an Oscar contender with such great films as American Beauty and Girl Interrupted. The first flaw is not in the film, but in the trailer. Yes, "I see dead people" is an enticing line, but I would have given anything to see this movie without knowing that in advance. It really detracted from the early suspense. And, the big surprise ending I hear about is so obvious that I thought the surprise might be that the obvious ending didn't occur (and this would have made it a better film). Unfortuantly, the obvious does happen and they use very heavy-handed flashbacks to make sure even the dumbest in the audience get the idea.Other than these flaws, it's an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, but a few flaws...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe that this film is very good, but not good enough to be spot #23 on the IMDB top 250 list. First of all, the movie is a little bit overrated. (which is understandable because no other decent movies were out at the time except for Phantom Menace) Second of all, great movies get better each time you watch them. With each viewing, Sixth Sense gets less and less exciting and turns almost to the point of boring. The characters and their problems are not interesting enough to watch again and again. By the third time you've seen it, the movie becomes mediocre, knowing the ending does not make this movie good. (However, it is fun to point out things you didn't notice before about...well, *you know* (I don't wish to have a spoiler in comment)) Anyway, the problems with the characters is that they are too much the same. They're not melodramatic, but both Willis and (I forget his name) "the quiet kid" say all their lines in the same kind of serious, low-toned voice. There is feeling behind the lines, but not enough variety of feeling.Finally, there are a few plot holes, but I don't wish to discuss them because previous commenters already have. Cole "the quiet kid" did a fine acting job (compared to all the other kid actors out there, he looks like Orson Welles) it wasn't incredibly entertaining to watch his acting skills, but they were good. I hope the poor kid isn't scarred for life by the tone of the movie, and I hope he doesn't become type-casted and turn into another MacCullay Culkin.Anyway, a good suspenful movie (not really scary) and I would strongly recommend watching the movie once, but not twice, and definately not six times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finaly a real horror movie ! I thought they were extinct !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this, not expecting to much, and although i stayed away from all the reviews, magazine articles and all that stuff because i knew this movie had a real surprise ending, i still wasnt totally convinced that THE SIXTH SENSE would be more than just a few scares. When i left the theater, i was totaly marvelled by what i had just seen. This movie had restored my faith in american horror movies once again, something i thought it wouldnt happen in a million years, after having to put up with endless Freddy Krugger, Jason and countless horror teen movies. I was totally convinced that Hollywood had just abandoned adult scary horror forever. For years i wished i could watch another, THE CHANGELING, INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, THE HAUNTING (the original), even the first POLTERGEIST. Finally after seeing there were no horror movies anymore, just, teen-make-you-jump-on-the-chair-with-loud-music-flics, i wasnt totally convinced THE SIXTH SENSE was going to be as good as it promised. I was wrong.Of course i guess everybody has already seen it by now, so those of you who also love the movie, know what im talking about. So what can i say, that hasnt been said ?...That the story is fantastic, the atmosphere is perfect and the actors are great ? Well this doesnt begin to describe how good this movie is. And for those people who still insist that the plot has holes, i suggest you go see it again, because im sure you must have seen it only once, or you didnt paid enough atention the second time. There are no holes in this plot. This is a brilliant and detailled screenplay with the precision of a swiss clock. Its funny how most of the people who complain about the plot holes in this movie are the same who claim that the middle of the movie is empty and too much slow paced. Maybe if those persons, had paid atention to the details instead of waiting for an action scene they would noticed how crammed with plot clues and attention to eventual plot holes this movie is, particulary in the "empty" scenes. There are no plot holes in THE SIXTH SENSE, and even just for this this movie deserved to be praised. By the way, check the DVD for more on this if you still think the plot is wrong, maybe this will convince you.Anyway, what more can i say ? This movie is a modern masterpiece, and one of the greatest real horror movies of all time. And it doesnt have special effects, buckets of blood, gore or action scenes in it. Just a good story and a creepy atmosphere through out. This is how you do an horror movie.I hope somebody in Hollywood is taking notes, because i would love to see more like this. I want to see more like this. This is what horror movies are all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a child actor!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is a very good movie in itself (and yes, the ending is really something, with a twist I only saw that year in Fight Club... great). But the real credit goes to Haley Joel Osment, or "Cole". This child can really act. I watched the movie on home video (because I was pretty scared of watching it in a movie theater), and all the time I could only think about his acting; he looked wise beyond his age, more like a seasoned actor than an 11 year old kid. I think he has a great future ahead of him.As a strange coincidence, I watched "The Exorcist" 1 day before this film, and reached a conclusion: while Linda Blair was the star of the film (with Max von Sydow, of course), I couldn't stand Chris MacNeil at all. This limited my enjoyment of the movie, since her character appeared too often. Her overacting should not be excused. I couldn't find this flaw in "The Sixth Sense", where Bruce Willis acted great.This film stands out from the rest because it makes you spend the entire time trying to figure out the ending, and by the time you think you know what will happen, you get a rather chilling surprise. What a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderful, suspenseful, frightening film about a relationship with a young boy and a child psychologist. The young boy lives a life of solitude and fear as he has this special sense or power to see dead people as well as the living. M. Night Shyalmalan does an outstanding job with the direction and script of this now-classic chiller. The acting is superb as both Bruce Willis and especially Haley Joel Osment give performances...excuse the pun...to die for. The film has a power in itself and it gets a grip on the viewer and does not let go till the very end..and although the ending is somewhat known for its twist...I did not know what was coming the first time I saw the film. I was totally floored when I saw it and spent the second viewing making sure it was at all plausible...and it was.

But except for the ending (terrific) it failed completely to come up to my expectations, most of the time it was not even exciting nor thrilling. The movie is actually above average due to the outstanding performance of Haley Joel Osment. Bruce Willis tried really hard to act well, but he did not succeed.

Haley Joel Osmont is brilliantly and lyrically understated, and Bruce Willis is fine too . More like a grim concerto than a horror film, it is what it is.Great autumnal hues, and a fuzzy soundtrack which fits it well.The flaws:Sometimes the taste is too classical for some,although at times the movie can be a little boring until another great image comes on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A major disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>{SPOILERS ahead} I never felt so rotten after watching a movie in my whole life. I admit it, I did not guess the ending, but that is precisely what made the movie so awful. To elaborate, every movie has its story line, a set of rules it must abide by to stay logical and entertaining. When a movie follows these rules and still manages to deliver a surprising, dramatic show then I can call the movie great. Sixth Sense did all that only to reveal in the last minutes [SPOILER AHEAD] that Willis was dead, an idea that crawled, perhaps, into many people's minds but was so illogical that it simply did not make sense.I am sure you know all about the plot holes. Like the fact that Willis was dumb enough not to notice that something was wrong. What, he didn't attend his own funeral? Never called anyone on the phone? Where did he get information about the boy in the first place? Never tried to talk to any living being, including his wife? How about having to go to a bathroom for crying out loud!!! Now, the script tries to nullify the hole by giving Cole this line: "They(dead people) see what they want to see". Is this supposed to cover everything? Willis may be dumb but his character is NOT. In the movie Ghost, Demi Moore's husband played by Patrick Swayze finds out that he is dead in the first 5 minutes after getting shot. It takes more than a year for Willis to do the same. Yeah! That makes sense...But the biggest blow is the main area of the plot - the reason why Willis wants to help the boy - putting it simply, Cole is afraid of the ghosts, the cause of his mood disorders (at least that's what Willis thinks). But Willis IS a ghost! To deny the fact(like many reviewers here do) that the boy doesn't know Willis is a ghost is outrageous. Cole isn't stupid either - he knows nobody can see Willis's character, not his mom, no one!!! Yet he is not afraid of the doctor. It follows that if he is not afraid of Willis then he shouldn't be afraid of any ghost. But this doesn't make sense.I saw the movie only once but I can also recall that Willis, outraged by the sight of his wife kissing another man does something to the store door or window. This produces a sound!!! But can a dead man interact with the real world? Nope!!! Not in every other similar situation (like when he tried to open the door to the cellar). Another nonsensical point.There are numerous other holes that people here mentioned. I am not going to mention them all. Don't get me wrong. I am not trying to deny the fact that the movies was shot beautifully. Almost everyone played his or her role to perfection. It was at times scary. However, I sincerely believe that the movie would not have been given so many rave reviews if it weren't for the shocking ending. Somehow people managed to see past its lack of logic and rationality and give it a perfect 10. Believe me... that's what the director of the movie was hoping for. In the end, Sixth Sense just doesn't play by its own rules. Too bad, it could have been a good one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So here it is. THE psychological/supernatural thriller of the new millennium, rewarded with 6 Academy award nominations. I expected a lot here, and got what i expected. A great, and sometimes chilling movie. I have to admit there were times i grew a bit restless while watching. After all, the boy was seeing things that other people couldn't see. Even we as an audience couldn't see. And it's hard to sympathize with this kid if we don't understand what scares him. But we got to see it about 30 minutes into the movie. The images presented to us were sometimes scary, as the deceased people the boy claims to see are in the state they were when they died. E.g. A boy who played with his father's gun, misses the back of his head. In the end comes the surprise you wouldn't have guessed if you tried. Which just proves how involving the movie is because the obvious clues to the surprise are there in plain view throughout the movie. To the people who haven't seen the movie yet, I dare you to guess the surprise even now i've said these things.Sixth sense is a great, if somewhat overhyped movie. It's great, yes, but a classic? Will you remember it 20 or 30 years from now as most people remembered Psycho? I doubt it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three were the numbers of times I watched this movie till I get the conclusion that... it's perfect. Before I watched it for the first time, I already had great expectations, what is not good, the chances you have to be disappointed is much bigger then. But the opposite happened: I left the cinema wondering how M. Night Shyamalan could do something so perfectly arranged and also coherent. And I am not just talking about the plot, the soundtrack, the camera movements, everything seems to be in the right place.Cole is a twelve-year-old boy who would be like every children in his age if there weren't this simple fact: he can see dead people! The story is focus on Cole's little issue and how Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) will find a way to help him. The movie also has beautiful background themes like: love, losing a close person, familiar relationships, human cruelty, friendship, human rational beliefs and how people always try to find reasonable explanation for everything, beyond of course the relationship between doctor and patient, how they have to be confident with each other to find out the answers.It's not a movie to make people scared like horror films, but it has the elements that can make you jump out of the chair and fell chills in your neck whiling watching it. The bad news is after this movie you might have another opinion about chills ... The same thing will happen about things we can't find anywhere... Never mind, when you see it, you'll understand what I'm talking about.The three things I admire the most about this movie, one for each time I saw it, are: the Haley Joel Osment performance ? an Oscar deserved one, the techniques ? how it really keeps the watchers attention, and how everything directs to the amazing surprise at the end.

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense would have to one of the greatest films ever. Everything from the writing, directing and the acting was superb. The fact that you couldn't pick the ending made it even more enjoyable - that's the films I like. If you know what is going to happen it sort of spoils the movie for you. I had to see it several times to pick up what I missed and seeing it for the second, third time etc etc makes you realize you should have seen it coming.Bruce Willis is a legend. He is such a versatile actor and the fact that this movie made a lot of people stand up and take him seriously (which should have been done years ago) is very rewarding. Haley Joel Osment was amazing. No words can describe the performance he gave. He will definitely be around for a very long time. Toni Collette was also very good and the chemistry between her and Haley was unbelievable. This movie will definitely go down as one of the best of the 20th century and should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't really a spoiler, but I wouldn't read it if you have not seen the film anyway.I think this movie worked on so many levels that it would have to be called "layered". Many leave the theater in awe of the GIANT plot twist, obviously, but that seems to only be the icing on an already richly sweet cake.Almost everyone agrees that the movie was a whole entity before its shocking conclusion surprised them. I've never seen a plot twister that relied so little on it's "big secret". Perhaps that is part of the reason that so few guessed the ending before it materialized; the audience was so enthralled by the drama, suspense, and downright eerieness of the film that the notion that the wool was being pulled over their eyes simply did not occur to them. This is what made the ending so shocking and incredible.However, a plot twist, in the end, is really just a gimmick. The layers that made the film so complete were plentiful. The tone and pacing of the film were appropriate, the directing was obviously focused, and the performances were stupendous. Truly stupendous.Toni Nicolette: touching. Donnie Walberg: unsettling. Haley Joel Osment: inspiring.Hollywood loves to manufacture its child stars and milk whatever attention they can out of their cute faces. Too often young stars are credited with undue respect. It is seen to be incredible for a child to pull off an emotionally complex role.Haley Joel Osment did not simply "pull it off". He did not merely "portray" a character. He made a character real. He made us all feel as terrified and as alone and helpless as a boy so cursed would. I was moved.Donnie Walberg's part was small, but the madness in his face cast a shadow over every moment that followed it. It prompted me once again to ask why his brother receives so much more work than he.Finally, Toni Nicolette. I had no idea the level at which her talent reaches. Now I do. I will watch her in the future.Overall? 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie that messes with your mind above all things. The clever plot and little hints that point to the ending make this movie a thriller that will definitely not lose its popularity. So maybe Haley Joel Osment didn't win an Academy Award and the film itself didn't get an award for "Best Picture" but this movie fails to disappoint. It truly shows what Child Psychology is like today and Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment are a great team on the screen. It didn't scare a lot of people and the beginning didn't amuse people as much as the makers of the film thought it would but it still is an eerie and chilling movie that could have a great sequel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading several comments and becuase of my friends pleading with me, I examined this movie more closely than I did the first time I saw it. After about the tenith time, I still had no doubt in my mind that I had just wasted $4.00 in a video store to see this movie again. I have given the stupid thing more than enough chances, but I still can't see the big deal. Either I'm blind, or that this is a bad movie. Since I have 20/20 vision, I don't think eyesight is an issue. The kid sees dead people. Big whoopie do. This movie is like Titanic: they both are movie about that were popular at the box office, but that wasn't enough. Everyone has to love them and shower them with awards and nominations. WHY???????? The titanic sinks, the movie is over. GET OVER IT. In the Sixth Sense, the(we are sorry, but this portion of this paragraph contains the ending of the film and cannot be shown at this current time. Go and waste your own money to see it). What were they smoking when they made this? I mean, it was shot fairly good, but still it was higly overrated. I've seen food that looks scarier than this will ever be. false advertising is another reason this movie is bad. The "#1 thriller of all time" is really, "#4 most boring movie of all time." the "Scariest movie of the summer" should be the "Sleepiest movie of all summer." The main reason I hate this movie so much is because it has been done before, for the most part. My 1,000 words are almost up, but let me say this: Don't waste time and money to see this, get something that can be classified as a good movie like Psycho (1960 version) or Jaws, don't go for something like the Sixth Sense or one of those retro 50's cheaply made movies. Some of those are good, but most are not. In other words.....STAY AWAY FORM THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

I admit there are a few implausible things but perhaps we can look back to the movie "Ghost" where dead people COULD interact with inanimate objects. I was totally surprised by the ending even though I knew relatively what was happening, I think a lot of people are too much into the Hollywood hype where a movie has to have a definite dnouement, I find these people to be unimaginative and unappreciative to actual QUALITY movies which I think is where this movie ranks.

Night Shamalyn shine, while the legendary performance from new young actor Haley Joel Osment will forever burn in my memory, while Bruce Willis has rarely been better, and Toni Collette is an impressive supporting female.Malcolm Crowe (Willis) is a child psychologist who has agreed to council a troubled 9 year old named Cole Sear (Osment). Yet Cole is not Crowe's usual young, troubled boy. He has a deep dark secret - that he is haunted by the ghosts of the spirit world. Now it is time for Crowe and Sear to stop these unfriendly visitors, but, is there a way?This is one of the best films of 1999, everything (and I mean everything!) is perfection.

		<shortDescription>But for the supernatural element, tone is similar to "Kramer vs Kramer"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is an unexpectedly poignant and utterly unpretentious ghost story. Bruce Willis is understated but effective as a child psychologist who is compelled to redeem a past failure by counseling a troubled 8-year-old boy who eventually professes to being able to "see dead people". Never gimmicky or over-the-top, "The Sixth Sense" presents us with three very real people: Willis, the boy (Osment) and his mother (Collette), each trying to cope with a unique personal trauma. Not unlike "The Exorcist", the film draws us into the characters' dilemmas by devoting much of its first half to letting us empathize with the leads and share in their lives, then compelling us to experience their mounting turmoil. But unlike so many horror films of the past 20 years, "The Sixth Sense" unexpectedly eschews cheap shocks and gore for simple, potent drama and the painful revelations that accompany life and death. The three leads are uniformly excellent, but it is Willis who surprises; never in his career has Willis relied so predominantly on the subtlest of facial expressions to convey his emotional state, and here he accomplishes this vital feat admirably.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Has no one noticed what a rip off "The Sixth Sense" is of Bergman's "Fanny och Alexander"? In the film, Alexander has something called den sjetta sansen (=the sixth sense), which enables him to speak with the dead. He also communicates with his dead father, who guides him throughout the film. There is also a scene in which a dead girl vomits on Alexander, she is sick because of evil parents. Sound familiar? Sure as hell does to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid plot with great ending, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film contains a great combination of horror, mystery, drama, and sci-fi all conglomerated into the same film. The premise of the story is that a young child played by Osment is able to see dead people as easy as you or I can see the living. What do these "dead people" want of him?? Dr Malcolm Crowe ( played by willis) offers his help to unlock the mystery. **** Do not read this next paragraph if you don't want to learn of the ending**** Ok, this is a great film, no doubt about that. The ending is one of the best as well.. But I bring attention to the fact that if Crowe is suppose to be dead all along yet HE DOESN'T KNOW HE IS DEAD, why don't we see crowe trying to interact with the living?????? He is suppose to be "alive" yet wouldn't it seem a bit out of the ordinary if your wife never talks to you?? OR in the case of when he went to see Cole at his house, he is sitting with cole's mom--- wouldn't it seem feasible to want to strike up a discussing with the mother of a boy whom you are trying to solve his "mental problems"??? I just find it hard to believe that a man would not try to communicate with anyone throughout the duration of the time he is examining Cole, beacause he is DEAD so therefore if he did, he would surely realize something is wrong, why would everyone ignore him? hmm This is about the only point of the movie that keeps it from a 10 for me. The plot is well-developed, and Willis does a good job portraying Crowe. Osment is the real star of this movie though. The kid puts on one heck of a performance! You believe his pain, his fear, and want to see his problems resolved. Also, I would have liked to see Cole help the ghosts in his house ( the wife and the kid with the bullet wound) and maybe tell the audience a little more about the backgrounds of the ghosts to add more of an eerie twist. But a solid movie nonetheless 8 out of 10 p.s. if you like this movie watch Jacob's Ladder, another psychological thriller with a litter darker theme</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie because it is good entertainment. Its ideas of ghosts and spirits, of powers that heal are nice. And no one can possibly have forseen the unforgettable endingHowever, the movie is a far cry from "Brilliant!" or "Masterpiece!" status. At times very slow-moving, it centers too much on the little boy's supernatural encounters, incidents and not nearly enough on the effect it has on the people around him. The plot is not well-developed enough. It seems that Bruce Willis' character decides "ooooh if you help them, they will go away." He does, and they go away. Very sappy and forgettable.Haley Joel does give a good performance for someone of his age, and Willis is crucial in his supporting role. The conversation with his mother in the car was touching, but moments of real emotional epiphanies are few in this movie.7.5/10</fullReview>

Not that I didn't waste my money renting it.Somehow I can see Hollywood producing a Sixth Sense TV series where the kid and the doctor go around helping ghosts so that the ghosts can finally be at peace.

I was noticing the "clues" in the movie, but had no warning about the ending. But, just because it shines does not mean it is gold. Osment did not get on my nerves as much as other child actors. Bruce Willis gave a normal Bruce Willis job. The atmosphere was nice, but underutilized. I think a few more scenes of the boy communicating with the 'ghosts' would have been a bit more fulfilling.

		<fullReview>*** SPOILER ALERT ***I'd like to make a few comments about The Sixth Sense. I rather enjoyed it, and was completely taken by surprised by the twist at the end. But there a few points that slightly marred it for me. These are rather small points, mind you.First of all, there are loose ends everywhere, which most people will probably have spotted. This is all right if you can turn off your critical mind for a couple of hours and just go with the flow, but for those who like everything neatly falling into place at the end, if fails quite conspicuously.There was no need (I think) to suggest that the boy had mind-reading abilities (as when he unexpectedly told his teacher about his past) and then just drop the matter altogether. Mind-reading could be a subject for an entirely different film. As treated in The Sixth Sense it makes a couple of brief appearances, then sort of hangs outside the main story, not quite fitting in anywhere. This overloaded the plot for me somewhat. It should simply have been left out.Also, I dislike having to be told explicitly what one should be able to understand on his own with little effort. An example is when Cole's mother is talking out loud in her sleep, and Cole overhears her saying something like "Cole, what's wrong with you?" etc. It should be obvious that she's worried about him -- she is his mother after all. Are we so dumb that it has to be spelt out in red for us? There are other such examples in the film. Also, when Willis's character visits Cole in hospital, and explains to him why he wants to help Cole so much, in essence spelling out the main storyline in clear, unambiguous, single syllables. Okay, he was talking to a ten-year old boy, but I can't help thinking that the scene was designed for the benefit of the audience. Willis's motivation was clear enough.And then there's the fact that Willis's character, being dead, is not recognised by Cole as being dead, even though Cole recoils in horror at the sight of every other dead person he sees. Maybe I missed something -- could someone drop me an E-mail explaining why this is so? Thanks.There is a difficulty in portraying convincing characters in a film that is intended to scare you. The spectacle rather overshadows the characters. It's hard to reconcile the two. This film did a much better job than most other films of this genre. On the whole I was entertained, but with a little more care it could have been a lot better.Cheers,Mike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only good thing that this movie has going for it is the acting by Collette and Osmont. Willis' character is okay, but dull. I would have preferred ghosts that were not visible to the audience. The movie would have been more chilling in black and white. The screenplay is average and incoherent. However, the movie is better than Robert Wise's "The Haunting" (1963). For a great ghost movie, check out "The Innocents" (1961) or "The Changeling" (1980). score: 8 (out of 10).</fullReview>

There was a little boy in the film who could see dead people and communicate with them. That would certainly be awful. I'm 19 and I know I'd certainly get scared of dead people walking around, but this boy must be 8 or 9 years old. That would be terribly frightening for a child at that age. I just can't help but feel sorry for him. Aside from that the film was quite perplexing because I did not realize that the psychologist was dead until the end of the movie.

		<shortDescription>not really scary: more of a drama. Excellent movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i didn't really understand this movie completely the first time i saw it, so i enjoyed it much more the second time. You really have to take a really close look to see all the subtle clues that lead to that big revelation at the end. I also understood the subplot of the little girl better this time and the way Cole tries to help her. This movie definitley deserves to be seen twice!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, even if it was made by Disney...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has done what few movies have been able to do: Keep me interested, without any mind-blowing special effects. It had a few effects, mostly gore and such, but overall, the cinema-photography, a deeper-than-first-glance plot, and stirring film score gave this movie my high rating.The cinema-photography was excellent. Mr. Shyamalan (The Director) really knows how to compose a scene, so that you understand not only what the script is telling you, but what the director wants you to feel.The plot was great, as well. I won't give the major surprises away, in case some of you have yet to see it, but suffice it to say, I haven't seen a plot this involving and deep in a very long time. And just when you think you can't possibly be more emotionally drained, the end comes, and you want to go right back to the ticket office, and buy another go-around.The music was also very touching. Written by James Howard, (Who also did the music for Disney's recent "Dinosaur") the score moves you almost as well as the storyline. The themes presented seamlessly integrate with the events unfolding before your eyes...I believe most people who have seen this film will agree with me...And those who have yet to see this movie... What are you doing here?!? Go out and get tickets, while you still can!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best of 1999</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense may be one of the best psychological suspense/horror films in history. It ranks among the best of Hitchcock, combining brilliantly crafted dialogue, well formed characters, and a handful of uncharacteristically strong performances (Bruce Willis, particularly, who finally may have wept with actual EMOTION behind his tears for once) into something truly remarkable to witness.I regret not seeing this film in theaters. I was swayed into thinking it was another atmospheric horror film (Stir of Echoes and dozens more in recent years), complete with an eerie, whining child lead. Not so. Don't believe whatever you thought you saw in the coming attractions. Haley Joel Osment is strikingly-convincing as the troubled Cole Sear (odd name, though) whose gift for transcending the realms of the perceived living world has those close to him deeply concerned.But are they any more alive than the emaciated, mutilated creatures who haunt him?That is the question for you, the viewer, to answer. I'm sure the film will lead you to a satisfying conclusion...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't get into film stories very readily -- especially if they happen to be "horror" films. I find myself laughing at the action rather than finding it believable. Not so with this film; I found the some of the scenes to be hair raising. That means the director did a good job.The story seemed vaguely familiar; both my wife and I guessed the punch line no more than ten minutes into the story. Still, it was a good story and well told. The story seemed familiar because it had some of the flavors of "Jacob's Ladder," "Heaven Can Wait," "Ghost," and maybe just a dash of "Beetlejuice."The presentation of the story is clever and engaging, even though the director uses several traditional English manifestations to signal the presence of spirits: deathly silence and cold. The visual images are well done, and, as I already mentioned, it was convincing enough to be actually hair raising.I'd see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've seen the movie "The Sixth Sense" at the theatre, I recommend that you buy the tape or the DVD and pick up on what the writer's and director have to say about "rules and clues" in the movie, then watch it again. I, for one, loved the suspense in the movie and was completely surprised by the ending. What a unique twist on things and I didn't even catch on to it. Even the director thought that they had given away the twist on the ending during the scene when the boy is in the hospital speaking to Bruce Willis about the 'dead' and yet when they attended the premiere viewing, no one in the audience caught a thing and were all shocked at the end of the movie. Great job, great movie, a real must see even on tape.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I posted my comments on this movie a while back, but having read some of the latest reviews, I feel compelled to add the following:SPOILERS!!! SPOILERS!!! SPOILERS!!!There is obviously a division here between those who loved it and those who complain about so-called plot holes or things that don't add up. (I'm EXCLUDING those users who couldn't stay awake because there were no explosions!)This film clearly operates on a metaphysical level. In my opinion, one's ability/willingness to accept this, with all its accompanying mysteries, is the key to understanding and appreciating this film. Malcolm and the other "ghosts" may be technically dead, but they have not yet completed their journeys into the afterlife. They are caught between the world of the living and the world of the dead. A very important aspect in this regard is Cole's crucial words to Malcolm: "They don't know that they are dead, they only see what they want to see." Does that mean that they think they are still alive? Not necessarily. It may simply mean that they experience their in-between-world as the real, living world. But they are not active participants in this world. They don't communicate with the living (with the exception of Cole) and they don't have the same needs as the living. Therefore the notion that Malcolm should have noticed that no-one else acknowledges his existence, as one user has suggested, is quite ridiculous. He would not have gone into a store to buy food!!! It is equally ridiculous to question the time lapse between the shooting incident and Malcolm's first meeting with Cole. What does time mean to "ghosts"? Do they sometimes wander around aimlessly? Do they approach more than one "gifted" person and then move on to another if they are not helped? I don't know, and I have a suspicion you don't either. It is also important to note that the "ghosts" were focused primarily on their unfinished business. They needed closure before they could move on. What was Malcolm's unfinished business? His perceived failure as a husband and therapist. So when he seeks out Cole, it is to resolve both these issues. He achieves this by helping Cole understand and accept his gift, and Cole helps him to make peace with his wife. (She believed she came second, remember?)It has also been asked why Cole isn't scared of Malcolm when he first meets him. He IS - Malcolm waits for him outside, but Cole senses his presence and starts walking faster and faster and so avoids him. But then Malcolm approaches him in the church, which is a safe sanctuary. And no, that does not necessarily mean that no other "ghosts' ever entered the church, it only means that Cole felt safe there!! Still weary, of course, but safe. Malcolm also approached Cole differently (less threateningly) than the other "ghosts" did, because, I believe, part of his unfinished business had to do with Cole specifically (redemption for failing his former patient). To put it simply, he helped himself by helping Cole.As for the "cold air breathing" aspect: this went hand-in-hand with the intensity of the "ghosts'" presence. Which is why it was so pronounced when Cole was scared. That it happens at the end with Malcolm's wife, is particularly relevant. It signifies the intensity of his presence, which he reveals to her when he is ready to talk to her. He makes a connection with her and she becomes AWARE of his presence. He is then able to tell her that which he didn't tell her before he died. He can say goodbye.This, of course, is only my interpretation. But to me it makes perfect sense. And I'm glad that it does, otherwise I would have lost out on one of the most wonderful movie experiences ever!</fullReview>

It was so obvious when no one talked to him OR saw him except for the kid after the first scene in the movie. Now, granted, I heard that the ending had a twist to it and that did kind of wreck it, but COME ON PEOPLE!! Number 22 of ALL TIME???!!!! Even worse is the fact that some people thought this ending was better than "The Usual Suspects" which is heresy in its greatest form. Osmett (sp?) was good as the little disturbed kid, and Willis also showed some real talent but being nominated for best picture made me ill. Three kings was superior in direction and story and I'm pretty sure didn't even receive a nomination for anything. There, I've said my peace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this movie I knew I didn't want to see dead people, even if it meant helping them. That's how effective the "seeing dead people" scenes were. The young actor does a great job as portraying someone who sees dead people. Bruce Willis has a very unusual role where he does pretty good to portray vulnerability. The direction and editing of the film give us a view of the world from the eyes of a child who "sees dead people". Thomas Newman provides a very subtle yet haunting score that complements the movie very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's really two movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is really two movies - one that works and one that simply doesn't.The part of The Sixth Sense that does work is the just about everything NOT directly related to the surprise twist at the end - the little boy's seeing the ghosts, the problems it causes in his life, his relationship with his mother and the psychologist, and the psychologist's guilt over a similar patient from his past. It is all beautifully acted and shot, and a refreshing change from the excessive gore, profanity, nudity and sex we are so often subjected to in the movies. It wasn't exactly the scariest movie I have ever seen, but some of the scenes were quite chilling - such as the one where the little boy sees the female ghost in the kitchen and for a split second he (and the viewer) believes it to be his mother.SPOILER ALERT!!!!I knew going in that there was going to be a twist ending having to do with someone being dead and not knowing it, although I wasn't sure which character. It became pretty clear as the film went on that it HAD to be Bruce Willis' character, but then again it simply didn't track logically. How on earth could someone be dead and not know it? Or at least not be able to figure out that something strange was going on (for example, why he couldn't communicate with anyone but the kid). Since it was completely unbelievable, the ending left me feeling flat, which is too bad because almost everything else about the movie was classy and well-done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply put: A masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd originally held out on viewing this film for as long as possible in order to savor the experience known as "The Sixth Sense" in the company of solitude. Yet thanks to the asininity of a couple of prepubescent girls who decided it would be entertaining to spoil the film at the expense of an entire classroom of high school students, I became reluctant to attend the theater and rent the movie for a number of months.When I finally obtained a copy of the movie and inserted it into the VCR, rancor towards the aforementioned individuals returned in the blink of an eye. Upon reading in the opening credits that James Newton Howard had composed the soundtrack, however, I allowed myself to become immersed in the film, and from then on was not once subjected to straying thoughts.In the case of "The Sixth Sense," the director had a vision--and this vision came through in such an efficient manner that the final creation was not a movie, but rather, an experience: an experience which comes together on every conceivable level, from the acting to the musical score, that leads the viewer through a first-hand perspective of what each character is seeing and experiencing on an emotional level, with the revelations that force their way onto the air evoking the same reaction from the viewer as the fictional characters on the screen.It does not serve much of a purpose to elaborate on any specific aspect of this film; as it stands, everything is as close to perfection as it can possibly be in a movie. Perhaps the only flaw is that for first-time viewers, emotional or detached, analytical dispositions will grant an entirely different perspective on the movie and its merits as far as suspense is concerned. But since profound cynicism is required to blatantly disregard the merits of this film, there should be something to appeal to each and every viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sixth sense has to be one of the scarriest films ever made. The whole idea of the movie is very thought provoking and can make you lose a lot of sleep. The story is basically about a little boy who can see dead people wondering around but the final climax of the film is the ending which is superb. I do not recommend this film to anybody who gets scared easily although i think its a shame that such a great film should not be seen. Bruce Willis was very good in the film acting his usual cool self but the highlight of all the acting in the film has to go to Haley Osmont who played the little boy. Very rarely do we see such fine young actors. The only other young actors i thought who were as good was the little boy in "The Champ", the little boy in "Kramer v Kramer" and the little boy in "ET". Only The Exorcist can compete with this film on scary levels.....truly a masterpiece</fullReview>

Bruce Willis plays a child psychiatrist who tries to find out what is wrong with him and finally having earned the boy's trust, the youngster tells his haunting secret. The film offers and eerie score, many scares, and some brilliant story developments that will make the viewer rethink the many assumptions that they normally make when watching a film.

		<shortDescription>Technically marvelous but keeps its ace in the hole showing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good example of a film that rests on its creative laurels and dispenses with all that icky "story" nonsense.Excellent cinematography, lighting, acting, dialogue, and production design abound. It was refreshing to see Bruce Willis do well in a role that isn't summarized as "make smartassed comments, kill terrorists". The technical attributes are what make the movie worth seeing; the photography and lighting reflect the dreary subject matter of the film beautifully and with tension, where necessary. It is for these things that I give "The Sixth Sense" very high marks.So what's the problem? Here's the problem.What does everybody that hasn't already seen this movie know about it? "I see dead people." It's on the trailers and it's spoofed constantly on TV for comic effect, so everybody knows that this "gift" is the central focus of the story. And that's fine with me. There's just one problem:That's the WHOLE story.Little Cole sees dead people. Okay, so what of it? Since we already knew that from the trailers, the impact of the line and the revelation of that secret is lost when Cole spouts the line halfway into the movie. I, for one, was left saying: "we already knew that. NOW what?"At least the makers of "The Crying Game" had the sense not to say "Oh, by the way, IT'S A GUY!" in the trailers for THAT film.Other than that Cole sees dead people, there isn't really a whole lot going on in this film. Okay, so the movie shows US some of the dead people. Yes, it may make you jump in a couple of places, but that doesn't define a thriller. I can sneak up behind a person and yell in his ear and make him flinch; that doesn't make me the master of suspense.By and large, the genuine creepiness that DOES take place in this movie is effective, but sparse and short-lived. And since we already know about the dead people, there really isn't much left for the audience, except for one thing.***SPOILER WARNING***The writer did leave himself an ace in the hole. The problem is that it's almost completely given away by the end of the movie, to folks with a keen eye and sharp senses.Everybody I knew that saw this movie before I did said: "oh, man, it's great, you've gotta see it, the ending will blow your mind, etc." I started watching the movie. Bruce Willis gets shot, and about twenty minutes later, since the shooting itself had not been brought up at all in the film since it took place, I started asking myself: "okay, it was significant that the underwear-wearing guy in the bathroom blew his brains out... but that alone would have sealed the doctor's motivation for wanting to help this kid. So why did the doctor have to get shot?" Simple answer: so we can all find out at the end that he's already dead. Duh. Of course, that early in the film, it's only a hypothesis. When the big secret is finally revealed, however, you've got so much evidence to support your theory packed into your head that there's no way you CAN'T be right. And, as it turns out, you ARE right. It's a surprise ending that fails to be a surprise. Therefore, for me, there was nothing interesting about this film in terms of story. And quite frankly, I wasn't too interested in the whole "I see dead people" concept to begin with.If you want to see a movie with an EFFECTIVE sucker-punch ending, try "The Usual Suspects" or "Fight Club".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this at the cinema once, and I will honestly say that no other film of 1999 left such an impression.Now before I carry on I will say that I'm quite well "viewed" as far as this genre of film goes. A number of my favourite films are from the psychological horror genre. I won't compare this film to any other of its kind because I prefer to judge a film on its own merits. This isn't really a review, but rather what I was thinking while watching it.(SPOILERS)OK, so I saw it. I wasn't expecting great things from it. Which is the only reason I can think of why it took me so completely by surprise. It started promisingly, with a quite disturbing intruder scene and a gunshot. Suddenly, its "The Next Fall" (Autumn for us Brits!) and here is a man, previously injured by said gunshot, pick up the case of an odd young man with similar childhood problems to his attacker. At this point I had no reason to think that anything was amiss. If you don't start to wonder at this point, it's too late. I was completely drawn into the relationships between the characters and this young man's plight. Obviously I wasn't watching it in the same state of mind as others, who may have guessed the "surprise" right away. Call me thick or whatever, but I feel better off than those who did guess. Because they will have missed out on one of the greatest movie experiences for some time.Its a very personal drama with delicate performances, combined with some extremely effective chills. It slowly moves along to it's conclusion, introducing several elements on the way to distract you. Cole's mother's anguish at not understanding what is happening to her son is well portrayed. As things progressed, I thought "this is a good film". Then towards the end, a quite devastating shock is revealed at the dead little girl's wake (whom Cole is now trying to help.) I was so repulsed at and chilled with what was revealed here. Now it was a "great film". As things were being tied up, with a quite emotional scene between Cole and his mother, then between Malcolm and his wife- BANG! It happened. As Malcolm looked at his hand, my blood froze. And it stayed frozen till the close and well into the end credits. I walked out into the night air, I was dizzy. I hadn't walked out of the cinema feeling like that for a long long time. It's not the most original surprise ending, but it's certainly up there with the best of them.Now, here I am, after buying the DVD and watching it a second time. And even though I know the ending and how obvious it is in hindsight, It still has a great effect on me as I remember my feelings during the first viewing. But isn't that what all great films do...This film has generated a lot of debate in this forum, which says more about it's quality than I can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was genuinely scary, unnerving, and disturbing. Yet the scariness of the movie certainly does not come out of mindless gore or unrealistic monsters. It comes out of sheer, basic, suspense, the likes of which I may have never seen since Psycho, more than Silence of the Lambs and Seven.Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a nice man,a devoted husband and psychiatrist. So good is he at his work, he receives a plaque from the mayor commending him. However, his joy that night is brief, as his celebration with his wife is cut short by an unexpected blast from the past--a patient of Malcolm's that he couldn't help (Donnie Wahlberg in a short but memorable cameo). He tells Malcolm that he didn't help him, and he has still been miserable for the last 10 years because no one could pinpoint why he was so upset. He then pulls out a gun, shoots Malcolm in the gut, then blows his own brains out. Flash forward to 2 months later: Malcolm is standing near the house of young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) and his mother (Toni Colette). Cole has become a patient of his, and after reviewing Cole's case, Malcolm realizes that he and the man who shot him have a lot in common, and Malcolm sort of sees this as his shot at redemption for failing his other patient. The two meet and strike an instant rapport. But Cole is depressed, and always seems to look sad. His single mother is constantly stressed, trying to juggle two jobs and be a mother and father to Cole. She can not reach Cole herself, cannot understand why he is always so frightened. Eventually after Malcolm earns the trust of Cole, Cole tells him his secret: "I See Dead People." Cole explains to Malcolm that he constantly sees dead people walking around, not knowing that they are dead, and not seeing each other. Only Cole can see these people. At first Malcolm tries not to believe Cole, but after listening to a tape of one of his sessions with the man who shot him, he realizes Cole is telling the truth. The two have their individual problems, though. Malcolm and his wife haven't talked in months, they are now completely estranged from one another, and she seems to have found a new beau. Cole's mother wonders why her grandmothers pendant keeps getting moved, and gets furious when Cole denies taking it. The story goes on like this, telling about how Malcolm and Cole try to help each other This intelligent film is about 3 completely heart-wrenching relationships. Malcolm's relationship with his wife, Cole's relationship with his mother, and Malcolm and Cole's relationship with each other. All three are introduced to the story at the beginning, and at the end, all three are neatly and beautifully concluded. Possibly the most moving scene of the movie is when Cole comes home from school. He asks his mom how her difficult day was. She says: "Well, I won the lottery this morning, I quit all my jobs, I picnicked in the park, and then swam in the fountain all afternoon." She then asks Cole how his day went at his school (where everyone views him as a freak and an outcast). He answers: "Well, I was picked first for dodgeball, I hit a game-winning grand slam, and everyone carried me off on their shoulders." It shows how the only escape from their two difficult, miserable lives, is each other. The two most memorable things about this movie are Haley Joel Osment, who is nothing short of a revelation as Cole and who unjustly lost the academy award for Best Supporting Actor to the simple acting of Michael Caine for The Cider House Rules, and the ending, which clearly borrows a little something from The Usual Suspects. The rest of the cast is uniformly good, especially Toni Colette as Cole's mother. Bruce Willis does an admirable job as Malcolm, a very different character than he has played in his traditional movies. The writing and direction is some of the best you will ever see. M. Night Shyamalan has loaded the Sixth Sense with symbolism, foreshadowing, and clues to the big finish. He had the bad luck as coming out the same year as American Beauty, which was only a little better written , but much better directed. The Sixth Sense was nominated for 6 oscars: Best Picture, Supporting Actor Haley Joel Osment, Supporting Actress Toni Colette, Director Shyamalan, Writer Shyamalan, and Editing. It lost them all, unfortunately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sith's Sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So what if you can see dead people? The interesting plot brings us towards new conception of fear of knowing too much. As we know, we usually guess about things we can't see or won't see. But IF and only if we CAN SEE them? We are forced to accept the world around us in multi dimensional.Another interesting plot is to confront our fear. The next step after accepting is dealing with it. What can we do better with this ability? How should we do it?The Sixth Sense couldn't be done without Harvey's performance. He outcaste Bruce Willis. Playing as a child with supernatural gift, he stand alone like a SITH, a character-race in Star Wars (Lord Sith, Darth Maul, etc.), with power and ability causes other to fear and stay away from them. And here, we can see he is alienated from his mother, and friends. And almost from those spirits he saw. No secrets in that.One plot we are not suppose to reveal is Bruce Willis' character. He is, yes, a psychologist with a deep trauma after some patient attempt to murder him, but here we can see another fact. We are, indeed almost always trying to ignore our fate and conditions. We do our best to cover our pain and failure, as we're trying to move along and to forget it. But unless you're dealing with your deepest pain and failure, you will be able to move forward better. And healthier.The movie is about us, dealing with ourselves, our pain and ability. It is packed with suspense and thrills and a bit of horror, but blanketed with drama and tragic reality. A milestone in it's genre. A must see for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good, and well told story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most arresting aspect of this movie for me was the portrayal of the troubled little boy. The methods he devised of dealing with his apparent ability to "see dead people" (i.e. the "sixth sense") and his heartwrenching difficulties with his mother, classmates, and the troubled spirits themselves are excellently portrayed and presented. He is an unusually good actor, particularly for one so young. Bruce Willis is quite good in his role of the Child Psychologist attempting to help the ostensibly delusional and psychotic child. The spooky effects are good, and not overdone with gore or crude bloodshed. In fact, the movie really makes one think about the proximity of the "spirit world"- especially on a dark night when alone. Many viewers who have offered comments here have seen the movie more than once. I think I will too. It is an entertaining, well thought out, well performed and expertly and effectively shot film. Rent it next Halloween!</fullReview>

Without giving too much away, the ending is quite a shocker, and this is why I compared it to The Usual Suspects (i.e., there's something that happens at the end that has been running (nearly) throughout the film, and you need to keeps your wits about you). It was nice to see M Night in a small cameo too. No special effects, no star-studded line up, just plain old fashioned chiller thriller. Haley Joel stole the show, and Willis puts in a spirited performance as the child psychologist. The score and camera work are also commendable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is excellent.The acting, casting, direction, filming, and especially the music, dialogue, and script are superb.Willis and Osment are outstanding (many of their scenes are riveting!). So were some of the minor characters, notably the man who watches his daughter's video.Numerous subtle touches were brilliant. E.g., Cole's mother was dressed less fashionably than the other mothers at the birthday party. This was revealing and sad. She desperately wanted her son, and probably herself, to be accepted. This made the event at the party even more tragic and her situation more horrifying.Many of the minor elements were brilliantly imaginative, e.g. the tale of the girl with the video and the remarks by "Grandma".Nothing is irrelevant or ill-conceived. Nothing is predictable. Nothing is sloppy; it's all very tight.After the first viewing, I watched it again. I was even more impressed by its brilliance, subtlety, intelligence, and imagination.Most movies bore me. I have a hard time getting through most of them. I prefer watching one at home so I can easily turn it off; I seldom watch an entire movie. I do not like "horror films"; I don't consider this to be one. I also don't like things that depend on the element of surprize; surprize is an integral part of this movie, but it is brilliant and beautiful to watch even when all the surprizes are known.I'll be on the lookout for more of Shyamalan's work.Why! oh why! can't Hollywood produce more movies of this quality and intelligence?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though after seeing this film I didn't come out quite as impressed as some of my friends did it is still a very good movie. Bruce Willis turns in a surprisingly intelligent, gentle performance and is matched step for step by Haley Joel Osmont, who shows what child actors can do if they are both good and blessed with a decent script. The well-documented twist at the end, though not that well filmed in itself, is still the best since 'The Usual Suspects' and as a result one really done need to watch it twice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood needs to make more movies like this. This one has everything you need and gives you a film you'd be proud to take your mother to. There's no sex scenes, no needless violence, any violence in it is part of the story. The Sixth Sense is one movie that could have been made in the 1940's. That is how good it is. On first viewing I admit, I was a little bored on the seemingly slow pace, but in the end you find out why some of the characters behaved oddly and it all comes together and on a second viewing you can truly appreciate the need for the pace of it. Do not miss this one, you will not be able to forget it. Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment are fantastic and Olivia Williams as Willis' wife, I especially loved the performance of Toni Collette as Cole's mother. I hope to see more of her. I felt for her and completely believed the character. M. Night Shamalan should be proud, and please, Hollywood, send him and the whole crew more screenplays and scripts. Thank you to all those responsible for this film. A job well done.</fullReview>

Great Acting by everyone but Bruce Out shines!(what the hell happened at the OSCARS!)3/ The director did his best to cover the master ending, totally vintage!.4/ Osment. For a little kid he does very well!.5/ When i first watched the film i thought yeah this is ok, then about 5 minutes from the end i realised that it was lagging on until the amazing show down. i talked about it for a week!. I've seen a lot of films and i have to say that this is the best thriller ever!. enjoy bav.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie - certainly the best one about the supernatural I have seen. It is not only thrilling, but thought-provoking and moving - and is refreshingly free from the gore, foul language and gratuitous nudity which has often tarnished the genre. After the explosive opening, the next 30 to 40 minutes seem slow, but then begins the build-up to the amazing climax - surely the best surprise ending since 'Witness for the Prosecution'. Only at the conclusion (and really only after a second viewing) does one see that the deliberate pacing of the earlier part was essential, that the apparent plot implausibilities are in fact perfectly logical, and how beautifully scripted and directed the film is. Moreover, all the essential supernatural elements of the story have been reliably reported by reputable parapsychologists. Bruce Willis (not the most obvious choice for the role of a child psychologist) is a revelation, Haley Joel Osment is a genuine find, and Toni Collette and Olivia Williams give faultless support. It is a disgrace that this movie won only a single Academy Award, for Editing - and particularly that M. Night Shymalan was not given the Oscar, at least for Best Screenplay. A film that restores your faith in modern Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having heard so much about how amazing the twist in the tail of this film is, and having missed it at the cinema, I spent a good few months scrupulously avoiding all reviews, articles etc which might possibly have hinted at what was going to happen, only to have all my hard work undone just a few weeks before the video came out (damn you Daisy Donovan). In spite of this I watched the film trying my hardest not to think about what I'd heard (i.e. trying to figure out how it was going to work out every two minutes or so) and still it was an awesome, staggering surprise at the end. Perhaps shrewder people would have found it a little trite from this viewpoint, but I had been expecting a simple horror movie, lots of running about screaming being chased by evil monsters type thing. What you get in the end, though it does provide plenty of jump-out-of-your-seat and shudder-with-fear moments, was a profound, touching, moving story about love and loss, which left me, hardened cynical old movie buff, beaming like a crazy thing at having seen such a great film, and my wife in floods of tears. A truly wonderful film, all the better for its lack of razzmatazz, the downbeat, restrained feel running through the grey-faced performances of all its excellent stars, the use of colours, the music, every aspect perfect through and through. Maybe on reflection there are a few niggling points, maybe they should have built more on how the boy sorts out his problem with the dead people and his relationship with his mother, but as an overall cinematic experience it's very, very impressive.</fullReview>

Oh, and he has another problem too - his relationship with his wife has soured. Malcolm helps Cole come to terms with his problem, which in turn helps him, Malcolm, come to terms with his own. Cute, no ?Well, that's how the movie opens; somewhat slower-paced than one would have liked, and even bumbling and incoherent in spots - like the kid Cole messing about the dead girl's house. Also, the scene where Malcolm talks to the kid about the state of his marriage seemed a lot like the conversation between the kid and the old man in "Home Alone". A gnawing fear had begun to creep in at that point that this was turning into another ghastly "feel good" movie.Luckily, the surprising twist in the end more than made up for all that. Hard to tell whether the movie bungles initially because the director just couldn't help it, or because he wanted to lull the viewer into tedium before delivering a solid parting punch. Either way, it packs quite a wallop with that ending.For first time viewers - do not switch off (except to make out) because the movie began to get boring. I did, and I now feel like I have to see the movie again to appreciate some details (and to nitpick on some others).</fullReview>

I like how IMDB's comments screening doesn't allow for spoilers because this ending must be observed in all of it's majesty. I have made it my mission that no one hear the ending by word of mouth, but instead see it. It's almost fun to make people figure it out, in the months since it's release I have seen the film about a dozen times. Every time I see it like to have someone there that hasn't seen this masterpiece yet. The reactions are almost as good as the film. If you haven't seen this yet, see it.

		<fullReview>This is a movie that should be seen over and over. "The Sixth Sense" had everything from a plot that was so well thought out it made me really think about what came next. This truly is a thrill ride that will leave everyone on the edge of their seats wondering what will happen next. I'm very glad to see that I was fortunate to figure out what the movie was about the first time I saw it. I have since seen several times and it keeps getting better each time I have seen it. The plot is laced with twists and turns that will keep the mind working well after it is over. Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment kept me on my toes wondering what would happen next with each scene they were in and each word they spoke because it was a clue to the finale. "The Sixth Sense" was so powerful and thought provoking that I wanted to be in it because I wanted to find out what it was like to be in one of the year's best movies.I can't give enough praise to the young actor Haley Joel Osment who gave one of the best performances by an actor young or old. Bruce Willis has finally found has made the best decision of his career by selecting the role of Dr. Malcolm Crowe. Bruce Willis makes me glad I watch movies because he is just so good. I was surprised to see how good Olivia Williams was in this film. I saw her in "The Postman" and she was not quite used to her full potential. I'm glad that this role allowed her to flourish as an actress. She has proven to be a hot commodity in Hollywood and deserves to be in more movies.I'm proud to say that this is one of the best movies I've seen in my whole life.</fullReview>

Knight Shalmayan, he tries to get the best out of his actors even Bruce Willis. But overall this is a well acted and directed thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is a good film but the twist is pretty obvious, and the pace of the film is incredibly slow. But what made the film worth watching are the top performances from Bruce Willis and Toni Collette, I also thought the Osement kid was good, but his performance was hyped up. He was no better then the child from 'Mercury rising' in fact in my opinion he was not as good as that kid. I gave this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense has moved me in ways that no other movie has ever done. After seeing it on opening weekend, I have gone to the theatre three times with the intention of seeing something else - yet everytime I have ended up seeing 6th Sense again.This is a movie of extraordinary power. It speaks to all of our human emotions and conditions: fear, uncertainty, guilt, isolation, love, hope, peace, etc...If this movie disappointed you, maybe the misleading trailer should be blamed. In my opinion, this is not a horror movie, nor is it a thriller. It's a drama with supernatural overtones. It is also the most heart wrenching love story I have ever come across.SPOILERS!!! SPOILERS!!! SPOILERS!!!!Whilst Haley Joel Osment (Cole) is absolutely magnificent, I don't agree that he played the lead, as some would suggest. Another user put it very well when she said that the movie was about one man's journey into the afterlife. It is in making this journey, that Malcolm (beautifully played by Bruce Willis) meets up with Cole, the link between the living world and the one that Malcolm now occupies. Malcolm, tormented by guilt about his failure as both a psychologist and a husband, is neither willing nor ready to let go. Ultimately, they help each other accept and understand their respective journeys. And in the process, a mother and child find each other, and a husband makes his peace with his grieving wife. "Goodnight, Sweetheart" is a line so filled with meaning that it will stay in my heart forever.The fact that I have seen this movie four times, obviously indicates that it was not its ending that did it for me. I got that part when I read the plotline. Rather, it's the incredible atmosphere and power of the characters' emotions that spoke to me. So if you figured out the ending and was disappointed by the rest, a second viewing may just change your mind.10/10 with NO reservations!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't have much things to say about this movie that hasn't be said yet. But I'll say that the brilliant thing about this movie is: Even if I did understand what the end will be at the middle of the movie the ending is just fabulous. The way they explain it, is just amazingly great. I'm not really emotional when I'm watching a movie but I have to confess my body was totally submerged by emotion. Those kinda feelings you rarely have. And Sixth Sense gave them to me. I guess it would have been even better if I wouldn't have get it but I'm not disappointed. So my last advice beside going to see it or rent it is "If you have a really are perspicacious or aware of details, you really should relax and not thinking so much =) I hope you'll enjoy this movie as much as I did</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without listing any plot spoilers, I will simply say this: The Sixth Sense is most emphatically *not* a horror movie. It is a BEAUTIFUL and PROFOUND film about more subjects than apparent on first view. And it is STUNNINGLY well-made! Overall production quality puts this film in the top 10% of films -- music, cinematography, acting, writing, etc., are all MAGICAL. Bruce Willis gave us his finest work in this film. And that boy, Haley Joel Osment -- WOW. See the film; you'll see why he got an Oscar nomination -- the kid was *10* years old when filming.Check out the DVD to see the filmmaker talk about how he was "guided" in the making of this film, by a force beyond himself. This film *will* stay with you after you've seen it.One last thing -- SEE IT MORE THAN ONCE: you will be amazed at the things you didn't notice the first time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genuinely thoughtful and well made thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been waiting for ages to see this film, having missed at the local cinema. I have avoided all of the reviews and spoilers, and my perseverance was rewarded. This film is so subtle, so beautifully constructed, so well acted, that it is a real treat for anyone who likes their thrillers made with intelligence, rather than scaring your pants off with blood and gore.Everyone will identify with Cole, wonderfully played by Hayley Joel Osment. We have all had that feeling of being scared of the dark, hiding in our safe place, feeling the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, with no logical explanation why. He manages to convey, with just a look, the true, paralysing horror of what he has seen. A word of congratulation must be added here for the director, M. Night Shyamalan. It would have been so easy to cultivate a performance that included lots of screaming and eye rolling.Bruce Willis and Toni Colette also give terrific performances; the best seen from Bruce in a long time.I won't give away the ending, but if you enjoyed the sense of pervading eeriness, as in The Woman in Black, then you will enjoy this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The official Hollywood name for a film that comes out of nowhere to break box office records and upset the gravy chain is a 'sleeper'. There have been a fair few in the last couple of years, including THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, and even THE MATRIX, which came as a huge shock to the Lucasfilm empire! But how refreshing it is when a small film suddenly makes it big in a world where everything is starting to get a bit too predictable. THE SIXTH SENSE did exactly that, as well as thrill us, shock us, and ultimately move us.One should not 'review' this film in the literal sense. To do this would spoil a first-time viewing, not only in the plot but also the level at which this film operates. Sadly films like these become victims of their own hype, and one should remember to treat it as just a movie, albeit a very good one. The leads are all exceptional, the writing is superb and James Newton Howard has excelled himself with a spooky, but emotionally haunting score.If you haven't seen THE SIXTH SENSE, then stop reading this right now and go and see it! One tip though - if you rent this title, leave enough time for two viewings...</fullReview>

They did a fantastic job of the script, not too many giveaways of the twist in the ending which I am sure everyone knows by now. The acting quality of Haley was superb - that boy is definately going somewhere is Hollywood and putting him with such a gifted actor as Willis made him shine. An emotional rollercoaster ride throughout the second half I thought, it really tugs at your heartstrings ( well mine anyway). 20 out of 20, a must see film again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And I still love it. I can honestly say at this point that The Sixth Sense is my favorite movie ever. In my opinion, it's better than The Shawshank Redemption, American Beauty, Dr. Strangelove, The Usual Suspects, and every other truly great movie I've ever seen. To use a common but appropriate cliche, The Sixth Sense is genius.And it has so little to do with the ending, which seems a common fixation in this forum. I love the atmosphere, the low-key performance of Bruce Willis, the breathless acting of Haley Joel Osment, the brilliant usage of color and setting, and the overall quiet and meditative pace of the film. Shyamalan seems to have a real "less is more" philosophy of directing, and it works to this movie's advantage again and again. A superb movie, and still a 10/10 in my book. Do see it, if you haven't.</fullReview>

The director ought to have won the Oscar as he has this uncanny knack of making ever scene in the film filled with tension and anticipation and the climax is brilliant.... What ought to be a lesson to all other film-makers is that both in the direction and writing the movie is not overdone and in many scenes slightly under-stated giving an air of reality and realism to this scary and thought provoking masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've got an unusual story to tell you about "The Sixth Sense". When I first saw this movie when it first came out last August, I didn't care for it that much. Then the movie continued to make tons of money at the box office. I kept asking myself "did I see this movie the wrong way?" I didn't find it all that scary. When I go to see a horror film, I expect some scares and shocks and this movie didn't seem to provide that. Then this past February it got 6 Oscar nominations including Best Picture. So on the basis of that, I went back to see it a second time. And you know what? It turns out that this movie is pretty good after all. The second time I saw "The Sixth Sense" I saw the movie as a drama instead of a horror film and on that basis it works. The one thing I do agree on (even when I saw it the first time) is the outstanding performance by eleven-year-old Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear, the boy who "see's dead people". He's terrific in this film. I hope we'll see lots of him in years to come. Also terrific, Australian actress Toni Collette as Lynn, Cole's mother. I didn't even know see was from Down Under since she's playing an American. I was very happy that Osment and Collette received Oscar nominations for their performances here (I think they both should have won). Bruce Willis, who was not recognized by the Academy (unfairly), gives one of the best performances of his career as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, the child psychologist who tries to help the boy. "The Sixth Sense" is a well made thriller from an unknown writer-director, M. Night Shyamalan, who received Oscar nominations for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. Too bad he had to lose both (if "The Sixth Sense" had been based on a novel and Shyamalan had adapted the novel to the big screen, he would have won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay; the movie didn't have a chance against "American Beauty"). "The Sixth Sense" is definitely one of the biggest sleeper hits ever. Good job by all.*** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film with THAT twist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is all too often the case that a film will come along amidst a blaze of publicity and ultimatly fail to meet expectations. On the other hand once every few years a film will come out with little if any real hype and blow the competition away. In 1999 this film was The Sixth Sense. The premise is really very simple, "boy sees dead people" and were this a typical Hollywood picture this is exactly all you would have. However writer/director M. Night Shymalam brings a fresh approach which opens new possibilities that many others would not have wasted time or valuable budget on. For example, the special effects are kept to a bare minimum, so that when you do see something horrific it is genuinley disturbing unlike some films i.e. The Haunting. As with most films this one must rely on the performance of it's leading man or in this case boy. In this role Haley Joel Osment is a revelation, cue oscar nomination. He has excellent support from a brilliantly understated Bruce Willis and fellow oscar nominee Toni Collette. Finally for those of you who have been living in outer space, this film has a twist in it's tail that turns your whole perspective of the movie upside down, and this is certainly one of the reasons for it's huge box office sucess, (many people were going back to see it again). However I was one of the unlucky ones who had been told the ending in advance, but I have to say it didn't spoil my enjoyment one little bit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, I have watched this twice now and I must admit, an ending has never done more to shatter my illusion that I can't be completely fooled for 110 minutes. My hat is off to not only the director, but every friend I have that could have innocently spoiled this movie but didn't. I knew not of a surprise ending going in, and it definitely makes viewing #1 thoroughly enjoyable.OK, now to the holes. Most of them really are covered pretty nicely. And if they're not, well, as Howard Stern once said, "For this movie, ya gotta suspend disbelief!"Let's begin with the seemingly random use of extreme cold. This is the big, stinking, glarer of the whole film. It's used arbitrarily for effect, and omitted during scenes where had it been used, the surprise would have been wrecked early. I admit it's a bit of a cheat, so I won't use space defending it. If logic dictated all, Superman would never have gotten away with a pair of glasses and a comb-over for a suitable disguise. Forgive and forget.Now, for the lack of a bullet hole. Cole does say that "they only see what they want to see." That explains Malcolm's not noticing he had a gaping exit wound in his lower back. As far as Cole not seeing it, well...the entrance wound was below the belt, and I never saw Cole standing behind Malcolm sans sportcoat. Shaky, I know...but how does Jimmy Stewart not notice Kim Novak #2 for God's sake! My point is, even the classics falter under the weight of heavy scrutiny.The performances here neutral out any shortcuts taken to sustain the film. Bruce plays a low-key role with the same Everyman Having a Really Lousy Day quality he's brought to saving the world, a building, an airport, etc. Say what you want about the guy, but if the Martians showed up with space lasers cocked for real, who would you call? I really believed this character and it's a testament to his skills that he never appears to be condescending onscreen to his co-star, a common trap in adult-child pairings.That brings me to little Forrest Gump, Jr. (Yes, THAT'S where you saw that kid before!) This was a big-time ACTING role, not a throw a cute kid into a harrowing situation and film his "horrified" reactions in cut-away shots. There were a couple of occasions where you could see him "act", but mostly, he handled quite a few different emotions with startling accuracy. I look forward to watching his career unfold. He's gonna be a good one, as long as he never, ever, ever finds himself left "Home Alone".It's impossible to review this film without coming eventually to "The Usual Suspects." I've never cared for that film, because the ending never raises any valid questions that had never been considered before the surprise was revealed. On that count, this movie comes through in spades. After the first viewing, my head swirled with "But, wait a minute..."'s, which began overlapping into each other as pieces fell together. The number of user comments on this film supports this point: This movie COMMANDS discussion, and that is no small feat.One more thing WHAT THE HECK IS UP WITH MOM'S SOUP? What possible back-story would motivate a woman to feed soup to her child made from Winona Ryder's "Heathers" recipe book? That was a VERY CHILLING scene, and was an interesting way to confirm to Malcolm and the audience that this ghost business was for real...but talk about coming out of nowhere!!I give this movie an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello. Yesterday I watched the Sixth Sense again, and I would like to share with you the impressions that this movie caused on me since the first time I saw it. I really enjoyed the Sixth Sense and believe that it has a very good plot and script, but, it didn't surprise me; since the moment I heard that the ending would surprise me, I knew that one of them was dead... It was logical. In the 60's there was a movie with an ending like this, Carnival of Souls, so, I didn't see anything I haven't seen before. Haley Joel Osment performance was superb. And I must say that Bruce Willis' too. It's a real pity that he has done so many bad movies before (Die Hard 1, 2, 3, etc)(Just keep out of this list Pulp Fiction, Last Man Standing and Twelve Monkeys) because The Academy seldom forgives... Probably he will receive an Oscar someday in 25 years... And Toni Collete, it is always nice to see her... Muriel's Wedding is one of my favorite movies... This movie was very good, but I can't say it is the best psichological thriller I have ever seen... That place still belongs to "What ever happened to Baby Jane?"...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a wonderful, wonderful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first sent in my IMDB comments on The Sixth Sense right after I saw it in September. We got the DVD version two weeks ago and have watched it twice again. For me, this movie gets better each time I see it.The first time I didn't know what to expect and was truly surprised and stunned. The second time, knowing what was going to happen, I was able to see it from a different perspective.After the second viewing we watched the DVD extras, including an interview with M. Night Shyamalan that addressed many questions that I've seen raised here in the IMDB comments, such as why it gets very cold in some scenes and not in others, the pointed use of the color red in certain scenes, etc. That allowed me to look at the movie a third time with yet another perspective.I was able to appreciate the performances of the actors even more the second and third time around. Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis were nothing short of brilliant in conveying exactly what they needed to convey. Toni Colette was marvelous (the scene in the car gets me misty-eyed every time). But Olivia Williams, as Willis' wife, had one of the toughest roles, which I didn't appreciate until I saw the movie for the second time.When I read the User Comments from people who didn't like the movie, I wonder if they could possibly have seen the same movie I saw! I would highly recommmend watching the DVD version to see Shyamalan's comments, several excellent deleted scenes and lots of other goodies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BAD...???? I don't think so...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS !!!!!I have been reading some of the prior comments, and a little group of them kept me thinking about. I don't know if this is or not the best movie of 1999, but, as for me, IT WAS. The greatest I saw (that year), for sure. Very intelligent. This is not `Vertigo' or `Scream', Why to compare? It's something totally different. Of course, people who is too busy confronting it with another films, searching clues or waiting for scarecrows, will hardly appreciate the GENUINE FRIGHTFUL situation of a child who is feeling totally alone in THIS world. The only people who take him serious, are all DEAD and angry. No one is there to take off his fear. Not even his mother can do anything, because of his silence and because she's got two jobs, no helping hand and a small son smarter than she. All the time you wonder if he is going to become into another Vincent Grey. THAT'S HORROR, and that's drama. I wasn't so much smart: I didn't guess the end. Some people said it was obvious, I don't think so. I saw the movie on august '99 and i didn't heard much about it. Nobody persuaded me about a great ending, so i didn't was in speculator role. But because of that, I will hardly forget that moment. It's the best: to start to remember that overlooked clues once I have been scoffed. Better than feeling smarter than Shyamalan. I have neither found so much mistakes.: some guys are asking (banal) thingslike: ` Why was Cole afraid of every ghost but Malcolm ?' `Why did every ghost appear in a form that showed how they died except Malcolm? They were all bloody and disfigured; why not Malcolm? Where was the bullet hole in his shirt and the blood?'`(Clearly the biggest question is): why it was never cold when Malcolm was in the room (with lots of people)except in the very last scene with his wife?' Well, I couldn't say that those are mistakes: According to the film, a ghost is the denial of someone's own death. Cole explains that: `they don't know they're dead'. But they're looking for Cole's help, because they have died with fright or anger, and estimating that they could die. Instead, Malcolm died with GUILT. He's desire of bring help to Cole, it's stronger than his need of help. He had never estimated his death, he didn't see the gun before than Vincent's shot. He don't know or don't care about the bullet hole, so he don't show it, he can't. (I suppose that a ghost must look like its own idea of it self) He's neither angry or MAD, so why it supposes to be cold before the end??? (or when he suspects about his wife, of course) And, after all, how can you be sure it wasn't cold? It's really necessary to show lots of people in shiver with the cold of one only ghost?? I mean, in the restaurant or in the theater. It would be stupid. On the other hand, Cole really needs someone trustworthy. After all, he is just a child, and Malcolm is not like a ghost supposes to be, so, even if he notice something, he is who has to believe what he want , in this case.Anyway, if you remember their leave-taking, you can wonder how much did Cole really know about him.Now, think about this: This has to be a great movie if people still talks about it this way. Still spends money and time on it (THIS WAY). Shyamalan is so very intelligent. He made a masterpiece of the late 90's. A turning point. He knows how to play with our mind (nicely) and, obviously, he knows what people wants. This is a simple but powerful story.And, anything else: why all this prejudice about Bruce Willis? He's not a bad or less actor. He's really good doing he's part, what ever he play. This is a good performance, but is not his best. And neither a surprise. I must mention his `James Cole', in `12 monkeys', one of the best performances I saw, ever. That was a very dramatic and intricate role. It was something truly confuse and he made it really credible.I don't like most of his movies, but it means nothing about him. He is really great anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprise Ending worth the Wait!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most enjoyable films of this type that I have watched in years. Acting was great. You are never quite sure where it is all going, but when it gets there, all the clues given along the way make sense at last. Unless someone tells you what it is, you will never guess the ending, and I guess that is the mark of a good film. I am an action, adventure fan, so the pace is a little slow at times, but I still rated it a 10. Rent it and Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>*This* surprised people? Slow movie, good performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, I watched The Sixth Sense in April 2000 on the DVD I had purchased a week earlier. I had tried very hard to avoid any discussion of the movie (as I always do with any movie) until I had a chance to see it. The one thing I had heard (before I could change the TV channel) was that there was a "big surprise" at the end.Now, I am an average guy, maybe a bit above average in education. And I will try not to give away the "surprise" here, in case you haven't seen the movie, yet. But the "big surprise" was obvious to me 17 minutes into the film. It was so obvious to me by the time it was "revealed" that I had thought, in a scene where the boy and the doc agree that their therapy is over, that both parties *already acknowledged* the surprise in that scene and were saying goodbye. At the time, I thought, with some admiration, "This is a pretty subtle way to make that realization occur." So imagine my confusion when a few minutes later we get the big, dramatic scene where one of the characters *finally* does realize what's what. I was in disbelief ... "You mean he *didn't know*?" I wondered.I don't get it. "The Crying Game" had a "big surprise" that was obvious as soon as they showed the "female" character's face. And now this. Am I somehow amazingly intuitive or is everyone else slow? I mean, when you see the doc sitting in the boy's apartment across from the mother and *no one is talking* doesn't that give you a big clue? And the fact that earlier no one seemed irked at the loud conversation in the church? And once you realize that, and note similar instances as the movie progresses, isn't it obvious?Perhaps because I saw no surprise, this movie seemed very slow to me. A lot of worried looks on the kid's face as he avoid various feelings or actual encounters with dead people. And very few interactions with the dead people. To me, the best scene by far was at the wake for the little girl who died. The movie should have had 2-3 additional examples like that, instead of a lot of peeking around corners by the boy.Still, the actors did a very good job. For that reason alone I gave this movie a 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Am I the only person who couldn't stand this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was I the only person on the face of the Earth who didn't succumb to the completely dumbed-down storyline of this movie? I took a guess at what the "big twist" would be within maybe the first 5-10 minutes of this film, and for the next two hours, I had to sit and be forcibly spoon-fed every possible indication the my assumption was correct. Yeah yeah, Haley Joel Osmont IS a very talented young actor, and I have no doubt he's going places... but I have never seen Bruce Willis have less range in character (as Malcolm) in any movie he's ever done. He sits (or stands... either way, he never seems to move) for the entire duration of the film, looking haggard and hung over, whispering 90% of his dialogue, and speaking the remaining 10% in a dull monotone. *yawn*If I have to actually sit and think to myself during a movie about whether or not it will end the way I know it will, then I'm obviously not getting into it. Osmont's character Cole was interesting, indeed, but the remaining characters, aside from Malcolm, had little if nothing to do with the plot other than to bolster our belief in the central character. Once they get their screentime, they really didn't have to be there anymore, and so, why not introduce entirely unrelated characters and events to further the plot? The Sixth Sense's storyline does that in spades.I find it VERY hard to believe that so many people are so lacking in their intelligence and/or attention span that they never picked up on what the "big twist" was until the end. It couldn't have been more obviously spoon-fed if they just came out and told you what it was at the beginning. I don't feel that the resolution was effective either (I can't even remember a climax... unless that was the "big twist"?). It seemed to leave every question answered and little to question or remember the film by.I was sincerely disappointed with The Sixth Sense. I expected a fairly decent mystery/drama/ghost story with some intelligent, well-thought-out story development, and a good cast of characters. Instead there is little intelligence needed by the viewer to enjoy the movie, and one good character to get interested in. I think my cat even knew what was going on with this movie... probably why she wanted to leave before it was over.- Martin Lettvin</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lesson in fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE SIXTH SENSE is a dramatic lesson in fear that borrows heavily from 19th-century literature (especially the stream-of-consciousness technique pioneered by Victorian writer Ambrose Bierce). A truly powerful masterpiece, it accomplishes its objective without gratuitous violence or gore and with only a little nudity and swearing. Yet the fear factor itself is raw and mesmerizing enough to scare you - if you allow yourself to be scared. Taking a break from playing the action hero is Bruce Willis, who portrays a child psychologist with a dark secret of which even he is unaware. Haley Joel Osment is a delightfully unconventional little boy who lives in a tent, speaks fluent Latin, and plays with toy soldiers in church. He also can communicate directly with "dead people" (i.e. ghosts). The movie juxtaposes the real world and the land of the dead in a casual manner that just adds to the suspense. And as I said before, it is all done very subtly and without a lot of sickening blood or violence. THE SIXTH SENSE will surely go down in history, along with PULP FICTION, BRAVEHEART, AMERICAN BEAUTY, and FARGO as one of the greatest films of the 1990s. So see this movie soon. It will terrify you - and restore your faith in the motion picture industry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I already saw this movie a couple of months ago, but decided to send in a review after all because it just got way too many credits. I was horribly disappointed. First of all, how could anyone call this a horror movie, it's a psychological drama with only one or two scenes that could be described as -slightly- creepy. It's not a bad movie, it just doesn't do much to me, there's no thrills, no false scares, the few ghosts are all very tame and in my opinion the little kid was pretty annoying. The movie goes on and on in the same pace, doesn't have any real highlights, no memorable moments, and the end (though it was kinda interesting) wasn't the roaring climax i was secretly hoping for. But still worth a look. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

Shyamalan provides an excellent and gut wrenching story which shows his range when you consider his prior film was "Wide Awake" which was a beautiful tear jerker of a film. this movie also has it's moments.

		<fullReview>First of all, forgive me. I read about the ending before actually seeing the movie. Now, some of you may think that it ruined the film, but it one way, it enhanced it. Now, I tried to figure out the clues to the end, and I was stumped. I just couldn't figure it out.  Anyway, now to the film. This is a supremely effective chiller that is one of the quietest horror films ever (it whispers the scares). This is the first film I've seen with Toni Collette in, and she did impress me (though she didn't deserve her nomination). Her scenes with Haley Joel Osment are minor marvels. Osment deserved all the praise he received for his performance. The subtle shifts in emotion were alone worthy of the nomination. I would have given him the Oscar over Caine (but not over Cruise, Law, or the unnominated Bentley). Bruce Willis is in his 'strong, silent type' mode, but that didn't bother me. The reason the film didn't deserve it's oscar nomination was because the film wasn't among the five best of the year. There were many far more challenging and powerful films in 1999 (however, had it been another year, I probably would have embraced the nomination). M. Night Shyamalan deserved the praise for his script, but didn't deserve the nomination over Three Kings or The Straight Story. I was surprised that this film didn't get the win for film editing (it was the best of the five, yes-- better than Matrix or Beauty). This is a film that was a haunting beauty, and I will see it again (and I'll probably buy it too.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had waited a while to see this film, I had heard heaps about it - mostly that there was a real twist at the end. So when I watched it a few days ago, I looked for the twist from the start. Lets just say that if you are looking for it- its fairly easy to find- there are clues everywhere! This took a way the shock value that other viewers may have had when the surprise ending came about. The twist is good, and if I had not been looking for it- I probably would not have found it, or picked up on the clues. I didn't think it was as scary as what people said. In fact I thought as it more as a psychological drama. Bruce Willis was particularly good in his role, and I feel it is a shame that he was overlooked in the best actor category for the various film awards. This is a very good film, it is well written, directed acted, although not scary as such it does give you the chills in a couple of places. Well worth seeing, and watching again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The #1 Thriller of all time? Not quite, but a good watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sixth Sense" is a schitzophrenic movie. If you can make it through the first hour and 20 minutes of this one, it starts to pick up steam very very quickly. The storyline consists of a psychologist's attempt to help a young boy with a terrifying problem. He can see dead people. These lost souls communicate with the boy on a constant basis, needing something. Help? Revenge? No one knows, until Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) enters the picture. Dr. Crowe is fighting his own personal demons as a year before a patient with similiar symptoms to this boy reveals that Dr. Crowe failed to help him.Bruce Willis puts his all into the role of Dr. Crowe, and you can watch his face grow more and more haggard and emotional as he realizes he may not be able to help this boy, especially as his life at home begins to deteriorate due to his efforts. This has emerged as one of Bruce's best roles in recent times and will stand as a true sign that he has matured as an actor.Haley Joel Osment stars as Cole, the young boy with the huge secret. He is the real star of this movie, portraying the pain his character is suffering with an amazing dexterity and touch. You feel this young man can really see ghosts, and react with his level of terror once we see them as well. The Academy went with longevity over the true best supporting actor this year, and I hope to see Haley Joel win the Oscar he richly deserves in the very near future.Toni Collette is the only other real character in the movie, playing Cole's mother. She comes off a bit dry for a mother struggling to understand and find a cure for what ails her son, but overall is a strong character and feels real enough.There really is no supporting cast to speak of. Malcolm's wife, Cole's teacher and the ghosts of the dead are the only real supporting characters in this one. Filler mostly, although one dead soul has a bit more importance to the unfolding of the last half hour, and I wish I had caught her name. "The Sixth Sense" was a sleeper hit, and I feel got as much overkill from media outlets as "The Blair Witch Project" did, and like TBWP got a major boost in its audience from that. Is it a good movie? The answer is yes, the last half hour (and it's rather stunning final plot twist) is strong enough to carry the weight of the rather lengthy and droll first hour. Is it a thriller? To some extent, but packs nowhere near the "thrill" of a "Halloween" or "Silence of The Lambs".2 1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

Night Shyamalan has to fudge all over the place to keep the surprise ending a surprise. In my comments here, I have commented many times on the dangers of writers directing their own work. In almost every case, the director lacks the necessary objectivity to identify and excise plot flaws. In this case they were glaring.Many questions come to mind. Why was Cole (Haley Joel Osment) afraid of every ghost but Malcolm (Bruce Willis)? Why did every ghost appear in a form that showed how they died except Malcolm? They were all bloody and disfigured; why not Malcolm? Where was the bullet hole in his shirt and the blood? I watched the movie a second time and there were a number of scenes where he had no jacket. He always wore the same shirt, but there was no bullet hole or blood in any scene.Clearly the biggest question is why it was never cold when Malcolm was in the room except in the very last scene with his wife (Olivia Williams). He was in scenes with Cole's mother (Toni Collette), a restaurant full of people, a theater full of parents, a doctor, and on and on and yet in no scene did anyone seem remotely chilly, no less seeing their breath.So, I have a fundamental problem calling this a great motion picture. However, it was very well filmed from a technical standpoint and produced some excellent suspense throughout that kept the viewer engaged.The acting was fair to excellent. Toni Collette was mediocre at best as Cole's mother. She overacted in almost every scene and her chemistry wasn't very good with the boy until the last scene when he told her what her mother said. Likewise, Olivia Williams didn't bowl me over as Malcolm's wife.Bruce Willis gave a good performance, but he is out of his element playing the sensitive and self doubting type. He always comes across as a bit whiny when he tries to play nice guy parts. His forte is playing the tough, strong courageous type and he would best serve his career by staying with those types of parts.Finally, there is young Haley Joel Osment as Cole. He gave an excellent performance and was the linchpin that held the whole film together. He was very versatile in his portrayal of various emotions. He handled fear, playfulness, affection and anger with equal aplomb. His physiognomy was right for the part as well, as he looked very nerdy and self conscious, exactly what was needed for the part.I rated this film a 7/10.

It was entertaining and it had real potential, but it had too many flaws to realize it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was quite surprised with this debut effort from Shalyman. The actors who were excellently cast in their roles(the mother, the son, and the psychologist) do a more than adequate job with the chilling tale. Shalyman himself does a great job of slowly unveiling the terrifying world inhabited by the dearly departed and the movie really draws you in effectively. The scenes in which the horrors seen by the boy are left up to the imagination create the most memorable shivers. While not an entirely original plot through and through (the scene in which Willis' character hears barely distinguishable voices on an audio tape undoubtedly came from the novel "Legion" by William Peter Blatty)"The Sixth Sense" makes for a good old fashioned scare. My only contention is the "surprise" ending as I thought it was totally telegraphed early on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies (like "The Usual Suspects") that you should see twice. Since the ending was revealed to me before I ever saw it, the first time I saw it was like the second time. As much as I enjoyed it from that perspective, I only can imagine what a pleasure it would be to see this movie without knowing the ending! (So see it and then make a solemn vow *never* to reveal any of its secrets to your friends who haven't seen it yet!)The child was spellbinding. I truly wish he and Michael Clarke Duncan of "The Green Mile" had been co-winners of the Oscar for supporting actor, even though no one can convince me that Haley Joel Osment was a *supporting* actor. He was the most critical element of the movie and carried it off better than many, many, many adult actors.Comments on "The Sixth Sense" are difficult because so much of the movie's brilliance lies in its final few minutes. The only thing to say is that this movie is thoroughly enjoyable, and I went into it with a skeptical, it-can't-be-as-good-as-they-say attitude. I was wrong. It can. And it is!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find that a lot of good movies are a disappointment for movie buffs because of all of the press they have to read before they see a movie. This is one of those movies. It is a very good movie, the first time I saw it was when it first came out and I liked it very much. I kind of knew something was up with the dinner on their anniversary and when he could not open the door to the basement. But I liked this movie on a personal level, it made me think a lot. To me that makes for a good movie. So if you have not seen the film, don't go in thinking it is going to be the best movie you have ever seen and pay attention to what is going on. You will enjoy it more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find that most of the negative comments about The Sixth Sense are that it's not scary enough. I, too, was expecting a psychological horror type of film, and other than the suprise ending, I didn't really see what the big deal about this movie was. Upon second viewing, I concentrated more on the relationships between the characters, especially between Cole and Malcom, and found it to be a more satisfying experience. The final scenes between Cole and his mother, and then Malcom and his wife (don't worry, I didn't give the surprise away) were one of the most moving and poignant scenes I've seen. The Sixth Sense, like The Green Mile, is a touching emotional drama, with a hint of the supernatural. Definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't figure it out. What's the big deal with this film? It wasn't the worst thing I've ever seen, but it's nowhere near the top, and certianly not one I would place on a 'best picture' roster. I'm firmly convinced that Willis is incapable of breaking out of his dull monotone, and although Osment was fairly good, several of his scenes left me with my eyes rolling. The dialog for the most part was howlingly stilted, but provided for plenty of laughs. The supposed suprise ending was nothing of the sort, and left me thinking "yeah, so what?" I'm sure Shayamalan is in love with his home town, but the way he presents it is dull and uninspired and makes it look about as fun to live in as the town I'm in. Also I can't figure out why people watch this ten times in a row. I saw it once, got the plot (?!?!) and feel no need, or desire, to watch it again. Every now and then a majorly hyped movie lives up to it's expectations, but this one left me with one thought: "thank God it didn't win Best Picture". If it did I might have to pull the Vincent Grey routine with the Academy voters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thought provoking, chilling, original and just plain entertaining, "The Sixth Sense" is an absolutely wonderful film. This is one film that will leave it's mark on film making for a long time to come. Haley Joel Osment who plays (Cole Sear) is incredibly talented and though he is not new to the big screen this is the one that really got him noticed. So much in fact he was nominated for an Oscar. Bruce Willis plays (Malcolm Crowe) the psychologist that tries to help Cole. Bruce Willis has also never been finer. As he takes a break from his customary tough-guy role to show that he can do a wonderful job in other areas.The film is about a boy that can see dead people and is living in constant fear and wants help, but he must first find someone to believe him before they can help him. You will love the unexpected twists and turns of this film. Don't let this one pass you by.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was nothing special to me. I heard such great reviews about it, and how it was "Scary!" "You'll Be Thinking About It For Days!!"....uh, no! I left the theatre like "That was not very good." I mean, I never knew what the end was gonna end like, but I was never scared the whole time. I didn't jump once. I didn't think about it, except how disappointed I was, days after. It doesn't suck, don't get me wrong, but it is not scary at all.The acting is wonderful, might I say. Haley is such a great actor. I've seen him in movies before and how good he was, but this was a major boost in his career! He had me crying when he explained about 'grandma's pin' in the car after the accident happened. Bruce also has a great role, too. I'm usually expecting him to be a badass/tough guy and it was great to see him caring and more down to earth in this film. Maybe I need to see this film again. Blair Witch was better the second time, maybe this one falls in as well. Blair Witch had me scared for days!! I even had to go camping in Blairville Georgia 3 days later! Anyways, I don't think it was the best film of 1999 by far, but definitely worth watching. I also think I was expecting more than it was, and it led to disappointment. I'm not dyeing to see it again, but I would sit down and watch it if a friend rented it one night at a sleepover.</fullReview>

I was almost in tears because of him.. and no, not because I was scared! :)And the ending was shocking. Brilliant. I think that was the main reason I was so taken with this movie.

		<shortDescription>Interesting film, but is it truly deserving of the praise heaped upon it? *Some spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this on video the first week it was released. My first impression was, "Wow, that was good." Then, I began to think a little bit and more and more holes became apparent.First, consider the score. While praised by a number of the other reviewers, and it was effective, it often slipped into ham-handedness, especially whenever a 'scary looking' ghost was going to appear. I realized how thoroughly the score was manipulating the audience only upon reflection.Second, the dialogue was very stilted and it is credit to Willis, who can indeed act, and to Osment that they were able to convey any emotions whatsoever. Further, Osment should have gotten the Academy Award for being able to handle such awkward lines and still convince the audience that he was a real child.Third, did that ending suck or what? I'm surprised that more people didn't see the plot twist coming, since it was thoroughly obvious from the behavior of Willis by the middle of the movie (i.e. Why wasn't he having conversations with anyone except Osment?). Actually, I didn't even know there was going to be a plot twist of any sort going into the movie, having not paid much attention to buzz and talk about the movie. Further, the flashback and flashback montage revealing 'what really happened' could have been cut entirely, unless the director thought the audience was so stupid that it wouldn't get the previous five minutes and the blood on Willis. Well, maybe audiences are that stupid.On a more upbeat note, the cinematography was really very good, and showed a very fine attention to detail, especially the sweaty palms scene. The only quibble I had was with the lingering shots of Philadelphia landmarks. While they certainly occasionally helped highlight the eerie mood, they weren't always on par with the quality of other shots. Anyhow, still above average there.So, in conclusion, great acting (considering the limitations of the principals), fine cinematography, and an interesting story hampered by manipulative music, bad dialogue and five minutes of ending that could have been cut. Still 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now this is a classic flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when the horror genre was flopping, a movie starring Bruce Willis called The Sixth Sense came to save the day. With great acting, directing, and writing, this movie became a classic. It was creepy, not scary, and had such a great story that touched you in the heart. Now tell me a horror movie thats done that to anybody. Bruce Willis, an underrated actor in my opinion, did a hell of a job playing the role of Dr. Malcolm Crowe who helps a boy, played also greatly by Haley Joel Osment, who sees dead people. Also great writing and directing by M. Night Shayamalan, who is right now in the most famous director list right now. He probably created the most shocking ending of all time in any movie. Pretty much like Hitchcock. Great film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Plot, too Stylistic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I very much enjoyed the ending, and the plot as a whole. I had no problem whatsoever with the acting, I thought it was quite effective. My only problem was with the actual filmmaking. For Art Film lovers, or the more urbane yuppified folks out there, this movie's "atmosphere" is a dream come true. Low key earth tones throughout, yellow filters, use of shadows, (giving the movie a surreal sort of sepia look, along with slight blurring at the edges in daylight scenes), the red bits throughout, lots of use of camera angles and pretty Philadelphia scenery, in fact every element necessary to show a pretty picture with some strange undertones. Quite effective if you don't notice it. My problem is that I did. My husband and I had a discussion afterwards where he wondered why I couldn't just relax and enjoy the movie...my response was that I was shown that it was a movie far too often. In other words, I was constantly struck by the cinema photography and "clues" (red doorknob, etc.) too many times to completely lose myself in the plot. I'm sure that most people are far more relaxed about these things and that I am unnecessarily anal, but when I watch a movie I want to be lost completely in it, not looking at; "Gee, what a clever Director I am! Look at my subdued earth tones! Look at my yellow filters and shadows!". Hitchcock did it well, so you lost yourself in the plot, and in fact this Director gave a bow to Hitchcock in the spiral staircase scene. But Hitchcock was an old master, and this is a fresh young Director, so I would imagine that as he progresses, his movies will become masters as well. All in all I found it mildly enjoyable, with the plot being the best part. If it had been done with less pretentiousness, it would have been perfect.</fullReview>

Everything he does, every expression and gesture he uses, we have all seen in "Moonlighting"--the first and last time Willis was fresh and creative."The Sixth Sense" is an old-fashion thriller. The plot lines are well crafted and flow in a seamless fashion. The movie grabs your attention and never lets go.

		<shortDescription>Not recommended after Kilbourn and before "Tricks and Clues"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense ends with a twist that must have been thrilling to see for those who saw it unprepared, but that pleasure was denied me several months ago by TV's Craig Kilbourn, who purposefully gave it away for a laugh (I will not do that here). Beyond that, the director makes some interesting efforts at being stylish, but this too was partly ruined for me by his own somewhat pretentious `Tricks and Clues' commentary at the end of the video. As for the acting, Bruce was good but much more interesting in Twelve Monkeys and Haley has been overhyped if not overrated. And the overall story, especially the transitional section which precedes the twist, is weak and the pace is slow. Meanwhile, oddly enough, I still laugh at Craig Kilbourn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best I have seen in a long time. Why it didn't receive as many awards as American Beauty is just more proof that politics and viewers' understanding can spoil an exceptional movie. I don't like movies that are obvious copy-cats as opposed to sequels. I've heard some viewers commenting that this movie is just another " so &amp; so ". I say "so &amp; so " because I don't want to give any of the story line away, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Haley Joel Osment did a powerful job. Bruce Willis didn't do the hard, shot 'em up, run for your life thing, and I think most people were expecting the Die Hard John McClain (sp). I think that is why many people didn't come out of the movie feeling satisfied, along with the fact that there is required thinking and acceptance on the viewers part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An ending as much a surprise as the one in "The Sting." Don't bother guessing. There are clues that do lead you to the surprise ending. However, everyone that I know who has seen the film understood the ending because they connected to all of the clues in the movie, once the saw the ending -- OR -- does not understand the ending and someone has to tell them what happened. So far, about a 50/50 split.Don't ruin it for someone who has not see the movie!</fullReview>

I didn't find the film scary in "The Omen" or "The Changeling" sense, which I think is the whole point. Although there are some "jumpy" moments (the music doesn't help), the overall impression is that we should have sympathy for those who have passed away and for some reason, cannot rest.

		<fullReview>I was expecting so much more from this movie....maybe too much! I don't think it deserved to be nominated for "Best Movie of the Year". I don't understand why everybody made such a fuss about the ending...it was soooo predictable. There were so many clues during the movie, it was almost too easy to find it. Because I found the 'big secret" almost from the start, I felt cheated at the end because I thought it would be something much more complex than that...no jaw-dropping here. If you want a "jaw-dropping end", see "The Usual Suspects"...you will be very surprised, I promise you that!Two good things about this movie: Haley and Bruce. Very convincing and touching. But, that was it for me. I was expecting a lot from "The Green Mile" too and I got it; I would of liked to say the same thing of 'The Sixth Sense" but I can't...sorry about that!</fullReview>

The ending of the movie at first doesn't seem to make sense, but then when you look back at the entire film, it makes sense all along. Haley Joel Osment is spectacular as Cole.

After I watched it the first time, I went back and watched the anniversary dinner scene again because of all the scenes in the movie, that one seemed to be the most poignant under the circumstances.

		<shortDescription>" I see dead people,"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard this line given by young Haley Joel Osment during a preview of the movie on TV, I thought it was going to be another one of those movies that has more talk than scare. Therefore, I decided not to go see it, but wait until video. Finally, I read the reviews of the movie in the paper. The Sixth Sense recieved an average of 4 stars out of 4 stars. In the paper, it stated the #1 Thriller of All Time. When I saw this, I decided to go see the movie. Good choice. Bruce Willis plays Dr. Malcom Crowe, and doctor in child psychology. He recently won an award from the mayor of Phildelphia, stating his excellence in the field of child psychology. After losing his former patient to suicide, he decides to help a little boy named Cole Sear, noticing that both his former patient, and little Cole Sear are very similar. There's only one catch, Cole's problem is that he sees dead people, who abuse and torture him. When I stepped out of the theater after the movie was, done, I was amazed. The final ending was pulled off very cleverly. The clues were given to you throughout the whole movie, it's just that you wouldn't have thought they were clues. The acting was magnificent. Haley Joel Osment did an excellent job as Cole(Well deserved Oscar nomination). Bruce Willis was awesome as Dr. Crowe(Yet, there was no nomination in sight). Toni Collete was perfect as Cole's mother(Oscar nominated). All of the actors were great! Finally, I would like to talk about the Oscars. The Sixth Sense did not win even one Oscar out of it's six nominations. That's sad.It's one of the greatest movies of this decade. I would've at least expected the Best Directed Oscar, I mean, come on the ending was pulled of very cleverly. If you haven't seen this movie, go do it. It's even worth buying!</fullReview>

The ending was raise-one-eyebrow "interesting", but hardly a shocking twist. Rent Primal Fear if you want a jaw-dropping TWIST! The movie was ok, but I could have watched it on tv. I'm sour enough over the $4.00 spent on the rental, but would have been in a REAL bad mood, had I plunked down $8.00 to drag through it in the theater. To summarize: With the exception of the child, it was moderately acted. Unoriginal plot. Horribly slow paced. Sadly un-scary. Terribly over-rated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From a directing standpoint, The Sixth Sense is a brilliant piece of work, but the script leaves quite a bit to be desired after you've let it digest. Basically, the whole movie revolves around the "twist ending", but once you've worked your way back through the film, too many holes in the plot emerge. Since I cannot list them here, if you want to discuss it, please feel free to email me. Unfortunately, like Fight Club, this movie suffers from the "ending written before the middle" syndrome of contemporary film making and what could have been a fascinating film ends up being simply above average. Outstanding performances by all the cast members INCLUDING Willis really held this movie together.</fullReview>

Just come up with a "surprise" most people can't guess because the movie is too dull to warrant paying close attention to, get a brand name Hollywood homeboy like Bruce Willis to put his name next to it so you can dump it in some 3000 theatres, oh, and make sure you invoke and imply the "supernatural," and humanoids who apparently don't go to psychics and let a masterpiece "surprise" flick like "Fight Club" flop (because it requires SERIOUS thinking to make it work), they will hand you their 8 bucks over and over again to PROVE that they can figure it out! Believe me, the 200 million bucks this movie has made isn't based on non-repeat viewing only. I don't even want to think about how rich Willis has gotten off you dweebs, he can buy the town you live in and the one next to it with just a few points off the gross. And please, no comparisons to Hitchcock! Hitchcock made movies that SERIOUSLY QUESTIONED SOCIETY while pushing all your buttons and taking your money. The only thing "The Sixth Sense" seriouly questions is the sense of its viewers. This movie allows them to imagine and fantasize that having NO SENSE is actually MAKING SENSE; hence its outrageous popularity among the cretins, probably the same ones who think "The X-Files" is deep. &gt;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll probably be bashed for saying this, but I didn't think the Sixth Sense was that much to scream about (no pun intended). A friend of mine had already told me the ending, but there were so many obvious hints along the way that any observant person would figure it out anyway. After about 20 minutes I found myself wondering when it would be over. Granted, little Haley Joel Osment gives a great performance for a child his age. You really feel the weight of his anguish. But after a while, even his big scary eyes and frightened whisper became too repetitive. The slow pace was just that: slow. It wasn't that suspenseful and certainly not Oscar-worthy like a Hitchcock film. Treat yourself to a well-rounded suspense film like Rebecca and leave Sixth Sense on the shelf.</fullReview>

Before I saw it, I thought it looked like a lame Bruce Willis movie. Not scary at all, but interesting. When I finally saw it, I thought totally different. Before seeing it, I thought it was the last to be given the Oscar for Best Picture. Now, I think it totally deserved to win. It was scary, complicated but easy to understand after some thinking, and simply brilliant. Everybody's making a fuss about the great kid actor Haley Osment, when I think this was definitely the best performance ever by Bruce Willis. The only thing this film lacked was length.

		<shortDescription>Great, but not the greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my experience, there are two kinds of movie trailers: Trailers that take a bad movie and make it look good, and trailers that take a good movie and make it look bad. The Sixth Sense is of the latter category. I saw the trailers, thought it looked stupid - not just because of the presence of Bruce Willis, but just because it didn't look interesting. Then it started getting critical raves, and I figured "what the hell, I'll give it a shot". Boy am I glad I did.I only have one major major problem with the film: The ending. I have an uncanny ability to sniff out twist endings from a mile away ("The Usual Suspects" didn't fool me for a second) and this one's no different. Okay, I'll admit I had the ending spoiled for me ) but even if I hadn't, the "subtle" clues are so blatantly obvious I'm surpised no one else got it...it seems to me like the first time you see Willis and Cole's mom sitting together (like 10 minutes into the film), it should be a simple matter of connecting the dots. And another thing: I wouldn't mind if the twist took up maybe one slightly enigmatic shot. But instead they have to spend like 5 minutes showing us flashbacks, sound bites, etc. etc... Frankly, I thought it was a bit of an insult to my intelligence. But the director (sorry I can't remember his last name) seems like a very smart guy, and I keep having images of him arguing with studio executives, telling him "Oh, you have to add so and so, make it more obvious..." and he finally caves in and does it.But that doesn't matter, because the rest of the film is fantastic. It had a few really really scary parts (the sick girl comes to mind) but it wasn't "terrifying" like everyone says. Blair Witch kept me up a lot more. But it's a very intelligent film, with a good script, creepy score, and kind of understated direction (which is a good thing). What really pulls it all together are the performances: Bruce Willis is genuinely good. He still tends to be a little monotonous, but he shows a lot more emotion and range than, say, Die Hard. Toni Collette was excellent as well. But little Haley Joel Osment...wow! I am truly in awe of his performance. I still think the Supporting Actor category should've been his by a long shot. It would be an amazing performance by an adult, but to come out of an 11-year old boy...wow! The scene towards the end of him and his mom in the car truly had me choking up. And the creepiest scene in the movie doesn't even involve ghosts: it's simply Haley Joel's monologue in the hospital bed about seeing dead people. The expression on his face, his barely-a-whisper delivery, the faintest hints of tears at the corners of his eyes...it sent shivers up my spine, and trailer clips simply do not do the scene justice.All in all a great movie. American Beauty was the only best picture nominee that actually deserved to be nominated in the first place. Cider House Rules? Come on...I could make a list of better movies from 1999, but I won't. One of the best of the year, but not in the top 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot holes and one poor acting job still left my opinion of The Sixth Sense a high one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May contain mild spoilers.I didn't get a chance to see this movie when it was out in theaters, so it was a combination of rave reviews from my friends and the bundle of Oscar nominations that led me to Blockbuster on the day of the video release of The Sixth Sense. It was okay, but definitely not what I expected. The trailers portrayed this film as if the majority of it consisted of Cole Sear being frightened and cajoled by ghosts (one example is the scene between Cole and the poisoned girl in her bedroom. Commercials seemed to imply she was chasing him). This was not so. Instead, he didn't reveal his "secret" to his psychiatrist until the movie was halfway over. Even though "I see dead people" was the most overplayed line in the commercials, the movie left me under the impression that the audience wasn't supposed to know. As for the twist, any sharp and clever person can figure it out prior to its revelation. I am not one of these people, so it was surprising for me.I guess I just expected this movie to be more terrifying than it really was. I thought the twist would be of the frightening, makes-you-jump variety.Also, there were some forgivable but annoying holes in the plot, as other people have mentioned. The one unforgivable element was Bruce Willis. He was expressionless, and this dragged the movie down (like the scene where Cole's "secret" was revealed, ugh!). Haley Joel Osment's performance, however, was incredible. He deserved the Oscar. He'll probably get one later, the same way Whoopi Goldberg was passed over for The Color Purple but got one for Ghost, instead.All in all, a worthwhile movie to see. The scenery is great, and the storyline is interesting if you let your imagination fill the gaps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimately disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was probably one of the handful of the people that totally missed this film theatrically and still managed to not hear the "secret", but I was ultimately disappointed when I did finally see the film.The "secret" was so painfully obvious in the first twenty minutes that once I had guessed it the rest of the film was simply a game of seeing if what I was watching confirmed it....and inevitably it did.I was also confused about so much effort being put into establishing the presence of spirits in the child's apartment, but when the plot was expanded to him 'listening' to them he instead seeks out another, entirely new character. What did the battered wife or the suicidal boy have to say, and other than to jump out and go "Boo!" what purpose did they serve?It is still an entertaining, well made, and worthwhile film, but highly overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made me jump but it doesn't deserve an Oscar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this one again - it made me jump the second time too, and it was interesting to watch it knowing the twist at the end. It's not bad - worth a viewing, especially if you like thrillers. That poisoned girl scared the s**t out of me when I saw the movie the first time. I thought this film was creepier than Blair Witch.But Bruce Willis is mediocre at best. He is not a serious actor, he was fine in Die Hard and he should keep to that genre - this film would've been better with someone else. Haley Joel Osment was pretty good for a kid but I cannot believe he is nominated for an Oscar. Never mind that this film is nominated for best film. It really shows just how BAD the Oscars are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About the `surprise' ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... I'm afraid I got it almost immediately - that is to say, about a third of the way through. I mean, Shyamalan drops us a pretty broad hint. I wonder if he even intended to keep the secret hidden. I have a suspicion... I think that Shyamalan's intention was to reveal the secret at precisely the moment I worked it out, possibly by dropping an even broader hint. But then someone at some preliminary screening failed to get the hint, and Shyamalan thought: `Well, if it's THAT easy to keep people in the dark ...'I'm reminded of `Vertigo', where Hitchcock does something similar: he makes his revelation less than half way through, as soon as he decently can (to the audience, of course; not to the central character). It must be said that this makes `Vertigo' a better, tenser film. An explicit revelation halfway through would have likewise made `The Sixth Sense' a better, tenser film; so I'm GLAD I worked things out early on - a friend of mine who didn't found the story a little humdrum, before the conclusion.I don't know that I would have had THAT reaction: even given Shyamalan's miscalculation, this is a beautifully told tale, supported by three perfectly judged performances (Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, who proves that it IS possible for an adult story to have a likeable child as a central character, and Toni Collette - but I'm always ready to rave about her, wherever she appears). The criticism that the ghosts intrude on what could have been a good domestic drama is entirely misguided. This is a story ABOUT ghosts intruding. I found it refreshing to see a fantasy that takes its fantastic premise seriously, without using it as an excuse to cheapen the drama.The sober photography helps a good deal, without drawing attention to itself. A pity that one of the shots was so obviously swiped from `Poltergeist'. Not that I minded - this is a much better film than `Poltergeist', anyway.</fullReview>

After "North" the ability of Bruce Willis to work with a kid and get the best out of him should be obvious...I hope he gets typecast if this is to be his legacy. Haley Osment is so good he's scary he's so good...he's scary...After Forest Gump somebody should get the idea this kid has a big future. He's not cute, he's just good. I'm not suggesting Bruce W. plays a boy scout leader, but the role seems right somehow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 6 for "Sixth"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good film, featuring an incredible performance by Osment and a strong reminder of what a fine actor Willis can be when he's got a good script. But while I certainly don't wish to jeopardize my membership by revealing the end (said by many to rival "Usual Suspects"), it simply doesn't warrant the incredible attention it's received (including its Best Picture nomination), and, to my own surprise, undoes any strides it makes towards being a human story rather than a ghost story. For this is really a movie about how being a kid in today's world is tougher than it's ever been. This could have been a much darker, better film, but Disney clearly reigned it in from any steps into R-rating territory. (It's PG-13.) Hopefully its success will allow Shymalan freer rein on his next film: he's capable of it, as the "Munchausen revelation" will attest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie made with immaculate perfection. Rarely you get to see cinema which leaves you with awe and would want you to go back and see it all over again as soon as possible. Director Shyamalan has made this movie with perfection to the core. Its a touching tale of a child who sees ghosts and his relationship with his psychiatrist ....his mother...and himself. Its about his discovery of his own personal powers. It is also a tale of a man(Willis) whose life has a lot of loose ends to meet. These intertwined...it makes it a mesmerising cinematic event. Beautifully crafted scenes which are edited with perfection.touching performances....especially a oscar worthy potrayal of Cole by the young Osment. Flawlessly directed with just the right atmosphere of gloom and darkness. After it has finished you are left with an awe of wonder and a feeling of sadness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant performance in a difficult role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie for one reason; the advertised subject matter alone would not have been enough to coax me into driving to the theatre. When I noticed that Haley Osment had a lead role (or, technically, a "supporting" role, but I don't buy that-- he is the lead in this one), I knew it was something to check out. I recalled seeing him several years younger in that shortly-lived sitcom "Thunder Alley" with Jonathan Winters, and I remember having had the distinct impression that he had talent, and that I should keep an eye out for him in the future. I saw this movie very early following its release, well before word had really spread about how great his performance was, so I can honestly say other peoples' opinions had no influence on my perception. Anyway, I came out of the theatre thinking this kid was truly brilliant, in a role very difficult for most child actors to pull off even well. I felt, and still feel, that Haley's performance-- and only his-- made this movie first class. At the time, I thought he should get an Oscar, but I never thought he stood a chance. I'm glad others have noticed him in this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This a powerful ghost movie. It haunted me for days afterward and only exhaustion from work enabled me to sleep, even though I knew that someone (dead) else was watching me or doing their thing (what the dead do when dead) in the next room.Bruce Willis and the kid did a wonderful job of making this movie work. The director did a masterful job of hiding and cutting through scenes that would take away from the big ending PUNCH climactic sequence of scenes that Bruce's character experiences.Highly recommend seeing this on the big screen, but since it's going to video very soon see it with all (and I do mean all) the lights off if you don't watch movies that way already. Very spooky and if you have any amount of imagination it will make you more aware of what you see out of the corner of your eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mellow suspense film. Spoilers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't seen the trailer and don't care much for Bruce Willis, so it wasn't until this last weekend (and a slew of Oscar nominations) that I plunked down matinee money to see The Sixth Sense. I knew there was some Big Secret Twist and the tag line ("I see dead people"), but that was all I knew.Without spoiling anything, I've got to say that pretty soon into the movie I had figured out the twist, and I thought it was so obvious that I assumed there must be something more; halfway into the movie I realized, nope -- the writer director is saving this up for his big revelation. That was a letdown.Dispensing with that, I thought this was a decent enough movie. The character study made this probably the most mellow suspense movie I've ever seen, but that was fine. The movie rightly lets its emphasis fall on the young boy who is far more interesting than his doctor, but this also leaves one of the holes large enough to drive a truck through: the disintegration of the doctor's marriage so quickly after being shot is presented as an incongruous "given;" that was my immediate tip off that there was only one explanation. The movie also plays a little coy with its supernatural rules ("they can only see what they want") so that the dead can move a physical object (a coin, videocassette box, a piece of jewelry) but then, maybe not (the desk barring the door).The main reasons I decided to see the movie were 1) check out Haley's performance and 2) there's just not much else out there right now. All of the performances in the film are good, but Haley Joel Osmet and Toni Collette, as the boy's mother, have a couple of scenes together which are terrific. Neither one gets to exhibit a great deal of range -- not their fault; it's written into their parts -- but they more than make due with what they're handed. Osmet and Collette's final scene together in the car is absolutely fantastic, wrenching stuff.A side note: Osmet is in far too many scenes to be considered a supporting actor. Perhaps that's just my perception because I was quite interested in his character and predicament, but as I think back, he still seems to have about equal screen time with Willis. I haven't noticed that anyone else picked up on this, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining and chilling film-- ***1/2 out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie did very well in the box office unexpectingly. But I must say it deserves it because it is a great film.Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crowe, a good child psycologist whom we find out because he and his wife are staring at a plaque he earned. They go into their bedroom and find out that their house was broken into. They find a disturbed man only in his underwear with a gun in the bathroom. They are talking and it turns out he was an ex-patient of his. Then the man shoots Malcolm and then he kills himself. Then like 2 years later he goes and sees this disturbed little boy who sees dead people and the story goes on from there.There is some fine acting from Osment, the actor who played the kid who was nominated for an Oscar. Bruce Willis also does a fine job in this film.The whole film is entertaining throughout. The film is suspense but I wouldn't call it horror even if it does have a few "jumpy" parts. I really enjoyed this film and I highly recommend you rent it when it comes out in late March.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen the movie and would like to without any plot points revealed stop reading right now. I'd also advise you to see the movie before you read any other reviews for that matter.The Sixth Sense is one of the best thrillers in recent years. I didn't find it scary in the least, but the movie was so well made it blows most of the competition out of the water. There are two areas in which it excels: acting and direction. The acting is first rate. And its not the flashing kind of Al Pacino acting that gets all the attention either--just quiet, powerful understated performances from Willis, Osment and Collette that make you believe everything you see on the screen. Shaymalan's direction is fabulous, especially during the "ghost scenes" in which he has the ghosts move at the corners of the frame without focusing directly on them. Its a nice break from the shot-for-shot slasher film clones that we're getting so much of these days.Of course, then there's the ending. As soon as I heard that there was a suprise ending I said to myself "Hey, Bruce Willis is going to be a ghost." Given rules for ghosts set up in the films I knew Bruce Willis would only interact with the kid. And as scene by scene went by I was proven right (even through some clever direction to force assumnptions upon the viewer--such as the anniversary scene). So the ending came as no surprise to me, but even without the third act's dramatic revelation, I found myself captivated by the movie. Definately one of 1999's best surprises.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far more than a horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two kinds of great genre film. The first is the sort that exemplifies the conventions of the genre, while respecting the genre's limits. The second kind of genre film uses the rhetoric and archetypes of the genre to film to point beyond the limits of genre, to attain the level of the symbolic, the ethical and the spiritual.Thus , in the film Noir genre,Kiss Me Deadly is a brilliant example of the first kind of good genre film, while Touch of Evil is a brilliant example of the second. The greatness of The Sixth Sense-and I firmly believe that it is one of the handful of films from last year that can be classified as truly great-lies precisely in how it transcends its genre.The Sixth Sense resonates with Hawthornesque tonalities. It echoes Melville, Poe and Henry James ( I refer to James' great ghost stories, not his often tedious "novels of manners").The critics who saw only only a creepy, dull story with a twist at the end missed entirely the films extraordinary religious symbolism. The Bruce Willis Character is a soul in limbo, waiting to be saved. The instrument of salvation? A frightened, yet preternaturally gifted, child.Not a single performance in the film hit a false note..this is an extraordinary film about parents and children, about husbands and wives, and about life and death. The score, the cinematography, and the script were uniformly excellent. I i especially liked the filmmakers' brilliant use of the Philadelphia locale, and the way in which the cities dark history was alluded to. In short, a wonderful film and an exhilarating religious experience-SUPERB</fullReview>

There's nothing particularly GREAT aboutthe movie -- however, it's worth a watch. Bruce Willis DOES turnin the second best performance of his career, the other beingthe brilliant "12 Monkeys". Haley Joel Osment's performance isgood, but woefully over-rated.If you need a twist ending, watch "The Usual Suspects". To see asimilar ending, watch the (also great) "A Pure Formality," theunder-rated '94 French film.Oh, and as far as Oscars go? Give Haley's little gold statue toMichael Clarke Duncan. Pick someone who can reach the podium.THE SIXTH SE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, Fantastic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one extraordinary movie. A movie with such talented people working all on the same movie, right THE SIXTH SENSE. When The Blair Witch Project came out I thought it couldn't get any better in the fright genre. Ohhh what was I wrong, because nothing could prepare me for this movie. Great script, great actors, great directing, great score, you name it. It was all perfect, but the most thing to be said about this movie is the acting of Haley Joel Osment, is one of the years best and still has me think about it. Just like a young Robert DeNiro. Together with Toni Collette this is the only movie in the fright genre that gave me tears in my eyes. Especially the scene in the car and some scenes where you see Haley with his tears in his eyes. I hope he wins the Oscar for 'Best Supporting Actor', because I think you won't see this the next year from others anymore (only from him, can't wait for his next movie) and same for Toni. This is such a frightening and beautiful movie it gives me goosebumps. I love Horror movies for a very long time, from Hellraiser to Evil Dead to Braindead, to name a few movies, but this is of only movie of the decade together with The Blair Witch Project that ranks up to my favorite top 10 movies I've ever seen, and that says a lot. At last but not least I want to say that Bruce Willis and Olivia Williams are also great and very affecting. If anyone of the cast&amp;crew read this, I wish you all the luck at the Acadamy Awards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie actually came out of nowhere for me. I had seen the trailer numerous times and thought it looked like it would be interesting. But after the wretched movie referred to as Star Wars Episode 1 I lost my faith in child actors.The kid in this movie completely caught me off gaurd. Wow. That's really all I can say. He was spectacular. There really wasn't alot of negative things I could say about this movie though.It seemed to be created for a family base. There were limited curse words and there was barely even a reference to sex. The only scary parts were the ghosts of the dead people.Even that wasn't too bad. This movie does go to show that you don't need extreme special effects or lots of gratuitous violence and sex to make a spectacular film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The next best thing to watching this movie opening night is watching it as a "Sneak Preview". I was lucky to receive sneak preview tickets to a movie I knew nothing about prior to seeing it. The Sixth Sense was pure fascination from the very beginning to the "End" (Not to give too much away). Bruce Willis was his Bruce Willis self (Who could ask for more) but Haley Joel Osment, as Cole Sear, simply stole the show. Still gives me goose bumps just thinking about it. OOOOOooo.

		<shortDescription>Best movie of the year--absolutely no doubt about it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(A+) I saw The Sixth Sense during the first weekend it was out and let me make this perfectly clear: This movie is one of the greatest movies of the 90s. The Blair Witch Project, Halloween H2O and the Scream trilogy just don't compare!I came out of the theater astonished and awestruck, for I had witnessed one of the greatest endings. And for those who say that they saw it coming, I say 'no way!' because there is absolutely no way one could predict the ending to this movie unless he or she was the unfortunate one who heard it from a friend or read a spoiler somewhere.The script was superbly written (by M. Night Shyamalan), and the cast is great. The acting was magnificent, even though you might hear otherwise now that the movie received so much praise. For some reason, people like to place negative comments about a movie that had great success; my guess is that it's because they like to be different from everybody else. This IS a great movie, believe me.There are two kinds of horror movies. This kind (dealing with the supernatural and the fear of the unknown), and the slasher kind (where a mentally ill and/or deformed in some way person or creature goes out and massacres teenagers). The first kind mentioned is my favorite type and that's why I grade The Sixth Sense so high, it's simply original and well thought out.Cole Sear is played brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment and Malcolm Crowe was also fabulously played by Bruce Willis. M. Night Shyamalan did a superb job directing and I look forward to his future films.The music score, written by James Newton Howard, delivers the appropriate mood and builds the suspense. A great score. I love the camera movements also.If you enjoyed this movie as much as I did, I would also strongly recommend you to see THE STIR OF ECHOES with Kevin Bacon, directed by Devid Coepp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect The Sixth Sense to be nominated for an oscar, since horror is so often overlooked, and since Hitchcock is gone, there just aren't that many good horror movies around anymore. This film surprised me. I was glued to my seat through the whole thing. Not normally a big Bruce Willis fan, I thought he did a great job. Now I don't know that I would have chosen it for an Oscar, but when I discovered it was nominated, I got a small tingle of satisfaction that it made it. This was a clever movie, suspenseful, perplexing at times, but all coming together in the end in a flash of insight. I enjoyed it completely and recommend it to anyone who loves a good ghost story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dramatic intrigue with a twist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the beginning "The Sixth Sense" develops fascinating little crooks and twists for viewers who are on their toes. The film rolls along in an almost dreamlike state meant to lull the audience into believing the entire story is quite normal, average and almost everyday. Then it slaps them in the face. As the characters begin to recognize their problems and deal with them, one might guess the story would lose its momentum. However, this is the point where new plot details surface and old ones get a quick kick in the pants.I'd say the film is a veritable jigsaw. The audience may not find putting it together the most pulse-pounding and energetic trip of their viewing lives. Yet the puzzle draws them in and engages their involvement. And it does have hair-raising moments in spite of its lack of kick-butt action.In summary: good plot, good director, good actors, and great ending (among the ranks of "Casablanca").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a truly amazing film. I was blessed with the fact that I had heard little about it and knew little of what to expect. This is, I believe, the best way to see a film. So by reading this, you're going to be more prepared than I was. I will, then, be careful.If you think of child actors, perhaps Macaulay Culkin springs to mind in a wash of horror. Whilst Jake Lloyd did an admirable performance as young Anakin in The Phantom Menace, the role did not offer enough substance to truly test him as an adult actor.Haley Joel Osment, however, is nothing short of brilliant. In a role that would test the most experienced actors, he draws the audience into the film in a way that defies belief. Although not at the top of the cast list, due to seniority and experience, had he been older, he could have out-billed Willis.Having said that, the performances from all four of the key players is truly remarkable. The story centres around Osment's character, a child of divorced parents who can communicate with the dead. Willis is his child psychologist and the interplay between the two is awesome. Collette and Williams play the child's mother and Willis' wife respectively. The former gives a truly empathic performance of a single mother with a problem child, and the latter is perfect as the wife of a loner with their relationship in tatters.Another player that should not go amiss is director Shyamalan, who also stars in a cameo role as Osment's doctor. The pace of the film makes us at one with the characters, and because the film altricates sharply between horror (in the slow-moving, chilling vein of The Exorcist) and sorrow (it is perhaps the most moving film of this decade) we become utterly helpless. It reaches out to you in a way that giants such as Titanic simply fail to do. There is also some incredible photography, under the watchful eye of legendary D.P. Tak Fujimoto.A wonderful film, or even experience, even for die-hard action lovers. I saw grown men moved by this, and the women in the audience didn't stand a chance! Watch out for the Oscars, because Osment and Shyamalan (whose next film Unbreakable is expected to be just as good) should both receive nominations. If they don't there is something seriously wrong with Hollywood these days.</fullReview>

I didn't realize the clues that were given although I have to watch it a second time to see if it's all correct. The whole atmosphere of the film made me think of the Exorcist a couple of times. Of course the little child but also the old house where he and his mother live and the dark interior of it.

		<shortDescription>Good - But not that good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is just that. It's very competently put together, and certainly has an interesting premise, but it's let down by a few minor flaws.The cinematography is at times clumsy, and at others, over elaborate. I got the feeling that they were trying to achieve so much here that they got really carried away with it.The child's dialogue, whist undeniably powerful (and *so* well delivered) is utterly inapporpriate. No children of that age talk like that. The only writer around at the moment who seems to be capable of producing good dialogue is Tarantino - and he is only prepared to look at one very specialised area. Bring back David Mamet!At times the dialogue is far too expositional. I felt patronised by the film. Lines like "You used the S-word" are really unneccessary.Finally, there was the occasional ham-fisted attempt at emotional manitpulation. The perfect example is the child's final scene in the car. I didn't feel convinced by the characters there at all. It just didn't work for me.All those criticisms aside, the film is still very good. I would certainly recommend watching it. Only if you can't get in to see American Beauty, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a beautiful, beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of focus is given to this film's surprise ending, which some people complain they can see coming (although I didn't). But, the ending, although a great and beautiful one, is not the best thing about this movie, nor is it a good reason to see it. For my money, the reason The Sixth Sense is so good and so respected stems from the atmosphere that it creates. This is a quiet, meditative movie - one that draws you into its core and actually fosters that "wow" sensation that movies are supposed to create (most don't, if you ask me). The acting is superb in its subtlety - not just in the case of Willis and Osment but also supporting players Williams and Collette. Of course, Shyamalan's excellent script and direction don't hurt the movie either.If you figure out the ending early on, don't worry about it. It's worth your time to see how the story plays out. Also, be sure to pay close attention to the role of the color red - it has an important symbolic function. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of 1999!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am embarrassed to admit that the only reason I saw THE SIXTH SENSE when I did was because THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was sold out. I hadn't seen BLAIR WITCH yet but I heard great reviews, and of course it was sold out when I went to see it. So my friend and I decided to see THE SIXTH SENSE instead. Not only did it turn out to be a better movie than BLAIR WITCH is, but it turned out to be one of my favorites.THE SIXTH SENSE is about an award-winning child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), who is depressed because one of his former clients committed suicide because Crowe was unable to help him. Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) is a child that has social problems frighteningly similar to Crowe's old client, so Crowe decides he will try to help this child in order to find redemption. Cole later reveals that this problem goes well beyond normal social problems. He claims to be able to see the ghosts of dead people, but no one else can.The acting in THE SIXTH SENSE was superb. Olivia Williams does well as Anne Crowe, Willis' depressed wife, and Toni Collette does a great job as Lynn Sear, Osment's loving mother who is very concerned for her child. I think that Bruce Willis is at his very best in this movie, and I happen to be a fan of Willis. But I think that Haley Joel Osment stole the show. He did an amazing job, expressing more combined emotions that most adult actors have to deal with. He is definitely the best child actor I've ever seen, and I am glad that Bruce Willis let him have the spotlight.The plot is very entertaining, though at times you may wonder where it is going. The ending is the best part of the movie, and it completely changes whatever you originally thought of the whole story line. I applaud the advertisers of THE SIXTH SENSE for not leaving a trace of the surprise ending in the previews of the movie (unlike DOUBLE JEOPARDY) and I certainly will not give it away in this comment. But I will say that it will completely surprise most all of you. (I think many that say that they saw it coming are probably lying.)THE SIXTH SENSE is one of my favorite movies, and I think it is surely one of the best films of 1999. I hope it wins many Oscars this year, and I recommend that you go out and buy this movie now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When my boyfriend suggested we go to see the Sixth Sense, I wasn't interested. I hadn't heard much about the film at that point, and thought it would be just another story about a bloke in a dirty white vest running about a lot and saving the world. In short, the type of film he likes and I don't. How wrong I was, and what a great decision it was to give in to his whines and go and see it. From the start I could tell this was going to be a film of class. The acting was brilliant from all of the cast and if the young boy does not get an Oscar then there is no justice in the world. This film made me laugh, cry and jump so much that I threw my popcorn over the man next to me more than once. The ending was absolutely fantastic, and the whole film comes together in the very last few minutes. We talked about it the whole way home and the whole way through our bedtime cup of cocoa. If you haven't seen this film yet, where have you been, and whatever you do, don't let anyone tell you the ending before you go. Well done Bruce, my faith in you has now been restored, but that doesn't mean I will be going to see 'Die Hard 4'!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to see this movie because Bruce Willis was in it. I was expecting an average thriller made better by one of my favorite actors. I was extremely surprised by the quality of The Sixth Sense. This has to be one of THE movies of 1999. Bruce Willis plays a psychologist who is working with children. One night he is attacked in his own home by one of his old clients, who is now a grown-up. Willis`s character is named Malcolm Crowe, and he is determined to never fail again. One day he is going to see a new client: a boy named Cole Sear, who is having some kind of unknown trouble. This movie is a horrorthriller, there aren`t that many shocks in it, but it is a well directed and exciting film. Bruce Willis manages to act without having a pistol to rely upon, and Haley Joel Osment`s performance is well-above-average. 9/10</fullReview>

On the first look, you don't really know where to put this film. Is it a thriller or a movie about the problems of a psychologist? In the middle you think its a really good horror-film. After all i think its a great mix of all that and this is the fact that makes this movie one of the best I have seen during the last years, both in the genre of thrillers an of psychological horror-films. One fact that makes this movie a great one is the end, which you wouldn't suggest. I won' tell anything about this or any other content of the movie, because this would destroy your experience. After the movie was over and I started to search for logical errors in it, but there weren't any. There not many movies of which you could say this, but this is one.After all I have to say that this movie is a masterpiece and an absolutely must if you like psychological thrillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not as good as expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i went to this movie expecting a really good and scary masterpiece film. But, i was pretty disappointing. There were some creepy scenes in it, but of it was really boring. It was just too much ofthe same things. A ghost passes by, he says something un-scary, he walks away, the boy gets scared and tells about it to Bruce Willis. A few minutes later, the plot has completely forgotten about that particular event. It pretends that we are scared by every stupid ghost with blood coming out of his head, while we weren't. Throughout the film i thought about that surprising ending everyone had talked about, but when the end finally came, i wasn't "surprised"at all, i knew this was gonna happen from the beginning! Therefore, i can't understand how come this movie is getting so much praise. It is truly overrated. If you're planning on seeing it, let me give you some advice: don't expect it to be as good as everyone said. Maybe you'll enjoy it more, because i thought it would be fantastic and i was very disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film was excellent. The young actor gets 10. I didn't actually see the end coming which makes you want to kick yourself as it is there to be seen with hindsight. Well crafted and well executed, I wouldn't mind seeing this again. OK This isn't an out and out horror film but the film has its moments that make you jump. The boy makes this film and is well supported by Bruce! Go see for yourself and make up your own mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Think you've seen it all? Nothing can surprise you anymore? Certainly no twist in the plot? Think again.Think on how you would make a scary film. Lots of gore and splatter? Liberal use of scary music? Lots of supernatural apparitions or ugly demons? Think again.Think on how you would expect actors to act in a scary film. Loud and unsubtle? So every last dumbo will get the hint? Think again.Think on how the characters would be portrayed in a scary film. Naive and slightly dumb? Walking into every trap you can see coming from miles? Think again.And now stop thinking on it and go watch the movie.</fullReview>

Easily the best performance of Bruce Willis' career this movie just gets better and better as it goes on.I would recommend you know nothing about the story before you watch as it has a twist like no other at the end ! When it all ends, some of the heart stopping visual kicks will stay in your mind for ages!Watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was the best in the whole year! (To me it was). Bruce Willis did excellent acting and I loved Haley Joel Osment! He should get the oscar for best actor. The twist at the end was freaky, but I guessed it through half the movie, so I wasn't surprised much. One of my favorite phrases in the movie is when Cole says: "They don't have meetings about rainbows."Overall vote: ****1/2 of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, still, no summary for it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is a good name for a movie, because people expect things like mystery or thriller in the movie, and this is exactly what this movie has.First of all, I'd like to say that all the actors and actresses did one hell of a job, I can't complain about any of them. This might also be Bruce Willis best performance in his career... And of course, I can't finish this paragraph without mentioning Haley Joel Osment... The little boy did a great performance in that movie, and he actually gets into his character a lot, representing Cole's feelings and fears.This movie has a touch of "something" that is a bit hard to name for me, but it surely keeps everybody paying attention every single minute, since the beginning to the end.Then we have that amazing final... Yes sir, that final that made all of us drop our jaws and refuse to believe what we just saw.The great thing about this movie is that everything matches, because everything the kid said about the dead people are the same things that Bruce Willis does, like: He doesn't know he is dead, he sees what he wants to see (his wife...), he can't see the other dead people... Everything was perfectly planned by the writers of this movie, and I personally think the plot is fantastic.I'll rate this movie with a 10 out of 10, of course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw it yesterday, and after it had finished I was wondering why this movie got such a high rating. The first hour or so the movie is just boring, there's no progress in the plot at all. And then there's this terrible goof (microphone clearly visible in the classroom).The second part is better: finally the plot starts evolving. OK, there's some good acting: the young boy (Cole) for instance, but I have my doubts about Bruce Willis: I just don't think this is his kind of role.Many people have mentioned the surprising ending: I thought it was quite predictable.To wrap things up: ordinary movie: not good, not bad.I voted 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film that evokes the prodigy of life through the eyes of a dead soul. My first impression upon seeing it was the simplicity that carries the story past understanding, and into a state of complicity with the viewer that dissolves fear. It made me come to terms with the dark, noisy loneliness and all dark things I've brought with me since childhood. And it's a very special Bruce Willis we see here, one who although being part of the nightmare resembles each and every possible cure. Peace of mind and peace of heart, this movie brought me, and for that I am thankful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an interesting film that doesn't deliver</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the trailer from the 6th sense I didn't have the intention of going to see this film immediatly.Everything looked and sounded (the whispering in the trailer still gets on my nerves) very pottered. Thankfully the film itself is better made. In essence this is a simple story about to lost souls and their search for a comprehensive life. The film itself revolves around the surprise ending, which I didn't find surprising at all. In fact watching (and not looking) at this story gives away the ending about 45 minutes into the film. To achieve this ending a lot of scenes feel also pottered and unbelievable. Once again this is a film where characters and plotlines seem to revolve around the story,normally a story is build upon characters and the succession of events and plots. Still we are left with an interesting film thanks to M.Night Shyamalan great acting-direction and his visual flair. Some of the scenes are real terrifying examples of horror. Both Willis an H.J. Osment, cool, performances give the film an extra edge. But the real surprise was the performance of T. Collette. Her performance doesn't have one false moment as the even more scared mother. Even more rewards must be given to the director of photography for his stunning, but underrated, work. All in all this is a film that has a lot to offer, but unfortunately not what it promises. *** out of four</fullReview>

The film is rather psychological than a typical thriller. everything is great, from music to actors. Haley Joel Osment has shown that he can play really good parts. As for the ending...

		<fullReview>This movie is amazing .. Harry joel osmont gives away such a blistering performance. Without this performance it wouldn't be so great, really.This movie is one that can be watched in 2 ways. One way is the greatest way; Without knowing the end. The other way is knowing the end. A bit like 'The usual suspects' If you see it the first time, you will be left numb after seeing the ending. It's so mindblowing. I know i can't tell you about this, so you would have to see it for yourself.. It's one of those movies you just have to see.I realise this is going to be the year of 'American Beauty' or 'The Insider'. But for me The Sixth Sense beats those movies in a blink of an eye. Just as in my opinion 'The Matrix' or 'The Blair witch project' would.Anyway, The sixth sense is also the movie of Bruce Willis. We see here that the man can really act !! (unlike some other action hero's) He contributes to the whole atmosphere of the movie, which is awesome. And scary as hell. For me the ending of the movie (i can't stop about it) has one of the most memorable scenes in the history of movies, that's all i can say. I hope i made you just a little bit curious in what is one of the best movies of the year, one that should get the oscar for best supporting actor (Harry Joel Osmont), and one that should get a whole lot more credit that it is receiving.be prepared to be blown away...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredible film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, Haley Joel Osment (plays Cole) is one heck of an actor. His performance rivals that of Linda Blair in "The Exorcist" and Henry Thomas in "E.T.". Osment brilliantly plays true horror and fear and I found it hard to believe that he wasn't truly haunted by unknowing ghosts. The film is a visual masterpiece. The use of the color bright red is so perfect and downright spooky that I can't see that cinematographer not getting an award. The story itself is great, but the final touch is the complete horror of the idea that you could be dead and not know it. Rent, buy it, or watch it and think about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(WARNING: My comments could serve as a spoiler for the fourteen people who haven't yet seen this movie.)This is an atmospheric and well-acted movie, but I think the story is told with much more portent and suggestion of deep meaning than it warrants. It's basically a ghost story dressed up like a Bergman film.I'm not sure about this alleged "twist ending" either. Unfortunately, I heard that the film had a twist ending before I saw it. (I didn't hear what the twist was.) Perhaps because I knew they had one in store for me, I saw it coming a mile away. Still, I think even if I hadn't heard what I heard, I would have figured it anyway. I can't be sure.Also, I'd like to point out how unconvincing and unsatisfying is the doctor's way of bringing peace to both himself and his wife. Let's just say that the evidence does not support his claim that "you [his wife] always came first [ahead of his work]."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haley Joel Osment is marvelous!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a successful child psychologist who's faced with the toughest challenge of his career when assigned to help a young boy, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment ) who is haunted by unknown demons. The director is the relatively unknown and young M. Night Shyamalan and despite his obvious talents the movie is a bit disappointing as a psychological thriller. The shocks are too far between and even too obvious and the plot, despite of a successful surprise-ending, does not hold up to minute scrutiny. But having said that it is important to emphasize that H. J. Osment is absolutely amazing as the haunted boy and stands out as one of the best child performances for a very long time. Bruce Willis is excellent as well, his performance is very quiet, almost modest, and it suits him very well. But the outstanding performance of the film is without a doubt the breakthrough of the young Osment and personally I can't wait to see what the future brings for him. It's more than likely that "The Sixth Sense" will be remembered as the real beginning of an exceptional career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Overrated Film of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read so many reactions to this movie that sing its praise. "A masterpiece" - "perfect" etc. What a crock. This movie is very far from being perfect and even further from being a masterpiece. Don't get me wrong; it's a good B movie... and nothing more. There are plot holes galore, and the movie, in a nutshell, is contrived. People think that since the ending threw such a twist, it compensates for the uneventful majority of the movie. It doesn't. The movie is original, to a certain extent, but is hardly what everyone makes it out to be. I've heard people asking unintelligently, "when was the last time I saw a movie that made me think? When was the last time I saw a movie that I discussed with my friends afterwards?" I think a better question would be, "When was the last time you saw a genuinely good movie?" The answer would most likely be one of two: a long time ago, or never.</fullReview>

He manages to cover this inconsistencies with calculated shocks, the main, obviously, at the end of the movie. One on the finest features of the film I think are the solid characters depicted, with provides the picture with a sordid, pitiful ambient, with its three tattered protagonists. In this way, I find this film rather influenced by "The Exorcist" ambient, which "Sixth Sense" owes most of its undoubtable virtues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a scene in this movie is wasted. This is one of those movies in which you cannot afford to arrive at the movie hall late (as I usually do) or miss any of the scenes in between. And if you skip the end thinking that you know how it is going to end - well you have got another think coming. No, this is the type of movie you need to see not just once but twice in order to fully appreciate it. In the first viewing get the hang of the story. In the second viewing appreciate the nuances of the story. Manoj Night Shyamlan will go a long way if he makes his movies like this. And you will go a considerable way down the path of enlightenment if you watch a movie like this. Everyone in the movie acts well, but little Osment really comes out tops. Bruce Willis has proved that he is not just a high-octane action hero either. And once gain it proves the basic fact that the basic ingredient of a good film is a good idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know the feeling I'm talking about. The buzz deep inside you when you see a film so brilliant that no star rating, any review, anything could possibly convey how absolutely superb the film was. Well The Sixth Sense gave that feeling for the first time since I saw Death in Venice a while ago. Anyhow, the plot sees Bruce playing a child psychologist and a year after he is shot by a disgruntled patient in his home, he takes of the case of Harley Joel Osment, who has the sixth sense of the tile: the ability to see the ghosts of dead people. After Color of Night and Mercury Rising, the prospects of Willis playing a shrink AND working with a child are not good, but he is perfect for the role. Gone are is usual action man histrionics and instead he underplays the role calmly and gives a performance that is worthy an Oscar nomination at least. Child actor, Osment is superb too and mixes his role with sympathy, fear and desperation that put his performance among the child greats. "Brat", doesn't even come into the equation. As superb as they are, the most credit has to go to writer/director M. Night Shyamalan who skillfully handles his intelligent script and comes up with a chilling atmosphere throughout the film as well as several electrifying shocks, based on relatively simply situations. Then there's the ending and a twist so perfectly executed it with have thinking for days, unpicking in your mind all that has gone before. It's that brilliant twist, plot-hole creating though it maybe, that really gives you THE FEELING.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While it now seems to be impossible for any film - good, bad or indifferent - to escape the hype machine that declares it the greatest movie ever made, "The Sixth Sense" nonetheless holds up well. It is an intelligent, well-made thriller that can be genuinely frightening and moving by turns. Bruce Willis acquits himself honorably in a demanding role that requires him to do more than grit his teeth and show his chest hair, but the most impressive performances come from Toni Colette and child actor Haley Joel Osment. Most importantly, the plot is interesting, plausible and internally consistent, and even manages to survive the much-discussed 'final twist'. The 'final twist' is an over-used device in movies currently - for every film such as "Wild Things" (where the whole movie is one twist after another) or "The Usual Suspects" (where there is only one twist, but an immensely satisfying one), there are half a dozen others where a wholly arbitrary and gratuitous twist is thrown in 'just because'. The ending of "The Sixth Sense" is not arbitrary or gratuitous, and you get the pleasure of mentally reviewing the movie to see if it stands up in the light of the ending. To its credit, it does.Possible spoiler: it may be interesting to compare this film with "Jacob's Ladder". Both films merge a sometimes bleak and usually realistic view of everyday life with genuinely disturbing glimpses of 'the other world' that do more than merely play the slime-and-gore card. And as viewers who have seen both films may notice, they have other ideas in common as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sixth Sense is great. It gives you psychological thrills on a level that ordinary thrillers never reach up to. Goosebumps is the best single word to describe the sensation when a child tells his shrink that he sees dead people, walking around like regular people. Chilling. But I think something is missing. Once you get to realize that the kid actually sees dead people, when the fun is supposed to start - it abruptly ends. But the end is horrifying and quickly reinstates the position of this film as #2 film of the year 1999. #1 is of course The Matrix...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie, that shows that Bruce Willis is capable of doing some serious acting too. Still, he pales when compared to Haley Joel Osment's work as a boy who sees dead people.The final twist, which I have been waiting to see from last August was just as good as any twist can get. I would like to sent Nathan L. to hell for telling it to the masses (who had not seen it yet) in TV. It's just that final thing that makes this movie to be so great. Thank you for making it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a movie with a brain!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whatever your view is on The Sixth Sense you have to admit that it has got people talking! How long has it been since you've felt compelled to sit down and just *talk* about a movie? For me, it had been quite a while and then I went and saw The Sixth Sense. And I left the cinema having been both scared and moved. I'd had goosebumps, a big smile on my face, and tears in my eyes just over one movie.The acting is seamless - Oscar nominations for the three leads, please! - the cinematography is so moody, as is the music, and the script is SO different from anything you're likely to come across in a long time.Yes, the movie has a twist, and, yes, the movie would have been great even without the twist. BUT what is important to me, personally, is not the nature of the twist. It's the fact that here is a movie with a BRAIN. Unlike the ending of The Usual Suspects which was great but in the end just made me feel manipulated and cheated, when The Sixth Sense twist happens you will inevitably go "Oh THAT'S why..." and you will want to see the movie again because you know that it'll be a totally different movie the next time you watch it. The whole premise has changed. In fact, this is two movies in one! A scary story about a boy seeing ghosts and a touching story about... :) See for yourself!!!I cannot recommend this movie enough. Unless you are very cold-hearted or have a short attention span (Yes, unlike so many modern-day movies, this one actually requires that you feel and think as well as concentrate on what's going on), you will love it and you will want to go back to it again, because although close scrutiny will reveal holes in the plot, it's a cracking good story that leaves you *thinking*. Let's hope Hollywood picks up on this and starts making movies which challenge the audience!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you see this film, it will probably stay with you for quite a while, and you will find yourself tossing over the plot in your mind for days to come. You will seek out others who have seen it, and want to discuss it with them. If you live alone, be careful; you may have trouble sleeping! Haley Joel Osment is extremely effective as a guarded and serious 9 year-old boy who is burdened with the secret ability to see the dead. Osment is excellent, making his character seem like an old soul. Bruce Willis is also impressive, playing against type, as the child psychologist who makes it his mission to help the boy. To the character of the boy's mother, Toni Collette brings intensity and depth.The soundtrack is eerily effective, giving the viewer a creepy feeling of anticipation. I was impressed to learn that the director of this film is the young man who plays the medical intern. Subtlety in movies is a welcome change these days, and this movie entices the viewer to use his or her imagination, which can be more frightening than "seeing everything." The previously mentioned soundtrack, the photographic techniques, and the old, almost Gothic, architectural scenery, give this movie a great sense of atmosphere that one has to experience to define.As it blends dramaticism, creepiness, and pathos, "plot holes" aside, "The Sixth Sense" is a movie I am sure I will see again and again, picking out new things with each viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film -- nothing more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to love this film, I have waited for it to open in Sweden for so long. Unfortunately, I did not love it. I came pretty close to not even liking it, but well, in the end I did like it. Last night I saw "Fight Club" at the cinema, I hadn't expected very much, but I walked out of the cinema thrilled and enthusiastic and "wowed". I walked out, after having seen "The Sixth Sense", thinking about all the plot inconsistencies. I tried to overlook them and say: "Look Anna, you're too stupid to realise that those ten or fifteen plot inconsistencies do not exist. Surely, there are a "logic" explanation for everything." I failed. But as I said, I *did* like it and I was quite spooked at times, but after having seen Edward Norton and Brad Pitt and David Fincher (well, I didn't actually see *him*) in action the night before I just don't think I was ready to accept "The Sixth Sense" as a great movie experience. I *should* love this film, and I know that I probably would have if it wasn't for a) the boring first 45 minutes and b) the fact that I knew there was a twist. I think that if the ending had come as a *real* surprise, like "oh-my-god-is-there-a-twist-in-this-film?!" I would have appreciated it much more. Now I spent half of the movie looking for clues to the twist (I didn't know *what* the twist was, though).Well, the film is good and Haley Joel Osment is fantastic -- a child actor that would actually deserve a Golden Globe or an Oscar (unlike Anna Paquin). And Bruce Willis was good as well! Okay, he's not Kevin Spacey or Edward Norton, and he never will be, but he actually did a great job in this film. I'm surprised. Well, I give this film a 6 out of 10, although I thought a lot about giving it a 5. A huge disappointment -- but still a good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everybody keeps talking about the ending but I think that's the worst part. For me it would have been fine if the movie ended 15 mins earlier. The movie would then have been a pretty scary movie with a little boy whose acting is amazing. The ending that makes you think about all you have seen is too smart for its own good. I've got to admit it's a great way to get people to see the movie more than once but that's all. The ending makes you look for flaws in the movie. And as a Man once said: Search and you will find. The ending looks smart at first but really hurts the film in the end. For example: In the scene where Bruce and the mother are sitting opposite each other, how did Bruce get in??? You know, without knowing he's ........ Well I think I will never know the answer. Still worth seeing. Definitely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was the only one in my group of friends who hadn't seen the Sixth Sense by the new year. Lucky for me they really are true friends and they spared me any likelihood of discovering the truth behind this movie accidently from idle conversation between them.All that I knew of this movie before seeing it was this:1. EVERYONE and I mean EVERYONE was impressed by it! 2. It was Bruce Willis's best role since Die Hard 3. The boy playing the disturbed child Cole should get an Oscar nomination 4. Toni Collette has picked a winner to expand her movie career. 5. There is a "Shock" ending that no one guessed beforehand.Being a movie buff and quite fond of thrillers I thought I could solve this one, so I watched the movie, paid attention to every scene and every piece of dialogue and thought I had it.......i thought you were going to discover that Bruce Willis' ex patient from the start of the film would be Cole's dad..........WRONG WRONG WRONG!I was so off the mark it wasn't funny..... I didn't have a clue. When I found out what the movie was REALLY about I turned to my wife and she looked back at me in one of those "Wow that's freaky!" kind of looks.I will show the same respect to others as was shown to me and NOT reveal the secret of The Sixth Sense, all I can say is WOW !!!!!Not to be missed 10/10.PS The scene between Cole and his mum in the car late in the film made my wife and I cry!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this day of the high concept one sheet isn't it amazing how the biggest films are, well, not really categorizable.Sinking ships?Animated toys?Washed up 60's spys?And now we have The Sixth Sense. Willis is a depressed, disorientated child psychiatrist who has to deal with an apparently reclusive, paranoid child (The remarkable Osment)who exasperates his mother played by Collette (Again excellent). We keep on being told that their "three minute culture" attention spans mean slow paced mood pieces like this just won't make it with the popcorn set. Wrong. This film starts slowly, and never speeds up. And It's just because of this slow pace that it generates it's extraordinary power. Willis gives a performance that is so understated it almost seems as if he isn't acting. It turns out the child sees dead people. What is then discovered is the nub of the plot. Rather like Psycho, to reveal any more would ruin it. Shyamalan directs with an aplomb that is tight and underplayed. The whole feel of the piece is positively European. Because of our conditioning from a succesion of easy thrills Hollywood schlock you assume certain scenes will end with gore and splatter. Instead Shyamalan takes the pace down every time. Atmosphere oozes from every scene. This is quality filmmaking for the masses that doesn't take you for granted.It's not a classic.It is a bloody good piece of entertainment</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heard and read a lot about this movie and, well, it didn't really grab me. I felt the tension, but I wasn't sucked into it. It's a slow movie and I felt myself drifting away from it. There were some really eerie parts though, and I felt this movie was heading towards something. Something special. I'd already read this movie had a surprising final twist, so I was pondering on that throughout the movie. When the moment was there I was especially puzzled... I didn't even quite get it. When the actual end of the movie was there I got it and I was blown away by the ending. One of the best ever. In the days after I saw it I kept thinking about it. Wondering if the ending was in line with everything I'd seen before. As I said, the part leading up to the ending was eerie at some times, tensed, and it was good, but not great. Well, the more I thought of this movie (after I'd seen it), the more I realized how brilliant in fact it was. I decided I just HAD to see it again to see if it all made sense. Yesterday I went to see it for the second time. It was awesome. It was just SO cool to look at it, now knowing the final outcome. In fact, I was watching a whole different movie. I even felt more tension than during the first viewing. Right now I can say it's one of the better or best movies I've ever seen, like the Top 25 or so. The 2nd viewing really made for that utter great experience. The screenplay of this movie is absolutely brilliant. This movie is what moviemaking is all about.

		<shortDescription>A true gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do I begin to sing the praises to this film? The Sixth Sense is unlike anything I've ever seen, and by far the best film I've seen in years. Let me first say that I am no fan of horror films, and many classify this film as a horror picture. It is not quite that. One can get away with calling it a "supernatural psychological thriller" perhaps. To say that it is Horror however, is to put it in a genre generally known for its inferior product, and this film is anything but inferior. Unlike 1999's only other mentionable scare film, The Blair Witch Project, The Sixth Sense doesn't hide the terror from our sight. We do see the ghosts that frighten Cole Sear so much. And they are considerably scarier than the witch of the woods in Maryland. But these frightening scenes are but one element in the overall success recipe of the film. Foremost I should mention Haley Joel Osment. Only once before did a child actor really impress me. I thought that Nick Stahl (in Man Without a Face) was outstanding. But the depth and honesty of Haley's performance here I have yet to see the equal of. He completely convinced me of his fear, and he invoked protective instincts in me I didn't know I had. If there is any justice in Hollywood (yeah, right?) he will AT LEAST be nominated for an Academy Award. (If they could give it to Anna Paquin, they just might consider Haley). In any instance, this little man has given a performance that many adult actors can rightly be very jealous of. The other performances are all outstanding too, and I'm sure now that no one could have betterred Bruce Willis in this role.Then, the direction and photography are far superior to anything I have seen in ages. The film is dark. Literally black sometimes. There is hardly any sunlight anywhere, and the rooms are all pale and depressing. This is Cole's world, and we are put right in there the entire time. Shyamalan also sneaks some very clever shots in the back door. Look for a trace of Cole's sweat vanishing from the table, his reflection in a shiny doorknob etc. These and many more find their way into the film, and every one of them fits perfectly where they are put. In short - there is not a single frame out of place in this film.The human elements are also strikingly detailed. Note the parents at the school concert whip out their camcorders when they see their kids on stage. The cleverest scene of all, is between Willis and Haley. They play a "mind-reading" game, and although one of them wins this battle of wills and wits, they both end up losing it in a way.These are just a few examples of the quality that this film boasts. It is an extremely well made and unbelievably well thought out suspense film. It has been years since a film has given me physical, literal chills, and this film has done exactly that. It managed to scare me -- something that a macho twentysomething man like me wouldn't like to admit.A final word: firstly, if you plan on seeing this film, read as little about it as you can. Do not talk about it with friends who have seen it, because the less you know about it the better. Let it unfold and take you over in it's own time. And secondly, go see it in the theater if you can. The unbearably tense music and huge dark screen add something very special to the experience.I think this film is a masterpiece in its own right, and if you can appreciate a good story with terrific acting, go watch The Sixth Sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very few films have ever affected me so deeply. From its disturbing and paralyzing aspects to those that move the viewer to tears, THE SIXTH SENSE is the finest film (that this aficionado has seen) to emerge from Hollywood in a long while.Highlights include the wonderfully subdued performance by the terribly-underrated Bruce Willis (his versatility is uncanny) and that of Haley Joel Osment--up to this point still best remembered as the son of Forrest Gump in the Academy Award-winning film of the same name, who deserves an Oscar for delivering the finest child performance in film history.Toni Collette also shines playing Osment's character's mother.M. Night Shyamalan, late into his twenties, shows a maturity at the helm of this production not seen from a director his age since Spielberg directed JAWS. The surprise ending--which may remain a surprise to those who have not seen the film--is indeed wonderful. Those who claim it is not that remarkable probably had watched the film *expecting* to see something shocking. A viewer should imagine, after seeing the picture all of the way through, not having been expecting a surprise at all. Only then perhaps will he truly appreciate the finale. It becomes apparent that everything that seemed unimportant in the film, is actually the most crucial about it. A film that has appeared to be, and been advertised to be, about something terrifying, turns out to be something almost unbearably touching.Best of all, and rarely mentioned in the reviews for the film that I have read, is the contribution of composer James Newton Howard--penning a dazzling score for this exceptional picture. His score singlehandedly breathed life into the bleak future of film music (subsequent scores from the Baby Boom composers in 1999 have also been wonderful).Overall a tremendous film that takes its time to unsettle and amaze its viewer. It seems somewhat long and tedious upon its first viewing...but this is a film that demands multiple viewings. I've seen it three times, and I could see it three more--it just keeps getting better. It will be interesting to observe how well this film ages, and how and to what extent it will be appreciated years from now.</fullReview>

I have to admit that I was expecting yet another dumb piece of pablum. Instead, The Sixth Sense focuses on the characters and quite astutely. Some people will find this boring as there is very little action in the middle and avoids all the cheap gimics you would expect from a hollywood genre flick. Haley is quite extraordinary and avoids falling into the 'cutesy-ness' routine of so many young actors in his age. Willis is perfectly understated and delivers one of his best dramatic performances and kept the mugging to a minimum. Plus, he's given the best dialogue he's ever had. Go see it.</fullReview>

But these 5 min. are the ones, which made the Film a really great One! Blame on all, who tell their Freinds the End, they should see "Plan 9 from outer Space" 100 Times in a Row ! And I think Haley Joel Osment should be awarded at the Academy Award for best Main Actor, not only for "supporting", as by Golden Globe Award, cause he got the "Sixth Sense".If YOU want to see the Film, don't look at ANY previews ! Want not to know, what the Film is about! You will have an amazing Experience, I guarantee. You will sit there, as the Names after the Film scroll through the Screen, and the whole Picture will scroll through your Mind. Enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE END!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It happened to me when I watched The Usual Suspects and Carlito's way and Shawshank Redemption. And it happened to me when I saw The Sixth Sense. I was lying flat on my back and sat up straight when it happened. If I could've seen my own face I can bet I would have never looked more bewildered than that moment. To me sixth sense was a good movie with superb acting and great direction five minutes before it ended. After those five minutes it transformed into a classic worthy of an Oscar nomination. It definitely has one of the best ends ever in the cinematic history.Bruce Willis has taken a leap from being a good actor to being a great one. His talents were utilized to hilt by the debutante director M. Night Shyamalan. Bruce has proven that there is much more in him than we saw in action flicks like Die Hard series and Last Boy Scout. It will be unfair not to nominate him for the Oscar. There haven't been too many performances better than his, this year. But of course the revelation is Haley Joel Osment. He has given a gem of a performance so early in his career. The fear, the confusion, the lack of confidence, was portrayed in a manner that cannot be faulted. Its amazing how someone so young can firstly understand, and then deliver such a complex character. Full marks to him for giving probably the best juvenile performance ever. (Apologies to all those Home Alone lovers) And finally lets talk about M. Night Shyamalan. There could be no better way to start a career. He has made an ideal first move in what should be a long shining career. He knows his job well but most importantly one can't help feeling that this is a film made by someone who has thought, ate, slept this one for ages. It must have been really close to his heart and it shows. Lets keep our fingers crossed that he won't be a one-film wonder. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not my general taste - I had to be persuaded to watch it with the promise that I would be walked to my door to scare off ghoulies - but it is an instant classic. Willis is excellent, and Osment it amazing!! There are loads of shocks right from the start, and despite a low SFX budget, the chills are there, even from steamy breath and disappearing hand prints. It loses nothing from repeat viewings (I've now seen it three times - you actually need to see it more than once to get all the nuances) and the twist at the end? Well, it's a zinger.</fullReview>

I knew there was a plot twist towards the end, and when you find out that.... Nope, you can find out for yourself. I was completely and utterly amazed as the twist unravelled before my eyes. It was the last thing I had expected. I had contemplated a few endings, what if they.... or I bet that they..... I couldn't have been more wrong!!! I feel I have been extremely unfair when voting for this movie as I only gave it a 9, but it may increase after my second viewing. And third, fourth.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many a time have I walked into a movie theater expecting the best but receiving the, well, average. With The Sixth Sense it was just the opposite. I hadn't seen very many scary movies, but I had been hearing great things about this one. So I decided to end the constant badgering by my friends and went to see the movie. I went in expecting average and getting anything but. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat with ghosts (that are frighteningly real) and chilly air and the little boy's fright until the incredible turn of events at the end that will make you say, "Now I understand!", but you will end the conversation with that. The Sixth Sense is definitely worth the seven bucks to see it at night, but be warned: this is a horror movie, and you will be horrified.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hmm...I went into this movie totally unbiased, as I did not know much of anything about it. I had seen no trailers, nor read any reviews, in fact, the whole reason I ended up sitting in the theater was because I was out with a few friends and we decided to see a movie spur of the moment. Well "the Sixth Sense" being the only movie playing we decided upon it. (one of my friends having seen it several times.) As the movie began I was held riveted to my seat. The opening few scenes were excellently done. My heart, I must admit, actually stopped once or twice. I give my congrats to the writer and director and actors there... In addition, the final few moments of the movie were filled with a couple of excellent twists which re-captured my wandering attention. I say 're-captured' because I found the majority of the movie sadly lacking. The plot was thin and repetitive and the characters a bit shallow. After seeing something once or twice there was no need to show the same type situation over and over again.I will admit to not being a horror movie buff, however, I will say that I have seen low-budget television horrors that held me more captivated than this.I believe that one or two twists in the middle of the movie would have helped. Though, perhaps the movie needed a complete make over. Basically, the first five minutes and last five minutes are worth watching, if one can endure 2 hours of boredom...</fullReview>

Alright the three dead bodies in Haley's house were pretty cool. The twist ending, before i saw it all I heard about was this big twist ending and while watching it I thought well isn't this obvious. When he's sitting with toni collette she doesn't even look at him like he is not there, in the restaurant his wife just looks around, and once you add up all these things you realize hey he must be.............. watch it and see. I don't know but maybe all the hype surrounding the film wrecked it like so many other movie that have made it big in the US before they come to Australia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is a rating for a film's ability to leave you with your mouth hanging open in amazement, The Sixth Sense is a definite ten. If you haven't seen it, don't let anyone tell you the secret. This is one of those movies you just have to see twice just to figure out what you missed.Ozment makes the movie. His performance is brilliant, especially considering his age. Bruce Willis is understated in his role as a child psychologist. In fact, just about any actor could have played this role. Willis' name attracts people to a film they might ordinarily have ignored. In fact, the movie trailer itself might keep some people away from this film in fear that it is a horror flick. In fact, the trailer doesn't do the movie justice.The Sixth Sense is a thriller, but more than that, it is about people and their fear. You will find yourself sympathizing with the little boy as he goes through a psychological evolution. You might even rethink your feelings about the dead.</fullReview>

In fact, the only thing which upset my enjoyment was the person sitting next to me in the cinema, who on several occasions screamed very loudly.Anyway, putting my neighbour's reaction down as both a critical "thumbs up" on her part and a new form of personal surround-sound for me, there is little more to say than to recommend it. Great plot, well filmed, apposite music, solid acting - enthralling and a genuinely spooky "chiller" to boot.

Night Shyamalan. And I assure you that this is not the only worthwhile feature of the film. Although all the actors, apart from Bruce Willis, are unknown they perform tremendously. In particular, Haley Joel Osment's performance as the endued with the sixth sense little boy is excellent!One future of the film that I will never forget is the unbelievably amazing end. Of course I will not disclosure it.

		<fullReview>I can remember sitting at the movies this past summer awaiting to see Spike Lee's forgettable " Summer of Sam", my wife and I saw the trailer for " The Sixth Sense", I can remember turning to my wife and commenting on what a piece of garbage this looked like. I recently saw the film and I'm proud to say that I was wrong, I'm glad I saw " The Sixth Sense", if for any other reason than i witnessed one of the best performances of the year by young Haley Joel Osment( you might remember him as Forrest Junior in the end of Forrest Gump). He just received a well deserved Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor and hopefully in February he will receive his first Oscar nomination, this kid was that great! " Sixth Sense" suprised me like another film from a few years back "Primal Fear", a Richard Gere star vehicle which I refused to see for that reason,not realizing that a young up and comer named Edward Norton would make one of the great debut performances in screen history with his Oscar nominated turn in that film. Like "Primal Fear", " The Sixth Sense" features credible performances by two Hollywood icons whose work at times have made me want to vomit, but these films were dominated not by their star leading men but by their relatively unknown co -stars. Congratulations Haley on your Golden Globe nom., good luck in the 99 Oscar race!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I highly recommended this haunting thriller to my family and all my friends. It was great; most of all for three really important reasons. First of all the ending twist is the best and most thought provoking twist in a horror film since Norman Bates was Mrs. Bates in "Psycho"!!! Because a film can not be judged on the ending alone, there are two other reasons why this film is the best horror film made in the 90's. It's dramatic and caring. I really cared for these characters even though it was total fiction; that's what really good films do best. And I also enjoyed the terror and scary images in the film; they were very HAUNTING! This is a great motion picture. Only complaint; the Bruce Willis character leaves the boy too soon I think, I mean we are dealing with ghosts here; you would of thought he would of stayed with the boy longer. Also the film is never truly climatic or absolutely enthralling. But, all in all this stands as one of the best films of the year; it's on my top ten list! The Sixth Sense ***1/2(out of four) - 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being in Iceland we often get pictures few weeks later, after they're shown in the US. Most of the times we premiere them before or at the same time as in England or any other Europe country. Seeing the success in US made me very curious. Could Bruce Willis really act? Was this such a great movie, that both critics and audiences loved it so? With huge anticipation I finally got to see the film in October and although I expected something great, I didn't expect it like that!! The scripting, the plot, the directing, the acting ... is one of the best I've ever seen. I've always been fond of Bruce Willis films, the action and suspension. But this is by far his best film, his best acting, and most profitable! The star of the movie is Harvey Joel Osment, a true wonderkid, and if there ever was a justice in awards for acting, this kid should get some trophies. The script should be nominated too, plus Olivia Williams and Toni Collette. All are doing a great job and when you think about this film after you've seen... you get more and more convinced. This is arguably the best movie I've seen (besides Titanic) and I want to thank everyone involved in it for that. A true masterpiece. A true gem. A film you won't forget. And because of this film, I have high hopes for young Americans (well, from India or other countries) as directors. See it and believe it. Thanks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is clearly one of the best movies of the year, along with Matrix and Fight Club. What makes it so special is the incredibly complex story, the great cast and the dark style. You can watch it over and over, you will not be able to find any weaknesses in the entire movie. The story manages to combine emotional themes with stunning fear and darkness. It will scare you like "the exorcist" and thrill you like "the shawshank redemption". It is nice to see that there is finally a young actor with REAL talent. We have had enough of those terrible grown-up-wannabes like Jake Lloyd. Osment is very realistic, and together with the rest of the cast he gives you a great performance. The dark style creates an atmosphere that keeps you nailed to the screen. It is good to finally see a horror film without teen-slashing and cheap effects.The Sixth Sense - Watch it and love it.

		<fullReview>Don't let anyone tell you the ending to this mind blowing movie. There's a new king of film twist plots, roll over Angel Heart! For years there has not been a movie which I have come out of being blown away, until I saw the captivating and emotional Sixth Sense. If you like movies that have a little bit of intelligence and make you jump without being a horror movie then DO NOT miss it! When you have seen it once I guarantee you will want to see it again just to figure out all the bits you missed the first time. See it now and tell everybody!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Genuinely Surrealist artefact, in which a film whose structure is pervaded with death and dream has exploded into the mainstream. Best image: long shot of Malcolm and Anna caressing after his honouring by the city; the silver inscription tilted ominously sideways. Appropriately about the disruption of the domestic, but also the crimes and injustices of history returning to haunt the present, and especially the innocent. As such, its Surrealsim is political. Twist obviously crucial: but if we don't get it we must ask why we didn't find certain scenes strange. Do we find lack of communication normal? Acceptable?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the first time in my life, i really said "oh my god!" in a movie. I had to pause the film to get over the shock at the end. If we take this film as a whole, it was breathtaking right from the start. Before watching the film, i had doubts whether Bruce Willis was suitable for this role. However he was as good as the kid. I don't expect this film to get an Oscar. And i don't think it will get a nomination either. But i believe that the kid really deserves one. Whoever says anything about the film to a friend who hasn't seen it, will be doing something terrible to him. If a friend of yours starts to tell you something about the film, get away from him at once and don't ever see him again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Comments contain some spoilers!!!I felt this was an excellent film. The plot and storyline were well thought out and the acting was terrific. I'm not much of a Bruce Willis fan, but he did a fine job here. Spoilers belowMy one issue is this: taking into account that Willis' character is a ghost and we should assume that time passes differently for him, it still does not explain why it takes him so long to realize that something is wrong. Both at the restaurant with his wife and even more so waiting for Cole with Cole's mother and having no one take note of his presence might be a tip-off.This isn't enough to spoil the film for me, but it is a bit of a loose end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Putting the magic back into the telling of ghost stories</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hardly need to say anything ... or rather I can't say anything that hasn't already been. This is a excellent movie; we've had gore-fests, we've had horror-parody, now is the time for the return of the *intelligent* horror story.'The Sixth Sense' works it's magic by suggestion; by simply going *just* far enough from normality that the viewer spooks themselves.There are a couple of moments to make you jump, just to make sure you are in the right frame of mind; there are a few unpleasant ghouls, but this is no Clive Barker fright-a-thon.From those simple elements it builds slowly (perhaps a little too slowly) and you start to share in the torment of young Cole as he searches for an escape from all the "dead people" who inhabit his world. Eventually psychologist Crowe offers a way out and you sense that the film will have a happy ending and that, as it were, the ghosts will be laid to rest. But no, just when you start thinking all is well with the world, the *real* truth is revealed.It's not a 'Carrie' style heart-stopping moment, but the final twist is so brilliantly played out, you can't help but go back and revisit all those key moments that suddenly make a totally different sort of sense.The beauty, the magic, of this film is provided by the two splendid performances from young Osement (Cole) and Willis (Crowe) drawing you effortlessly into their world, making the unreal palpably real.Knowing that there is a big 'twist' to this film, you may well be able to work it out for yourself, but even if you do, you will surely enjoy this beautifully crafted film, a film that puts the magic back into the telling of ghost stories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surpassed my expectations- (SPOILER, though slightly subtle)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My expectations weren't too high- I saw a matinee, just wanted it to be mildly entertaining. I had seen BWP a few weeks before and thought it was creepy, but overhyped, and not the scariest movie of all time like everyone said. I had friends who said they almost cried BWP scared them so bad. Well, there's one of many moments in this (there's so many that just made every hair on my body stand on end, my skin crawl, and made me actually gasp- and I can say that movies that only have 1 or 2 moments like that, I can probably only name 10 or so) I won't give the end away, but the moment that starts out with the kid appearing to Cole and whispering excitedly, "Come on, I'll show you where my Dad keeps his gun"- that one moment, to me, was 10 times scarier than all of BWP put together. There were many times where I jumped, and it wasn't just a "fake" jump, it was something clever that I genuinely didn't see coming. As far as The Twist, first of all, I've decided when it's hyped that a movie HAS a twist ending, that's a drag right there, because you-well, I do anyway--spend at least half the time trying to guess the twist. Having seen a hell of a lot of movies, and a hell of a lot of twists, I usually get it 9 times out of 10. (BEGIN MINOR SPOILER) I guessed the twist in Jacob's Ladder, so...and it was already spoiled because I read a review that DIDN"T give a warning, but said, "If you've seen Jacob's Ladder and Angelheart, you'll see this one coming a mile away"(END) I'm pretty much the spoiler queen, it's like heroin or something, maybe 1% of the time I can resist reading them, I don't know what it is. If I had to pick any movie where I could go back and not know the spoiler ahead of time, this would be it. My husband didn't see it coming, and he's pretty clever about guessing them too. Something else I did not see coming was how emotional this movie made me. I had a friend die on me without getting to say goodbye but was over my grieving, and if you've recently experienced the death of someone close to you (especially if you are not finished grieving) then in all seriousness, please think twice before you watch it. During the second to last scene in the car, I surprised myself by starting to cry, hard, and I didn't stop until the credits were partway over (and Bruce Willis is not one of my favorite actors). GOD that scene in the car got to me. Re-reading the screenplay, I realized even more how great it was, and how heartbreaking. There are so many elements that just make your heart wrench. I read the last scenes of the screenplay at home, alone, and had a really good cry, which hasn't happened since I read the screenplay to The Green Mile. Aside from that, again, this movie scared the crap out of me. The premise is very scary but they could have handled it in a way that bungled it up, but they did it just right. Even if you *really* don't like Bruce Willis' acting, and were turned off by the trailer, give it a chance. But don't be surprised if you need to sleep with the light on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A chilling, emotional roller coaster ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood is littered with child actors who have failed to continue their careers beyond their childhood years. Macaulay Culkin, Shirley Temple and Gary Coleman to name but a few. There seems though a marked difference in the promise of young Haley-Joel Osment who almost carries the brilliant 'Sixth Sense' on his own shoulders as the apparently mentally troubled Cole Sear. Osment seems to almost inspire the likes of Bruce Willis to separately stellar performances. Cole Sear claims to have the ability to 'see dead people', Willis is the child psychologist who helps Cole deal with his strange 'hallucinations'.Willis' character, Malcolm Crowe is determined not to fail Cole in the way he failed an almost identical case years before. Crowe eventually discovers the incredible truth behind young Coles claims in one of the films more chilling scenes involving a tape recording of a previous session with another 'psychic'. Another scene which seemed to highlight the films Oscar potential involved Cole and his mother (played well by Toni Collette) caught in a traffic jam resulting from an accident, it is in this scene that the film reached its emotional peak and seems to reach out to anyone who has lost someone close to them without warning and with so much left unfinished.The Sixth Sense is an emotional and truly hair raising, fine piece of work that contains a final twist that will drop your jaw and send you back for more. It truly is a film that warrants a second viewing. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was excellent, very emotional, chilling, and it holds your interest the whole way through. There are some genuinely scary moments, (I jumped watching this and didn't jump once during the dismal "Stigmata"). Its pretty much like Maltin says, "the film is sinuous and creepy without being manipulative." Haley Joel Osment is astonishing, never has a child actor been so convincing since Anna Paquin in The Piano, who was around the same age when she won her academy award. Osment makes the film seem all the more real. I haven't seen Bruce Willis this good since Pulp Fiction. Toni Collete is great too, (although i could hear her australian accent creep through on occasion). Unfortunately, I was already aware of the twist at the end, (thanks to a tv presenter who decided to be incredibly irritating to my country by broadcasting the twist just to annoy everybody!) but this didnt diminish the power of the final scenes, which were both creepy, and touching. Ive already heard from people that this movie "sux" and it "doesnt have enough blood" and "it was boring", oh and "End of Days looks better". Hmmmmmmmmm, im sure a Schwarzenegger action vehicle will be better. Right. Im not sure if the film will get a best picture nomination, theres probably been better this year, but if little Osment doesnt get a nomination I will despise the academy awards!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood's been getting better at producing more intelligent horror/thriller films of late. I'm not sure what's going on; perhaps it's something they're putting in the bottled water. Anyway - "The Sixth Sense" is a lovely example of what a "taught psychological thriller" should be all about. Shyamalan's opus about a little boy and his counsellor hits exactly all the right buttons, and does so whilst cranking up the tension to an almost unbearable level.It is not overly gory, it does not rely on hugely fantastic special effects to stun and amaze the audience, neither does it resort to clichd shock tactics. It is a great example of a good idea for a good film cleverly executed. The performances are good by all, but a special mention must go to Haley Joel Osment who plays a difficult and demanding role with the ability and talent of an actor five times his age. Toni Collette is also superb as his troubled mother, and it is very refreshing to see her tackling such a diverse range of roles (including such films as "Muriel's Wedding", "Emma" and "Velvet Goldmine").I will confess that the storyline was somewhat spoiled for me, as somebody I know (and now despise) had the stupidity to tell me what the twist was. So, rather than appreciating what should have been an excellent exercise in astounding revelations, I sat through the movie thinking "oooh, that's clever" and "of course, I understand why that happened". I feel rather cheated out of watching it for the first time, all in all, which is more than a little disappointing. So, if you have seen the film, or you know the twist for some other reason, then keep your mouth firmly shut, and don't spoil it for others. And therin lies the film's main weakness - it is extremely vulnerable. A great deal of the film's effectiveness relies on the fact that people will not talk about it to other people who have not seen the movie. And, as we know, people have a tendency to blab.This gripe aside, "The Sixth Sense" gains a lot of praise (and deservedly so) for being a cunning little movie with a nice line in scaring the pants off you. I feel that a great deal of praise should also go to the studios who produced this film (Hollywood Pictures and Spyglass Entertainment), for not leaving it to fester, or become a low-budget B-movie, a straight-to-video job, as it could easily have been. These sorts of thrillers are ten-a-penny these days, and it's nice to see that they recognised Shyamalan's talent for writing and directing, and gave the project a budget, a distribution and a cast it deserved. (Although one can speculate that it's reaping the rewards by taking in a phenomenal amount of money - rightly so, too).The cinematography is well done, the soundtrack not too intrusive, and there are no appalling performances to spoil the rest of the movie's grandeur. "The Sixth Sense" is a good movie, pitched at exactly the right level, and it's a great night out at the cinema too. Even my parents enjoyed it, so it must be doing something right!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much has been made of the twist in this film. I don't know whether this says something about me or the predictability of Hollywood but from simply having some knowledge of what the film was about, I actually guessed what the twist would be before I had even seen the film. Given this hunch, it was really quite obvious as the film progressed that I was right -however even when it came at the end it was still packed with enough power that it sent a shiver through my body.Credit then to the director, who accomplishes this, and the rest of the film with consumate skill. There are a few powerful moments in this film which should rightly go down as great moments in cinema. However if I was going to draw faults, I would say it takes too long for the plot which everybody already knows (that the kid can see dead people) to unfold, and that perhaps more could have been done with it one it has.Still, great performances from both Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment as the kid make this as believable as it could possibly be, and you're unlikely to see a better chiller than this in the next year.Go see it.</fullReview>

So many movies feature so much tedious, unreal dialogue--assuming they feature a plot at all--that it struck me as a real revelation that M. Night Shyamalan's script could ring so true and sound so human. I think I am going to savor a number of scenes for as long as memory lasts, some scenes were gripping, involving and satisfying; credit should go to the actors surely, but surely to the screenplay, as well.I hope Haley Osment receives at least an Oscar nomination.

Everything about this flick was outstanding, especially the plot and the twist at the end.Mr Willis is at his best in this, and the boy Cole with his 'sixth sense powers' is truly convincing. To have the ability to not only see the dead but speak with them must be terrifying for a boy his age (see what happens to the other boy Vincent)...It was scary, but not meant to be a mindless gore fest, which made a great change from the usual Scream-like antics we see in movies today. Some parts really made the skin crawl, especially the things the boy Cole says (I'll leave it to you to see the flick) and sees. It was awesomely acted, unlike some bombs that have been churned out this year! Although it may not appeal to those who like blood and gore splashing all over the screen, I recommend this flick to all those who enjoy a truly frightening but tasteful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How come nobody's mentioned the Usual Suspects?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It just surprised me a bit. The past few years have seen a whole bundle of 'twist' movies (Wild Things, Dead Man's Curve etc) where the final reel reveals new insights into the previous ones, but although none of them are bad movies as such, they've all seemed a bit too self-conscious - twists for the sake of it, rather than in order to genuinely stun the audience. Because you know that nothing is what it seems, you spend the movie trying to guess what the twist will be. The biggest effect it can have on you, therefore, is to mildly surprise you with the way things turned out. The success of the Sixth Sense is, like the Usual Suspects, that it only turns out to have a twist right at the very end. Most people I know who saw the Usual Suspects went to see a heist movie, and thought they'd got one right until the fateful pin-up-board-coffee-cup moment. Similarly, with the Sixth Sense, you get an effective and straightforward spooky movie which suddenly catches you by surprise. The movie has done such an effective job at this that I think it has been somewhat overrated.First of all, I admit that I knew that a twist of some sort was coming (knowing that, it became quite predictable), which, by what I've said already, means that my appreciation for the movie was dulled because it couldn't completely surprise me. The flipside is that I wasn't so awed by the twist as to be blinded by the movie's faults. It's definitely a good film - maybe an '8', and the acting is superb (especially in the mother-son scene in the car), but it's nowhere near one of the all-time top 100 movies, let alone top 10. Two main points:1. Once you remove the shock-effect of the twist, it's actually a very meagre tale. As many others have pointed out, the actual resolution of the boy's problem is given far too little weight -the film is unbalanced. Far too much of it is taken up by Bruce finding out what anybody who's seen the trailor already knows, and far too little actually deals with it.2. If you argue that the twist cannot be removed from the story as a whole - that it is simply too central, then the film must be judged on how well it is integrated into what goes before. The brilliance of the Usual Suspects is that the twist and counter-twists of the ending both explain the previous events better than the previous narrative had. It all makes so much more sense. Although the Sixth Sense is pretty tight (the first encounter between Bruce and the boy makes more sense at the end, for example), there are nonetheless big gaps, like what happened in the time between the opening Donny Wahlberg bit and the "The Next Fall" new scene (sorry, I'm trying really hard not to give away any spoilers). I have bigger objections still, but I don't want to give it all away (a cop-out, I admit).There are loads of good points about the Sixth Sense (the acting and the elegant direction spring most immediately to mind) which elevate it to the status of a damn good movie, but if you remove the once-only shock of the twist, what you're left with is not enough to make it a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, there is no way I would have imagined Bruce Willis could pull this kind of movie off. He's completely the wrong person for it when you think about it. Usually known for his smarmy, in control hard man action roles, it is totally explosive to see him playing a tortured, confused waif of a man, grasping at straws and completely out of his depth.But forget Willis, everyone in the movie is compelling for different reasons. The movie itslef is like a box. When you get to the end and see all sides come together, you simply have to marvel at the neatness and cohesiveness with which the whole experience was put together.Beautifully acted, scripted, photographed and delivered.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was able to predict the ending of The Crying Game. I was able to predict the ending of The Usual Suspects. I wasn't even in the predicting mode when The Sixth Sense surprised me more than any other movie ever has. And the surprise is not far fetched. It's completely logical but so well hidden in the way the movie moves.The movie also got my hair to stand straight for a few extended moments, and startled me once.And all that was done with a brilliant script, acting talents, brilliant cutting and direction, and music that plays with the viewer's feelings.I love surprises.I'm hard to surprise.I got surprised.Excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the full-throttle media build-up, I was genuinely shocked to find how crushingly mundane this film is. There is literally nothing to it.Although well-acted and visually superb, The Sixth Sense is a whispered, re-hash of the more tedious scenes from your least favourite horror films and thrillers. It mistakes tedium for intelligence, and inaction for faith in the viewer's intelligence. As for the 'twist' ending... well, it's more heavily signposted than the M25. If you haven't guessed it by the time the film is halfway through its scrape, then you have some serious problems...It was watchable enough, mind you...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A feel-good horror from an emerging master storyteller -- a masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sixth Sense" tells the story of the young tormented boy Cole Sear (played superbly by Haley Joel Osment), child psychologist Dr. Crowe (played by Bruce Willis in for me the best performance of his career to date), and Cole's fiercely loyal mother Lynn (played by Australian Toni Collette). I happened to catch Osment in an episode of "Walker: Texas Ranger" shortly before seeing this film. He was a few years younger in that but his acting was uncannily affecting for such an unintelligent television program (its not surprising he was nominated for a Young Artists award for his performance). He stole the show in that, as he did in this. Everyone seemed to be commenting after the film on how good 'the kid' was -- including me. I'd hazard a guess to say that he's one child actor who will maintain a strong acting career throughout his adolescence and into adulthood.Told with genuine tension -- hats off to the writer/director M. Night Shyamalan -- occasionally you'll jump in your seat, a chill will run down your spine, and the hair on the back of your neck may even stand up. The final dnouement was superb (and that's all I'll say about that). In a word (or three), a must see. "The Sixth Sense" is without doubt one of the best films I have seen for a long, long time.If you loved this film, check out Shyamalan's previous film "Wide Awake", a feel-good comedy, also dealing with the spiritual.Mr. Shyamalan -- you are a master storyteller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know what to expect when my wife and I went to see this movie. I suppose we were sucked in by the whispering kid in the trailer like everyone else. I generally won't even bother watching horror movies, and fortunately, this is not a horror movie as I would define it. Suspense, yes...a bit shocking, yes. But there was a great deal of human emotion here. Willis was very good...but, admittedly, I usually like him. Clearly, however, this was a defining role for his capabilities beyond cynical action hero. Haley Joel Osment was stunning. I wonder what else this kid can do?!? The mom was strong, too. I liked the way it was filmed...it moved at a pace that held my interest but didn't drive the film forward. It left room for the story to unfold. This was one of the better movies I've ever seen. I would recommend it to almost anyone...and I have. But since people come at movies from different places, I don't say a lot about it ahead of time. This one could be too easily spoiled by trying to tell the story. Better to let people discover it for themselves. I am very interested in seeing future films from the writer/director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was happy with this movie pretty much across the board. It worked as a scary/horror story (managing to be both frightening as well as disgusting, something that people often confuse). Although we don't get to see much of the story between Bruce Willis and his wife, it does have elements of romance. Lastly, it's a good mystery -- why the heck are these ghosts bothering this kid?Personally, I didn't see the ending coming, and I loved it. I've talked to people who say "Oh, it was obvious", but all I can say is "Everything's obvious after it's been spelled out in front of you." As for complaints that major pieces of 'plot' weren't described (what does the mother do for a living, where's the father), I guess I looked at this movie as if it were a play in which the interaction between Bruce Willis and the boy was the focus, and other things were merely added where they contributed to that story. When I read Hamlet I don't ask myself what Rosencrantz and Guildenstern were doing before the King summoned them, or whatever happened to Reynaldo. Those elements aren't vital to the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense heralds the arrival of a major new acting talent in the realm of movies,giving an astounding acting debut.Which is strange because he's been around since the end of the 70's.He had a famous wife.You might have heard of him.His name is Bruce. The Sixth Sense is another horror benchmark horror film.While all of the recent post-modern slasher flicks are only interested in scaring its audience,(as well as being witty and having beautiful people chased by psychopaths)this concerns itself with emoting feelings from its viewers.There are scenes(mainly between mother and child)that are genuinely emotional.The Sixth Senses reputation has so far built around the twist at the end.While it is well crafted,depending on how intensely you are watching it,you may(like me and many of my mates)guess it before it comes along. The Sixth Sense is a horror film,delivering moments of subtle creepiness,cringing nastiness(Cole locked in the attic room)but the scariest thing about the film is how good an actor Haley Joel Osment is.The best child actor since Macauley Culkin gives the best child performance since Anna Paquin in "The Piano".Paquin got an Oscar for her eforts,Osment deserves one.As does Willis for his touching,layered performance as the child shrink unable to forget his past.The fact that The Sixth Sense works is testament to the talent of Bruce Willis,lets hope he can keep up the acting trend,and can continue to survive without the safety nets of big guns,string vests and Alan Rickman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Not too bad at all...'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rather good film overall... it seems a little empty in places and generally uncertain in it's message to the viewer, but it maintains the attention well. S Some of the scares are pretty tacky and overblown, but with well-executed buildups. The twist is excellently planned, and suprised me - though it's a little odd that the fact revealed by the twist does not have a noticable effect on Cole during the preceding rolls of film. The performance of the adult cast, while convincing in themselves, is totally eclipsed by that of Haley Joel Osmet, who is simply SUPERB. Perhaps even the best performance ever by a child actor. Very, VERY intense, emotional, and moving - particularly the scene where he is locked in a cupboard at a 'friend's' birthday party. Toni Collette is the only other actor who comes close - The scene where she discovers a previously unknown truth about her mother is excellently played, despite the unusual setting for such a scene. Bruce Willis missed an opportunity with this however, playing little more than a (admittedly positive) variation on his recent characters' emotionally dry, squinty-eyed selves. Moreover, it seems a little like the filmmakers didn't get the time to include everything they wanted in this movie. I found it somewhat unconvincing that once Cole 'tests' the theory of why he is being visited, everything is suddenly perfectly cleared up, and the film ends after 15 minutes. No 'journey' by Cole, up to this point. Having said that, neither of those points detract significantly from this otherwise very entertaining picture. Go see it.</fullReview>

The acting was OK, nothing special the plot was fairly run of the mill. The only bit that I didn't see coming was the ending - which raised it from a "4" to a 5. The scary parts relied on the tried and tested "loud noise makes you jump" formula used time and time again. Overall: By all means see this one and see it all the way to the finish as the ending is the best part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghost story with heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American ghosts, like American gothic, seem to have been imported with a lot of other European cultural baggage into the New World (though the Indians had their own), but their basic modus operandi is the same. Ghosts linger after death only if there is some unfinished business, usually if they have died a violent death that remains unavenged. They are not terribly easy to communicate with. They are also guaranteed to drop the room temperature in the most overheated living room. And of course some people are much more sensitive to ghosts than others, having a "sixth sense".Ghost folklore is put to good use here in what is really an exploration of the relationship between a child psychotherapist and his patient, Cole, a sad seven year old whose parents have split up and who doesn't seem to be coping well. For that matter, the psychotherapist isn't coping too well with his problems either, his failing marriage and the memory of a patient who killed himself after. But once the Doctor accepts that the kid is really seeing things he is able to help, and he realises at the end that he has helped himself a lot too. Although the whole film has a pretty sombre tone, set in a well-observed gothic but real Philadelphia the tourist brochures are not likely to feature, it finishes on an optimistic note. Sometimes the ghosts will be able to finish their business satisfactorily, and be on their way, leaving us to carry on our lives in our own way without being haunted by the past.Bruce Willis is cast as the Doctor. An interesting choice; he has been seen mostly as an action man zombie in violent thrillers (Die Hard etc). Here he is a zombie of a different sort, reflective, sensitive, concerned, guilt-ridden. He is greatly helped by a truly stunning performance by child actor Haley Joel Osment as Cole who communicates his character's pain so well we all suffer. You don't have to believe in ghosts to feel that no seven year old should have to put up with what this kid has to bear. In a lesser role, Toni Collette does a nicely observed caring but baffled mother, single, but coping (or would be but for Cole's problem). Olivia Williams rounds out the cast as the Doctor's wife, who, after flirting with the handsome help at her shop, takes to watching their wedding video when he's late home. Donnie Wahlberg (brother of Mark) also does a nice cameo as a deranged intruder.The writer-director, M. Night Shyamalan, an ethnic East Indian brought up by his doctor parents in Philadelphia, (and who has a cameo role as an emergency room doctor here), has retold a truly ancient myth in a subdued and sombre style unusual in a mainstream Hollywood production. His handling of the scenes between Doctor and patient is quite masterly. At the end we are left with a simple but often forgotten truth: Our ghosts are about ourselves and once we recognise that we can deal with them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's twist again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a good year. The Matrix put the thought back into action, The Mummy gave us fun adventure almost worthy of Indy himself, the much overlooked Go walked a great dramatic line between danger and humour, Blair Witch was incredibly inventive (albeit partly through necessity), and if my friends are to be believed Fight Club, will in turns repulse and excite me.Another movie to add to the list is definitely The Sixth Sense. How nice it is to be treated to a mature subtle film for a change. Although it's doubtful whether you could call Blair Witch or The Sixth Sense 'horror', the pair do make an effective anti-dote to the CGI tedium of The Haunting remake, reminding people that a film can live on in the mind long after the credits have rolled. It is also worthwhile approaching both films in the same manner: Ignore the hype, don't expect slick FX, just sit back and watch a nicely crafted little movie rather than the 'event' you were expecting. Less is more. So here's to more less.Unlike Blair however, there are a few traditional 'haunted house' tricks, mostly designed to startle the audience - someone suddenly walks in front of camera, or appears then disappears in the distance. 'Cheap' maybe, but also extremely effective as the camera is so still during the film that any unexpected movement becomes all the more obvious. The two leads are great, Osment is suitably fragile after home problems and ghostly visits, and Bruce is nicely calm.Problems? Well, some scenes remind me in essence of Danny in The Shining, but hey, that was 20 years ago now. A bit schmaltzy in places? Maybe, but for the most part the overal tone remains dark. It is also a little slow in places, but to be honest the final twist does reward your patience tenfold. And what about that twist? Well, knowing there was one did send my mind into overdrive, and one of the (many) possibilities I came up with was correct, but it was still a shock when confirmed. Long after leaving the theatre I was still remembering all the little details and important clues that totally passed me by, and with each new discovery my admiration grows.Maybe on my visit to Fight Club I might just have a last minute change of mind and dive into Sixth Sense again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepiest film of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first film in about a decade which has forced me to watch certain scenes through half closed eyes. I think that this is due to the realism portrayed by both the direction and the quality of acting.Bruce Willis does an excellent job but the real star is the young lad who plays Cole (there is no way that anybody could have acted the part better, definite Oscar material).The deliberately slow build up creates an almost tangible atmosphere and the lack of CGI makes the whole think more realistic and hence more creepy. I have never seen more people jump or scream whilst watching a film.The most amazing thing about this film is the way it merges so many emotions, you can't help but begin to care about the characters. This is all built up towards the end where one minute you are watching an incredibly emotional scene regarding Cole and his mother and the next you are left spinning by perhaps the most incredible ending to a film this decade. Forget The Usual Suspects.I urge anyone who enjoys a night out at the pictures to go and see this film, I can almost guarantee that you will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A psychological horror movie that resonates in the soul after the experience is over.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a long time since Hollywood made a horror movie that relied more on acting and characters than special effects and shameless gore. Luckily for us, M. Night Shyamalan is as much a fan of Henry James as Stephen King, and his movie, The Sixth Sense, is a masterpiece of psychological horror that would make the writer of 'Turn of the Screw' proud. Shyamalan successfully resists the temptation to throw in cheap thrills, and instead focuses on the characters, how they react to their situation, and how they are changed by it. The audience quickly sympathizes with the young boy who can see dead people, and the broken man who feels driven to help him.Young Haley Joel Osment gives a performance that is more textured than any since Anna Paquin in the Piano, and Bruce Willis' familiar taciturn demeanour works well for him. Certainly one of the best movies of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The whole movie is centered around the "surprise ending". From what I've seen and heard, when one is surprised by the ending, and think that it's brilliant, one generally loves the film. But if you know the ending of Sixth Sense, this movie seems to drag on, and I was pretty bored most of the time. I just wasn't very interested in the surprise, and didn't find that there was much more to this film. Good performances by Willis, Osment and others, and a few intense moments that were well directed, help to keep Sixth Sense from being as bad as it could have been. After seeing the ads, I though Osment would be real irritating, but he surprised me, and I think he will probably give us good to great performances for a long time to come. Sixth Sense is rated as one of the best movies of all time on the Internet Movie Database. I happen to believe that the public should be able to judge movies better than that.

As the year plodded on I thought the best had come and gone until I saw ?The Sixth Sense', wow, what a brilliant film. Everything about this movie is top notch from the acting, the story, and script, commendation has definitely got to go to the actors, everybody from Bruce Willis to Toni Collette (from Muriel's Wedding) were perfectly cast and all gave career high performances. ?The Sixth Sense' grabs you from the opening and doesn't let go until its fantastic conclusion, and for a fairly slow paced story you simply cannot take your eyes from the screen. If you like to be scared, this is the movie watch, forget all the garbage Hollywood has been shoving down our throats, Yes ?Scream' and ?I Know What You Did Last Summer', I am talking about you. Lets hope that future productions use this style of chiller as a blueprint instead of the thoroughly unimaginative ?slasher' movies of recent years.?The Sixth Sense' has got to be one of the top movies of the year, if not the decade. I watched the film over a week ago and I still think about it, that's just how haunting an experience it is. My highest praise goes out to everyone involved in the making of this unforgettable, excellent motion picture.</fullReview>

It's all of them, and although you can clearly see the joins, it helps you across them without you really giving them a second thought.I thought this film was fantastic. Bruce Willis proves that he can act without a dirty string vest, and he proves that there's talent in there dying to get out, with this film I think he's got his ticket out of the action hero genre.Osment, the child star, is amazing. When he whispers low you can feel how scared he is, he genuinely looks terrified during the scary section. This child is more believable than a lot of so-called A-list stars.This is another clever film, it manages to avoid stock scare tactics and over the top "I'm over here" signs in the story, it's a huge surprise, and I loved it.Go see this film, pray you don't catch any spoilers as I did, and go see it.

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is not quite a horror movie. You might call it drama, but of that I'm not even sure. But whatever genre, the movie transcends it.I do not wish to spend my time summing up the movie's plot. It is quite simple enough, and if you haven't seen it, you've probably heard something about it, or else you wouldn't be here.What really struck me about the movie was it's interweaving details. If you've only seen it once, see it again. Then you might notice the fact that Malcolm always has problems opening the cellar door; that Cole's mother never awknowledges Malcolm when he comes to see the boy; the looks Cole gives Malcolm when he asks him "what is it that YOU want out of this?"; and other things. The clues are all there, but subtly woven into the plot.The acting was very very good also. The young boy always portrays exactly what he is feeling--we can tell, and we feel sympathy and pain for his sake. Bruce Willis makes the perfect psychologist--he is calm and caring, and he doesn't give up.The movie's surprise ending didn't catch me off guard--because I had been previously told. But it was still as emotional and well done as I ever might have expected.The Sixth Sense really impressed me--and it made me think profoundly--few movies do that nowadays. See it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, there sure are a LOT of comments for this movie! Anyway, overall I thought it was fantastic, since it was quite refreshing from regular action films, and the whole plot (to me) was quite satisfying. Most people have already said what I wanted to say, but I wanted to contribute my two cents too. ^.^ Actually, in quite a few bits, e.g. Cole busting to go to the toilet, etc, made the whole (packed) cinema laugh.The only downside to the movie was that even though I was only seeing the movie for the first time and hadn't read anything on the internet or any spoilers (not even this page yet) concerning the ending, and yet because ONE person told me there was a twist at the end of the story, halfway through I guessed what it was, and kept hoping I was wrong but I had guessed correctly! (which kinda took away most of the suspense) But still... and also after reading the other comments, isn't Haley Joel a main character, not a supporting actor? (I mean, if he got nominated for an Oscar, which I think he should too) He sure stole the show from Bruce Willis... ^_^ Anyway, the filmmakers were quite smart because now I want to see the movie again, in the point of view of KNOWING for sure the ending and trying to make sense of it during the movie... If you haven't seen it, DO go see it, and don't try to guess the ending, just WATCH the movie, okay? ^.^</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a horror, it's a scary drama!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sixth Sense is not a horror film. It's about ghosts and possesses a number of shocks that will levitate you from your seat but it's not a horror movie. This is a drama about a kid who can see the dead and the psychologist that tries to help him.The film opens with Bruce Willis and his wife (Olivia Williams) celebrating his achievement of winning an award for outstanding work as a child psychologist. The night is interrupted by a former patient who Willis failed to help. He attacks Willis before killing himself.A year on and Willis has a new patient named Cole played by the outstanding Haley Joel Osment. Willis sees in Osment a chance to make amends for the patient who he let down a number of years ago. From here on there are two plots both revolving about a family. The most interesting of which is that of Osment's. He keeps many secrets and refuses to tell his mother. He confides in Willis; he has got an ability to see the living dead. This ability has to be the most frightening that a child would ever have to face. The other less interesting plot concerns Willis and his wife who seem to be be growing apart.M. Night Shyamalan proves himself capable as both writer and director. He uses strange camera angles to suggest the eerie nature of Osment's dilemma. His writing is also adept; it is surely Oscar-nominated material. The opening 45 minutes are quitely effective before the film really grips you. The finale is successful in what it does. It was purely designed to promote the film's chances at the box office, and it seems to have worked.</fullReview>

Well, I guess everyone knows now.It's nice to see that Mr Willis is maturing as an actor, and is starting to show a knack for sympathetic characterisations. But, Man, Haley Joel Osment--what a find. I don't think I have ever seen a more mature, forceful performance from a child actor.To cap it all off, the final plot-twist is an even bigger jaw-landing-in-your-lap surprise than the one in 'The Crying Game'.

		<fullReview>Excellent ghostly horror film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, cleverly plotted and beautifully photographed, with moore than a few chills and twists. A surprisingly superb performance by Bruce Willis("Pulp Fiction", "The Last Boy Scout") as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, the child psychologist who tries desperately to cownnect with a reclusive, ostracized young boy, equally well-played by newcowmer Haley Joel Osmet. I say surprisingly superb in regards to Willis, who for once shows a level of depth and refinement previously not allowed him by the cardboard characters of his bone-headed, fx-ladened action movies ("Armageddon", "Die Hard"). "The Sixth Sense", like the earlier "Blair Witch Project", has become an instant horror classic, thanks largely to the wonderfully written script of Shyalaman, a heretofore largely unknown talent from the outscirts of Philly. His story eschews gory, cliched action-horror, and goes for the intellectual side of the supernatural. Well-done, genuinely frightening, and lots of fun, the MooCow says grab some popcorn &amp; check out this ghastly goody! :?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. That's what I can say about this movie. The only other movie I can remember with a surprise twist was The Usual Suspects. I had trouble following that film's twist and turns in the plot. The Sixth Sense goes with simple-fashioned storytelling. No big sidetracks to the story and just follow the characters from beginning to end. It's hard to describe what I think of the film's major plot points without in effect dropping hints. All I can say is the mood isn't so scary, although it is creepy. But it would be surprising if this film at least won't be nominated in the Oscars for Best Screenplay.The verdict: 5 of 5 stars. This is the best film I've seen so far this year.</fullReview>

Malcom couldn't help Cole/Vincent while Malcom was alive so Vincent/Cole kills Malcom, who then goes back in time and IS able to help Vincent/Cole by using his curse as a gift to help the dead girl (and helping other ghosts, including Malcom). Because Malcom is able to help Vincent/Cole, there is no reason for Vincent/Cole to kill Malcom, which breaks the cycle, so Malcom is in truth never killed. How do I know Vincent and Cole are the same person? They both have a bunch of white hairs and both say the same thing, "Do you know why you are afraid when you're alone?--I do." Lee</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak plot but weirdly affecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the plot in this film was terribly weak and Bruce Willis's acting flat. Moreover, given the sinister overtones, his face is too cherubic and ungrizzled, seeming to smirk in serious scenes. Before seeing this film I had been told there was a big twist at the end but I did not know what it was. All through the film I tried to guess. I came up with the final twist but rejected it a couple of times. It is just too incredible. Now that is saying a lot when the two premises on which the film is based are that some people can see and commune with ghosts while others cannot and that ghosts can move physical objects. All that said, there is something affecting about the film. When I left the cinema the world seemed surreal. For some hours I felt literally uncertain about the people I saw around me and the motives for their behaviour. A weird experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If You haven't seen this movie, DON'T READ FURTHER!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all anyone who trashes this movie either doesn't understand the movie fully or doesn't want to understand. Every actor in this movie played an important role and gave brilliant performances. Particularly Bruce Willis in his first successful serious role, definitley his best and Toni Collete for a fantastic portrayal of a single mother.Now lets get into it... This is not a scary movie, the main issue here is the afterlife which would probably fall into a supernatural/psychological drama. This movie is about one mans journey into the afterlife.As we begin the film, we see the final moments of Malcom Crowe's life. Note how his wife Anna and him communicate. When Vincent Grey actually enters the scene notice the striking physical resemblence to Cole Sear.Could they be the same person? It is possible, notice the voice simmalarity, of young vincent. This leads to a theory that Crowe's life is flashing before his eyes and has stopped at where Vincent is a boy except his name is Cole yet they are the same person, however Crowe switches into the present every time he is with his wife. Which leads to questions like: Who is the young man Anna is with? Is it a younger Malcom? Why does Anna give this young man a first edition book?Anyways back to the plot Crowe is confronted by a patient whom he has failed(Vincent/Cole?) before giving the chance to help, the patient shoots him and then himself. The movie begins one year after the murders. Crowe is waiting for Cole, and he is reading a file similar to Vincent's. Heres a question: If Crowe has been dead for a year where did he get the file? How did he know about Cole?The film then journeys into the building of Crowe and Cole's relationship, the problems and triumphs Cole and Crowe have during the process and the frustrations and understandings Cole has with his Mum.Notice how no one ever notices Crowe, yet Cole does. Can Cole See this? Does Cole Know Crowe is a Ghost? Now here are some things to think about: When Cole's Mum is looking at the photo's why is their no ghost's sprite when it shows the youngest picture of Cole? There are alot of first person views in Cole's house especially with his Mum,like she is being watched. These are all important but, pay attention to every scene Crowe is in and look at how he handles himself and how others handle him. He knows he is dead, he just forgets or wants to forget.Cole sees ghosts they scare him, Why doesnt Crowe scare him? Crowe helps Cole with his problem, by telling him to listen to the ghosts and they will go away. Cole does this and he infact helps one and it goes away(crosses into the afterlife) he realises that he has a gift and he shouldnt be scared. He then helps Crowe with his problem, even though Crowe was dead he didn't know how to communicate with his wife. That really is Cole's role in the movie except one bit: How did Cole open so many drawers and cupboards so quickly? Did he infact do it? Why did the hand print appear then disappear afterwards?Where as for his mum she just wanted to understand her son, and when she finally did he solved a grief she had for years and no bond could have been greater than her new bond with her son.As for Crowe he is infact the main character, and the film is about him and how he helps a boy with a great gift that others dont understand, and how he deals with the fact he is dead.The ending is a twist when watched for the first time, but when watched more than once it shows infact that even though Cole said "people don't know their dead" they do know they just dont want to admit it. The final moment is one of great WARMTH, LOVE, LIGHT and LIFE. The words he says here show that he in fact knew he was dead, HE JUST HAD A HARD TIME COPING WITH IT. This is a film of the ages and makes us think about death and the afterlife the way it should be looked at, this will forever be a film that will constantly bring up new things and intrigue us forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly one of the very best movies I've ever seen so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, where should I start talking about this movie? Before I saw it, I've heard so many positive things about it, especially its surprising twist at the ending. So, then I thought that this must be a must-see film, and I decided to go and see it on the first day it was released in Australia. It was so unbelievably packed in the cinemas that almost every session was sold out on that day, and I truly had some difficulty in buying the tickets. And, the most important thing, after watching it, I was truly amazed and absolutely impressed by the movie. Brilliant original idea and marvellous performance by its actors, everyone who worked on this movie must be very proud of it. Little wonder, it has brilliant script, supported by extraordinary performances and it makes every actor in it look extremely good, especially Haley Joel Osment, Bruce Willis and Toni Collete, the leading actors...... So far, I have seen it three times, and I will be definitely going back again to watch it. The second and third time around were even better, although the surprising ending part was no longer a big surprise anymore, but really, the ending is truly the one to die for. Each time I watched it, I was truly touched by the ending and my tears just nearly burst out...... Enough said, definitely go and see this movie.... This movie will really touch your heart, even though it might not be the scariest movie you've ever seen....But without the help of any special effect, this movie does a very good job in scaring everyone out of the seats (just compare it with THE HAUNTING, it makes THE HAUNTING look like an absolute joke).... One more thing, if it doesn't get any Oscar nomination next year which I think it deserves much (Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor, Best Original Script), it will be a huge tragedy for the film industry....... Reason? Because this is simply one of the best films of the year</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so you're in the reviews section of IMDb, so that means that you are a bit of a film buff, so by this time, even if you haven't seen the movie, you have already read somewhere that there is a huge twist at the end, so I'm not spoiling it to you by telling you "there is a twist", am I?Well, the trouble is, I am. European audiences have heard about the success of this movie in the States, and have heard about there being a twist, so most of us see it expecting it to come. And if you expect it, it is really quite obvious and easy to figure out long before it happens, there are many hints (put there so that everything makes sense at the end, of course). And it's not even such an original idea, we've seen similar things in other famous movies (which I won't mention so as not to give away too much). The whole movie relies very much on this final revelation, and until it comes, it just doesn't have anything consistent to say, there is never any real feeling of menace, which surely is the worst that can happen to a horror film(I do think, though, that the performances are quite decent, especially Osment's, given the difficulty of his role. But the pace could certainly be better). So if you see it without being surprised by the ending, the whole thing doesn't seem so impressive. A bit empty really. OK, but nothing extraordinary. I'd say 6.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Common Sense to see Sixth Sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a sense that I have seen the sixth sense before, then again I have seen "The Matrix" in countless other films. It doesn't necessarily mean thats bad. The plot basically revolves around the boys discussions with the psychiatrist (Bruce Willis) and the interaction mainly between these two characters is at the heart of the movie.The film is difficult to label. It isn't a horror, although there are some scary moments, its not a thriller though at times it is quite thrilling. I would class it as a supernatural drama. Its a strangely uneven film. I really don't know where it actually goes and what it is trying to say. Is it about the effects of loss? as the child is suffering badly because of his parents divorce. I felt that the scenes involving the children in the film were excellent . The loneliness and isolation of childhood is remarkably well presented. The scene in which the children at the party lock the boy in a cupboard is very painfull to watch.The performance by the leadinbg actor and no it is not Bruce Willis but Haley Joel Osmet is sensational. He gives a wonderful , sensitve performance. He is neither cloying or "cute". I loved the scenes between the boy and his mother. Toni Collette who plays the mother is excellent in this too. The scene where she and the boy discuss her mother who is dead but has given the boy a message for his mother) is excellent. Its extremely emotional and real. In some films it can be difficult to believe in a relationship between two characters but I really felt that these were mother and son.There are major gaps in the film, not least the "twist" but overall I liked it. I also wondered why the boys parents had divorced and where was his father. Its never really explained and the boys feelings about his father are never unearted. What does the mother work as? This is never explained either. The reason I ask this is that she seems so out of place at the childrens birthday party scene compared to the other mothers.The relationship between the Willis character and his wife is never fully developed and is quite frankly uninteresting.Overall an effective " supernatural" drama with some fine performances and some scary moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Sixth Sense' presents a unique problem for the reviewer. Its most outstanding feature is a directorial subtlety which deceives the audience right up to the last five minutes and then forces a re-evaluation of the entire film. Unfortunately this subtlety, which is undoubtedly the film's strength, has to remain unexplained. Suffice to say that for many people the highlight of 'The Sixth Sense' will be its conclusion - a fact which betrays the flaws in the film.'The Sixth Sense' lacks both pace and purpose. Its basic premise is replete with possibilities but none of these are explored. Characters are poorly drawn and lack depth. Apart from the above mentioned 'twist', much of the direction is mediocre. The film contains a few obligatory shocks but fails to maintain suspense. It is a film which continually seems to be about to get going but then grinds to a halt.The resolution of the film in relation to Haley Joel Osment's character is unsatisfying and lacks a necessary catharcism. The performances of Bruce Willis and Toni Collette are lacklustre owing the deficiencies of the screenplay and the direction. Even the film's raison d'etre - the last five minutes - is telegraphed to such an extent that the discerning viewer will work out what the 'sting in the tail' is to be.Despite this, it is almost inevitable that 'The Sixth Sense' will be a highly regarded film. Like 'The Blair Witch Project' it contorts reality to such an extent that the deceived viewer is forced to admire it rather than accept the fact that it has exposed the gullibility of its audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is good stuff, but since there are already so many comments, I'll be brief:The direction is excellent - everyday buildings sprout monstrous gargoyles (I don't know if everyone spotted it, but there is a moment near the beginning where the skyscrapers in the background appear to have demonic, grinning faces); subdued or oblique lighting intensifies the air of menace; the shocks, few though they are, are impeccably timed.One should praise Tak Fujimoto and James Newton Howard for their excellent contributions.The performances are restrained, but not bland. Colette is at her finest, as usual. Haley Joel Osment is a revelation, one of the best child performances ever (note the bit in the church where, from the balcony, he talks to Willis with the weariness and sarcasm of a much-lived adult).THAT twist...well, it's reasonably unpredictable, but it's a shame it isn't really developed. In fact, the film seems to disappear into a blandness at the end which reminds you it was made in Hollywood - which is a shame, after so much good value along the way. And, as you think about the twist, you realise it's actually illogical. Oh, well, I'll say no more about it.Overall, the film will be compared to Blair Witch, though it doesn't resemble it much. What it's really like is a cross between The Shining (which is inferior) and The Innocents (which remains superior, because it is much more bitter and chilling). In fact, the appearance of the first ghost in Sixth Sense so closely resembles a moment in The Innocents, that I can't believe it's not been copied. Still, this is not really a criticism - this is fine, intelligent, thoughtful film-making, and how often does that come from a studio picture these days?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The finest of '99</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the hopeless farce that was the Blair Witch Project (which I viewed the previous week), I was hoping for a movie with a bit of style, substance and storyline. In those respects, The Sixth Sense did not disappoint.I can honestly say that this was the best film I have seen this year, at once exhilarating and eerie. This is the only film I've been to recently where the audience has actually applauded at the end - and that's pretty unusual for us "reserved Brits"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could not believe how involved this movie was, by showing an immense amount of symbols which made the whole movie. The coolest part about the Sixth Sense was the after talk with my friends and teachers. I thought that Bruce Willis played an awesome part, but no one could out-act Haley Joel Osment (the little boy). If he does not take an Oscar for his role, it would be very shocking.Getting back to the symbols, such as the red doors, handles, triangle pancakes, and his name "Crowe" has a whole meaning in itself. This is definitely a movie that will be talked about for many years.</fullReview>

It is a beautiful piece of work, so rich in subtleties and at that same time, bold and personally involving. This movie is beautifully paced, for those of us who like to be coaxed into a story.

If you enjoy being "invited" into a story rather than having it thrust at you in mind numbing picture flashes and sound effects then you will enjoy this movie.This is not really a Horror picture at all. It is a thought provoking study of characters faced with a question: Can I truly say I know all about what I am seeing? It is a wonderful journey of discovery as seen through the eyes of one small boy and one grown man, each facing the unknown.

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie and I must say it was very good. I had seen it by accident because the people at the theater carted us before we could see House on Haunted Hill, on the way out of the theater we saw saw some friends there and we decided to see The Sixth Sense because thats what they were going to see. And boy was I glad that happened, because I was so surprised to see this movie, I didnt think it would be that good at all. The entire movie was very well put together, and the ending will absolutely blow you away. I doubt you'll be able to figure it out. But some parts, leading up to the end, got dull and bland at times, and a few scenes were not as good as they could have been... but don't get me wrong, there were some times that were quite freaky. But trust me, the end makes watching the whole thing worthwhile. This is a great movie, it's ending gives you a message that you will freak you out about death. The end is completely unexpected, it wont even cross your mind until the very end of the movie. Go see it, its worth the $7.50!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally saw this movie at a Halloween showing at my college, and I enjoyed it mainly because of the company I was with and because it was a SPOOKY day and a good ghost story is always welcome...Yet I was surprised to find the film more of a psychological thriller, rather than a horror flick. I enjoyed Haley Joel Osment, Olivia Williams, and Toni Collette as well. Bruce Willis was emotionless and deadpan per usual, which is the way I like him.The film did drag in spots given the hype that the movie has received in recent months. (How long do we have to wait for Cole to confess that he "sees dead people?") Unfortunately, I'm not a big fan of screenwriters who devise the ending of movie before the action, and it is clear that it is done in this work. EVERYTHING leads up to the ending, which is interesting and surprising, but the exposition of the movie needs a little more OOMPH. Also, ten minutes after my viewing I began to think about little things that were wrong with the film and its ending, which really started to irk me.Short review? It's no Usual Suspects, but it's one of 1999's amusing little gems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was on the edge of my seat!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people have powers of perception beyond the normal range of the five senses. The movie explores this strange phenomenon. Most scenes in this film are dark and shadowy with the camera moving stealthily through doorways, stairways, cellars and attics. I was on the edge of my seat most of the time not knowing what to expect next but knowing full well that there was something threatening in the shadows. Several times I leapt in my seat which says a lot for the development of the spooky atmosphere and fine direction. At first the story is rather confusing because not everything is revealed in the beginning. It's a case of mental gymnastics as we sort out the clues concerning the various characters. Bruce Willis is great and his scenes with the young boy hold our attention as we delve into the various possibilities until finally the truth is revealed. In the opening scenes with the psychopathic intruder we experience our first shock but there are more to follow. The psychopath shouts too much thus blurring his speech which makes it difficult to comprehend his words. I enjoyed the argument with the school-teacher in the room which was once a court-house and the "locked in the attic" scene which scared everybody including the audience. To sum up:it was well acted,well directed, and sets exactly right . It has great entertainment value but like most stories about the supernatural not to be taken too seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw "The Sixth Sense", my wife left the theater in the middle of the movie (right before Cole learns the purpose of the 6th sense), because she was terrified. We had to stay up the rest of the night and watch Disney movies to take her mind off of it. I was pretty spooked as well, but, since I stayed for the resolution, the movie as a whole was a much more enjoyable experience for me than it was for my wife.I'm glad there are occasional movies like "The Sixth Sense" that avoids sex, language, and gratuitous violence/gore, yet still gives you the creeps.

		<shortDescription>Without a doubt, the best film of 1999</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In our modern times, most movies rely heavily on computer generated effects to create images that are impossible to film. I don't know about you, but I have always found computer effects to look really fake on film. You can go through a whole movie and pick out what's computer and what's not. I really hate it. But The Sixth Sense, as I recall has possibly only one computer effect and everything else is make-up. I really liked this movie, it is a little slow moving at times, I was expecting a big budget thrill ride, but I got something out of that was so much better: I found myself concentrating on the dialogue and story, rather than thrills. It takes a really interesting story and interesting characters to make a classic movie, and I feel that The Sixth Sense has both of these. It's one of those movies at the end where you think, "I really should've seen that last twist coming a mile away." I couldn't see the outcome, as the story could have gone in so many different directions. So if you haven't seen this masterpiece yet, get up and go now! You may find yourself sheding a tear or two at the end. Willis, Collette and Osment seriously need Oscars next year for their impressive work.AUSTRALIAN CLASSIFICATION:M15+ Medium Level Violence, Supernatural Themes.There are a lot of those supernatural themes in there, but violence, not really, just a little bit of blood.</fullReview>

But the only thing that saved this movie from being a total wash was Bruce Willis's great passive, restrained acting and an ending that will blindside anyone seeing the movie for the first time. I thought the pace of this movie was extremely slow and for a "horror/ghost" movie it had little shock value. I would rate this movie a 4 out of 10. (1 point for Willis and 2 points for the ending)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>?The Sixth Sense', a psychiatrists salvation, a young boys nightmare.In what would seem a twisted and even terrifying situation a seamless bond develops and will leave you wondering why such beautiful artistry and compassion is not in all of us.A psychiatrist, with a passion for his work, vows to help a young boy tormented by the unseen ghosts, restless souls of the earth, after being shot by a previous patient in his own home that showed the same symptoms. After an initial rocky start the boy and man form a deep bond and Cole (Osment) finally decides to reveal his secret to Malcolm (Willis). Nothing prepares him for the secret and nothing will prepare him for what is to come.Bruce Willis, in which may possibly be his greatest performance, gives his character a depth in which you can sympathise with, even understand what is going on in his life, in his head, as he comes to grips with the revelation of what Cole (Haley Joel Osment) exposes to him.Haley Joel Osment is incredible in this film. His character is so intense that you can feel your fingernails digging into your skin waiting for his response to the frightening life he must live. He shows you a world, which may, or may not be there, causing your heart to jump and you to shrink back waiting for the outcome of what he sees.I admit that the movie is not for all audiences and you have to be prepared for what appears on the screen, but in saying that, the movie is not terrifying like I have read in most reviews and comments. Maybe it depends on your constitution. It is more thrilling than horror.?The Sixth Sense' is not a Friday night amusement. But if you want something that lets you walk away thinking of what just flashed in front of your eyes, then it is the movie for you, but if not, stick to ?The Haunting' for cheap screams and amusement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>solid suspense film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of people who are able to see the dead has served as the foundation for any number of suspense films in the past, including the greatest horror film of all time, 1962's "Carnival of Souls." Now comes the most commercially successful of such films, "The Sixth Sense," which, although it does not begin to approach the quality of that earlier film, still emerges as a solid supernatural thriller that eschews graphic violence and gratuituous gore for understatement and thought-provoking creativity.Bruce Willis stars as a renowned child psychologist who has just been awarded a major honor by the city of Philadelphia where he works and lives. On the same night, however, a former child patient breaks into his house and shoots Willis while his terrified wife looks helplessly on. Cut to a year later as a recovered Willis pursues his latest patient - a troubled child who harbors a terrifying secret: he is, for reasons unbeknownst to anyone, able to catch fleeting glimpses of dead people, whom the little boy argues, are not aware they are dead. As Willis begins to slowly learn to believe the child, a warm relationship of mutual trust and bonding develops.It is this concentration on character rather than the more customary grue and gore that separates this film from so many other horror films of recent vintage. Also, the director manages to create and sustain an atmosphere of slightly off-kilter otherworldliness through the use of visual correlatives: the eternally grey October sky, shots of creepy statuary or gloomy buildings caught at odd angles, a lyrical use of shadows, leaves blowing forlornly along an empty, windswept street, a glancing glimpse of a graveyard as it momentarily catches a frightened child's sight as he races by on a city bus. It is these moments, taken as a tapestried whole, that give the film its cumulative suspenseful power.As to the film's widely heralded surprise twist ending, it will come as less of a revelation to those with a knowledge of such films as "Carnival of Souls," "Jacob's Ladder" and "Ghost" from which "The Sixth Sense" seems to derive much inspiration. Still, the audience does leave the film feeling that it has, at least, been in the hands of a group of filmmakers who respect its intelligence and have carefully thought out the elements of the narrative before rushing the production before the cameras. In this day and age, that is a rare treat indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that all of the actors involved did a pretty good job in this movie but I am astonished at how many people were surprised by the ending of this movie. After seeing how the other players in the film react, or don't react to Bruce willis after he is shot, it becomes obvious to anybody who is familiar with the old Twilight Zone series or the movie Carnival of Souls that he is in fact, dead. It really hurt my enjoyment of the film and I found my self wishing it would end quickly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderfully surprising gem of a movie. Bruce Willis in a very different role, I enjoy his acting anyway but this was superb. For a "horror" movie, very little special effects, gore or violence, but then it didn't need those as it held its own with the acting of all the cast (especially Cole). The twist at the end makes the movie. A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the best pictures of 1999</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no advanced warning of Sixth Sense, and was frankly unexcited with the prospect of seeing Willis in this. However, I did like him in "Death Becomes Her" and it seems that death works well for this actor.The storyline is right out of Robert Monroe, except that in this case the soul of the angel stays in the body. Instead, we are treated to Cole's visions of horror - a sight no one else is privy to. You watch with deep interest, wondering if this one can be cured - and at what cost...Watching Willis' character follow this boy (excellently portrayed by a fine young actor I hope to see more of), we see his wife stop speaking to him and how his home life is changed. We see the boy's real fear of his visions, we learn to see him not as a monster at all, but a perfectly normal little boy who just can't tell anyone - at least not yet - why he is so tormented. His "DO NOT ENTER" tent in the bedroom is a great touch - a hiding place in so many ways. Plenty to fear here.Most of my complaints about this movie evaporated upon the arrival of the credits. However, there is still one scene which, although not genitally explicit at all, still seemed extraneous. Just because little boys pee in a Sandler movie doesn't mean it is in. I just didn't want to watch that; although it did maintain focus, I would have preferred another way.It is a rare movie I recommend to my friends. This one I do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bruce Willis sure has a special sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to see this movie since I first saw the trailer. I didn't know what to expect, it could be a drama, a thriller, an action or horror movie. But I don't want to make "The Sixth Sense" fit into a film genre. I just can say it's an amazing, smart, touching movie. It'll give you some scary sequences, huge surprises and great acting from Bruce Willis and the boy who portrays Cole.The first part is a little slow. But you need to establish the characters' psychology and the way they're going to interact. Once you get through the introduction, you'll see a great development of a very simple story (you already know the basic plot from the trailer). Even if you think it'll be a predictable movie, you have to give it a try. Let it get inside you, feel Cole's fear and Malcolm's need to help this kid who thinks he's a freak.I won't say anything about the ending, only that it's an unexpected twist that gives the movie a nostalgic and emotional mood.This is not an independent movie. It had a large budget and it features my favorite Hollywood actor, Bruce Willis (if you've only seen him in the Die Hard series - it was awful - you should try "12 monkeys", "Pulp fiction", "The fifth element", "The bonfire of the vanities" and so many great movies Willis has made). It's an example of Hollywood at it's best: smart, well done, great actors, big bucks. But most of all, it's a movie with a soul.Don't miss it.</fullReview>

I don't think it was a bad film, the kid was riveting I guess but overall it was a big disappointment. I'd seen the huge American box office and heard all the hype and I really was expecting the best film of the year and it wasn't even the best film I've seen this month. (I would rate Election, An Ideal Husband, and American Pie higher than this) I figured out the twist pretty quickly and was completely detached, almost to the point of boredom. I though the flashes of dead people weren't at all scary. It was original in that it had a child as the protagonist but this idea has been explored many times before. I would only give it a 6 out of 10. I had an annoying audience in the cinema which probably didn't help but I am dumbfounded at this average film's popularity. I don't know, I loved "The Thin Red Line" and plenty of people didn't so I guess we all have different tastes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Curse or a Gift?? The Sixth Sense is a thought provoking movie that gets you thinking about the supernatural and it's powers. With an explosive start, the movie could only get better as it got deeper into the lives of the characters. At first I thought it would be scary and spooky, which it is in some minor parts, but it became more of a movie to make you think and feel deeply. Throughout the show I was entranced and felt deep concern for Cole (Haley Joel Osment). I was amazed at his strength and consideration for not worry his mother with his secret. The storyline was unusual and not something that you see often in the movie mainstream but it was enticing and well worth the price of admission. The ending left you wanting to watch it again and make more sense of parts that at first seemed eerie and strange. The acting was outstanding with proof that Bruce Willis can do serious roles and Haley Joel Osment is an amazing talent that has only recently been recognised. Australian Toni Collette was also great as the troubled boy's mother. This is definitely a movie to put at the top of your `To See' list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine movie but certainly not a great one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this is a fine movie, it is one of the most overrated by audiences in recent years. Among the film's main strengths are the stunning performance of child actor Haley Joel Osment and by the young actress who plays his mother.The script is very clever but also very, very sentimental. This is not to say that the scene near the end of the picture when the boy connects on a new level is not moving--it is. But the ending of the story of Willis's character is more effective as a stunt than as a source of honest emotion.I will say, though, that the scenes intended to be scary are really, really scary. This owes largely to Osment's performance, which draws us into complete identification with the haunted child at the movie's center. It is also a credit to the screenwriter/director, though the movie's scares are never adequately integrated with the gooey emotion at the movie's heart.I recommend THE SIXTH SENSE, but I insist that it is not the "great" movie that current popular sentiment suggests.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie saved horror for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this movie, I was absolutely amazed at how scary it really was. I didn't even want to go see it to begin with, having just seen the completely unscary The Haunting and The Blair Witch Project (which was an incredible film, but not as frightening as it was made out to be). I was losing my faith in horror; it seemed as if the last movie that was even remotely scary was 1980's The Shining, and even that was overlong and only littered lightly with shocks.But The Sixth Sense scared the hell out of me.My girlfriend and I had our eyes covered quite a few times, which I do not regret because I know it saved me at least some sleep last night, and the whole theater jumped on that first quick glimpse of one of them (see the movie and you'll know the one I mean).The ending, of course, was brilliant, even if it was a bit unrealistic (I've come up with many questions that can't be answered about the film). I won't go on about the acting, because everyone else already has, but I will mention what nobody ever notices except in Lawrence of Arabia where you can't miss it: The cinimatography was amazing. Every shot was perfect - not distracting, but noticible if you're looking for it.See this movie. I'll never say I hate Bruce Willis again.</fullReview>

That's why by the time I went to see it, I felt like I already knew the plot, and even though I didn't want to, I started guessing the ending, and sure enough, I guessed it.

Most movies today are entirely too predictable, so being totally taken unaware by the ending changed this movie from a good movie to a very good one.

The actors were great, the plot excellent, and the production and directing brilliant. I now know what they mean by a "thinking man's movie", because this one is definitely a thinking man's movie.Food for thought: How many of us are like Dr. Crowe, but don't know it, or want to admit it? I'm not talking in the mental sense, but the physical sense.I would rate this a 9.5, considering the thrill I got watching it at the theater, and the hours of thought about it I had afterwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an incredible movie! One that stays in the mind long after one has finished watching it. It deserves to be an Oscar contendor next year. Haley Joel Osment was brilliant as the troubled Cole. Bruce Willis and Toni Collette also put in excellent performances. This movie was not only chilling but also thought provoking. And the twist at the end. It's worth seeing just for that!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hearing my friends talk about this film I knew I had to see it, and I did, but I wanted to see it by myself. This was not a good idea since I was the only one in the theatre which seated about 500 people. This movie terrified me, I had to get up and move to the back row so I knew nothing was behind me. Not only does this movie leave you haunted and chilled, it leaves you with a sense of belief. The direction and the dialogue keep this film tight knit and doesn't drift off. It is simple and does not try to trick you with complex plot twists, it just scary as hell. The end of the film leaves you with a jaw dropping look on your face. All in all a very good film, I just wish I could go back in my basement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget the talk of plot twists, this is just plain great movie making that deservedly put M. Night on the map. Not really a movie about the occult, it's more what you might call a "psychological drama". Bruce Willis gives the most solid performance of his career as a child psychologist attacked by one of his charges and changed forever. Haley Joel Osment is his new charge, a child who simply can't fit in with his peers with a very different way of looking at things. Toni Collette is grand as the troubled mom trying to find a way to solve Haley's problems. They really don't make movies this good very often at all, I don't know what won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2000 but I can tell you what movie should have won. A fantastic and effective score accompanies this most exceptional movie. Highly highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yesterday, I saw this film for the second time, and as expected, I picked up on certain elements I didn't see the first time, like millions of others who have seen it more than once. Upon closer viewing, I can truly say that while "The Sixth Sense" contains some chills, it amazingly also possesses comfort - it is very life-affirming. Apparently, writer/director M. Night Shyamalan wrote from personal experience, because you can feel the love and warm emotions bubbling just below the surface.You can feel the love and warm emotions bubbling just below the surface as the film works on many different levels, one of which is to encourage more communication among different generations.It is possible this movie will collect several Oscar nominations, depending upon the quality and competition coming from future 1999 fall/winter releases. I am almost certain it will receive recognition for the performances of little Haley Joel Osment, Toni Collette, and Bruce Willis, along with the original screenplay, score, sound effects editing, makeup, cinematography, and film editing. But if not, "The Sixth Sense" has already received its recognition at the box office, since it now ranks number two domestically behind "Star Wars - The Phantom Menace." In other words, it has truly touched the hearts and challenged the minds of millions of moviegoers everywhere, and will continue to do so for many years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood Pictures presents a movie that not only brings horror to the screen but fear. I was expecting this movie to be a straight horror film; that's what it looked like in the trailers. But, The 6th Sense is more of a Horror/Thriller type movie, which makes it even better. Bruce Willis (Die Hard Trilogy, 5th Element) does a great job in this film and it is rare to see him pull off such a dramatic role like this one. I give this movie a straight 10 out of 10.

		<fullReview>At least three terrific talents have combined to produce The Sixth Sense; a film that captures new cinematic ground, at least in the modern era of film. It occupies something of the same surprising, innovative territory The Usual Suspects challenged a few years ago. The Sixth Sense tells the story of an eight year old Philadelphia boy (Haley Joel Osment) who believes he can see dead people. A child psychologist called Malcom Crowe (Bruce Willis) takes the case hoping that he can help the boy. It's a shame that the publicity for the film betrays the boy's secret before we see the film. We aren't told in the film until half way through what is bothering this young fellow. But this would be just about the only criticism I can level at a movie that is a triumph in so many ways, at least for a film from the Hollywood big league. And the three talents? Well writer/director N. Night Shyamalan has created an entrancing film which is spooky in the pre-special effects fashion. The Sixth Sense doesn't rely on digital monsters but on much subtler techniques. The half glance, the fleeting shadow and at a push the sudden loud noise are layered upon a cleverly worked script and some very effective, sometimes clever camera technique. Shyamalan (pronounced SHA-mah-lahn and I gather called Night by his mates) is a 29 year old American of Indian extraction who has been entranced with film since his early years. He had produced 45 short films by the age of 16! The Sixth Sense is his third feature film following Praying With Anger in which he also starred, and then Wide Awake in 1997.  The Sixth Sense will definitely catapult Shyamalan into the top category of directors. Then for our second on the list there's Haley Joel Osment who in spite of being only 10 years old gives a superb, knowing performance. This is no first flash in the pan effort from Osment. He has been in films and on stage for five years. He was the young Forrest Gump and also played Avery Brown on Murphy Brown. He had a plum role on Ally McBeal for which he was nominated for an Emmy Award. The third talent would have to be that superb actor Bruce Willis. He again shows that his talents extend far beyond lunging around gun in hand. He years ago played the lead in Sam Shepard's play Fool For Love which ran for five years off Broadway. Consider his almost unrecognisable performance in Die For You and his perplexed cop in The Fifth Element before you write Willis off as some idiot action star. Anyway he was great in Die Hard. And Australia's Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding, Lillian's Story, The Pallbearer) nearly made the list for her touching performance as the young boy's mother. The Sixth Sense somehow avoids the mawkishness of the awful Ghost and is miles ahead of The Haunting, the other ghostly film on show now. The essential trick upon which the film is based remained hidden for me, as it will I think for nearly everyone. It isn't horrifying but is a bit spooky and thought provoking. It's fine entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disturbing, emotional, and all together fantastic. This is certainly one of the best films of 1999, a sleeper that roared at the box office.I don't think I've ever seen a more difficult child's role tackled with incredible talent than that of Cole played by Haley Joel Osment. This kid deserves an Oscar. The movie as a whole should qualify in several other Oscar categories including best director, original screenplay, cinematography, and -- dare I say it -- best picture? I can't think of many other films this year that should qualify for best picture category.I won't bother giving a run-down summary of the film as so many others have done that here, but instead say that this film is all the evidence one needs that the horror genre really deserves to be "rescued from the kiddies" (i.e. the 14-24 year old male demographic) with its reliance on cheap tricks, over-the-top effects, senseless violence and gore, and liberal use of mocking or brainless humor. Hopefully Hollywood will pick up the clue-phone. It's been ringing a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looking at this film in an objective manner, there is really nothing in it that would class it as a very good film. Bruce Willis is still the same 'smirking' Bruce Willis, whatever comes out of his mouth. All it has to offer are some atmospheric and sometimes disturbing images with a final twist to the story.But the film is entertaining and quite disturbing. Maybe I have too much of an imagination for my own good. I came out of the cinema thinking that I should see it again from the perspective of knowing the whole story. This might have been interesting, but it may have amplified the glaring holes in the film. Nevertheless, it made me think about the film and try to understand the character that Willis played. This could have been an even better film with emphasis on the relationship between the characters, especially Willis' character and his wife. If you have a spare afternoon, go see it but don't expect too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of the thousands of movies I have seen, this is probably the most nerve-racking, mind-blowing, excellent movie I have ever seen. Its soundtrack does a lot of this, since the music is discreetly put in the back ground, with a Jaws-like feel, peeking at the most suspenseful times. However, as it is in some movies, it doesn't do it all. The very feel of the movie is dark, with everything leading up to everything else. Plot twists are numerous, and you are always guessing what is going on, BUT YOU RARELY GET IT RIGHT! Another plus is the use of the camera and camera angles, in which you know afterwards that every camera shot and every angle it is shot from is thought out completely. And the movie uses discreet details to give it a very eerie feel. I can't tell you specific examples of this movie, since saying very little is very likely to give away too much. So you're just going to have to see it yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stunning and wonderful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been more than six weeks since I have seen this movie. In that time I have seen five or six movies in theaters, and that many or more on video.This had far more impact on me than any of them (including American Beauty) - that's how good, unusual, and resonant it is.This is not just another horror movie, or just a horror movie with a twist. What it amounts to is a journey that the viewer doesn't know he is taking. Most horror films leave you at the end with a feeling of dread, relief, or remembered shock, but this is the first horror movie that filled me with joy at the end - and that's the most amazing thing about it. The other amazing thing is the sheer intelligence of this script throughout.I'm not as impressed as some with Willis's acting - I thought it was serviceable and filled the bill. It was, however, great casting, because having him in there made the viewer start to expect a real "Night of the Living Dead" gorefest climax - Bruce against the zombies! Light the torches! - concealing the true nature of this movie until the end. But Osmont's acting - and the way he was directed - had me completely sympathizing with him; both his fright and bewilderment, and his later courage in being able to talk to the unwelcome visitor in the playhouse, were entirely convincing and moving.I will see this movie again; I don't think it's making too much of it to say that it's got enough ambiguities and layers of meanings to justify repeated viewings. I don't think that it will get the Oscar for Best Picture of the year; it may not even be nominated, and I'm not certain that it will deserve it. It's clearly not an Oscar-oriented picture, in that it doesn't have the Big Gesture, the Good Costumes, the Big Sinking Boat, the Grand Theme, the Anthony Hopkins appearance, and not a strand of classical music in sight or sound. But seeing it was one of the most moving moviegoing experiences I have had in a long time, and I hope that at least the script and Osmont get Oscars. And where was Haley earlier this summer when we needed him on Tatooine?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe the Sixth Sense was researched thoroughly as I have heard demonologists speak on the subject of the paranormal: and much of what these clairvoyants had to say was incorporated into the movie. It was very unsettling indeed.The acting job by Bruce Willis was probably the best of his career. He is so believable and he's not even hanging from an elevator shaft or racing in a cab through Central Park. He's just acting, and he's great in this film. As for Osment, well he deserves the Oscar. If he doesn't get it, then the academy is even more blind than I thought. (I.E. Shakespeare in Love beating Private Ryan-get bent!) Quite simply these actors make the characters frighteningly believable.And that's just for starters. For the first time in years this was a movie with an actual story. I know, unreal idea in today's big Hollywood, with their awful big money concepts. It just proves, give the public a story rather than Godzilla, and they'll go see it. There's no reliance on special effects made on some turbo-geek's CGI machine to drive the film. Shyamalan has written an amazing script with twists and turns that will leave you with goosebumps for the full two hours. He also did an incredible job directing the film, with filters, and angles that will make you quite nervous, as if you're with the boy and Willis throughout the terrifying twists.As for the ending, go see the movie and you will be blown away. It's right up there with The Usual Suspects as far as surprises go. And bring a warm jacket to the theater because you will have the chills as each plot twist hits you.Simply put this is by far the best movie I've seen all year. It'll make you ponder the paranormal, even if you don't want to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, let me say that I really enjoyed this movie. It was a great way to pass a couple of hours with friends. I just didn't find it, the ending especially, to be the great mystery that many people did. A friend and I figured out the final plot twist 15 minutes into the movie. As the action continued, we found a great deal of evidence to support our theory. And at the end, we were proven correct. In reality, I wish that I had been as surprised as most people were. It would have made a good movie experience all the more better. It was rather amusing to look at the faces and hear the conversations of those around us as the movie was letting out. The disbelief and shock that was evident did help compensate for the fact that we weren't equally as surprised. This is not to take anything away from the performance of Haley Joel Osment. He's a very gifted young actor, and his portrayal of Cole Sear gave me serious chills. Toni Collette as his mother was also excellent. The rest of the actors gave strong, if not spectacular, performances. All in all, this movie lived up to its reputation as a pleaser, if not all the hype surrounding it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being the ignorant teenager that I am, I needed to have my mother explain the ending to me, as it went too fast for me to grasp just what was happening. After that, though, it made perfect sense and was a fitting conclusion to a pretty good film. In my opinion, it really wasn't as jaw-dropping, shocking, and/or haunting as other people say, but that's just my opinion. I didn't see it coming, but I wasn't looking for it. I still wasn't shocked, though, because it made sense, etc.As for the rest of the movie, I thought it was pretty good. It could very easily have been done as a cheap, gory horror flick, but in the hands of the director (I forgot his name), it actually exhibits a great deal of intelligence and a nice mix of the supernatural and religion. Yes, Haley Joel Osmont is very good in a role that requires a good deal more maturity than most kids' roles today. He has many of the frightening moments, and they're all frightening in his hands. But he also is effective as the frightened little boy who has a very simple desire we all can relate to: not to be called a freak. Bruce Willis was just okay, but Toni Collette, who plays Osmont's mother, did a good job, as well. The story as it is presented is very chilling, if not very scary. There are quite a few frightening bumps along the way, but none that are truly nightmare-inducing. That's probably because this movie is well above the rest of its genre (Maybe not The Blair Witch Project, but I haven't seen that one.) and fits more into the drama area of movies. Anyway, well-directed, -acted, and -written (except for some stupid parts), and I do recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Sixth Sense" doesn't really make "sense" to me. After listening to all the hype and seeing the massive money it's raking in, I thought it would be a memorable and effective movie. Well, it didn't really turn out that way for me, I can safely say that it was a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it's fairly good, but it doesn't quite deliver all the goods like it seems to. I think the main thing that keeps this film's quality from declining are it's performances and it's rich sense of poignancy. Terror doesn't seem to strike very largely or often, with the exception of it's eerie atmosphere and one "jump scene", frights are practically absent. The child (forgot his name) delivers an excellent performance as the tortured boy who sees dead people, he breathes life into what could of been an annoying, one-dimensional character. I thought Bruce Willis was going to be mediocre, considering that this is his first "serious" role, but he was surprisingly convincing as the boy's counsellor. Toni Collette's character was sketchy, but the complicated relationship between her and her son really affected me, it was actually quite moving, especially towards the end. The movie's main flaw is it's sluggish pace and occasionally wooden script, there were some parts that just didn't persuade me, like there was zero power. To be honest, the whole ghost aspect of the film's story was quite weak, it seemed to be more of a backdrop than a plot, but it did quickly get better when it reached the shocking conclusion. All in all, "The Sixth Sense" is a good movie in some ways and a fair one in others, overall, it's really the performances that keeps this film worthwhile and interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A clever, scary but intelligent film with one almighty twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about a young boy's ability to see ghosts, or dead people, walking around like everybody else. But instead of gruesome scenes with plenty of blood and gore, the film takes a more intelligent, dark, yet riveting path. It combines elements of several genres, including horror, but also drama and thriller.The plot focuses on the relationship between child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and Cole (Hayley Joel Osment), the young boy. Having apparently failed a similar young boy years before, Malcolm is determined to rectify his previous failure, and in doing so, redeem himself. This is especially so after the boy he failed, now a man, broke into his house, shooting Malcolm before turning the gun on himself.The acting was top notch, particularly Willis, Osment and Collette (Cole's mother), and on a couple of occasions I was truly scared, having no idea what was going to happen. Few films today (The Blair Witch Project is perhaps the exception) are able to truly scare an audience, but this certainly is one.What makes this film really good however, is the twist at the end. If you haven't watched the film, now is a good time to stop reading, otherwise, keep going.Anyway, to find out that Malcolm had been dead all along when he was originally shot (and he didn't even know it) was very clever, and during the film you don't have a clue. But when that realisation comes, it suddenly clicks. "Sometimes they don't even know they're dead", Cole once said. Very apt.All in all, a very good film that'll make you scared at times, but is very cleverly crafted, and makes you think. It's nice to see Willis portray a more serious and complex character; certainly a pleasant change.</fullReview>

So, I've watched its progress at the US Box Office over the net, and I've read the poor reviews as well. So, I can't explain why it did so well ($220+ million) at the Box Office because it isn't really a mainstream cinema-goers movie. On the other hand, I thought the critics would love it, but they definitely did not embrace it. So, the IMDB voters poll is, in my opinion the only true poll for this movie at 8.8 avg.

		<fullReview>Before I make any comments on the quality of this film, I must first ask, nay plead, that those of you who know the secret not tell anyone who hasn't yet seen it. Guard your comments when talking to those in the know, because you never know who might just be passing by that you spoil it for. I know how much it hurts, for the secrets to both 'The Crying Game' and 'The Usual Suspects' were given away to me by so-called friends.That out of the way, I must say that 'The Sixth Sense' is as almost perfect film. Bruce Willis acts masterfully in a role that one at first might think him mis-cast for and Haley Joel Osment puts in a performance far superior to much of the adult acting I have seen in recent years. It has been a long time since a child has been called to play such a difficult role, and I can't control my dismay that he was not cast as Anakin Skywalker in the newest Star Wars episode. Of course, Jake Lloyd might have done just as well under the awesome skill of writer/director M. Night Shymalan. The story is meticulously crafted, and the ending is a true mind-blower. I hope this movie is not looked over come Oscar time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A big studio, big star film that has the look and feel of a highly personal, independent production. This is one of the finest examples of cinema storytelling that I have ever seen. All aspects: screenplay; direction; acting; photography; editing; art &amp; design; and musical score are superb. Every person connected with this production should feel exceptionally proud, especially the director and screenwriter, M. Night Shyamalan, whose talent is the strong common thread weaving all the aforementioned ingredients together. "The Sixth Sense," in my opinion, is one of the finest films of this decade and is destined to become a classic of its genre. Mr. Shyamalan has raised the humble ghost story to the level of art, and he has done it in such a way that his film puts many so-called reality-based motion pictures to shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true horror story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a time when horror films are steriotypically seen as gratuitous displays of gore and of monsters who repeatedly mutilate "innocent" characters for no reason what-so-ever, The Sixth Sense decides to break the mold and return to the "good old days" of the horror genre.This movie doesn't use gore or overused violence to play on the audiance's fear...instead it goes back to way horror films were done in the old days. The days when Hitchkock was the master of horror. This movie, beside the ghost who are depicted with their death wounds, is at heart one big mind game. This movie is very very believable...which adds to the suspense that is already present. This movie, unlike other horror movies, doesn't treat the audiance as mindless movie goers who are only interested in violence and blood; instead, it treats you as intelligent person and often makes you think about what is going on. The acting was superb, the music well done (although at some points it did harken to the current horror style of increase intensity of music means something is about to happen), an excelent story, and of course the best ending ever to be shone on the silver screen. The ending comes at you out of nowhere and you find yourself with your mouth dropping to the floor.If you see the movie don't tell anyone who hasn't see it how the movie ends. Trust me. Hitchkock had the right idea about telling people not to tell others about the ending of Psycho but when people started to tell others...the "magic" so to speak died from the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After being disappointed by the overhyped "Blair Witch Project", I went in to watch this movie with very low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised. Bruce Willis turns in a fine performance as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, an acclaimed child psychologist. When the movie begins, Crowe and his wife Anna (played by Olivia Williams) are celebrating Malcolm being given a citation by the mayor, when unexpectedly, one of his former patients breaks into the apartment, shoots him, and then turns the gun on himself.About a year later, Crowe seems to have recovered from the injury, atleast in body. His personal life isn't going well: he and his wife rarely speak to each other, and she appears to be on the verge of having an affair with a co-worker. What keeps him going is that professionally, he has a new challenge, in the form of a troubled boy: Cole Sear (played by Haley Osment.) Cole belives that he can see and communicate with the dead, and although he doesn't let anyone in on his secret, his strange behavior at school results in his being labeled a freak. Crowe sees in Cole a way to make amends for his failiure with his former patient. Can he help Cole get rid of his hallucinations, if indeed that is what they are? Of if they aren't, can he help Cole live with his visions? And what do the dead people want from him anyway?Much has made of the movie's final twist. If you go in knowing there's one, it isn't too difficult to figure out what it is ahead of time. The movie should be given credit for not cheating its viewers: the final conclusion appears to consistent with the facts provided earlier. M. Night Shyamalan does a good job of direction. He does however, revert to the old horror movie trick of having his ghosts pop in from outside the screen, but the plot is sufficiently interesting, and the performances sufficiently good that he can be forgiven for using it.In my opinion, the only weak link in this movie is Olivia Williams. In the first scene with Bruce Willis, she reads her lines with very little emotion: it is almost as if she's giving a speech. I'm told she is a good actress, so part of the reason for the poor performance could be that she isn't given a substantial role. In all, I found "The Sixth Sense" to be a good movie, well worth my time and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was ok. I really think it wasn't as good as people said but it's still a cool movie. It's more of a psychological horror movie. It will scare you but it doesn't have a lot of action. I also noticed that many scenes in the trailer are not in the finished movie. All the scenes deleted looked a little actionful. Why did they leave them out? Anyway, the plot was really cool and the script was good. The acting was great. Bruce Willis was great as usual. Haley Joel Osment was a surprise. He didn't look like a good actor but he was pretty good. The plot has to deal with a child who can see dead people but they don't realize that they are dead. I did like it and will buy it on DVD but I don't understand why people think it's the best movie of the year. It was cool but not that cool. Now for the surprise ending. I already knew it because I was stupid and asked a friend what happens. If you don't know than it will be a bit of a surprise. I actually thought it was sad. It's like a little of The Exorcist and Ghost but must people will like it. I did but I didn't think it was better than Bruce's best movie, Armageddon. The Sixth Sense: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is really a work of art. It's one of the most captivating and well-made movies I've ever seen. It's chilling, but it's touching, and of course the ending is brilliant. I left the theater stunned, and I don't know how anyone could find this movie boring. Apparently some people need mile-a-minute comedy or nothing...Bruce Willis is pretty darn good, but he's wallpaper compared to the powerful performance of Haley Joel Osment. Osment should have top billing, not to mention an Oscar for Best Actor. As a young person, I think it's about time a kid gets the recognition they deserve by being cast in a real role. And it's always good when a movie recognizes the supernatural as a very real part of life. So my admiration to the Sixth Sense for really delivering what a lot of movies are afraid to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that manages to transcend the sum of its parts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sixth Sense" has at least three flawed areas that interfered with my enjoyment of what could have been a real gripper. Number one (and I am not being humorous)was the silly and so very obvious hair piece perched atop Bruce Willis's bald cranium. At first I found it quite distracting, with my focus continuously wandering up to that area. I was mostly able to work through this as the film progressed, but was never able to completely avoid its niggling presence. Secondly, the bizarre and phantasmagoric plot required just a little too much suspension of what is left of my intellect to be entirely persuasive in a film so deadly serious in its portent. I also found the effects makeup of the dead people very unconvincing and rather poorly done. Finally, Bruce Willis is, in my opinion, not a very good actor. Competent, yes, particularly when involved in one of his action/adventure vehicles where charisma and presence are required more than acting excellence. I do realize, however, that the constraints of the script and the grim mood of this film did require a rather somber and wooden approach to the portrayal of his character. Happily, all of this is forgotten with the superb performance of young master Osment playing the part of the boy, Cole, along with an excellent and convincing job by Toni Collette as his mother. The very last scenes of the movie were obviously designed to shamelessly extract all possible moisture from one's tear ducts, including mine, but upon leaving the theater, I was able to apply my most useful and stringent criterion for judging a film: how long did it stay with me? An hour, 5 hours, the next day? All of the above. "The Sixth Sense" is a very good film which manages to transcend the goofiness of the plot by means of good direction, fine camera work and some excellent and intense acting--and, of course, the surprises at the end.</fullReview>

Bruce Willis surprised me with a fantastic performance, and I don't generally like him in much (12 Monkeys is the only one I can think of...).

		<fullReview>Before seeing the Sixth Sense I had heard all the reviews and heard about a shocking twist ending. After seeing it I have to say this is the best movie I've seen in a while. The ending isn't quite as shocking as it's been made out to be but does lift the film up to make it pretty creative. Willis, Osment, Collette, Williams and an unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg all turn in fine performances. Even though it's not scary, the Sixth Sense contains enough suspense for a few shocks and is safe enough for an entire family to watch. For a change, a movie that does live up to the hype.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who knew Bruce Willis could act? I had 0 interest in seeing this film, and it is now right up there with Contact as one of my all-time favorites. I can't understand why this movie gets compared with Blair Witch all the time. For one, I wouldn't classify it as horror. What it really is is a supernatural thriller that touches upon drama and endearing comic moments, all-the-while employing all that is wonderful and good about film making to create a touching and memorable movie, whereas Blair Witch is nothing than an over-rated novelty.The filming, the acting, the script - everything is virtually flawless here. While it does have a startling plot twist, the strong story and well-developed characters prevent this from becoming just another gimmick-flick. And Haley isn't just good for a little boy - he's just plain GOOD. You don't often find that much charisma in someone so young. To me, this movie is the perfect blend of art an entertainment. It's also another one of the few films to actually make me cry - three times no less.We can only hope that Bruce Willis will keep up the good work. I have my fingers crossed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay. I have to give the film the fact that the main actors in Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment give great performances. And the first time I saw the movie, I liked it a lot. However, upon second viewing, I have to say that it bored me. The movie creeps along slowly, there is not much of a plot, and the scares are not really effective but just to make the viewer jump. Of course the ending loses a lot of its impact on the viewer, so that lowered my opinion a lot. It is a well-crafted movie, but the film drags way too much. The ending should not influence the opinions of people about the movie as a whole, which does not contain much substance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No doubt about it, "The Sixth Sense" is the best horror movie I've seen since the original "Poltergeist." The plot is deceptively simple -- a kid who sees ghosts -- but the movie goes so much deeper than that. It's an allegory for all our nameless fears that we have to fight alone because nobody else shares them.Besides the plot, multiple other elements come into play in making "The Sixth Sense" the sensation that it is. The acting is superb on all ends. Haley Joel Osment plays Cole with an impressively haunted maturity, and Bruce Willis stays out of his way. And for such relatively small parts, the ghosts give off near-visible auras of otherworldly anger and fear.The other main element in the psychological terror behind the movie is how it attempts to instill fear in the audience. Transcending flashing lights and computer-generated wraiths, "The Sixth Sense" goes instead for suggestions of cold and some sharp makeup effects. And not to be forgotten is the score, which chilled me deeper than most of the visual elements.One thing that everyone wants to talk about is the ending. While I won't reveal it here, suffice it to say that I had made dozens of guesses about what the surprise twist could be, and I could not have been more wrong. It completely knocked me off my feet. In short, "The Sixth Sense" is a must-see for anyone who likes a well-thought-out thriller. If it doesn't leave you stricken, impressed, and a little scared the next time you're alone in the dark, you may already have crossed over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cole is a very disturbed kid, prone to swearing at teachers,writing obscenities and hiding out in churches. Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a child psychologist, tortured by guilt after the suicide of a previous patient. His depression is threatening his relationship with his wife, but he sees in Cole a chance for redemption. But Cole's problem may not be psychological. The boy claims to be plagued by visions of the dead... So Bruce strips down to his vest, takes out an Uzi, and BLOWS THOSE GHOSTS AWAY!!!!!  Actually, I made that up, because this isn't your typical Bruce film, but it is a very good one. Bruce does very well in it, as the shrink tormented by ghosts of his own. His performance is reminiscent of Jimmy Stewart in Vertigo and the film as a whole has a similar dreamlike feel to it. The film covers similar ground thematically too - the corruption of the past by the present, the hold the dead have on the living. Both Bruce and the boy are in the grip of the past and this is evoked by haunting images of Philadelphia hanging malevolently over them both. The other performances are very fine too. The young boy conveys his terror and incomprehension very well and Toni Collette ("You're TERRIBLE Muriel!") is convincing as the fraught mother, trying to save her son from something she can't even comprehend. The film has a washed-out, dead look to it, similar to The Exorcist and the film probes similar anxieties (the mother's impotence to protect her child from abuse). But this is a much more compassionate film than The Exorcist and stays away from in-your-face horror, inducing instead a low-key feeling of tension and unease. It's beautifully shot, well acted, cleverly written and rather creepy.

		<shortDescription>Outstanding, well-written and directed thriller. The ending not as surprising as you've heard.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an extremely well-written, and even better-directed thriller. M. Night Shyamalan never deviates from the feelings he evokes in the first few scenes. He is interested in mood and perspective.Haley Joel Osment is captivating. He utterly ignites the screen. He manages to portray this part in a much more complex and subtle way than you'd expect from someone his age.Toni Collette brings the right blend of motherly love, frustration and heeby-jeebies to the table.This is one of the best performances Bruce Willis has ever turned in. He proves he can hold your attention without snappy one-liners.Donnie Wahlberg looks like his music makes me feel.The only thing that disappointed me with this film is the ending. Don't get me wrong -- it's great. But I had heard so much about it being the best ending in the history of civilization or something, and to be honest I thought it was a little obvious. I thought I knew it after 10 minutes, and I KNEW I knew it after 20. The Blair Witch Project was much more shocking in its ending.Still, a first-rate film.Much better than the Shining, which I thought it would try to rip off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...a great film that delivers in both fright and enjoyment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent movie. It is full of moments that are genuinely frightening, and the overall mood is best described as "creepy". The plot begins slowly (a little too slowly?) but eventually develops into an ending that leaves you breathless.I've seen the film twice now, and can vouch that it takes more than ending to create a great film. The Sixth Sense succeeds. Moments are scary, or emotional, or just plain powerful. If you're a true "movie-goer" and immerse yourself into this film (which is easily done given the great score and excellent directing) then you should find yourself shuddering more than once.The acting is exceptional, Bruce Willis - taking into account his recent jobs - is surprisingly good. The boy and his mother are believable, and the character interaction is very nice. The film quality is dark and granular, giving you a strong sense of realism - like watching a documentary. Just like "Saving Private Ryan", great steps were taken to build scenes using mood and emotion.The ending does much more than complete this great film. You will find yourself pleasantly surprised and in many cases your draw will land in your popcorn. Once you figure this out, you'll be thinking about it all the way to your car. All in all, a great film that delivers in both fright and enjoyment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am glad this movie got such high marks, but from the comments this mostly relates to the acting and the ending. This, plus the music and cinematography are outstanding but that is not what really made it with me.I never see junky horror films and that is what I thought this was until some of my metaphysical friends clued me in that it was a great movie. Metaphysics is the belief in things unseen including the entire premise of this movie.I am a licensed practitioner of metaphysics and this absolutely beautiful movie is a primer on beliefs held by many in the metaphysical community, which not coincidentally is centered in California, with Arizona and Florida following.The entire movie is a wonderful example of how the Creator ultimately weaves everything together in the right and perfect fashion. Every piece fits like a glove in the tapestry of eternal, unending life.If you liked Powder, Phenomenon, Defending Your Life, Ghost, or any of a host of films like that, don't miss this one!While it sure is not "horror", Sixth Sense could be described by many as "fantasy". For me, it is a picture of a very real possibility. The underlying concept of people floating around trying to work out unresolved issues before "moving on" may be scary to some and probably way beyond the realm of possibility for most. In any case, this movie does a superb job of painting a tapestry that most metaphysicians would quickly recognize and love.</fullReview>

I've been reading some reviews here from people who say this wasn't a very good horror movie, well it wasn't suppose to be a horror movie, it's a psychological thriller. Hollywood has apparently infiltrated the minds of these people to make them beileve that blood and gore and big buget specail effects are what make a good movie. People don't seem to like anything that is going to make them think because their minds are so vacuous that they sit there in the theater and wait for it to be filled by Hollywood drivel.

		<shortDescription>In the spirit of the Independents...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have nothing but praise for this incredible smashing psychological thriller with a stunning performance by Haley Joel Osment, a revelatory acting turn by Toni Collete (far from the musings of Muriel's Wedding), and a subtle, subdued performance by Bruce Willis. Yes...the final twist is jaw-dropping and I absolutely did not see it coming. And I don't know about other viewers but I was absolutely scared out of mind; I found it very clever that M. Night Shyamalan managed to work the physical sensations of being scared (cold skin, raised hairs, goose bumps) into the script, i.e. that's how you know the ghosts are around you.But many readers keep referring to this as a Bruce Willis movie ("It's different for him", "I expected it to be another Bruce film"), but it's not. In fact, replace Willis with another unknown actor and what you get is...AN INDEPENDENT FILM. This is not a big studio thriller (a la the Haunting); it is very much an independent film in its careful plotting, its pacing, and its ambitious ideas. I love that this film has captured America's attention as it is a reason why independent film and independent filmmakers are forces to reckon with and pay attention to. My hat is off to M. Night Shyamalan for giving us a scary, highly emotional, involving and unforgettable film. I for one would like to see Mr. Shyamalan's other works, all of which are...gasp! Independent films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even better days after seeing it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My husband and I went to see "The Sixth Sense" last week after hearing terrific reviews from family and friends.Nearly a week later, I still can't get the movie off my mind. DO NOT let anyone give away too many details and ruin the movie for you. But let me just say you'll think about it for days...Fans of cheap horror flicks expecting a grisly, gruesome scare-fest will no doubt be disappointed. But those who enjoy a good psychological thriller with an unusual abundance of intelligent dialogue will be glad they saw it. This movie is really mischaracterized as a horror film, which in my book is a major disservice. No hackers, slashers or cheap camera tricks here. It's a well-acted, well-written and well-directed suspense drama that really delivers.I've been a fan of Bruce Willis since his "Moonlighting" days. Even the most cynical critics who pigeon-hole him as just another action star will be forced to sit up and take notice of his acting in this one. And the little boy puts in a truly poignant and subtle performance for his young age. Handled by a less-adept child actor, his character easily could have been played way over the top and the movie would have been ruined.For those of you who are hesitant to see "The Sixth Sense" because it's marketed as a horror movie, don't let that stop you. This is a movie that merits seeing not once, but twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sharp, Haunting Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sixth Sense" was a sharp, haunting thriller that was almost painful to watch. The main thing that distracted me from this movie was a constant feeling of pity for the main character in the story, a little boy. Not only was the kid living in constant terror, but nobody believed him, and it looked like he would be locked up in a mental ward. Focusing on the constant pain the boy was in was to me a major distraction, causing me to lose track of a lot of subtle details I otherwise would have noticed. I didn't find the movie terribly entertaining. However, like most others, I was *COMPLETELY* blindsided by the surprise ending - I didn't see it coming at all, and when it comes it's a real shock. The audience in the theater I saw the movie in let out a loud, collective gasp of exhaustion and fascination when the end credits started to roll, as if they had been holding their breath for two hours. This is a movie I would like to see again, now that I know how it ends. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better films this summer, but certainly not the best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to repeat in detail what hundreds of people have written already -- The movie is good, and a must-see. The acting is fantastic, and yes.. even Bruce Willis is actually acceptable without ever firing a gun. I do have to respond to the many comments that have pointed out that the setup is slow.(As one comment stated.. "The beginning was ONLY character development.")I personally am of the opinion that they made a mistake in the marketing of the film. I don't believe that Cole's "gift" should have been publicized. The film would have been much better if it hadn't been, but to be fair, it would have been difficult to sell it any other way.If we lived in a perfect world and Access Hollywood, Entertainment Tonight and E! didn't exist, imagine how bizarre this film would have been, with the viewer not exactly knowing what was going on until Cole's confession. So to those with their holier-than-thou critiques of this film, saying that it doesn't try to go beyond the typical boundaries of Hollywood filmmaking, I say that you're wrong. This is a psychological drama that is also a horror film, not the other way around. There are very few films that can even claim to do the same. What lessened the impact of this film WAS Hollywood with its (unfortunately necessary) marketing.Don't expect a masterpiece, but definitely understand that this movie is a cut far above the typical schlock of the horror genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, maybe that shouldn't be my one-line summary. I did walk out of the theater dazed, having laughed, cried, and screamed, and feeling a similar kind of shock-filled awe that I hadn't felt since the first time I saw.... Usual Suspects. Wait a second, Usual Suspects. The similarities are a little TOO striking. Is this thing ripping off my movie? I don't mind that so much--it's what works. Since that type of thing hasn't really been what you could call "overused," I'm okay with it. What I'm NOT okay with, though, is this movie scoring higher than Usual Suspects, because on originality alone it did not. Think about it, would you have given the movie such a high rating if it had ended differently? And you can only give so much credit to an idea that so obviously has been recycled. But enough diatribe on that. Beyond that, the movies bear hardly any resemblance to each other. "Sixth Sense" is much more of an emotionally touching film ("Usual Suspects" neither is nor tries to be emotional). And in spite of my bitterness, I did like the movie a whole lot. A WHOLE lot more than I expected to--the preview made it look even worse than Bruce's last "child-helping" film (something about a computer virus, right?) I don't think Bruce has been this good with a kid since "North." Anyway, the kid completely shone. I can't wait to see more of him in the future, he's amazing. And.. back to the summary line... THAT was Donnie Wahlberg?! Are you KIDDING me?! Donnie the "New Kid?" What?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie definitely deserved a 10. Somehow, it managed to be terrifying and surprisingly sweet at the same time. And it's not like some movies, where you feel like they're "constructed" rather than written because they pull at your emotions so much; this movie just managed to fit everything together perfectly. There was even some humor, although it did little to ease the tension.Kudos to the actors in the film... I have to admit, I'd never considered Bruce Willis much of a dramatist before I saw this one. And, while I'm usually skeptical of movies that have small children in them (I'm always afraid they're just in for "cute" value), Haley Joel Osment was actually very, very good. One performance that I'm sure will be overlooked is Cole's mother, played by Toni Collette. I was very impressed by the realism she gave her role.The only thing that I didn't understand about the movie was the "surprise" ending. I figured it out a good 15 minutes into the movie, and was sort of amazed at all the people going "what?" and "oh my gosh" when they revealed it; I kept expecting some other secret to pop up. That might be why I respected this film so much, though--even though I knew the secret, it still kept me on the edge of my seat the whole way through. In fact, it's very hard to type this without my fingernails. :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bruce Willis' BEST Acting Endeavor on Film . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . and Haley Joel Osment is a wonder. If both of these actors are not nominated for Academy Awards (and BOTH in the Best Actor category) then Hollywood is indeed a screwed up town. Willis' portrayal as the tormented child psychologist Malcolm Crowe is sensitive and compassionate, a beautifully realized, complete performance. And Osment's performance as the disturbed child Cole who has "the sixth sense" is astonishing--in my opinion, it's the best performance by a child actor in film since Patty Duke in "The Miracle Worker". The wonderful relationship that evolves between Malcolm and Cole is worth the price of admission alone. Also kudos to Toni Collette as Cole's ever-loving, always supportive Mom; to Olivia Williams as Malcolm's wife (in hindsight, one realizes that Williams pulls off an incredibly difficult technical piece of acting), and Donnie Wahlberg as Vincent, the anguished, tortured young man whom Malcolm could not save. I've seen the film twice now--blown away by it the first time, enjoying how well-crafted it is on the second round. The evil-spirited side of me was also looking for some hole, SOMEWHERE, in the film when I saw it again, but if a hole exists, I can't find it. Brilliant, disturbing, evoking laughter, tears, chills, and a great deal of thought, this is great film making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went to see The Sixth Sense on Saturday night with a friend of mine. Didn't expect the movie to be that great. Just thought that it was about time I needed to check out some horrors, been watching lots of action movies lately... just need some changes in my life.And yes, the movie was really scary. The soundtrack was superb. It was kind of slow at the beginning. I mean, I already saw the trailer and I didn't need this long introduction anymore. I wanted to see some real scary stuff.Then came the scary stuff. And I loved it. The soundtrack, as I said, really had a good timing. I was really kept at the edge of my seat. And the theatre was really cold, which really gave me a chill. You'll know what I mean when you see the movie. And all of the sudden, there came the ending, and man....I was speechlessI walked out of the theatre confused. I was not sure what I just saw. But one thing I knew was that it was the best movie I've ever seen this year. I didn't see it coming. I never thought the movie would be this great.And I am going back to watch this movie again tonight to collect some details I might have been missing last time.If you love the movie like "Jacob's Ladder", this is a must. Believe me, it's worth your time and money. You will not be disappointed.It really gives me a chill everytime I thought about what went on in the movie. And I've been sleeping with my lights on for the past two nights already.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a Bruce Willis fan, so I had decided not to see this movie when the previews first came out. But 6 weeks at #1 and all the buzz finally made me cave in. I'm glad I did.The biggest complaint I hear about this movie is that it starts too slow. I think the slow build up is necessary for the story, and thought every scene was necessary for the full effect. It's interesting to point out that there were pretty much NO special effects, just great camera work, good use of music (both the presence and absence of it), and great acting. Although I think an Oscar might be a little too much, Haley Joel Osment did a great job and really made me feel for him. Willis was actually pretty good, too, I must admit.Of course, none of this would have mattered without a story, and this movie had it. The ending was a true surprise, and, just like they want, I'll be shelling out another $6.50 to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is a somewhat slow moving, but perpetually intriguing suspense film in the style of Alfred Hitchcock. The plot was without flaw, the cinematography excellent, and the acting (especially by Haley Joel Osment) was outstanding. This film is a must see, twice! The first time to have the plot revealed to you in your utter ignorance. The second time to reassure yourself that the plot truly is flawless.

		<shortDescription>What's the hype?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a reasonably well written, well shoot and constructed film with no substance to mention, playing it safe and not daring to transgress the conventional Hollywood frames. Young Haley Joel Osman is the carrying force of this film and succeeds in receiving lots of empathy for his unhappy, fearful condition. Many scenes of this film are touching, and some scenes startling and slightly disturbing, but for the most part this film has been dumbed down to achieve maximum audience and profit. The good craftmanship of the film makers is being wasted in the director's lack of strength in his vision and edge. This is such a neat package of "horror" for cinematically uneducated and undemanding from a nice, compromising Spielberg school of directing. Bruce Willis is not playing a moronic action-hero, but an introverted academic in his typical boring way. Comparing this film to "Exorcist", "Shining" or "Silence Of The Lambs" would constitute a blasphemy towards great masters of film making like William Friedkin, Stanley Kubrick and Jonathan Demme. This film is more of the calibre of "Flatliners" than aforementioned achievements. Sixth sense is a relatively insignificant, unchallenging mainstream film with really, nothing you haven't seen dozens of times before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a Bruce Willis fan, so I had decided not to see this movie when the previews first came out. But 6 weeks at #1 and all the buzz finally made me cave in. I'm glad I did.The biggest complaint I hear about this movie is that it starts too slow. I think the slow build up is necessary for the story, and thought every scene was necessary for the full effect. It's interesting to point out that there were pretty much NO special effects, just great camera work, good use of music (both the presence and absence of it), and great acting. Although I think an Oscar might be a little too much, Haley Joel Osment did a great job and really made me feel for him. Willis was actually pretty good, too, I must admit.Of course, none of this would have mattered without a story, and this movie had it. The ending was a true surprise, and, just like they want, I'll be shelling out another $6.50 to see it again.</fullReview>

The acting is good, though by no means great, and the final twist is intriguing. Still, don't buy into the hype. The movie's worth seeing but go to a matinee. I must add that I love Olivia Williams.

		<fullReview>Movies, movies, movies they can be so happy, sad, and exciting. Yes there are scary movies , and yes there are disgustiing movies that make you want to leave but they can be so intresting to go and see. Sixth sense is a great movie to go and see. I basically liked Sixth Sense because of its weird wacky ending. Sith sense was a movie that you might have to go and see twice if you are slow like me but you didnt mind seeing it twice at all. I think this movie is highly recommended and I suggest that you go and see it but you should make sure that you bring a friend with you. One reason because your going to need someone to grab there hand for the scary parts then you might want that friend with you for asking questions at the end of the movie. SRVHS Debbie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that this movie was excellent. They had a wonderful cast of actors. Especially the 8 year old. The writers really knew what the were doing. This movie gets an "A" for being so scary and creative. There were so many good parts in the movie, but one stood out at me. It was when the littler girl showed the part of how her mother killed her with the poison. This was definitely part of my criteria being scary. The was another part that I thought really stood out at me. Great acting. The was good acting by the adults, but the 8 year old kid was excellent. I think he should get an Oscar for his performance. He made it seem real when he had to use his emotions. By having a child in this movie it brought back memories to me and I'm sure to all the adults. Memories of ghosts that they thought they saw. I know it brought chills to me every time that I am alone. If there could be one more thing that I wanted to see more of it would be how he interacted with the dead people. I still loved this movie. It really meet my criteria.By: Jarryd SRVHS student</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie "The Sixth Sense" was a very good and scary movie. The criteria for a movie like this one is that it has to be scary, full of surprises, have a good plot, make sense, and have a good ending. This movie had it all!The main thing that made this movie especially scary was the ghosts- not just one or two, but a whole army of zombie-like ghouls who haunt the gothic streets of modern Philadelphia. The ghosts follow this boy named Cole, because they seem to want something from him. The thing that makes that scary is that you as the viewer or him as the person don't know what they want from him until the end. It is very suspenseful. The other thing that makes this movie scary was that you didnt know if Cole was crazy because he was the only one who could seem them. But then you find out that he's not crazy, and that all the ghosts are really there to him, and that they need his help.I think that the movie was good because of the fabulous ending. The ending really got you thinking. Not just about how it ended, but the whole movie. It just made you reflect back and go through the movie to see if the ending matched up to the movie. Another thing that made the ending really good was that it was very scary. The movie was extremely good and scary, The whole movie was made very well, and it was obvious it had a lot of time and effort put into it. The ghosts were great special effects and gave the movie and eerie feeling. The end just tied up the whole movie, like movies should. But this endng was especially well done. The suspense was absolutely great, it had you on the edge of your seat waiting for another event to occur. The movie was very well made. I give it two thumbs up! by Aja</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie get's an A for good acting and suspense. It's a great movie for teens and adults. At times it's scry, suspensefull, and mysterious. To make it even better, it has a twisted ending.The acting in this movie was very good because it was realistic. When the boy by the name of Cole said that he saw dead people it was belivable by the way he acted. I also liked his reactions when he would see or hear dead people. Another good actor in this movie was the psychologist played by Bruce Willis. He was especially good when he convinced the young Cole to stop running and hiding from the ghosts and find out what they really wanted and why were they haunting him.This movie was full of suspense because you never knew what was going to happen next. When the doctor was shot I was in suspense wondering if he was going to die or not.Other parts that demonstrated suspense were when the ghost came, because you don't know what they are going to do.My opinion is that this was a great movie, an A+. The acting and suspense were just two of the many talents that stood out. This movie was definatly worth seeing.

		<fullReview>This summer I went and saw the awesome movie the Sixth Sense! It had an awesome plot,great casting and acting!! This movie was very easy to follow with many twists,turns and cool make-up. This movie kept me glued to my seat!Some of the best scene that showed the most amazing acting was when the little boy woke up in the middle of the night and wandered into the kitchen only to find a dead woman looking for something in the cupboards.When she started to talk to him the poor boy got frightened(as would most any one)and ran back to his little red tent and began to shiver and cry. This scene was amazing because of the great make-up.The little boy acted like he had really seen a ghost! Another time that the little boy showed great acting was when he first told Bruce Willis about his terrifying secret. This was an amazing scene because he cried like he really could see ghosts.When you see some really good make-up it makes the movie much better and more life like. When you see this awesome make-up is when one of the dead people talks to the little boy and then turns around you see a bloody head. The had been shot off by accidental gun fire. This make-up made the movie more life like and seem like the ghosts were actually there. The best scene though, is when the boy is talking to a woman she moves so you can see the other side of her face to realize that she is actually dead. The one side had been burned to a very crispy person. This was the best make-up I have ever seen in this kind of horror flick.In conclusion I think that this is a must see movie, not only for the theaters but a good one for keeps!This summer I have also seen the Haunting of the hill house and that movie was lame compared to this brilliant move. This year if you see a movie see THE SIXTH SENSE!!BY Anthony Arnerich High School Student</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good movie is well through out beginning to end. A good movie keeps you hooked eyes glued to the screen hands gripping the armrests and feet plastered to the ground. A good movie sets you up throught the whole thing then surprises you with a shocking mind boggling ending. The sixth sense delivered all this and more The key to a truely intriguing movie is in the acting. Bruise Willis gave a wonderful performance as usual but Haley was shockingly better probably the best child actors I've ever seen. When Cole (Haley) gets locked in the attic by two of his schoolmates and was beat up by the ghost you could feel his pain it was almost real. Cole helping us find out how the young girl really died.Throughout the whole movie you wondered about Malcome's relationship with his wife, for example when she sat waiting for him at a restraunt on their anniversary when he finally showed up and tried to pay the bill but she took it from him ( that was harsh). Scenes like that keep the movie going and hinted around a future occurrence. but it was the part when the little boy told his mother that grandma said hi and that she did go to her daughters dance recitle years ago when they had gotten in a fight. That was when you knew the mother believed him. In my opinion this movie The Sixth sense is very good worth every penny and more. Its powerful cast and plot came to gether to make a good movie that you and your family can see. It will keep you talking about its ending for days. This movie definitely gets four stars and two thumbs up from me!!</fullReview>

Now, I am angry that I was so busy wishing it would hurry and not paying attention to the details. So actually, it wasnt drawn out, it was details being layed before the audience.PAY ATTENTION, then the ending may not be such a shock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was a number one horror. This film will leave you hanging as the suspense drives you crazy. As a 5 year old child goes through scares as ghosts haunt him, and as they freak him out you are getting freak out your self. I would rate this movie a 10 on horror. Throughout this film at the most unexpected moments you will jump right out of your seat. I did at least, and thats what I find so great about a horror is unexpected moments of the film getting your heart beating. The ending is the most excellent part but I cant give that part of the film away you will have to see it for your self. by SRV Student: Chris</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effectively scary but overrated film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I admit that the suspense scenes had me covering my eyes, I was disappointed with this movie as a whole. The script was corny and overwrought and other than Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette (the actors portraying the little boy and his mother) I felt the acting was stilted and uncompelling. This movie has uneven, and, at times, frustratingly slow pacing. Some of the plot points are ridiculously pat (and obvious) and I didn't find the ending to be terribly surprising (or satisfying). There are other films with similar last-minute twists that are much more effective... see Jacob's Ladder, The Seventh Sign, and the one that I think inspired them all, "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge," based on the Ambrose Bierce story. I can only guess that the popularity of this movie is due to the performance of Osment, who is really excellent--he is the highlight of this overrated film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only the Best Film of the Summer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sixth Sense" is about a troubled youngster who communicates with the dead and the relationship he develops with his psychiatrist. Haley Joel Osment gives an unforgettable performance as the haunted child. Bruce Willis plays the sympathetic psychiatrist who tries to help the boy deal with his "gift". The mood of the film is set from the opening scene in which we see a red light bulb turned on and a woman enter a cold wine cellar. The nuanced scenes that follow lead to an unforgettable ending that requires a second viewing of the film. The writing is suspenseful and tight. True, it does start off a bit slow, but upon my second viewing, I realized this is part of the film's mood. "The Sixth Sense" is probably one of the best psychological thrillers that I've seen in a long time and brings to mind one of my favorite (and I think one of the best)psychological thrillers of the '70's - "Audrey Rose". (Although that film deals with reincarnation, I think the mood is somewhat similar.)</fullReview>

Bruce Willis as the doctor trying to help this little boy but not believing him at first was heart wrenching. The ending was superb. Never saw it coming like you do in so many movies.

		<fullReview>One of the finest suspense movies. I am not a Bruce Willis fan, but he certainly surprises me with his character in this film. Usually I don't feel for ANY of his characters (like in Armageddon), yet enough people talked about 6th Sense that I decided to go with my girlfriend. WOW. I must say that your hair may stand on end (especially the ones on the back of your neck), and for some scenes I almost jumped out of my seat. But I have to say that although the child does "see dead people" (as quoted in the trailers and tv spots) it isn't like some kind of zombie movie. Dead people aren't moving about with that tacky moaning and grunting that I had at first suspected. The casting, direction and plot are superb. The lighting of the scenes heighten the suspense as we found ourselves feeling for all the characters, including Willis'. See the movie soon, while it's still in theaters. But please go with someone. You'll want to talk about the movie long after the end credits roll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SIXTH SENSE Moves the Senses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Psychological thinking movie about a psychiatrist who after a terrible confrontation in the past, tries to atone for it by helping a boy with the same problems. Chances are you've seen this before on TV, and how everything unfolds will either leave you with your jaw dropped or you whacking your head uttering, "Stupid!" Some parts were played well. The scenes surrounding the dead young girl were thought out and impressed me. The boy's altercation with his teacher was mildly cute as well. If you want a good rental with your loved one at home, The Sixth Sense is it, chances are you two may cry together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cole Sear is a young boy who can see dead people sound scary believe me it is. The Sixth Sense is an effective horror movie with a good story to back it up. Cole is reluctant to tell anyone about his dark secret. Malcolm Crowe is a child psychologist who wants to help to Cole, as the story continues the relationship between them grows stronger. Bruce Willis is great as a child psychologist. Haley Joel Osment does an excellent acting job he made the character of Cole quite convincing. Like the Blair Witch Project this movie doesn't use tons of gore scenes instead it takes time to develop a strong story. The story is basically about getting over our fears and letting go of the past. The ending of this movie had a great unexpected twist. This movie has great imagery and an excellent spooky score. 10/10 Another great horror movie. "I see dead people" Cole Sear</fullReview>

It's one of those movies that you really want to see at least twice to watch for "surprises" and things the second time around, knowing what you didnt know the first time.Bruce Willis was excellent and the child playing Cole gave me goosebumps. I wouldnt call this a Horror film, I think it is more of a thought provoking film having to do with death and the realization of it. You should not have your mind thinking the entire time of what the surprise ending will be, you wont figure it out anyway and it's much better if you dont know!!

		<fullReview>This film thoroughly surprised me. Great acting, excellent characters (well-defined and intriguing), a hypnotic storyline, and lots of chills. I'm used to predicting endings even when they are a bit of a twist, but this one came from left field for me. I measure the success of a movie not just by the actual in-theater experience, but also about how much the film stays in my mind and keeps me talking about it after I've left the theater. The Sixth Sense had audience members immediately turn to their companions (as soon as the credits rolled) to discuss their interpretation, and I know I thought about it days later.Bruce Willis is fantastic in the role of the child psychologist, but Haley Joel Osment is the one who most surprised me. This boy has a great career ahead of him. His emotional range and sincerity is impressive, *especially* considering his youth. You go, Haley!I look forward to watching this moving again to see what I missed the first time around. Bravo to M. Night Shyamalan for a brilliant screenplay and tight, skillful directing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been plenty of good movies this year, that I enjoyed. Such as "Arlington Road", "Varsity Blues", "American Pie", "Austin Powers 2", "Outside Providence", "The Mummy", "Bowfinger", and even "The Blair With Project", but none have lived up to the excellence of "The Sixth Sense". "The Sixth Sense" is the best movie I have seen in a long time. You could actually feel Cole's anguish. And to those of you who don't like "horror" movies, this isn't one of them. This is a wonderful film, which will chill you at times, but it has no really gory parts. This is not a "Scream" movie, yet it has been #1 in the box office 5 weeks in a row! "Star Wars" wasn't even #1 that long! This is definitely the best movie of the year, and I don't expect to see a better one. Not only that, I expect that this film will be remembered as one of the greatest of all time. I wish I had a bigger scale! I give this a 10 out of 10, but wish I could give it a 20 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not surprised the mass market likes this very mediocre movie, but I can't understand the near universal critical acclaim a movie like this can get. I admit my own bias - I hate movies about smary kids to begin with, nor do I care for obvious sentimentality, but trying to be objective, the problem, as usual is the script. It simply is average--the pacing is awkward and plodding; there is a serious lack of tension and momentum. I do not consider myself to be a literary genius, but have all the critics of today never seen a movie with good writing? (Mostly pre 1990). Are we really left with movies that go "Boo.", (accompanied by the generic rumbling sound effect). Or are they only comparing movies to the other dismal offerings we get today (well,fair enough, perhaps). This movie was quite boring, and if I hadn't been nearly asleep thru most of it, I probably could have figured out the "surprise." Mainly I enjoyed the Philadelphia locales.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Oscar for Osment! "Sixth Sense" is a *** 1/2 Must-See Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only can Cole Sear "sense" dead spirits around him, he sees and can communicate with them. Thanks to a solid script and clever direction by M. Night Shyamalan and an incredible performance by young Haley Joel Osment (as Cole), this is one summer thriller that should not be missed. Sure, Bruce Willis is given top-billing in all of the film's promotional efforts, but there is no doubt who the "star" of this creepy and affecting film is. Osment is remarkable in the role of an elementary-aged boy with "The Sixth Sense". With psychiatric help (from Willis in a role very much resembling his turn in "The Color of Night"), Cole attempts to overcome his disturbing otherworldly visions and the fact that many of his classmates (and even his teacher) consider him a freak. Fortunately for all, Willis keeps his pants on and Osment works magic, playing his character with as much skill and believability as someone many times his age. Let the Oscar buzz begin! I'm wondering, just how young was the youngest Best Actor winner!?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M. Night Shyamala, I'm sure that Rod Serling smiles at you from the Twilight Zone!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think its fair to say that Rod Serling would've loved this film. Trust me, "the twist" is an honest to God "twist and 1/2!"Honestly, I was reluctant to see this movie at first because I was beginning to think that maybe the reason why mainstream audiences liked this film so much is because so many movies in 1999 were either sub-par or extremely over rated. I was already duped once this year by "The Blair Witch Project" but a close friend of my mine reassured me that The Sixth Sense had "one of the best endings in movie history." Thinking that his statement was a pretty bold one, I decided to check it out for myself. VERDICT: The Sixth Sense is thus far, the best film of the 1999.When the twist came at the end, I haven't heard so many "Oh's &amp; Ah's" and even crying in a theatre in recent memory. As the credits were rolling, I was still sitting in my seat in a daze. Even an hour later, I was still pondering about it.I'm admittedly very good at guessing "the twist" to movies because I've seen a lot of them and I'm a student of film. However, with The Sixth Sense, I just missed guessing "the twist" only by a hair. You see, I had a hunch that it was like the ending of a Twilight Zone episode called &lt;POSSIBLE SPOILER&gt;"The Hitch-Hiker", however, I guessed the wrong character.&lt;END POSSIBLE SPOILER&gt;.I could blab on like everybody else about how good the actors were in this film, but I'll spare you, because the real genius is M. Night Shyamala (Writer, Director and played the doctor in the film). He deserves and Oscar for writing and directing one of the best screen plays in recent memory.Cheers to you M. Night Shyamala!!The spirit of Rod Serling is alive and well!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not to cast aspersions on any fellow critic, but I would recommend those of you perusing the comments on "The Sixth Sense" to avoid reading AliceG's undeservedly nasty diatribe. My guess is that AliceG just cannot accept any film that doesn't swell with Gothic imagery and a teeming moroseness; I would also assume that the movie's much-hyped ending had no effect on a soul so numbed by cynicism. But I digress..."The Sixth Sense" is a tremendous achievement, a stunning end to a season that hung itself with bathroom humor and bathroom-quality films like "Wild Wild West" and "The General's Daughter." The acting, the script, and the direction rival that of any film I have seen; it is to M. Night Shyamalan's credit that "The Sixth Sense" reverberates with such heartening force.I cannot adequately express in such a short space how impressive this movie really is. What Hollywood has needed for so long is fresh talent, and in Shyamalan and Haley Joel Osment, it is unearthed. As for Bruce Willis, the assessment that he is a one-dimensional, prototype badass character is unfair. He lets "The Sixth Sense" come to him, never emoting, a trait that has victimized some of his lesser Hollywood compatriots."The Sixth Sense" deserves all the merit it has received, and I think Shyamalan will reap what he has sown once Academy Award nominations are announced. A work such as this warrants the praise it has received.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> In its fifth week of release, I finally got out to see "The Sixth Sense." I certainly wasn't intrigued by the previews (too much whispering!), but the tremendous word of mouth convinced me to go. I am glad I did. "The Sixth Sense" is easily the best film of the summer, if not the year. It surpasses "The Blair Witch Project" in both chills and overall effectiveness. It has such a sublimely quiet style both visually and aurally. The story is put together with such craft and care, and it's appreciated even more so after the final five or ten minutes.  I have no interest in detailing the plot as the previews (and other reviews) give away too much as it is. The less you know, the better. The performances were terrific, especially (and I think, love it or hate it, we all agree on this one) Haley Joel Osmont's fine acting job.

		<fullReview>The film is actually very similar to director Shyamalan's first movie "Wide Awake".The same themes of life after death,redemption and submission to the lord is dealt with here too though under a much darker surroundings,the pacing is similar and deliberate,there's a surprise ending and like the first movie the adult actors and stars are eclipsed by a young actor.The two most surprising aspects of this movie are Haley Joel Osment's controlled,mature and measured performance and the fact that this movie has found great favor among the audiences.As for poor Bruce Willis,who is badly miscast and gives the impression that he has strayed in from another movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a wonderful treat to walk into a movie expecting nothing and come away seeing one of the best films of the year. I expected little seeing as Bruce Willis was the star and although he does a fine job it is the young boy, Haley Joel Osmond, who steals this show. He sends shivers up the back of your neck with just his eyes. I can't say enough good things about this movie. You just have to see it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you see only one movie this year, make it The Sixth Sense; this film is well worth your time and money and may even be worth seeing twice just to make sure you catch everything you missed the first time around. Bruce Willis gives his best performance in years and proves, for those who may have doubted, that he is an excellent actor with ability beyond what the action movies suggest. Haley Joel Osment makes it real as the boy with a secret and he and Willis perform very well together as they work through Cole's fear. Toni Collette was also wonderful as Cole's mother and even scary as she tries to get to Cole in one scene. Whatever you do, see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has the United States become the land of the slow and the home of the dim?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the opening sequence, a child psychiatrist (Bruce Willis) is shot in the guts by an adult patient, a raving loony, who has broken into his home. In the scenes that follow, set a year later, the shrink meets up with a small boy who claims to see and hear the dead--imperceptible to everyone else around him. Since the shrink is never spoken to by anyone else in the movie, and the kid is the "only one who hears voices," the Stunning Surprise Ending that's promised is about as stunning and surprising as the end of a Polish joke. It's an indescribable experience to sit in an auditorium full of people who are held rapt by this brainingly obvious hooey. The writer-director, M. Night Shmyahan, has studied THE EXORCIST and THE SHINING, and, considering those films clearly too violent for this genteel moment in moviemaking, has taken one element from them--numbing, lugubrious slowness. He has made one commercially sound choice: If this material were played any quicker, its thinness and obviousness would smack the audience in the face like a coal shovel. How a huge audience can be magnetized by amateurish, headless, suspenseless pap like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and THE SIXTH SENSE in the same summer is beyond my reckoning. The lesson of SENSE and WITCH's success seems to be: Telling a story to a movie audience now is like telling a joke to a very slow twelve-year-old. And remember: Before you hit the punchline, go back and deliver a few of the set-ups twice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even apart from its "surprise" (just to brag, I wasn't fooled) -it's still a good little thriller- very aware of its (structural) limitations and mostly content to be what it is. Studio films are rarely this efficient or focused. And Osment is terrific, though it annoyed me to realize that, even without direction, he would have made a much, much better Anakin Skywalker (he was even the right age!!).The smaller moments, though, are what make the movie worthwhile for me- the school play (light years from any of the like scenes in the abysmal "Simon Birch", for example), the couple in the jewelry store, the events at the wake. Shyamalan does a good job of showing people relate in _pictures_ (true, a necessity afforded by the plot); it's so much easier, but not nearly so powerful, to let words do all the work. Great decision to shoot in old Philadelphia, too. (Side note: "Wide Awake" was also a religious-themed film, albeit in a much different way, and I've read that as a child Shyamalan attended a Catholic school at his parents insistence, even though they were/are practicing Hindus. As his career takes shape, I'll be curious to see how his background is reflected in his films.)It strikes me that the film has benefitted from its relative lack of publicity- one actually had to go looking for information to find out anything. The less you know, the more the movie'll hit you. This is a rare instance in which the studio's inability to recognize what they had actually increased the film's impact, not to mention its box-office receipts.That said, it's really just an overlong episode of "The X-Files" with the 'heart' of "Touched By An Angel"; theologically dubious and ultimately sentimental. Is it any surprise that it's become such a success?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 6th sense may be the best horror movie I've seen for a long time. When I first heard about it, I thought it was going to be another Mercury Rising (you know Bruce Willis -some kid) but I was dead wrong! The 6th Sense is a true spine-chilling movie. For those of you who are expecting any gore or in-your-face monsters, forget it, this movie is more subtle than that. And the ending! Don't read any spoilers, or you might as well forget about seeing the movie. As for the acting, Haley Joel Osment was EXCELLENT. He is the greatest child actor I have ever known. He plays his character with true emotional depth. No big-eyed, teary 'Mommy I'm scaaaared' performance that I'm accustomed to seeing in most horror movies but a real performance. You can actually FEEL his fear and you can really sympathize with him. The scenes with him and his mother are very touching. No, this is more than just a horror flick. One of the scenes that I can't forget is when Osment looks steadfastly away from the dead bodies hanging from a beam at his school. He doesn't scream or anything, but that scene carries weight, it tells you that the boy has seen this type of things many times. Another one is when he tells Willis at the hospital that he sees dead people around him, who don't know they're dead, and they see only what they want to see. Creepy. Osment deserves an Oscar for his role. Oh and Willis was good too, the two characters interact wonderfully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great plot twist, but holes ruin it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING -- this review MAY contain spoilers, but I've taken great care to write it very discreetly so that you shouldn't be affected by the review if you haven't yet watched the movie -- WARNINGThe plot twist in the Sixth sense makes the movie. Think of the plot twist (which is revealed at the very end) like a fine silk robe.Except it's ruined because it's full of holes.In the beginning of the movie, the psycho shoots Bruce Willis and kills himself.Then it says "NEXT FALL", and the movie continues from there. Over a year later, where Bruce Willis meets the boy.That's first hole. Would Bruce Willis go for over a year not knowing the secret? (By, the secret, I mean what you, the viewer, would know after the plot twist is revealed, at the end of the movie.)Also, if the secret would hold true, Cole's (The boy's) mother should never have spoken with Bruce Willis.Also, all of the ghosts that the boy sees are scary. They all have their death marks on them. The 1970's teen ghost has his head blown off. The girl ghost pukes up her poisoned insides. The housewife ghost shows her slashed wrists. But the secret of the movie does not follow this same pattern with the doctor ghost. You never see any wounds on the doctor ghost. Hmm... well unless that's because he never turns his back during the whole movie?? You wouldn't see the wound on the 1970's teen ghost if he never turned around either... but I'm not sure... maybe I should watch it again?... Also, none of the other ghosts speak. They stare blankly and then walk away. Why would that ghost doctor speak then?????? It makes no sense!!!The worst part is, again, that it continues over a year later after Bruce Willis gets wounded. I mean, Bruce Willis would NOT have gone for over a year without knowing the secret. Seriously. If all the other points I listed above where little holes in my silk robe, pin holes even, then this fact is like a giant tear. The movie should've continued in the next day, or next week after he gets hit. Not "NEXT FALL". UHHHHhhhh.Other than that though, a great movie, which promotes post-movie conversation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here it is, a wonderfully-crafted, low-budget (except for Bruce Willis), low-tech thriller. Suspense builds throughout the film while we watch two extremely likable characters struggle with their own personal demons. There are no car chases or explosions, and even the ghosts are reasonably tame. There are, however, Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment who play their roles with precision, leading us to the surprise ending -- which need not be a surprise to make this picture work, but adds to the enjoyment of this wonderful story.</fullReview>

For such a young actor to sustain believability without resorting to histrionics is an enviable feat. Bruce Willis does some fine work as the psychiatrist who must try to help this boy beleaguered by ghosts. I wonder, however, about some scenes that must have ended up on the cutting room floor. We never get any explanation about the ghosts in Cole's own home. Their unsettling appearances are never explained. And I am sorry, but I did foresee the ending. All in all, a good thriller, though, and worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a complete waste of time and money.1. They used your typical formula of scare tactics to make the audience jump (let it get dark, make the music scary and then have something unidentifiable jump across the screen). You really have no choice but to react, your body can't stop it, but this has been called "scary". And it didn't even happen that often in the movie.2. The movie dragged in too many spots for me to even start describing them. I kept saying to myself (get on with it, etc...)3. They made the movie confusing only to give the appearance of a "surprise ending". True I didn't realize their real ending...4. Wow! The camera work. I have heard of poor filmmaking but this is unreal. I keep hearing people who don't like the Blair Witch Project because of the unstable camera (most of those people don't realize its neccesity) but this movie was made in the third person using a lot of money and I was still having flashbacks of the BWP. This movie was supposed to have stable shots but I kept getting annoyed when the camera would struggle like a homevideo.5. They never developed any character. Especially the boy. I wanted to know more about his relationships with the ghosts. What did they want, why were they there? But they never tell you.Therefore if you are so inclined to watch your typical wonderbread "horror" film (that isn't even as good as Friday the 13th part 8 go ahead and pay the 6-9 dollars to see it. I can promise that you will jump three times and be completely confused until the end. And if you are like most of the other patrons I saw the film with you still will leave there confused and broke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotionally wracking ghost story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The word of mouth (WOM) on this movie has been huge and I finally got around to seeing it after 4 weeks and I'm glad I did. If you have not seen it yet DO NOT KNOW THE ENDING. I won't even hint at it here except to say it is one the best in movie history. This is easily one of the best 3 films of year (among The Matrix, EdTV and Thomas Crown). I had tears running down my cheeks about 4 different times throughout this film and all because I cared about the kid. Haley Joe Osment gives the best child performance I've ever seen (even topping those given in CE3K and ET and Sleepers) as a sweet and troubled child who sees ghost. He should be a lock for a nomination for best lead actor Oscar (but then again "Shakespeare..." won a "best film" Oscar last year). Bruce Willis is wonderful as a sympathetic shrink trying to treat the kid (anybody who saw "Nobody's Fool" will not be surprised by his work here) and Toni Collette (who?) is just right as the kid's mom. Also Olivia Williams is very fine and very beautiful as Willis's wife. Writer-director M. Night Smyamalan trusts the intelligence of his audience by giving us a screenplay as heart-tugging as "Titanic" or "Field Of Dreams". The scares here are creepy but not shocking. He's too smart for that and they work because we really care about the people in the movie. His direction is virtually perfect. James Newton Howard's score is his best since "Grand Canyon" and just as memorable (I can't wait to buy it). I'd heard that it was an excellent movie, but I still wasn't prepared by how good it was. The thing that really sets it apart is that for a scary movie it is touches your heart and in that respect it reminds me of "Ghost" (although this is much scarier) and "Jacob's Ladder".</fullReview>

Those of us who remember his brutal depiction of a wife beater on an episode of Miami Vice have a hard time sifting through the "smirk" comments that are so prevalent in the reviews of this movie. Oh, they don't accuse him of smirking, they compliment him on NOT smirking.. or something like that. It is too bad that success in the movies is all to often greeted with contempt by those paid to review films. The bottom line in "The Sixth Sense" is that a very good director got amazing performances out of very good actors to tell a story that will leave you thinking about it for days afterwood. That is a good movie. Enough said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>STOP WHISPERING!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time that I saw the trailer for "The Sixth Sense," (When I went to see "Election," which is still one of the very best movies of the year, and one that I would highly reccommend once it's released on video, btw...), I LAUGHED hysterically to the point that the other people in the theatre turned around to stare at me.And just what did I find so funny? The fact that NO ONE in this movie talked at a normal speaking volume-- EVER. They were either screaming or whispering THE ENTIRE TIME. There's very little middle ground here.So, when I actually caved in and agreed to see "The Sixth Sense," I was expecting to laugh my rear off at a movie that I was expecting to be so ridiculously full of itself that it assumed it could get away with constant whispering.But I was pleasantly surprised. It's actually a very good movie. It's not on the same artistic level as either "Election" or "The Blair Witch Project," but this is a thoroughly enjoyable film!Haley Joel Osment gives one of the most chilling performances in years-- not just from a child actor, but from an actor of ANY level of experience. He is really THAT effective in his portrayal of Cole, the young boy with the special "gift." Unlike when I saw the trailer, I did NOT think it was the least bit funny when Cole inaudibly confides, "... I see dead people." I can't imagine a better "Supporting Actor" performance coming along at any point this year. And the other performances are consistently solid, hopefully re-establishing some credibility to Bruce Willis' career. Still, Osment really shines here.Much has been made of the ending to "The Sixth Sense." And while it may not have been blatantly obvious, those people who, like I was, were told to expect a twist ending should be able to figure it out fairly easily. It's not comparable to the ending of "The Usual Suspects," by any stretch of the imagination. But it's still a satisfying and unsettling conclusion...Rating: 8 out of 10. The whispering thing is STILL annoying, but it's exaggerated by the trailer. Thematically, "The Sixth Sense" could have gone much farther, giving the movie a more profound impact or purpose beyond mere entertainment. But, it's HIGH QUALITY escapist entertainment, which is more than OK on occasion.</fullReview>

Instead of your usual tragi-violent or "sequel ready" horror film ending, you had a real healing kind of ending. this was the most refreshing aspect of the film.

The pacing was terrific, and the child actor at the heart of the piece is the best kid I've seen onscreen since Jodie Foster. (Sure sign of a great horror film: I was more flipped out three hours after seeing it than I was in the theater!)</fullReview>

It's a very deliberate take on someone's inner soul. Many people couldn't handle a movie like this. I believe they were inspired when they made this film.

		<shortDescription>Horror turns to healing. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had only heard good things about this film before I saw it but all of them were cryptic affirmations. Needless to say I went in "thinking" it was a good film. I was not disappointed. The cinematography was superb with it's cold autumn color palette. The child star was truly remarkable. Bruce Willis was refreshingly restrained. It never ceases to amaze me when he pulls subtley off so very well. However, the thing that impressed me most was the positive ending to the whole thing. Instead of your usual tragi-violent or "sequel ready" horror film ending, you had a real healing kind of ending. this was the most refreshing aspect of the film. But with such a slow, methodical pacing it surprises me that it is such a hit with the action hungry American audiences. Definately worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recently I went to see this movie and thought that it was excellent. I especially enjoyed the performance of Haley Joel Osment as Cole. This boy is a gifted young actor who will hopefully be around for a long time. Bruce Willis played kind of a second banana to the wonderful Osment, but he was still at top form. The chemistry between the two was fabulous, and you could tell that they shared a bond. The ending really sold it for me. Overall the movie is very spooky, but entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fascinating tale between a boy and a psychiatrist. The plot is a well constructed story that develops their relationship while they overcome their individual problems. Watch as how their roles as patient and psychiatrist interchange. Excellent cinematography by Fujimoto (Silence of the Lambs) whose contrasting light and colors in various scenes set the stage for the eerie settings. The camera work by the director, Shyamalan, is very deliberate and captivating. He moves it slowly throughout the suspense scenes--capturing every little detail and crack in the wall, so we can feel that we have a part in the movie. James Howard's score is reminiscent of his work in Primal Fear, like a subtle humming in the background. Osment gives a magnificent performance as well as the rest of the cast. Mischa Barton (Lawn Dogs) is also a delight to watch. As of August 1999, it is clearly one of the best movies of the year. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that The Sixth Sense had many redeeming qualities, starting with strong performances by both Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment. I think that the end twist with Bruce Willis's character was a great idea, and unpredictable. I also liked the particular interaction that Osment's character had with the ghosts. What I didn't like was that I don't think it was developed enough. Director m. Night Shyalaman was onto two very interesting plot elements, and if they had been developed a bit more, this film would have been much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like you've heard from everyone, you have to see this movie to know why it's so good. However, it's not THAT good in my opinion. There are a few good scares, and the story is intriguing, but it is only a thought-provoking and shocking ending that leaves everyone in total awe from this film. Though the acting is excellent throughout most of the movie, it is not "Oscar-worthy" as many have claimed. Also, it's not as original a movie as many critics have said. I don't want to name the movie I have in mind that is similar, because it might give away a few twists, but you'll notice similarities on your own if you think about it too. After all is said though, "The Sixth Sense" is worth seeing, even if it's just for a superb ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was brought back to see this film for a second time due to it's ending. I saw it again and thought it was rather descent the second time around. And I think when more people do that the hype is really gonna calm down. After you aren't caught way off guard from the ending it's not THAT amazing.The best thing about this film was the kid, Harley Joel Osment. He stole every scene in the film and was so perfectly casted. If only they had him play Anakin Skywalker, we'd be talking masterpiece for George Lucas. Bruce Willis did a fine job himself for a much calmer roll then he's used to. The directing and writing are both put together nicely and it holds your attention throughout and gets you tense when it wants you to.The plot is so-so, nothing really new here other than being put together real well. So what's my complain. Well when Titanic came out and everyone was truly amazed by it and kept seeing it again some Leo guy haters had to ruin the movie and take it from #5 on the top 250 and sending it off the chart making it seem way overhyped. So now a movie that really did deserve to be on the top 250 is knocked off even if it really did deserve Best Picture (come'on, if The Full Monty won would that make you happy?). But if that was considered overhyped I can't wait to see this the same time next year.Yes, it had an amazing ending, maybe one of the best since The Usual Suspects. But is it as good as The Usual Suspects? Very far from it. Is it better than Braveheart, Close Encounters, 2001, Fargo, or Reservoir Dogs to name a few? Hell no! It wasn't the best film of the year either. The Blair Witch Project was creepier, The Matrix was more jawdropping, and Go was more enjoyable. But yet all three of those don't seem to get nearly the amount attention as this, and it confuses the hell out of me.Next time please don't overhype a movie so much. If you think it's good or it's great leave it at that. The more hopes you get up for this film the more disappointed they'll be, especially when you think it's the best film you've ever seen. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The year's best film so far...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, by far, the year's best film to date: a very intense and emotional psychological thriller about a young boy who sees ghosts and the child psychologist who tries to reach him. Bruce Willis gives his best performance of his career. In my opinion, he's quite worthy of an Oscar nomination, but he'll never get one. He'll be lucky if he gets a Golden Globe nomination. The real treasure of the film is Haley Joel Osment. He gives the greatest child performance I have ever seen. It would be a travesty if he doesn't win Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards next year. Osment's performance makes me, as a theatre-acting major at University Of Illinois, feel envious of him, which I feel is a pathetic emotion. The writing and direction is flawless. The pacing is slow, but slow for a reason. We get a real sense of the characters and the situation and it makes us care about every one of them and their outcome. The ending, as many have said, is shocking and very effective. Nothing can prepare you for it; it's the best climax since, should I say, "The Usual Suspects." The ending makes you look at the film in an entirely different prospective and that is one of the film's greatest achievements. I highly recommend this chilling and haunting tale and should be remembered as a classic ghost story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When we saw the trailer for this movie, we weren't very impressed, although we like Bruce Willis is many of the movies he has made. We aren't usually into ghost story-horror movies, but decided to go because a friend suggested it. We loved the show and were very impressed with the acting on the part of Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis. We were shocked by the ending, exactly as the producers intended the audience to be. The last 5 minutes of the movie were worth the price of admission!! It is the type of movie that you will talk about for awhile afterward, trying to figure out all the pieces of the puzzle. It is a shame that more movies aren't of the high quality that this one was with a truly terrific ending that you only find rarely in movies these days. We would recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it! We simply loved this show!! We give it a 10, and would give it a 12 if we could!!</fullReview>

I have lately been complaining that there has not been enough really good mystery/supernatural/horror movies lately. This one came along at just the right time. The suspense that is built up is phenomenal. It's all the little things that do it. Just little details -- that are hard to define. And the interplay between the characters is great. I actually lost track of time, and the fact that I was "just" watching a movie... I am going to see this one at least twice more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd put off going to see the "Sixth Sense" because people kept saying it was creepy and after seeing it, I might be afraid to be in the house alone or won't be able to sleep at night. But I decided to ignore their comments and went to see it. I'm glad I did. The movie just wasn't about a boy (Haley Joel Osment) who sees "dead people". It was also about family; his relationship with his mother, and about single parenting. I thought Haley and Bruce Willis acted well together (they clicked well). I think Bruce's character was kind of laid back. But maybe that was on purpose; Bruce allowed the very talented Haley Joel Osment to take center stage. I've seen Haley in other projects and he always seems to stand out. I think Haley was the star of this movie. The actress who played his mother was also great as the divorced mom. I really loved that scene in the car between mother and son. Brought tears to my eyes. When I got home, I replayed all the scenes in my head and told myself that I wouldn't mind seeing it again (before it comes on cable or on video). And oh, what a great, and creative ending. If you haven't seen it yet, GET TO IT. You'll love it. Two thumbs up for this great movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must have seen every thriller ever made and none have left me so affected. I could easily say that I do not get scared at movies ... until now! Sixth Sense follows a child psychologist on a journey into the mind of a little boy who is labeled with paranoid schitzophrenic. Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crow, a doctor who was recently awarded a citation for his work. It is after a frightening encounter with a patient from his past that Crow meets Cole, a paranoid little boy in desperate need of a chewable prozac. M Night Shyamalan directs this brilliant film, slowly unraveling a secret that this boy is too frightened to face, and too unwilling to confess. We soon learn that this child can see ghosts, and Malcolm Crow might be the only person that can help him through his frightening ordeal. Haley Joel Osment, who plays the role of Cole, is so brilliant that I predict he will be nominated (and perhaps should win) an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding) does an admirable job playing the mother who can't understand what is happening to her son. Yes, this film has a shocking ending (brilliant, in fact) and don't dare let anyone ruin it for you. Go see this once to be scared, and again to let it sink in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this film would be a nice way to spend two hours. I didn't expect something so great. It was a pleasant surprise. First I must give kudos to the director. I have not seen anything he'd directed, or written prior to this, but he's proven with one movie that he's great in both fields. The direction of the film is marvelous. He creates an air to the film, it creeps you out, and may even scare you. He does this without millions of dollars in special effects, he simply does it with make-up, a great script, and great direction. The script isn't great just because it can creep you out however, nor is it the marvelous ending, instead it's the fact that the script plays the viewer like a piano. The writer/director makes us make these simple assumptions. Little things. Things so common that they don't need to be said, and then he has us slapping our forehead for making the assumption later. It's an excellent example that nothing is what it seems, and we should never assume. Truly excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How could I not add, this film is a classic, because its superlative story touches on timeless themes (the power of faith and of love, the cost of self-delusion), and because it is appropriate for nearly all ages (Hollywood, take note!). As frightening, as suspenseful, and even as romantic and as touching as this was at various times, it was always tastefully *and entertainingly* directed. Oscars should abound for this film in nearly every department. M. Night Shyamalan should be very proud of himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Sixth Sense" is definitely one for the DVD collection, but don't wait to see it on video. The audience reaction in a packed theater is part of the experience--and the theaters were packed both times that I saw this film. The fact that I would pay theater prices twice for the same film should be recommendation enough--go see it.Ideally, you should know absolutely nothing about this film going in. There are no spoilers here, but keep your mind open when you watch. "The Sixth Sense" is a chilling ghost tale, although not all of the ghosts are dead. This movie is about communication. Don't be a walking irony when you leave.The cinematography is excellent; it feels dark and creepy even in the daylight. And there are beautiful performances all around.

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is definitely the breakout movie of the year. It has stayed at number 1 four straight weeks at the box office (staying above the $20 million mark each time), has an excellent plot with a superb twist at the end, gives some Oscar-worthy performances, and the whole concept of it freaks the h-ll out of me. So, where should I begin? First things first: Who here agrees with me that Haley Joel Osment should get at least an Oscar nod for his spectacular role as playing nine year old Cole Sear, the troubled child who could see ghosts? I think several people could agree with me on that (including Entertainment Weekly, no doubt). I also think Bruce Willis gave the performance of his career as the child psychologist trying to recuperate from a past incident with another patient he couldn't cure, and is trying to fix his mistake through Cole. I also give M. Night Shyamalan all the credit in the world for writing AND directing this masterpiece of the movie. Going in, I expected your average movie: not good, but not bad either. I came out blown away by the surprise ending, the acting, the direction, the writing, the ghosts, just everything. One of my top picks for the year by far. My grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was fine the first time through, but appeared a little slow moving at times. The ending was great and done quite well. The second time through, the movie was fantastic, since the ending was already known, it made the movie even more interesting and I watched to see how the director had fooled me in the first viewing. The director did not pull any punches, the second time through the movie, I was flabbergasted that I had made assumptions the first time through and therefor made the same mistake as the doctor. Haley Joel Osment is fantastic and very convincing in this movie. Bruce Willis does an outstanding job also, but the show is stolen by Haley. The movie gives rise to a sequel or a fall season series. If you see this movie, see it at least twice to fully appreciate it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am so SPEECHLESS! I was totally BLOWN AWAY by "The Sixth Sense"! It is such a fabulous movie with heart pounding scenes with such an astounding plot! It went so very slow at first, but it got better as it went a long, and I was afraid that I was going to be disappointed, thinking, "Why did I even chose to go see this movie in the first place?"Yet later on, my mind changed, and I thought, "It was so worth it to see this!" And it was, it really was! I just got home from seeing this movie, and I am absolutely impressed and totally speechless by the brilliance this film has offered it's millions of viewers and the twisted, but creative imagination surrounding the film!I give lots of praise to Bruce Willis (Malcolm Crowe), Haley Joel Osment (Cole Sear, Toni Collette (Lynn Sear - Cole's mum), and the rest of the cast and crew who made this movie possible. Yet most of the praise has to go to it's brilliant director and writer, M. Night Shyamalan. I don't know what made him come up with such a creative and brilliant film such as "The Sixth Sense", but whatever it was, it earned him success and cheers everywhere around the world!If you haven't seen this movie, you MUST see it, especially if you love movies. I never wanted to see this movie at all, because I thought it was boring sounding. What made me go was the excellent reviews that the movie critics gave this film, and I thought that I should witness it myself. I'm really pleased that I did! This was an EXCELLENT movie, and if you didn't see it, you must go! You'll be impressed by what the film itself has to offer, but I think the coolest part was the ending when.....Oh, you probably didn't see it yet, whoever is reading this review now. But I won't tell you what happens, SO you are going to have to see it for yourself!!!! :o)Don't hesitate to see this movie yourself! This is movie WILL without a doubt BLOW YOU AWAY!!!!!</fullReview>

Bruce Willis is also very good in one of his best performances in a long time as Malcom Crowe, the child psychologist who feels the need to help Cole overcome his problem. The plot thickens at a time when you don't expect it and the ending will leave you breathless! Olivia Williams and Toni Collette are very good in their roles as well. I highly recommend this movie as entertaining, well written and directed, and well acted. More suspenseful and scarier than "Blair Witch". Run to the theater NOW!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't expected alot from this movie, but i truly loved it! Bruce Willis gives an amazing performance as Dr. Malcolm Crowe and Haley Joel Osment as eight-year old Cole Sear. I mainly liked it because it was so original. I got pretty freaked out with the vomiting little girl and the wife in the kitchen! There were some very humorous scenes, i loved the part when the big-shot actor of Cole's school Tommy Tommasimo got the part of the village idiot in the school play. And Cole finally realizes why he was given this gift. I'm not going through much detail cuz that would take too much of my time. But anyone who though "The Sixth Sense" was dumb needs to be shot in the head several times and they obviously have bad taste in thriller/drama movies. Go see "The Sixth Sense" tonight!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Sense Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent film! It reminded me of Fallen, (which I also liked a lot.) It is a little but scary at times, but not really a horror movie. (One person in the theater shrieked with fear at one point, but she must have been a jumpy individual.) Although there is plenty of suspense, this is a bit slower than Fallen, and lacks the struggle between good and evil. What it does have is a very clever and carefully thought out plot which you must be patient to absorb and fully appreciate.Bruce Willis does what he does best, which is play the husband who loves his wife very much but does not seem to have time for her because he is too busy helping people. The kid is good, and not annoying like Anikan.Do not see this movie if you are looking only for mindless fun to unwind some evening. You will probably still enjoy it, but it is a little bit intense at times. You may end up missing a lot too. (See Deep Blue Sea or American Pie the night you want to unwind. Those are good mindless fun.) Instead, see this movie on an evening when you are not completely stressed out and are willing to pay attention to details.I give it two sense up. ;)</fullReview>

Unless someone ruined the movie, there is no way you would ever guess it. The story is brilliant, the directing is well above average. But what most impressed me is the acting. The kid is one of the best actors I have ever seen. He is so totally believable! And Willis is amazing. He's not a hero, and he doesn't kill anybody. Instead he gives us a completely believable and sensitive performance. I hope he continues along this track. And I think we'll continue to see good things to come from Mr. Shyamalan.</fullReview>

Go see the film - don't let a soul tell you a thing about it and be prepared for a fantastic emotional ride. Bruce Willis once and for all shows that he can act without the use of a gun and a few explosions, he impressed me with his emotional side and pulled off a very believable part. As for Haley Joel Osment it is a pleasure to see a young actor rely on emotion and acting ability instead of "cuteness." If you can watch the emotionally torn and scared little Cole(Osment)and not want to jump up and shelter him with a hug run to the nearest hospital and have them look for your heart.SEE THIS MOVIE -then see it a second time and have your eyes reopened!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do agree this is a good film, with good acting, direction, photography and script. However, anybody who's familiar with the 1962 cult film Carnival Of Souls will immediately pick up on what's going on with The Sixth Sense story. I knew what was coming after the first half hour of the movie. But nevertheless, I enjoyed the film because it manages to be intelligent and compassionate while at the same time giving us a few good scares, without recurring to cheap shocks. I recommend it, and after you see it, check out Carnival Of Souls, and you'll be equally pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see the Sixth Sense with little knowledge except that it had gotten some very good word-of-mouth reactions. I hadn't even heard of it until the day it opened: I had never seen an ad or preview for it at all. Once I left the theater, my first reaction was: Wow! Writer/Director M. Night Shyamalan can be credited for a thoughtful script that deals intelligently with life and death. The performances are uniformly superb. Bruce Willis has never been regarded as much of an actor, but here he gives a nice understated performance that gives the film its weight. Toni Collette is very good as Cole's mom, frustrated over her inability to understand what her son is going through. Olivia Williams is wasted in a role that doesn't give her much to do. Donnie Wahlberg is great in his two minutes as a clinically depressed patient. Still, the film wouldn't work without the brilliant performance of little Haley Joel Osment, who gives one of the best performances of the year and perhaps one of the best child performances ever. This kid is great! He projects a great sorrow and pain in his role, and acts better than most seasoned actors. I hope that come the end of the year, he will have gotten a deserved Oscar nod. The years best so far(that will likely change, but for now, this is the one to see.)Four out of four stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I reluctantly saw the Sixth Sense. Over all the movie is good, with major kudos going to the boy. It was his charisma that carried the movie. I was thinking that this kid should have been Anakin Skywalker. Bruce Willis gave a good performance (and that is a very amazing statement). The plot was predictable. I saw it coming about 5 minutes into the movie. I then proceeded to watch the movie and was not swayed from my original guess. I kept waiting for the big "Shocker" at the end only to find out that it was my guess. Everything at the end was so neatly explained that I was let down.What was more of a "shocker" was the audience's reaction to the ending. I heard gasps, and one woman started to cry. Couldn't they see the sixty-two allusions to the secret? Oh well.The Blair Witch Project blew this movie out of the water with its creativity, acting, and unresolved yet appropriate ending. I would definitely recommend this movie as well as the BWP.This movie got 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine, important piece of filmmaking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the trailers and the posters advertised in the newspapers, my first reaction was, great. Another dumpy special effects bonanza with CGI ghosts, no plot, and bad acting. Just what we need. The critics rave reviews got me interested(they should advertise the movie). I went to see it, and was, to say the least, delighted with what I saw. I was deeply touched by it. It's not some scary monster movie with corny acting and CGI ghosts like the remake of "The Haunting". In fact, there isn't a single special effect in "The Sixth Sense". Not one. It doesn't need effects, because it's about facing the most frightening point of our lives, death. I walked out of the theater feeling the same way as I did when I came out of Roberto Benigni's "Life is Beautiful", and that was very happy. This is the first film about death that made me feel good, and ready to accept death at the time I may face it. "Ghost" is the wrong film to watch, because it made me scared of death. "The Seventh Seal" was about using the time you have left to live, so that didn't have a real positive impact on me either. "The Sixth Sense" did, and I was really happy about it. Despite it's 1 or 2 Hollywood cliches, "The Sixth Sense" is an important film for our lives because it teaches us to face death, to accept it, and to not be afraid. There were times in the movie when I thought to myself, why are the spirits the boy sees splattered with gore, blood, and muck? Is this supposed to scare us? Are blood and gore Hollywood's only idea of death? No. It's simply the way the spirits died. The tagline says, "Not every gift is a blessing". I disagree. I thought that the boy WAS blessed with a gift, yet he was frightened by it and he did not understand it. I think the advertising campaign needs to rethink their methods of advertising "The Sixth Sense", because they make it look like a stupid special effects fest, which it is not. I would remove some of the cliches here and there, and I still think "The Blair Witch Project" is the best film of the year. Still, I liked this film very much. I was deeply moved and touched by it. I think it's important that people see this film. It might change their lives!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See it! - even if you don't like "horror" movies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is one of the best movies I've ever seen, both technically and entertainment-wise.At least on first viewing, I did not see any holes in the plot or story-line - something that's very important to me in a good movie. For the story to work, you must believe that it is possible for someone to see ghosts. M. Night Shamalan wrote and directed this film in such a way that you can't walk away from the theatre saying "I might have believed this story, except that the kid or the doctor did such and such, or didn't do so and so, or did you notice how the ghosts did this or that..." Going back over the things the characters did and said, you find that everything matches up with the surprise ending perfectly - no holes.Haley's acting is incredible, Bruce Willis' is acceptable and improves as the movie continues. M. Night Shamalan did an outstanding job creating a different kind of a ghost story - just enough 'blood and guts' to call it a horror story, but more thought-provoking than anything else. Oh, by the way, bring a handkerchief or some tissues!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My 6 Cents on 6 Sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I had first saw the preview/ad for the 6th Sense, my immediate reaction was 1) another bad Bruce Willis sci-fi picture with a lot of hokey special effects and 2) what an amazing job they did on his hair. So I avoided it the first few weeks of release. Then I looked at the its box office totals and was shocked to see it not only number one but not losing much of its business. I also spoke to some friends who saw it and they said it was not what they expected it to be - go see it.So I went last night (by the way I saw a 640PM Thursday show in Manhattan and the medium sized theatre we were in was packed) and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. It is not quite the psychological terror/horror film I thought it was. Rather this movie is very thought provoking. Haley Joel Osment does a fantastic job as the boy Bruce Willis' character is trying to help. I think that his performance is certainly Oscar worthy. Bruce Willis is also very good in his very subdued ("Anti-Bruce") performance. Former New Kid on the Block Donnie Wahlberg also gives a very brief but powerful performance that sets the stage for the movie's plot. Go see this movie, unlike a couple of pictures I saw this summer, it does not disappoint and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Not as scary as the name or ads would leave you to believe (and you eventually get use to Bruce's hairdo).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A triumph of style and substance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense - ***Bruce Willis plays Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a gifted child psychologist down on his luck following the tragic suicide of a former patient. Dispirited, the good doctor finds himself burnt out and emotionally distant from his wife Anna (Olivia Williams.) Then along comes young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment,) an eight-year-old boy clearly struggling with inner demons. Cole's mother Lynn (Toni Collette) is having difficulty enough raising the boy on her own. It does not help that the child is shy, sullen, and prone to sudden fits of unexplained panic. Grasping for redemption, Dr. Crowe treats the troubled lad, eventually befriending him. For only when Crowe earns Cole's trust can the boy fully explain his secret. It would be wrong of me to divulge anything further. The rest of the movie's secrets I shall leave for you to discover.The Sixth Sense is a triumph of tone and ambiance. It manages to startle us, to make us grab the forearm of the person at our side, and to gasp at strategic moments. With the aid of cinematographer Tak Fujimoto (The Silence of the Lambs), director M. Night Shyamalan infuses every shot with dread and foreboding. In short, it is a highly successful thriller. Yet its most impressive accomplishment is that it does not skimp on drama. The movie is populated with three-dimensional characters that behave in real and honest ways. Take Toni Collette as the boy's mother. In a standard thriller, this character would be a throw-away, serving no purpose other than to complain to her son and disbelieve him at crucial points. But in The Sixth Sense, the mother is a concerned parent who is struggling to put food on the table and maintain her own sanity, much less the sanity of her son. She is a living, breathing person with strengths and weaknesses. As a result, we empathize with her. The same holds true for all of the supporting players, including the Doctor's neglected wife.The heart of the movie lies is the burgeoning friendship between Willis and Osment. It works wonderfully, thanks in large part to Osment's outstanding performance. Not since Radio Flyer and E.T. have I been so impressed with a young actor's abilities. When the boy is in the throes of a panic attack, you feel it. When he warily backs away from Dr. Crowe during their first meeting, you feel his hesitation as if it were your own. By his own standards, Bruce Willis turns in a relatively strong performance. It may lack the emotion of In Country and the flair of Death Becomes Her, but it is certainly two notches above his typical action work, such as his role in Striking Distance. One element that I found lacking for much of the film was the relationship between Crowe and his wife. Their estrangement seemed arbitrary, more a result of screenwriting necessity than of real life problems. By the picture's conclusion, however, this plot line was sewn up nicely.The film has a unique conclusion, which will have viewers discussing it in the lobby, in the car on the way home, and around the water cooler the next day. Some will love the ending. Most will be surprised by it, but some will not. I have mixed feelings in that while I found the final revelation to be intriguing, I wonder if it throws off the movie's delicate balance, sending it into standard thriller territory. The conclusion is not gimmicky, yet it is startling. The Sixth Sense is such a sincere and honest film that I question whether it needed that final twist. Oh, and I also saw it coming from a mile away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blair Witch? Boring! The Haunting? Horrible! The Sixth Sense? Sensational! This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I had heard, in the IMDB, recommendations to see the Sixth Sense instead of the B.W.P. Did I listen? Of course not. Do I regret it? YOU BET I DO! I am use to seeing Bruce Willis in violent movies. He actually does a great job as a serious, realistic character. Haley Joel Osment does a fantastic job portraying his character. The Sixth Sense is one of those thinker movies. One of those "Oh yeah!" movies. There is no gore, it doesn't really get cheesy, it's just, well.... good! I rate this movie B++, 79.999% See it if you haven't already.

		<shortDescription>A well-researched paranormal suspense thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An incredible film - the most suspenseful and frightening that I've seen in years. It's not a scary movie that's frightening because it's gross and disgusting. It's a scary movie that's simply scary, without special effects or excessive gore, which, to me, is the greatest kind of thriller that we see too little of these days._The Sixth Sense_ is exquisitely acted, written, and directed, with a score that brings the film chillingly to life. Bruce Willis (Malcolm Crowe) and Haley Joel Osment (Cole Sear) have a chemistry and power together that is utterly believable. Their performances almost make you suspend reality and believe that the characters are real people.Another thing that struck me is the attention to detail and the research that went into the storyline. Being a paranormal buff, the movie didn't look too promising as far as realistic paranormal investigation goes. However, the attention to free association writing, electronic voice phenomena, cold spots, a spirit's violent actions, and the stress the ability to "see dead people" puts on someone, especially a young child, was amazing. If you're into ghosts and the paranormal, this is definitely a film for you, and will strike you as being more than just "a scary movie."Just a word of warning: Don't let your guard down. If you don't like sudden parts, this may not be a movie for you. Go with a friend or family member who's already seen it and can tell you if something is sudden is going to happen. I usually don't like movies with any sudden parts, but I think this film, without that suspense, would not nearly be as good.I don't think there was anything that I didn't like about the movie... it's most definitely worth the ticket price and should be seen on the big screen in order to get the full effect, like _The Haunting_. I guarantee the story will keep you on the edge of your seat, and the ending will shock you - Everyone says it, don't think it's hype. It really will. I also guarantee you'll fall in love with young Haley Joel Osment, and his performance as Cole Sear. This is a fantastic movie certainly worth seeing in the theatres.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bruce Willis plays troubled child psychologist Malcom Crowe, and young Haley Joel Osment is Cole Sear, his patient, a disturbed nine-year-old who sees ghosts. Slowly Crowe gains young Cole's trust; and just as slowly Cole gains Crowe's trust. Therein lies the heart of this extraordinary film--for both individuals, when the film is over, have healed each other. And that's what the film is about--recirpocal healing. Willis gives his best performance since In Country, and young Osment is a revelation. The lad should be nominated for 1999's Best Actor. What a performance! The Sixth Sense isn't a horror film. The Sixth Sense isn't merely a ghost story. It's more: It's a terrific, riveting film, one the viewer will think about long after it's over. Final words: The wonderful twist at the end alters the film's entire meaning; and the name M. Night Shyamala should be kept in mind: He has directed and written the summer's best film.</fullReview>

If The 6th Sense doesn't go down in history as one of the best in the horror/thriller genre, it would only be because it is so difficult to find the proper genre in which to pigeonhole this movie. It hasn't been since Rushmore that I've sat through a movie (in a mainstream theater) and thought to myself as the film was running, "this is a very good movie...". The acting in this film is great. The kid is phenomenal. The images are suitably eerie at times and the soundtrack is as well.

And if neither of them surprised or shocked you, then you will know how I felt after watching this trash. There is nothing scary, enlightening or moving about this film.

		<fullReview>Not only does this movie deliver a knock-out punch at the end, but the punch is from the left, totally unexpected.My advice about this movie...never, ever, let your guard down. This movie does not use cheap special effects to get its point across, but rather, a tight, concise dialog that works from beginning to end. There is no fat here, it makes you work, and it makes you think. The use of lighting and camera technique worked well and added to the intensity of the film."I can see Dead people..." Indeed. However, some of those dead people are more scary than others, again, not giving away that left-handed punch line if you haven't seen it."Ever feel the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, or the hairs on your arm, when it gets cold, it's them, they're angry..." Those sensations will NEVER be the same after you've seen this movie.While Bruce Willis' performance is Oscar worthy, it is the littlest player who steals the show. James Van Praagh indeed.Go see this movie!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see The Sixth Sense recently and I was very surprised at how the story was pulled off. Surprised in a very good way, I must say. I thought it was great how the writers took horror to another level, unlike scream etc... I must admit that I almost screamed 4 or 5 times during the movie, even though a lot of people have said that it isn't scary at all. The story was very interesting and the actors were great. I applaud Haley Joel Osment for his brilliant performance and I do the same for Bruce Willis', who should try to make more movies like this one before going back to his bang bang action movies. I loved the twist at the end of the movie and unlike other people, I didn't see it coming at all. Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10, and you should know that it is not too often that I give out 10s. So go see the movie!!! It is well worth it!</fullReview>

Only later, as reflecting on the surprise ending, does one begin to appreciate the true nature of the entire story and the way the director has given you clues all along that are subtle enough to completely pass you by. You will find yourself reviewing in your minds eye, scenes of the movie that at the time seemed a little "off" but only after the ending and with review, made sense.

		<fullReview>[Editor's note: this comment contains a minor SPOILER]The Sixth Sense is a very good film. Had it not been for it's unarguably clever and surprising ending, it would have been fairy entertaining, by the numbers fare. But the finale does elevate it past that level. However, even with that surprise, the film felt oddly incomplete to me.The film's problem doesn't lie in it's acting. All performances are solid (although the great Olivia Williams is criminally under-used). Toni Collette was especially winning in her role as the Coles Sear's (Joey Hale Osmont) mother. The scene towards the end, when Cole shares his secret with her, it the most touching of the film. An unrecognizable Donnie Osmond gives a very brief, yet powerful performance as well. Bruce Willis and the child (whose name I may have incorrect about) are also good, but their performances are one note. Willis is believeable as the pensive, clever doctor but, with a few exceptions, never really emotes seriously. Osment's performance is perhaps the most overrated aspect of the film. I will be seeing this film again, and will try to pay more attention to him, but after my initial viewing, I wondered what all the fuss was about. True, he does a good job with the interesting character, but he never comes out of his disturbed, whispering mode.Set in Philadelphia in the fall, the atmosphere of the film is successfully bleak and eerie. The chills, when they come, are very well done and will make you jump, but they're awfully spread out (the first hour of the film, for the most part, was dull)The main distraction for me, however, was that the film aspired to be more than it really was. Willis and Osment meet for the first time, in a church. This church is used a few times throughout the film, but there really is no point to it. The spirituality of the sixth sense and of the character who has it is never explained throughout the film. Also, I wish they had elaborated more on the divorce of the boy's parents. It could have given more insight on both the mother and her son.For the most part, Sixth Sense, was an very well done film. Very well worth the price of admission. However it had a big weakness-it hinted at several thing but never really explained them. 3/4 or 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting, but see Blair Witch if you want a scare...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw this movie after many of my friends and acquaintances showered it with compliments. Keep in mind that this is after I've already seen Blair Witch, which was incredible (not to mention terrifying).The Sixth Sense's shining star (say that 5 times fast) was Haley Joel Osment, who played a leading role as Cole Sear. This young actor is BRILLIANT. It always gets me when certain children can grasp the rules of the stage so easily. I was stunned by his incredible performance as the troubled boy, Cole Sear, who "sees dead people" and who is passed off as schizophrenic or delusional. He can trust no psychologist, and his paranoia has many reasons.An award-winning psychologist, however, slowly wins this boy's trust. Bruce Willis, playing Dr. Malcolm Crowe, actually surprised me in the nature of his performance. Yes, we all know Bruce Willis as the blood-and-grime-streaked action hero-- but in The Sixth Sense, he is uncharacteristically good as this very caring psychologist, who is marred by a terrible tragedy. (I cannot reveal what this is or I'd spoil an important part of the movie.)Malcolm is so dedicated to his work as a child psychologist that he begins to forget about spending time with his wife, and having a life of his own again. This may seem trite and overdone in most movies, but is a serious problem in real life and is portrayed fairly well here. Cole must convince Malcolm to help him (believing Malcolm is the only one who will be able to rid him of the ghosts) but this forces Dr. Crowe to decide between his work with Cole... or his own family.M. Night Shyamalan did well with the plot in that it hasn't been done much before, but the movie absolutely did not succeed in being scary (if that was his intent). It was so utterly obvious when something frightening was going to happen, because the music would increase in volume up until the event for somewhere around a whole minute. It wasn't even FUNNY, like in Scream. I do usually like James Newton Howard's scores; ER, The Fugitive and Flatliners are wonderful, but I guess it's not really his fault he had to do some of the things he did in Sixth Sense. This blatant, failed attempt at suspense totally brought my rating of this movie down, just because it was so overdone. There were a few tear-jerking minutes in the movie, and the ending was actually a little surprising (the ONLY suspenseful part in the movie). There's a big "yeah, right" factor in certain parts as well, think about it if you've seen the movie. Overall though, I'd say it was a fairly good movie, especially because of young Mr. Osment. He is destined for great things... I'd rate this movie a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hesitate to give this film a glowing review for only one reason. I want everyone to experience it the way I did, which is with little or no expectations. Even then, it is slow for almost an hour and I was wondering why it was doing so well at the box office. Well hang around until the end and you will know.The performances are brilliant - as everyone has mentioned - especially the boy, and it is Bruce's finest performance since 12 Monkeys.Kudos to the director for not using cheap cheesy effects to scare us, the mental part was enough to grip me.I see Oscar nominations for at least the script and maybe picture and supporting actor, but don't let that affect you. Go into it expecting little (if you still can) and you will be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

Finally I got the same chills that night in bed as I did when I was a kid after seeing a frightening movie. I thought that the direction, the script, and the acting was superb, and I wish that the trailer to the film hadn't given so much away.

This is one of those movies that doesn't rely on blood and crap to give you chills! oh man, it was great! GO SEE IT! Don't let anyone tell you the ending.

		<fullReview>Blown away is the proper term for my reaction to this movie.It left me amazed at the talent of the actors/actresses and the crew.It has been a long time since a movie kept me talking a mulling over the scenes in my head hours after the movie was done.This is an absolute masterpiece.Bruce Willis was unbelievable.He pulled me in front the get go.I was so happy he made this movie.Haley Joel Osment was spectacular as the young lad who saw dead people.He seemed to be plagued by this unwelcomed gift.It actually scared me enough to make me jump a few times.Not necessarily from the images (though they were gruesome at times) but the mere suggestion that someone or something was there.This movie kept me guessing all the way to the end.And after it was over,my husband and I would go back through the scenes in our head..This movie is worthy of an award,and I am definitely going to look for the next project that Mr. M. Night Shyamalan is working on.This was an amazing piece.By far worth the $14 we spent to see it.I absolutely recommend this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This ridiculous, contrived, and artless bore of a movie, in one of its countless aesthetic miscalculations, mistakes a stately pace for depth and profundity. It rises above the typical summer film pap for a single reason -- it thinks it has Ideas about Big Issues. It automatically plunges back to a suitable level, however, as it demonstrates this broad lack of ideas at an interminable pace.The makers of this shallow dreck seem to think they have made a thinking person's summer popcorn movie about Death, and The American Family, and Love, and The Breakdown Of The American Family, and The Loss Of Love. But really, it's just another jumble of the same old crap: cardboard characters in prefab situations, behaving as they do because the plot needs them to, not for any intrinsic reason, and not -- resolutely not -- with any underlying impulse or motivation.Aside from its laughably sophomoric spiritual pose, The Sixth Sense is also shoddily constructed. Most of the scenes are either fake and stagey, redundant, irrelevant, obvious, or all of the above, and they are edited together with the sloppiest imprecision. There is no sense of drama, mystery or anything else.Although some of the imagery is imaginative and the production design is superb, they are placed in the service of an inert, smug and witless vision, presumably that of its writer/director. This unintentionally comic garbage makes "Jacob's Ladder" look like Bergman.The Sixth Sense is strictly for amateurs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually don't like horror movies (with a few exceptions) but after I heard about the Sixth Sense I decided to see it. Once the movie started, I was completely absorbed in it... yeah, it was a bit "slow" if you're used to the MTV style wham-bang action/horror movies, but I consider this one great drama/suspense. The first thing that came to my mind was how good the dialogue was. So much subtext, and the characterization was just wonderful. This movie has the same feel of "Seven" and both have become my favorite Horrordrama, with similar endings that mesmerize me.The acting is excellent! The plot can seem confusing at times but at the end, when you think about it, it makes sense.Some people are bored by the "slow" pace but I think they miss the point. It's not an action/horror movie. It is more of a drama with strong message about people and family and love. Some people, upon knowing about a trick ending, tend to try too hard to "predict" it and when they do, it takes away the pure joy of seeing the movie and not expecting anything. they are too smart for their own good. It is like going to to beach and watch a sunset and get bored by it because you know all about it... you are missing out of the joy of discovering something, or merely experiencing it.If you like a good story, good acting, and solid movie making, then the sixth sense is highly recommended.</fullReview>

But, ten minutes into the story, everyone was equally enthralled and spellbound. Even following the credits, as people were filing out, there was only thoughtful conversation and a sense that something amazing had taken place: we'd been treated with respect. Now, that's RARE!And the 'surprise' ending. There's been so much talk, I couldn't help 'figure it out' early on. But that only made the film much richer, as I began noticing so many subtle details. And it only serves the story. It's also amazing to see such a 'star' asBruce Willis playing support to a child.

Master Osment is sure to be around for years to come. I watched him on the Jeff Foxworthy show and he was good then. He's twice as talented now. Can't wait for his next project. But most of all congrates to Mr. Shyamalan. I will be looking for his work in the future and in the video stores.</fullReview>

The story was suspenseful and moving, and the acting, without exception, was superb. I have always avoided Bruce Willis films because I believed he couldn't act, but I've been very wrong. His performance moved me to tears. And if Haley Joel Osment does not get an Oscar nomination, I will boycott the awards! I just loved everything about this film, especially the ending, and I will see it again. It is by far the best film I have seen so far this year. No one should miss it!I do have only one small complaint - why is it so many films find they need to include a scene where one of the characters vomits on screen? I understand the scene's contribution to the story in this case, but these scenes really make me physically sick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mother more compelling than shrink</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming into Sixth Sense I expected a movie about a boy who sees dead people while those around him don't, and the shrink who tries to help him. That was as much as I had allowed myself to absorb.Osment's performance as isolated little Cole, whose only anchor is his mother, was quite touching. Osment's stillness for the camera, his prolonged moments of gravity and wide-eyed stares served as acute counterpoints to his contemporaries' careless, energetic tumblings. The lingering shots on Osment's smallest twitch and occasional tear-welling eyes allowed his talent to shine through wonderfully . He has remarkable control. I don't know if I say this in light of the fact that he's a child, or regardless of the fact that he's a child.I found Cole's relationship with his mother to be much more compelling than Cole's relationship with Malcolm Crowe (Willis). The most real moments for me were those in which Cole's mother brushes past inexplicable manifestations of Cole's affliction/curse/gift -- when she senses something out-of-the-ordinary and yet refuses to acknowledge them, perhaps because to do so would be to brand Cole as the freak that his peers accuse him of being. These moments of almost-acknowledgment made me wonder how I would react to proof of something outside of science, something that common sense tells me shouldn't be possible, shouldn't be happening, but is. This is the underlying ambition of a lot of scary movies; Sixth Sense succeeds in raising this what-if question more than any other offering in the same genre that I've seen in the last couple of years. The first instance is when Cole's mother leaves the kitchen for an instance only to return to find every single one of the kitchen drawers and cabinets opened and pulled out, and Cole sitting with his hands plastered to the kitchen table. No sound had been made in her absence; there was no way Cole could have pulled that stunt by himself, and no discernible reason for him to do so even if he could. So what could have happened? Cole's mother deflects any possibility of supernatural agents by saying, "Baby, were you looking for something?" To which Cole mumbles "Pop tarts."On the flip side of love and protectiveness, Cole, in his turn, seeks to protect his mother from what he perceives as his curse, his freakishness. Cole's deep love and feelings of protectiveness towards his mother mirror her feelings towards him but with a much different impact coming from a young and vulnerable child. Osment's portrayal of adult responsibilities in a small, fragile package, his taking over, in a weird way, of the parenting role with his mother, made him an even more sympathetic character.Willis as Malcolm Crowe. Perhaps it's me bringing my baggage of Willis from his days in Moonlighting (tv series) and his action flicks (Die Hard, Armageddon etc.) but Willis' face is forever associated with a little half-quirk of the lips and a twinkle in the eyes, or a kick-ass frown and smirk. Willis playing the pensive psychiatrist just came across to me as wooden. It was very quiet, very still, but not very confidence-inspiring. I didn't buy Cole's gradual conversion to Crowe from his initial sprint to the church to his eventual heartfelt confessions.Having Cole come to resolution with his curse/gift through the guidance of Crowe made sense in that Cole's mother was unable to acknowledge her son's difference, but it was not altogether convincing. Nevertheless, a REALLY good movie, and one that made me hide my eyes until the ghosts were gone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan has outdone himself. The script is sensitive in its subject matter and intricate in its plotting. Outstanding direction and visually engrossing cinematography (- the mood is established from the first shot). I was so enraptured by the storytelling and pace that I didn't see where the plot was headed. Each scene has definite purpose and gives us further insight into the characters.Simply the best movie I've seen this year (1999). Haley Joel Osment deserves an Oscar nomination. This is not an easy role for a kid to play and he holds his own in every scene w/Mr. Willis. Little Haley Joel supposedly made the director cry while delivering his lines. That is powerful acting. I would rate his performance among the best by a young actor, ranking close to Leonardo Dicaprio in "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" and Anna Paquin in "The Piano."If you haven't seen this film, and I suspect there will be a few that decide not to go, I urge you to go see it even if you are averse to the "horror genre". While the thrills are plenty, there are also moving human stories beneath the surface.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie. It was perhaps not fair to The Sixth Sense that the night before I rented "Seven" and was on the edge of my seat the entire time (if you haven't seen Seven yet, rent it!), so this film was probably unfairly influenced by my having seen an incredibly tightly written and acted thriller the night before. Still, The Sixth Sense is a fine movie with plenty of psychological suspense. I liked the premise -- that the spirits of dead people can communicate with certain "chosen" ones among us -- and the ending is indeed totally unexpected, as I'd read on this site. The young actor who plays Cole, Haley Joel Osment, was excellent in portraying a terrified child who doesn't want the gift he was born with, and even Bruce Willis was decent (I don't usually like Willis's acting, which I think is typically one dimensional, not to mention his trade-mark smirk). I give The Sixth Sense 7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A character driven, chilling movie. It is rare to find heart and Soul in any recent film, The Sixth Sense renewed my interest in going to the movies. It doesn't worry about being new, cute, breaking new effects, or splatter. The hugely positive audience response shows that well thought out ideas with fully realized character will still draw audiences in. My theatre was packed with teens the day before school resumed, they talked and giggled for awhile, but utter stillness slowly pervaded the darkness. The scares sucked us in, but the intense feelings between characters amplified that first goosebump into a lasting chill. Even if you figured out the ending, it is the precise execution that make this a killergood movie. I will lose faith in the Academy if they overlook Osment's amazing performance. Most child actors are only able to become a blank slate for the audience to project feeling onto--Anna Paquin in The Piano--and that is no mean achievement for actor and director. But Osment creates a subtle and stricken character, it is his constant intensity that ignites our fear. Loved this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horror? This film has ghosts, sure, but more along the lines of an x-files episode, not Poltergeist. Action? no...it does have Bruce Willis in it, but no action. Thriller? This fits somewhat. Suspense? Ditto. Romance? In the end. Drama? My vote.You can't really pigeon-hole this movie into one category(and those who claim it's "horror" need to get out more). Do not miss this movie, go see it before someone ruins it for you. Stop reading the reviews, both pro and amateur. Stop asking your friends and co-workers. Make some calls, bring a group TONIGHT(no takers? Go alone, DON'T WAIT). Plan on going somewhere for coffee afterwards(you'll want to talk afterwards). The ad-people promoting this film made sure not to give away any more than they had to, and you should see it without any other information. Don't even expect it to be a good movie.

		<fullReview>First, this is a great film. Wasn't expecting the ghosts (fortunately, I did not see the trailer), so they really scared the pants off of me. In fact, I had to come to the office alone the day after I saw the film (a Sunday), and I really got the heebie-jeebies. And it's not easy to get a 30-year old man creeped out, I tell you.However, I didn't find the twist THAT unexpected. I was told there was a twist, and if you're a movie freak like me, your mind goes into overdrive while the movie progresses trying to figure it out. Anyway, I figured it out and the ending had less of an impact on me, but nothing can take away the fact that it was a great movie overall."Planet of the Apes" and "The Game" - now those were movies that really caught me in the end (I figured out "Usual Suspects"'s ending too).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another bad Bruce Willis movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie (paid $9.50) on the advice of other people. I felt like leaving 30 mins into the movie. Three things killed the movie 1. The kid in the movie (I forget his name) drove me crazy. He needs to change his whispering and try to act. Typical one liners ("I see dead people", "Make them go away"). 2. It wasn't scary, laughable! 3. Bruce Willis. This belongs in the corner of the video store with other Bruce classics like: Jackal, Mercury Rising, The Siege, Last Man Standing, Color of Night, Striking Distance, Hudson Hawk, Death Becomes Her, Bonfire of the Vanities, Sixth SenseSixth Sense seems to fit perfectly!!!g-bucks</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie. It was perhaps not fair to The Sixth Sense that the night before I rented "Seven" and was on the edge of my seat the entire time (if you haven't seen Seven yet, rent it!), so this film was probably unfairly influenced by my having seen an incredibly tightly written and acted thriller the night before. Still, The Sixth Sense is a fine movie with plenty of psychological suspense. I liked the premise -- that the spirits of dead people can communicate with certain "chosen" ones among us -- and the ending is indeed totally unexpected, as I'd read on this site. The young actor who plays Cole, Haley Joel Osment, was excellent in portraying a terrified child who doesn't want the gift he was born with, and even Bruce Willis was decent (I don't usually like Willis's acting, which I think is typically one dimensional, not to mention his trade-mark smirk). I give The Sixth Sense 7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a film worth seven bucks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A character driven, chilling movie. It is rare to find heart and Soul in any recent film, The Sixth Sense renewed my interest in going to the movies. It doesn't worry about being new, cute, breaking new effects, or splatter. The hugely positive audience response shows that well thought out ideas with fully realized character will still draw audiences in. My theatre was packed with teens the day before school resumed, they talked and giggled for awhile, but utter stillness slowly pervaded the darkness. The scares sucked us in, but the intense feelings between characters amplified that first goosebump into a lasting chill. Even if you figured out the ending, it is the precise execution that make this a killergood movie. I will lose faith in the Academy if they overlook Osment's amazing performance. Most child actors are only able to become a blank slate for the audience to project feeling onto--Anna Paquin in The Piano--and that is no mean achievement for actor and director. But Osment creates a subtle and stricken character, it is his constant intensity that ignites our fear. Loved this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Combining elements of drama, thriller, and horror, this film could easily have been a muddled disaster. Indeed, the trailer didn't give a good impression of which type of movie to expect. Happily, the blend works beautifully, mostly thanks to the unbelievably mature performance of 11-year-old Osment and an amazing ending that will make you want to watch the movie all over again.The film opens with a harrowing scene that sets the tone for some of the more disturbing images to come. Successful child psychiatrist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Willis) and his wife (Williams) are celebrating at home after he wins an award, when they are accosted by Vincent Grey (an emaciated and very frightening Wahlberg), a former patient who blames Crowe for failing to help him. The deranged Vincent first shoots Crowe in the stomach, then kills himself. Fast forward to Crowe meeting Cole Sear (Osment, best known as the son of Forrest Gump and last seen in Bogus), a young boy who suffers from the same type of "mood disorder" that Vincent did. Gaining the tormented child's confidence, Crowe eventually discovers that Cole thinks he is being visited by "dead people." Crowe's initial skepticism gives way after he hears something strange on an old tape recording of a session with Vincent. Together, he and Cole try to discover a reason for the visitations so that Cole won't have to live in fear any more. Meanwhile, his obsession with the boy threatens to derail his marriage as his wife becomes increasingly distant.The Sixth Sense works because it plays out like a really good short story. The more dramatic moments are emotionally engaging, and humor is used to complement them. The brief scenes involving ghosts are quite creepy (thanks to their generally shocking nature and some fine makeup by Stan Winston). The characters of Cole and Crowe are well-developed, and convincingly portrayed. Willis, coming off the disappointing Mercury Rising, gives the man-helps-wunderkind premise another go, and this time he comes out a winner with an unexpectedly warm performance. Williams is used sparingly, but serves the story well. Collette is also effective as Cole's beleaguered mother. Best of all, though, is Osment. He gives Cole both the haunted maturity and wide-eyed terror needed to play a boy who is routinely subjected to horrific encounters with wronged ghosts. Given his tender age, he is almost impossibly good, certainly good enough to merit Oscar consideration. He and Willis work well together; there is a quirky chemistry between them that makes for some funny moments in the film.Director M. Night Shyamalan (whose Dickensian name somehow fits this movie perfectly) once again explores the reactions of young children to traumatic events-- basically the same territory he covered in 1998's Wide Awake (which featured a similarly adult performance by young Joseph Cross). At only 28, Shyamalan has already developed a strong style as both a writer and director. Even in the slower moments, The Sixth Sense has enough intensity to keep things interesting, and it is capped off by a twist ending that is wickedly clever without seeming contrived.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night and have never been so emotionally and physically affected by one movie in my entire life. It wasn't even the terror it installed in me or even the pity I had for the little boy, that made me actually sick to my stomach. It was the raw emotion in the acting and the images on the screen. I just wish that I had waited and rented this movie so I wouldn't have to sit in a theatre full of people who didn't like the uncomfortable and upsetting feelings and giggled uncertainly at the little boy with the hole in the back of his head. Oh yes, America, go ahead. Laugh at the dead little boy skipping off to find his father's gun. Oh isn't he SO amusing. F**k you all. anyways . . . moving on. :)I was stunned by the beautiful and sickening (in the good way) displays of raw emotion in the movie. I had expected it to be just like "a scary movie." And sure there were times that it scared the hell out of me, but most often it made me cry. The first ghost, the woman in the kitchen was by far the most effective. When she whirled around screaming "No, dinner isn't ready yet, and you can't hurt me anymore!" I burst into uncontrollable sobs while the guy next to me laughed confusedly. The acting was so amazing, not only with stunning performances by the boy and child psychiatrist but the dead people too. I was haunted all night by the face of the little girl crouched under her bed and by the screams of the man trapped in the room. I left the theatre with a pounding headache, a gut wrenching stomach ache and images of the dead and suffering burned into my head. I went home and wished for once that I was one of those desenstized Americans who could see someone mentally decompose and giggle. I wanted to forget the feelings that I'd had. I wanted to be able to sleep. This movie is one of the best movies I have seen. With ingenius camera angles and images and the best acting I have seen in a film since SLC Punk! it is a haunting movie that will hopefully move you in ways you've never been moved before.</fullReview>

Bruce Willis is proving again that he can be at the top quality level and that young boy is simply excellent. Remember his name and follow his career, he'll go far. He has that emotional quality that only great actors can achieve. An excellent evening, a wonderful movie.</fullReview>

But in the last 10 minutes, when I "figured out" the movie, I felt cheated. I had seen this movie already. Twice! I won't print here what the movies are, for fear of giving away the silly plot twist, but I felt ripped off.And Bruce Willis is a really bad actor. He only plays one role; Bruce Willis.

		<shortDescription>The twist(s) are the CLINCHER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie surprised me. I was not anxious to see it due to the subject matter and genre. But, friends persuaded me to go and I'm glad I did. The scenes with the dead were not pleasant but the last half of the movie made up for it. I was not expecting to cry and I was not expecting the big plot twist at the end. And everyone that has seen this movie has had the same response I had. You playback the scenes to put the puzzle pieces in place.NO ONE should divulge the secrets at the end of this movie. Everyone should have the opportunity to experience it without the benefit of a clue. Recently, a girl at work revealed the ending of "Blair Witch Project" - now I have no desire to see it. Why should I? I know what happens now! One of the sad facts about movies today is that they are so predictable, you could have written it yourself and gotten the million dollar paycheck! The director/writer of this movie deserves both of his paychecks! He broke the mold! GO SEE THE SIXTH SENSE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't help but feel incredibly let down as I left the theatre after this one. Many aspects of this film were certainly above average but I fail to see how this could be considered a classic many years from now or even one of the best films of the year. The films un-doing lies in its ending. At the moment when that key element of the plot falls into place it certainly does seem interesting. Yet, as soon as one begins to think about it and its repercussions on the plot, the film comes to pieces. If the film had chosen a logical ending to fill in the stories more than obvious holes, I might have felt not quite as cheated. If u really must go see it, pay attention to Haley Joel Osments performance, definitely one of the least annoying from a child actor. A very generous 5/10.</fullReview>

It wasn't even the terror it installed in me or even the pity I had for the little boy, that made me actually sick to my stomach. It was the raw emotion in the acting and the images on the screen. I just wish that I had waited and rented this movie so I wouldn't have to sit in a theatre full of people who didn't like the uncomfortable and upsetting feelings and giggled uncertainly at the little boy with the hole in the back of his head. Oh yes, America, go ahead. Laugh at the dead little boy skipping off to find his father's gun. Oh isn't he SO amusing. F**k you all. anyways . . . moving on. :)I was stunned by the beautiful and sickening (in the good way) displays of raw emotion in the movie. I had expected it to be just like "a scary movie."

		<fullReview>Thank God Hollywood is finally beginning to understand that not all of the movie going public are pre-pubescent thrill seekers hypnotized by the sight of gore, slime, breasts and entrails. The Sixth Sense is a rare treat from the Cookie Cutter film industry. Bruce Willis is great; Haley Joel Osment is great; Toni Collette is great. This is one of the few times in many years that I have left a theater feeling that my money was well spent. In the Horror/Supernatural film genre, this film (along with Blair Witch) stands out like a sparkling jewel.</fullReview>

My wife and/or I can usually figure out a movie's ending before it ends, but NOT THIS ONE! We were so impressed with the way everything that happened throughout all made sense by the end, and that all the little bits (the "clues") throughout hung together to support the ending, unlike the "flaws" in the plots of most so-called "intelligent" movies these days. And all of the characters were so well established. We loved it. Please go see this one if you like to use your brain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked into the theater expecting a rush at your face horror film but was taken by surprise by one of the most warm-hearted thought provoking movies I've seen in a few years. Bruce Willis and young Haley are quite a team - watching them work together was a pleasure. They played off each other so well I almost forgot I was watching actors at work and was swept into the scenes with them. If young Haley doesn't make you want to sweep him into your arms and protect him you need to rush to the nearest hospital and check your heart!! If you see one movie this year this should be it. Not one for young kids but if you are open minded and wish to think out the plot line without it being shoved in your face this will be a winner for you also. It's nice for a change to see the studio's giving the public credit for having minds - I love a movie that leaves you thinking. Go watch and see what a few plot twists, great acting, and fantastic directing can give you. P.S. anyone who spoils the ending should be beaten with a wet noodle.</fullReview>

I had no clue! Not to mention the ending ruled. The end reminded me of Shawshank Redemption, you just have no idea its coming. The acting is very solid. The young boy in the film is incredible. And a commendable performance from Donny Wahlberg in this movie. He's only in the movie for about 3-4 minutes tops but he makes his point very well. Bruce Willis is solid. Nothing spectacular. The director knew just how to get your hair standing on end. Chilling. Good stuff. Go see it now. Then come back and give it a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want blood, guts and gore. Don't see this film. If you want to have the plot thrown in your face. Don't see this film. If you want to think about what's going on. Don't see this film.Sixth Sense is a thriller that is meant to make you use your mind. If you don't understand how a true psychological thriller works, you'll never understand the concept of this film. If you do, you will be amazed and pleased with it. It doesn't throw junk in your face which is a breath of fresh air after the bunch of boringly blatant horror flicks that have been released recently. The acting is superb by all main characters! Yes, I know it is a surprise that it is Bruce Willis but the guy can actually act in a serious role if given a chance which he has with Sixth. Haley would probably have been a much better Anakin and Toni creates a wonderful mother on the edge.For those of you who hated this film, please learn to think instead of react all the time. Sometimes you just have to use your brain to be entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into the movie I thought that this was going to your typical horror movie. When you first see the commercials for this movie you are to assume that the ghosts the little boys sees are evil. As you watch the movie you feel that this assumption is in correct. The little boy becomes horrified by the images he is forced to watch. The ghosts all have minds of their own. These aren't the typical ghosts we are so used to seeing in films. All of them walk around not even knowing they are dead. That is what scares the little boy through out the entire film. Why I liked this film was because of its originality. Yes there have been films about people talking to ghosts. But never have we seen "talking to ghosts" so dark, gritty, eerie, and real as this film. For instance, the movie, Ghost, where a man dies and comes back to figure out the reason for his death and to help his love in fear of her demise as well in the process. That movie was scary in its own way but also had light hearted humor. It also had the subplot of true love. Six sense on the other hand I feel is the complete opposite from Ghost. True both movies do have the same premise. But as I said Six sense took the whole idea of talking to the dead to a different level as Ghost did. Instead of making light hearted jokes that amused you, like Ghost, it made fun of people and also made u feel bad laughing at them (example the couple buying the wedding ring). and I would also like to point out the movie did have a few faults to it, and a few holes, but overall I felt that this was a very good film and very original. It has made a very good addition to the horror genre . Even though I feel it has many other aspects to it than just being a horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awesome film, with great acting, an engrossing story, and an ending from way left field</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This summer is a great one for movies. After the first Star Wars film in 15 years, two awesome comedies in Austin Powers 2 and South Park, and two great horror films (Blair Witch and The Haunting), the Sixth Sense comes out - and continues the trend. Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment both turn in excellent performances. There needs to be a Child Actor Oscar created just for Osment; he is fantastic as young Cole Sear, a child who sees ghosts everywhere he goes. Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crowe; a child psychologist discouraged by his one failure, with a case that bears a striking resemblance to Cole's.The film grabs you right from the start, and doesn't let go until the end. Although billed as a horror movie, the scares don't really start until about halfway through, when Cole's ghosts become visible to the audience. And they're sufficiently creepy - real people bearing the marks of their deaths, as opposed to the translucent shapes of The Haunting. The ghost-story elements are all there, in both the actions of the spirits and their effects (the cold, the feeling of falling while standing still), lending this film much more credibility than The Haunting - ghost story fans will not be disappointed.Malcolm has his hands full trying to help Cole overcome his fear of the apparitions and try to come to terms with his ability to see them, but as a result his home life collapses as he drifts further and further from his wife. Ironically, his patient becomes the doctor, helping Malcolm to try to patch things up. The two work superbly together throughout the movie in fact.The ending, when it comes, is a complete surprise, from so far out of left field it practically skirts the foul line. I was left with my jaw in my lap as the credits rolled. The Sixth Sense stacks up as one of the best ghost movies I've ever seen, and certainly one of the best movies of the summer. Stick it on your must see list, right alongside The Blair Witch Project.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trailers for this film piqued my interest only slightly; to me, it looked like another generic ghost/horror story. Thank god my boyfriend insisted upon seeing it, because frankly I can't remember the last time I saw such an intriguing and well done film. The actors are wonderful, not to mention the little boy. This is no Macaulay Culkin; he is nothing less than believable, and his rivetingly palpable terror will draw you in. The story can be just a tad slow at times, and you're not always sure where the film is going. However, there are quite a number of refreshingly unexpected twists, and the ending shocked even jaded me.I rarely get excited by movies, but I left _The Sixth Sense_ absolutely exhilarated. This is a must-see, and anyone who tells you otherwise is dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Haley Joel Osment should be nominated for an Academy Award for his performance, and not in the "Supporting" category either. He carried this film on his little shoulders, and was amazingly effective.Bruce Willis was also amazing. Tender and sweet, a complete turnaround from his trademark smart-ass. I would imagine that being the father of three in "real life" gave him some insight to this role; I don't know that we would have seen this from him ten years ago.In a supporting role, Toni Collette was also terrific. Donnie Wahlberg is unrecognizable as the mixed-up grown-up former patient in his underwear with a gun (don't ask).And yes, the ending, the ending, the ending. It changes everything you've seen before, and actually makes a good movie better by adding a layer you didn't even know was there. A lot of the dialogue was a tad pedestrian, but the writer/director deserves a lot of credit for sticking to his vision. Sometimes it is about artistry after all, even when making a "horror" movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this film not expecting much and it really came to my surprise to find this an above average horror-thriller, not relying on special effects, but atmosphere and performances for its effectiveness. Bruce Willis was excellent as a caring and gifted child psychologist who's assigned to a very troubled and seemingly paranoid schizophrenic 9 year old boy who confesses to seeing dead people. The real star of the film was Haley Joel Osment as the boy. In case you didn't know, he was Forrest Gump, Jr. in the final scenes as Tom Hanks' son. I already rate him as the finest child actor around, in fact, I would have much more recommended him as Anakin in Star Wars I. The ending of the film will have the whole movie make sense in case you wonder what has really been going on. If you saw the begining, it shouldn't come as a surprise, but for nearly every body who saw the film including myself, it did. It remeinded me of the 1987 horror thriller Angel Heart with Mickey Rourke as a private eye detective in the 1950's who is assigned by Robert DeNiro to find a missing crooner and found out the true nature of his horrifying, surreal, voodo-drenched investigation. Strongly recommend the film for anyone 13 or older, younger children should stay clear</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Depending upon when you get IT, THE SIXTH SENSE is either: o Somber, episodic and only infrequently scary, or o Gripping, suspenseful, frightening, and surprisingly touching.I think it is the latter. It's also beautifully written, directed and acted.Because it is so unconventional (More Hitchcock than Spielberg), and uses cinematic elements (lighting, sound, editing) rather than special effects to provide its horror, it is not surprising THE SIXTH SENSE crept into theaters. What IS surprising is its excellent box office so early in its release cycle. This once again demonstrates a literate, entertaining film CAN find an audience in these days of megabuck special effects extravaganzas.THE SIX SENSE is the best suspense film since SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, and it's a horror/thriller, too!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This summer cinematic season has been so dismal that I was about to swear off all further moviegoing; but when a very thoughtful and erudite friend mentioned having attended The Sixth Sense and liking it, I resolved to give it a try.Not usually going out of my way to see horror movies, I went expecting a thoughtful and erudite film, and it DELIVERED. What is so remarkable about it is not the horror, but the tenderness and compassion permeating it. I didn't know what to expect. Yes, it was scary, but for me the chills were nothing compared to the tears.Haley Osmend's acting, as others have said, is so wonderful that you forget it's acting. He is a terrified, troubled, miserable child. But he is more. He is also intelligent, loving, and empathic. Supposed to be the patient, sometimes, despite his horrible burdens, he becomes the therapist. The scene took my breath away when, after Willis has abandoned Cole with regret all around, confessing that he can't be the boy's doctor anymore because he has too many problems of his own, they meet later in the church where Cole hangs out for sanctuary, terrified of being anywhere else. His toy soldiers are lined up on the balcony rail. There is a hard edge in the boy's voice as he taunts the man who had deserted him: which of these trinkets do you want to play, or play with, today? Then suddenly he looks more closely at Willis's manner, and his own changes to concern for him: "Something's happened to you, hasn't it?" Such dimensions of sensitivity save both of the characters in the story, and propel their film beyond horror to greatness.I did not find the ending as surprising as some did, but it was very satisfying. If the opening scene had been in a library, panning in on a newspaper and then on a story recounting the award given to the good doctor, or an article written by him, an even more intriguing level of Jamesian conundrum might have been evoked.But I still don't get the bit about the wine cellar which he could never unlock. Anyone who understands this is invited to e-mail me with an explanation. As the guy said in "Back to the Future," my density has brought us together.Maybe a second viewing will clarify. I'm definitely going back.It's worth seeing again. Do not culturally deprive yourself. Go!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be honest, I wasn't sure about this movie at first. But let me tell you "They got me". This movie sucked me in, slowly, and then slapped me around. Whoa! Where did that come from? It slowly but surely draws you into a complex storyline then in one deft move just completely turns you around. If you say you figured it, shut up. You got lucky. The plot twist makes the movie a winner, but that's not all there is. Bruce and the kid are great. The movie has a great look and spooky feel. It's slow, but that's okay, because you want to pay attention. There are no car chases or cheesy special effects to distract you from what's going on. While everyone is raving about Bruce and the kid, I would like to mention the mom. She was compassionate, honest and believable. There is a very touching scene near the end where I think most people quietly wept.Overall, I found it to be thought provoking. You want to believe. I couldn't stop thinking about it for hours. I can't wait to to actually talk to somebody else who saw it. Check it out, please.</fullReview>

It was scary without being over the edge. It wasn't gory or one of those stupid 80's slasher movies. This is one of the most intelligent movies made. Haley Joel Osment is the greatest child actor I have ever seen. He did not get fake and was very convincing. I did not feel that he was reading from a script to me. This movie would have been much less without him. While I do like Bruce Willis' over the edge action movies, I also thought that he was excellent in this movie. The conversation between Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis was so real. They were on an equal plane.The end of this movie was the greatest and most unexpected twist of all time. I want to see this movie again now that I know what the end is because thinking back, I realize there were many hints dropped to what the end would be that made sense as I was driving home.An absolute must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was thoroughly impressed with this film. The only film I can think of that "Sixth Sense" can be compared to is "The Shining", and it comes off rather well in that comparison. Haley Osment gives what is probably one of the best child performances I have ever seen. His character is believable and you can empathize with him quite strongly. He does a terrific job portraying a bright child with a very traumatic gift. The film is filled with subtleties. Unless you are fully alert while watching the film, you are bound to miss things, just as in any good mystery. I know, I did. It was only in retrospect that the group I was with could recall all the details we had missed at the time.Another aspect of the film is how well it hangs together. Credit is due to Shyamalan for his excellent writing and directing (the cameo was a bit much). The film takes you into a riveting and almost surreal world. It makes you question the world around you. The cinematography and perspective makes the film very real. I nearly jumped out of my seat several times during the film, and from the jerking throughout the audience, I was far from alone. An excellent and compelling film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been said they don't make movies like this anymore! My wife and I are so glad 'they're' wrong! There is not enough space here to adequately express the need for a plot... Sixth Sense has one and it pulls you into the movie and keeps you engaged to the very end. There are one or two points that will make you jump but the writer/director doesn't send out any 'cheap shots' just to get that reaction out of the audience. They have a purpose and serve to move the story along. The director seems to have chosen to take a leisurely pace, allowing the story to tell itself. I would advise you NOT to ask anyone that has seen this picture about it. There are things best left unexplained for you to discover on your own at the same time as the characters on the screen. This is one that never telegraphs any of its secrets except in hindsight. Please, PLEASE, Hollywood: Take a lesson and make more of these intelligent, absorbing movies that can take your breath away in one moment and leave you with a tear in your eye the next.

		<fullReview>This movie tries to do just a bit too much, but does most of it well. I loathe Bruce Willis, and he turns in yet another stone-faced performance here as what should be a very emotional role. The kid is great. He may look like Anakin or Macauly Culkin, but he knows how to poke fun at patronizing adults without being cute. As far as plot goes, the movie starts out very psychological, until the "I see dead people" line, when it turns into a supernatural thriller. The psych could have work if they had stuck with it, but once Willis believes the kid, all the analysing goes out the window.The gore and scares are not gratuitous, but are unnecessary; the movie works so well intellectually and emotionally, it doesn't need to work physically by startling the audience.In summation: The communication-with-the-dead plot works, but isn't deep enough. Either the psychology or the gore could complement it for a superb movie, but they clash with each other.But by the final revelation, this sin is forgiven as a twist that would make Hitchcock proud comes out. It leaves a few plot holes, but you won't care.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't make the mistake of thinking this is a typical Bruce Willis flick or yet another cheesy horror movie. I'm not a fan of either, but absolutely loved this movie. Is this movie perfect? Definitely not. But it is one of the best movies of the year, and perhaps one of the best all-time for its genre.I think the distributors actually mis-marketed this movie as strictly a horror movie. In reality, it is much more of a drama or human interest story. The plot, character development, and acting are what really make this movie, not the occasional scare. In fact the acting is likely (I hope) to produce at least a couple Oscar nominations. I hope the Academy members have the guts to nominate Haley Joel Osment, he absolutely deserves it.The best part of this movie is the drive home afterwards. You'll replay every scene in your head realizing how everything makes sense. So, go see this movie immediately!! But don't go in looking for a hard-core horror movie, instead look for the most emotionally gripping movie of the year.Highly, highly recommended.</fullReview>

Jesus! Everything is hair raising in this one.The thing is though, that the long "prelude" to the action is definitely necessary, otherwise, we would not be so surprisingly scared when the "action" came along...it's a well told story.The kid is incredible...every emotion is displayed in him..fear, sadness, and despair. For those of you horror fans out there, this is the sort of movie that reminds us of the film "The Entity"....neither of them have to depend on special effects to give us a good scare, even though "The Entity" is far more terrifying, even more so under the assumption that its based on a true story.Either way, I believe The Sixth Sense is one of the best films of the year.You get some horror and a lot of suspense and drama.Believe me, that dark hallway in your house will seem far more darker and scarier once you see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was thoroughly impressed with this film. The only film I can think of that "Sixth Sense" can be compared to is "The Shining", and it comes off rather well in that comparison. Haley Osment gives what is probably one of the best child performances I have ever seen. His character is believable and you can empathize with him quite strongly. He does a terrific job portraying a bright child with a very traumatic gift. The film is filled with subtleties. Unless you are fully alert while watching the film, you are bound to miss things, just as in any good mystery. I know, I did. It was only in retrospect that the group I was with could recall all the details we had missed at the time.Another aspect of the film is how well it hangs together. Credit is due to Shyamalan for his excellent writing and directing (the cameo was a bit much). The film takes you into a riveting and almost surreal world. It makes you question the world around you. The cinematography and perspective makes the film very real. I nearly jumped out of my seat several times during the film, and from the jerking throughout the audience, I was far from alone. An excellent and compelling film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been over a week since I've seen this film and I still won't get up at night to go to the bathroom.Very rarely has a movie stuck with me like this one. Through Haley's brilliant acting you can really understand what it's like to see ghosts. And you completely understand Bruce's frustration through out the film...who can help?Though not a Willis fan, I will be more willing to watch his films with hopes to see more performances like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been said they don't make movies like this anymore! My wife and I are so glad 'they're' wrong! There is not enough space here to adequately express the need for a plot... Sixth Sense has one and it pulls you into the movie and keeps you engaged to the very end. There are one or two points that will make you jump but the writer/director doesn't send out any 'cheap shots' just to get that reaction out of the audience. They have a purpose and serve to move the story along. The director seems to have chosen to take a leisurely pace, allowing the story to tell itself. I would advise you NOT to ask anyone that has seen this picture about it. There are things best left unexplained for you to discover on your own at the same time as the characters on the screen. This is one that never telegraphs any of its secrets except in hindsight. Please, PLEASE, Hollywood: Take a lesson and make more of these intelligent, absorbing movies that can take your breath away in one moment and leave you with a tear in your eye the next. Conclusion: Very well acted, Great plot and pacing, A movie you will want to talk about for a few days after seeing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was absolutely incredible; though I raved over "The Blair Witch Project," "The Sixth Sense" had more heart, more emotion, more suspense, and more power than Blair Witch. I will undoubtedly see this movie several times, and recommend it to anybody. The conclusion was a such a shock it brought both gasps and tears to myself and the viewers around me. This film was a true masterpiece...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie tries to do just a bit too much, but does most of it well. I loathe Bruce Willis, and he turns in yet another stone-faced performance here as what should be a very emotional role. The kid is great. He may look like Anakin or Macauly Culkin, but he knows how to poke fun at patronizing adults without being cute. As far as plot goes, the movie starts out very psychological, until the "I see dead people" line, when it turns into a supernatural thriller. The psych could have work if they had stuck with it, but once Willis believes the kid, all the analysing goes out the window.The gore and scares are not gratuitous, but are unnecessary; the movie works so well intellectually and emotionally, it doesn't need to work physically by startling the audience.In summation: The communication-with-the-dead plot works, but isn't deep enough. Either the psychology or the gore could complement it for a superb movie, but they clash with each other.But by the final revelation, this sin is forgiven as a twist that would make Hitchcock proud comes out. It leaves a few plot holes, but you won't care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't make the mistake of thinking this is a typical Bruce Willis flick or yet another cheesy horror movie. I'm not a fan of either, but absolutely loved this movie. Is this movie perfect? Definitely not. But it is one of the best movies of the year, and perhaps one of the best all-time for its genre.I think the distributors actually mis-marketed this movie as strictly a horror movie. In reality, it is much more of a drama or human interest story. The plot, character development, and acting are what really make this movie, not the occasional scare. In fact the acting is likely (I hope) to produce at least a couple Oscar nominations. I hope the Academy members have the guts to nominate Haley Joel Osment, he absolutely deserves it.The best part of this movie is the drive home afterwards. You'll replay every scene in your head realizing how everything makes sense. So, go see this movie immediately!! But don't go in looking for a hard-core horror movie, instead look for the most emotionally gripping movie of the year.Highly, highly recommended.</fullReview>

Bruce Willis, who I have previously only enjoyed in action roles, was also very good.The "kid seeing &amp; talking to dead people" bit is not overdone, in spite of what the trailer might lead you to believe. There are several unexpected scares (the best kind), and well done story elements which cannot even be touched upon here without spoiling them.Even if you generally don't appreciate child actors (or Bruce Willis, for that matter), don't let that stop you from seeing this very good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the absolute best movie of the summer, barely nudging out "The Matrix." I went into "The Haunting" hoping to be scared and and enjoy a sad, mysterious ghost story. I got neither. "The Sixth Sense" gave me both!!! I missed one of the big "scare" scenes because the tension was so strong - I just couldn't watch the screen, I was so scared! I was peeking out from behind my hands for a good portion of this film!It would be a crime to say a single word about the plot; in fact, I was rather irritated that the ads for this film show what they do. The writing, acting, and directing are all superb. Perhaps best of all, this story has all the backbone to really hold the film up.How can I express how GOOD this child actor is??? He has all the believability and strength of Elijah Wood (who got well-deserved top billing over Kevin Costner in "The War") and is perhaps even more appealing. As for Bruce Willis, I initially snickered and hoped I could enjoy the movie "in spite" of him - yet he was marvelous!!! I can't think of anyone who could replace him.There have been so many disappointing movies out there lately. Help make this worthy film a hit!!! Go see it right away, before anything you hear or read can give away even a sliver of detail!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the movie expecting to be surprised by the ending, as all the reviews of Sixth sense I read prior to watching the movie mentioned the surprise twist ala Usual Suspects, one of my favorite movies of all time. Alas, I was able to predict correctly what the surprise was 5 minutes after the movie's introduction. I actually enjoyed Sixth Sense more because the dialogues between Willis and Osment, and any scenes w/ Willis in them very much made sense, knowing what's happening/what happened.Osment was very convincing as a kid who sees what others can't and is terrorized by his special gift. Willis, though low key, showed compassion.Overall, Sixth Sense has more plot than Blair Witch and its dealing with spirituality gives it more depth than any horror movies in recent years.</fullReview>

I think the acting was superb especially by Osment who played the role of the little boy. When I first saw the movie I was like no way at the ending and I was saying thats impossible but after I thought about it I realized it made perfect sense and made the movie even creepier. This is a film I will have to watch more times to catch every little detail. Trust me people you need to go watch this movie immediately and really think hard after the movie to explain to yourself what happened in that movie. A 10 out of 10 but I don't want to say too much cuz that tends to ruin the movie a bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing ever happens in this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is not the thriller I thought it would be. It's not a bad movie, but I found it disappointing. It makes you jump here and there, but it's hardly a scary movie. I kept waiting for something major to happen, but it never does. The only interesting things about the movie are the little boy's performance and what Bruce Willis' character comes to realize near the end of the movie. That's it. If you want to see a scary movie, then rent a scary movie. If you don't get to see this movie, don't worry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can only compare this movie to a giant jawbreaker: deliciously slow to dissolve, many, many layers and it's always worth it. Sure, this movie is slow, but that's good. You can savor it, and at the end, you'll be thankful that it was so slow, ominous and quiet. I dare say this movie, despite a few plot holes I won't divulge here, is a near-masterpiece. The cast, the writing, the chills were impeccable. I won't be sleeping with the lights off anytime soon!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I say "The Sixth Sense" was a refreshing pleasure. The suspense kept me focused. The storyline, plot, and acting was the best I've seen all summer. Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear deserves most of the credit with his convincing portrayal and Bruce Willis finally landed a role to reprise my faith in his acting abilities. Bravo, M. Night Shyamalan! Excellent entertainment - excellent psyche candy - excellence all around.</fullReview>

The performances of Bruce Willis and his younger co-star also help to transform this movie into a memorable, worthwhile, and very frightening film.</fullReview>

Alas, I was able to predict correctly what the surprise was 5 minutes after the movie's introduction. I actually enjoyed Sixth Sense more because the dialogues between Willis and Osment, and any scenes w/ Willis in them very much made sense, knowing what's happening/what happened.Osment was very convincing as a kid who sees what others can't and is terrorized by his special gift. Willis, though low key, showed compassion.Overall, Sixth Sense has more plot than Blair Witch and its dealing with spirituality gives it more depth than any horror movies in recent years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic, the drought has ended.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After years of pathetically silly, poorly written and acted horror movies, the summer of 1999 has brought us two classics which will be enjoyed years from now as are The Exorcist, The Omen, and Rosemary's Baby.Along with the Blair Witch Project has come The Sixth Sense. In The Sixth Sense the writing, story-line, acting, and photography are superb. The ending sets new standards of excellence and makes one want to march out of the theater, buy another ticket, and immediately march back in. When was the last time anyone experienced that in a horror flick? The scare level was right up there with the best of it's genre and was consistent throughout.Now lets hope that this summer's horror offerings will prove to be more than mere aberrations (or is that apparitions).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, I went to see this movie not expecting too much. Bruce Willis in a dramatic, non-action role was hard for me to accept, since I would have to watch him try and "act". I am here to say I was totally wrong about any misgivings I had about The Sixth Sense. It was a compelling and chilling story, with an eerie surprise ending. Bruce and the kid have excellent chemistry together, and the supporting roles are strong as well, especially Cole's mom. Now, as good as the ending is (I won't say anything about that), my vote for the best scene in the movie HAS to be the funeral/videotape sequence. I'll keep the details to myself, but I'll tell you, my jaw was on the floor through that whole 15-20 minutes or so. I also liked the fact that the director and his excellent cast (give that kid an Oscar!) were able to freak me out without resorting to silly computerized ghost effects (ala The Haunting), or gory, slasher scenes (Scream, etc.).

		<shortDescription>This is how 'scary' works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director M. Night Shyalaman has obviously done his homework. 'The Sixth Sense' is a painstakingly constructed lesson in how to heighten tension and generate fear.With none of the high tech special effects of 'The Haunting' and none of the slasher-flick gore of 'Scream' or 'I Know What You Did Last Summer', the movie delivers more edge-of-your-seat nail-biting than all three of those films put together. What seems like a slow beginning is actually a careful build-up to some very creepy scenes.As always, the terror of what might might be around the corner is more effective than the monster leaping out of the shadows, but here Shyalaman uses both together with a very subtle approach and an expert timing. There are actually times when we forget we're watching a scary movie, and that's when the film strikes.The fear is projected off the screen brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment in the role of the psychic child. As the only one who sees the dead people, he's the only one that can show the fear. And show it, he does! The young actor does more to portray true terror than film veterans have done in some projects.Well worth your money (even at the higher priced deluxe cinemas) and certainly worth your time. With no excessive blood and guts and only mild language concerns, anyone who likes a good scare can enjoy this film.</fullReview>

It is scary, but in a spooky and intelligent way. (I slept with the lights on after seeing it.)And the ending will surprise even the most jaded moviegoer. Bruce Willis was great and Haley Joel Osment gave an amazing performance. The writing was excellent and well planned. I spent the entire evening after the movie going though the movie and finding how everything was consistent with the twist with no obvious flaws. I have recommended this movie to everyone.

		<fullReview>Bruce Willis is at his finest. The story will grab hold of you &amp; not let go until the unexpected ending.A great haunting tale that leaves you pondering the what ifs of the "Sixth Sense" when you walk out of the theatre. Great movie to see with friends. The use of special effects is sparing and only enhances the story. For those of you that are overwhelmed with the sheer volume of summer movies where the special effects are the story, this movie is a refreshing change.While it is tempting to give away some key points, I will leave them for you to find out yourself. However, if you're only going to see 1 movie this summer, I suggest you make that movie "Sixth Sense". It is well worth the 2 hours and price of admission.</fullReview>

It was able to give me a jump even when I was expecting it. More important, it gives chills (i.e. it gets you in the back of the mind).Five stars out of four for Haley Osment. Maybe Jake Lloyd (Anakin Skywalker) can learn something about expression and emotion. He gave one of the best acting performance I have seen from someone of that age bracket. In fact, despite being just over 10, he could teach several older actors a thing or two.Don't want to say much because a movie based on suspense really sucks if you know what happens so I'll just end with "A must see"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie worked for me for several reasons. It is a terrific adventure, well-written and beautifully layered. The plight of each character hits hard, and you really do feel their pain. It was SO nice to see a hit movie that isn't filled with profanity and sex, and the acting is outstanding. The music painted a perfect sorrowful background to a brilliantly written and directed piece of art. It was powerful without being "in your face" and left an impression with me that will last a long time. It's scary, it's touching and mostly, it kicks butt. I HIGHLY recommend this film for anyone looking for a good scare, and I think you'll get more than you bargained for - it's a great drama as well.</fullReview>

This movie wasn't hyped like everything else this year and it delivers. Hopefully, the Academy will remember Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette next spring. Their acting is far and away the best work of the year in supporting roles. Bruce Willis also shows that he is often overlooked and can deliver a compelling performance with the right script.

		<fullReview>Out of all the movies I've ever seen, only two movies have had endings that managed to take me completely by surprise... those two are Diabolique and Seven. Well, make this movie the third. I'm not even going to hint as to what happens in respect for an amazing script, amazing performances, and a storyline that will have you believing the unbelievable without even thinking twice. Just when nothing else this summer (or year, for that matter) looked like it was going to top Blair Witch as the best movie, along comes Sixth Sense... if you're debating going to see it, just go... it's worth the price of the ticket and will have you walking out of the theater stunned. Unless a real miracle happens, it may be a long time before another movie is released that has quite the ending as this one. But believe me... it's not just the ending that will have you completely captivated. Amazingly, for a Bruce Willis movie, there are probably only two words that would be edited out if this were to be showing on tv. Look to see this movie winning big at the Oscars, unless (like what usually happens) the academy decides it was too dark and nominates The Haunting, Scream 274 (The Geriatric Slasher), or something equally brainless and pointless...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a dark movie but I still walked out finding a lot of positives. Interesting twists made it worth while and I particularly enjoyed that it was tastefully graphic. I don't really enjoy serious graphic violence as constant or scare tactic. Just enough to feed the plot in the right places at the right time.....great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey this movie was chilling. After a few "bombs", finally Bruce Willis deserved what he need: good supports cast, good story(not original)but still good, and of course this little boy named Haley Joel Osment. The first time that i saw was in "Forrest Gump" and when i saw acting i say "This kid have future". Every decades "Hollywood" show great memorable child performances like "Kramer vs Kramer's Justin Henry in the 70's, Henry Thomas's E.T.the Extra-Terrestrial in the 80's and finally in the 90's Haley Joel Osment</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting tale that grabs &amp; holds you until the end!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bruce Willis is at his finest. The story will grab hold of you &amp; not let go until the unexpected ending.A great haunting tale that leaves you pondering the what ifs of the "Sixth Sense" when you walk out of the theatre. Great movie to see with friends. The use of special effects is sparing and only enhances the story. For those of you that are overwhelmed with the sheer volume of summer movies where the special effects are the story, this movie is a refreshing change.While it is tempting to give away some key points, I will leave them for you to find out yourself. However, if you're only going to see 1 movie this summer, I suggest you make that movie "Sixth Sense". It is well worth the 2 hours and price of admission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie worked for me for several reasons. It is a terrific adventure, well-written and beautifully layered. The plight of each character hits hard, and you really do feel their pain. It was SO nice to see a hit movie that isn't filled with profanity and sex, and the acting is outstanding. The music painted a perfect sorrowful background to a brilliantly written and directed piece of art. It was powerful without being "in your face" and left an impression with me that will last a long time. It's scary, it's touching and mostly, it kicks butt. I HIGHLY recommend this film for anyone looking for a good scare, and I think you'll get more than you bargained for - it's a great drama as well.</fullReview>

This movie wasn't hyped like everything else this year and it delivers. Hopefully, the Academy will remember Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette next spring. Their acting is far and away the best work of the year in supporting roles. Bruce Willis also shows that he is often overlooked and can deliver a compelling performance with the right script.

Wait to see Blair Witch and forget the Haunting; this film was a thriller that would have made Hitchcock proud.

		<fullReview>Out of all the movies I've ever seen, only two movies have had endings that managed to take me completely by surprise... those two are Diabolique and Seven. Well, make this movie the third. I'm not even going to hint as to what happens in respect for an amazing script, amazing performances, and a storyline that will have you believing the unbelievable without even thinking twice. Just when nothing else this summer (or year, for that matter) looked like it was going to top Blair Witch as the best movie, along comes Sixth Sense... if you're debating going to see it, just go... it's worth the price of the ticket and will have you walking out of the theater stunned. Unless a real miracle happens, it may be a long time before another movie is released that has quite the ending as this one. But believe me... it's not just the ending that will have you completely captivated. Amazingly, for a Bruce Willis movie, there are probably only two words that would be edited out if this were to be showing on tv. Look to see this movie winning big at the Oscars, unless (like what usually happens) the academy decides it was too dark and nominates The Haunting, Scream 274 (The Geriatric Slasher), or something equally brainless and pointless...</fullReview>

I cannot express how wrong I was about this movie. WOW! To say I was blown away is understating my reaction to this exceptional film. Take the chills from the Blair Witch Project and multiply them by 10 and then take the heart from a top-notch tear-jerker drama add them together and infuse the best performance by a child actor in recent memory and you can almost fathom how good this movie is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, but not the movie it pretends to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I liked: the performances are excellent, especially the actor playing the boy. He is totally convincing in every scene -- a true rarity for someone his age. He deserves watching. If his performance hadn't been true, the movie would have collapsed. I also liked some of the atmosphere and the basic premise of the film.What I didn't like: the movie previews made this seem to be a scary ghost film. While it does have its moments, it is more of a mawkish soap opera about Willis' character. The story moves excruciatingly slowly. And one more thing that bothers me: the story was done years ago on an old TWILIGHT ZONE or ONE STEP BEYOND. Ironically, it was better in the original because they took only 1/2 hour or hour to tell the story, while here they drag it out to almost two hours.It's an interesting psychological study, but as a ghost story it is just too sluggish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ads made it look really cheesy, so the film surpassed my expectations a lot (call it the Hudson Hawk gag reflex, tho Willis has redeemed himself lately - 5th Element, Pulp Fiction).6S is a really chilling horror story to experience on screen (unlike Blair Witch, which to me is more chilling in the retelling, and will creep me out the next time I go camping). I liked the elements of Lars Von Trier's The Kingdom, Jacob's Ladder, and an old Twilight Zone that permeated it. I liked the shadowy camera effects. But, IMO, the plot twist, while clever and somewhat unexpected, negates the whole second act. I can't get into it without spoiling the movie, so I hope this is clear enough to the folks that did see it.Still, an intelligent, well-executed film that does cater to the mainstream!7/10</fullReview>

It is quite inventive and the subtleties are quite interesting.Bruce Willis does an excellent job in this film and Haley Joel Osment is fantastic!!..keep your eyes peeled on this boy for future performances, he is sure to be a bigger star than he is now.(WARNING:specific movie details below, you may not want to read further) [but no real plot spoilers - ed]The plot starts slow at first but then picks up to maintain a good steady pace. Some notable things that I found most interesting was the usage of the colour red. I realize white is to life as black is to death but the director utilized the use of red quite a bit in this flick. Is this to symbolize blood? Horror? or a warped sence of dark seduction? An example of this is when the boy steals the red statue out of the church. There are other ones, why take the red one. Also the red door handle going down to the cellar and the red fort the boy builds in his room. What about the redness of the lips? in one scene, the boy looks like he just finished a huge class of red Kool-Aid, so much that it looks like he has a red mustache, take a look! One last example, although there are many others to mention, is the point where Willis is sitting on the couch and Haley Joel Osment is behind the couch playing with some toys and leaves a red toy truck on the top of the couch, the next scene shows it brown. And yes, for some of you scratching your head, I was sober and not medicated at the time. Is Shyamalan playing with us?..if so, I like it.

		<fullReview>I think the department in charge of marketing this film has done it a huge disservice. The fact that it was touted to be a horror flick almost kept me from seeing it. I went in expecting "scares" and special effects, but not really getting my hopes up too high . but what I got was something completely different from what I expected. This movie is more drama than horror, more heart than blood, and more thinking than scaring. The acting is effective - nice to see Bruce Willis do something other than wield a gun, and he comes across well in this; and Toni Colette, as the boy's mother, is strong in her performance as a loving, but confused parent. But the real standout in this piece is Haley Joel Osment as Cole, the little boy - now THIS kid can act!! My heart was breaking for this poor child for the whole movie . as he struggles with being considered a "freak" by everyone around him, so afraid to tell anyone what is really going on. While there are certainly moments that scare and surprise, I think "horror" and "action" are really the wrong words to describe this movie. But no matter what genre you want to put it in, I'd still highly recommend this movie to anyone. You aren't likely forget the character of Cole Sear any time soon . and there are enough twists in plot to keep you entertained, and ensure that you are NOT checking your watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All my friends lambaste for this heresy, but I wish the Sixth Sense was a better movie. Without dropping hints, I'll just say that that last part does blow me away, just like everyone else. But I think that most people are blinded to the fact that the rest of the movie, while necessary, just isn't that good.For myself, I was bored for the first third of it. Somehow, the movie just didn't maintain an air of tension for me that I think it needed to. And I blame that, to a degree, on the way it was marketed. I found myself waiting for the ghosts to show up, instead of getting into the tension of a troubled young boy trying to work through his problems with this doctor.The actors are great. This is one of the most believable performances I've seen from Bruce Willis in a long time and Haley Joel Osment is a stunningly good child actor. I am still trying to convince a friend of mine that Toni Collette (playing the child's mother) was Muriel in Muriel's Wedding; her range is impressive.Overall, a good film. But I feel that, with some slight work, it could have been a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is easily the best movie we have seen this summer. It is frightening AND suspenseful without resorting to unimaginative manipulation by special effects computer hacks. The story is patiently developed without resorting to bombs, car chases, knives or hockey masks. The dialogue is excellent, and director M. Night Shyamalan has pumped every ounce of realism from the three main characters.Bruce Willis, who plays psychologist Malcolm Crowe, needs to find more scripts like this one. Actually, all actors need more scripts like this one. This is Willis' best performance since "In Country" in 1989.Eleven-year-old Haley Joel Osment as vision-haunted Cole Sear is the real thing. For those who resist movies with "kids" in them, remember Patty Duke in the original Miracle Worker. This Oscar caliber performance merits a Best Actor nomination . not Best Supporting Actor. This is Osment's movie. In addition, Toni Collette delivers a superior performance as Cole's mother Lynn Sear.The surprise ending is stunning, yet totally believable. While mentally rewinding the movie later, you will think of numerous clues you should have noticed. Just like its ending, this movie will surprise many viewers as did other character-development type movies like Breaking Away, Driving Miss Daisy and Good Will Hunting. This film is a must see for those who yearn for something more that block buster bombs.It is refreshing to know that someone in Hollywood can still write, produce and direct a truly good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film I've Seen in 1999</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I happen to like just about every one of Bruce Willis' movies, so this was a no-brainer for me. However, I hadn't even seen a trailer to this movie, and knew only that it was about ghosts and a little boy. Well, when the credits rolled, I looked at my girlfriend and said this is ,without a doubt, the best movie so far in 1999, surpassing my previous #1, Arlington Road, by a little bit. This is one movie I can't wait for on DVD. Awesome movie. Go see it. The end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best film I've seen this year! A masterful work by M. Night Shyamalan. Bruce Willis delivers one of his best performances, and Haley Joel Osment is absolutely incredible! This is a powerful film that must be remembered at Oscar time for Best Picture (yeah, it's that good), Director and Writer (Shyamalan), Editing, Actor (Willis--yes, Bruce Willis), Actress or Supporting Actress (Toni Collette), and Best Supporting Actor (Osment). I'm not kidding, this is an outstanding film! Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrific surprise (in more ways than one).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into this movie, I was a little upset to realize at the last second that it was PG-13. It turns out, this added to my enjoyment much more walking out of the theater knowing that such a terrific film, and such a deeply frightening one had been done at that level. And it was perfect. If it had anything that would earn it an R, it would have ruined the effect.On to the actual movie. More than anything, the less you know about this movie the better, and the trailers are particularly unhelpful in this respect by giving away something that you're not supposed to immediately know (They also portray the movie as being horribly cheesy in my opinion, but hopefully in 10 years no one will remember the trailer and will remember the movie). So I won't say anything about the plot, except that I found it engaging, well paced, and well written; though to state it that way is to make it clinical in a way it really doesn't deserve.Bruce Willis and the kid both turned in great performances (Bruce Willis can really act when he has a good character), and Tak Fujimoto's cinematography was perfect. The lighting was perfectly called for, and of a style rarely seen, and the occasional use of a handheld camera was far from being the recent trendy attempts at "realism", but instead brought intimacy (something the movie successfully creates as a whole as well).I ended up walking out of the theater and turning to the person I saw it with and simply saying "Grand slam." Why? Because it slammed me with clever fright beats? Or had witty dialog? Or a clever hook? None of these. It simply accomplished everything that it set out to accomplish perfectly, without ever seeming over the top, trying too hard, losing steam, or relying on effects. That type of solid film-making is rarely rewarded and hard to find.And oh yes. It's very scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very creepy film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's going on here? The summer of 99 has produced 2 very intensely creepy films. First Blair Witch takes us all by storm and now the Sixth Sense does the same thing. What we have here is a film that does all the things that a "horror" film should do. It uses shadows, it has talk of the dead and the undead and it even uses other things like atmosphere and music to produce a very good scary film, and one that will have you buzzing about the ending.Young Cole can hear and see dead people and it is up to Dr. Malcolm to help him out. The story itself is interesting and how it is carried out is even better. But I have to say that I think this is a film that should be seen twice to figure everything out and to understand all that it is. Because when you leave the theater you will question many aspects of the film. You will wonder if it is legitimate in it's approach and honest and realistic with what the end of the film has wants us to believe. But when I walked home and had a chance to examine it, I realized how truthful it is, and that makes it even more brilliant. And in a way this film reminds me of a 1987 film called Angel Heart. Both films concentrate on foreshadowing and they also play with our intellect. When I first saw Angel Heart, I knew that it was good, but when I began to watch it more often on video, I realized that Angel Heart was a film that had more to it in every shot. Every single time the camera rolled, there was always a subliminal meaning behind the ersatz one that was in front of us. And that is what I think Sixth Sense does so well. You wonder at first why Malcolm can't get into his basement, and then when you leave the theater and think about the film, you realize how much it all made sense. This is a film that manipulates our psyche and plays with our ethos. But it has a great time doing so. I highly recommend this film, especially if you want to be frightened. There are about five or six really good moments in the film that make your heart stop. And on that level the film is terrific. But as a film, not a genre piece, this is top notch and dare I say that Cole may be remembered at Oscar time. Go see this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is that rarest of creatures, the intelligent summer chiller/thriller. Solid cast including a subdued Bruce Willis (who let's face it, may never win an Oscar but can be relied upon to entertain) and an amazing Haley Joel Osment. His performance is the glue that holds the whole thing together. If you don't buy him, you don't buy the movie. To discuss the plot further would be a disservice to the writer/director as well as to those who haven't seen the film yet. Do not, under any circumstances, let anyone tell you the ending!

		<shortDescription>Best movie of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't get excited about movies too often, and this year I've been thoroughly disappointed, having shelled out the bucks to see Star Wars, The Mummy, and American Pie--all big duds! This is the best movie on the big screen since Saving Private Ryan, a true winner. Bruce Willis puts on his best show, possibly of his entire career. Osment is the best child actor I've seen since Tatum O'Neil in Paper Moon (1973). His ability to capture all of the idiosyncrasies of a frightened boy with the "6th sense", those characteristics we the naive would never think of, is unheard-of in a child actor. This movie has it all! It's a thriller, horror, a little comedy, romance that will make you cry. It's like Ghost (1990), taken to another level! It is WELL worth the overpriced tickets!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was ready to be scared silly, and paid my price for just that. But after a good portion of the film, I had already decided that I was going to give this film two thumbs down, and I even kind of liked Hudson Hawk! HOWEVER, without giving away any clues, let me say that I completely changed my mind in the last 15 minutes of the flick, and decided it was a surprisingly good story. I usually go in expecting the 'twists' and hate predictable movies, but this one is a pretty well crafted piece. Kudos to the film makers, and I recommend this one if you're ready for a slightly slow-to-unfold drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read some wonderful praise for this movie from other theatre-goers who have seen it, so I'll let their words stand for all to see, and be brief. Someone here mentioned they believe this is a movie that is worth every penny of the ticket price. It is that, and so much more. A wonderfully made film. My faith in Bruce Willis, along with my respect was restored, and then some. Every character was believable, every scence was riveting, despite the movie transpiring slowly. This film also had a beautiful ending. It changed the face of what is seen as contemporary horror subject matter into something mysterious and revered. The plot twist near the end of this movie was the most well written piece of a script, and the most unexpected moment in a film I've ever had the pleasure to be a part of. I recommend this film wholeheartedly. It will undoubtedly, and expediently fill my elitist video collection when it comes out on video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie live up to expectations and more. It started out kind of slow but it picked up its pace quickly. The plot was very interesting and it kept me wanting to know more about each character. Bruce Willis is an excellent and versatile actor. He is very talented and he proves it in this film. Haley Joel Osment also contributed his talent as a young actor. He was very convincing and he brought emotion to the entire film. All the elements that are brought forth in this excellent film is an example of the kind of work that other films should try to convey in their projects. I am sure this film will not disappoint anyone with its wit, intelligence, and suspense. Even though Donnie Walhberg did not have much screen time he did an extraordinary job with his character. I hope to see him in future films. Overall, this film is one of the best I have seen in a long time. I suggest everyone go out and see it.</fullReview>

There's been a lot of talk about the startling ending, but I'd love to hear how the director planned out the interaction between the characters so well that you have to get to the end of this film to "See" what you were missing. This sounds vague I know, but that's why at the end you'll think "I have to see this again, now I understand!" The Sixth Sense is a movie lovers film. It's slightly slow to start even though all scenes are needed to make the story just right, with a great build up and ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, like many others, have been a little disappointed with the summer 1999 movie season. I had seen the trailers for this movie and decided to give it a shot. Once agian, in an attempt to bring in movie goers, they gave away too much of the movie in the previews. Luckily, this movie managed to be great despite this. Writer/Director M. Night Shyamalan gets his vision across. Bruce Willis shows he hasn't forgotten how to act in a movie that isn't all one liners and explosions. The supporting cast, including an unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg, are top rate. The most impressive thing about this movie was Haley Joel Osment. This young actor made me believe he was living with this torment. It is a nice change of pace to see a young actor who isn't just a cute face on the screen. This young man can act, far out classing any one else in the movie. I look forward to more from him. The refreshing lack of special effects and an ending that will leave you slack jawed are a definite plus. I will be going back to see this one again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is brilliant, even better than The Usual Suspects and The Matrix... It's one of the few movies I've watched lately and then realized it had no plot holes that I could find. I thought I found one at first, but realized it was merely a case of seeing what I expected to see rather than what was actually shown.At one point, Cole comments that the ghosts can't see each other, they only see what they want to see. The ending makes the same point TO the audience ABOUT the audience, and does it with a demonstration that cannot be argued against.The writing, direction, and acting are all great... I knew Willis could act, but I was surprised to see than Donnie Wahlberg (that's right, from the New Kids On The Block) can do some impressive acting, as well--at least in the brief appearance he makes as a former patient.There's one scene in particular where surprisingly good acting from a child combines with brilliant direction to allow you to see exactly how Cole feels having to go to the bathroom alone in the middle of the night, knowing that the dead will appear, but knowing when or how... I've never seen a movie convey emotion this way before.You really should see this--not to be scared (which you will be, suddenly and with no warning, at various points in the movie), but to be made to THINK, in the way that good science fiction makes you think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been in love with stories of death, horror, and the supernatural since I was 10. I am now approaching 46. I have seen a great deal of death and horror, both fictional and real. Most fiction does not get much out of me, not a shudder, not a chill.Until I saw "The Sixth Sense" (TSS), my favorite ghost story was "The Haunting", the 1963 version. It was followed by "Jacob's Ladder". "TSS" now is in first place.This story is filled with pain and compassion, kindness and fear, and failure and redemption. This is a lot to get from a ghost story. And in the end, it all makes sense.Bruce Willis as the psychologist, and Haley Joel Osment, as the troubled child have a wonderful chemistry. You believe they desperately wish to work with each other towards ending the child's torment. Furthermore, the terror and emotional pain the child displays is totally believable. This is what gives this movie the power it possess. When an emotional foundation is built, one does not require special effects and blood to engage us.I heard the audience around me gasp at some of the scarier moments. Personally, I had the hair on my arms and the back of my neck raise. For a jaded cynic like me, this seldom happens.If you have a weak heart or have religious convictions which would interfere with your enjoyment of a ghost story, do not see this movie. To everyone else, go see this movie. Then, after thinking about what you saw, see it again.</fullReview>

I am sure that anyone who has read a paper has heard about the surprise ending in this film, and don't worry, i am NOT going to give it away, god forbid... but if you don't see this film then you will be missing out on one of the best endings in a movie since " The Usual Suspects". I don't mean that by the content, but just how i totally did not see it coming... anyway, the film was a bit eerie in parts, and although i am not one who scares easily, it still managed to give me a little bit of the creeps. I highly recommend this film...the actor who played Cole (his name slips my mind) did a great job, as did everyone else... so that's about it! Go see this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie of Summer 1999, from any genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read some wonderful praise for this movie from other theatre-goers who have seen it, so I'll let their words stand for all to see, and be brief. Someone here mentioned they believe this is a movie that is worth every penny of the ticket price. It is that, and so much more. A wonderfully made film. My faith in Bruce Willis, along with my respect was restored, and then some. Every character was believable, every scence was riveting, despite the movie transpiring slowly. This film also had a beautiful ending. It changed the face of what is seen as contemporary horror subject matter into something mysterious and revered. The plot twist near the end of this movie was the most well written piece of a script, and the most unexpected moment in a film I've ever had the pleasure to be a part of. I recommend this film wholeheartedly. It will undoubtedly, and expediently fill my elitist video collection when it comes out on video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since the days of Moonlighting and Diehard, I have been a big fan of Bruce Willis. This was his best picture so far. This screenplay and plot development were amazing. The ending gave me chills that I last felt when Kaiser Soze was indentified in The Usual Suspects. The child in this movie is intensely real in both his scared scenes and happy ones. Great movie and nice to see Bruce working on something worth while for a change(Mercury Rising ugh!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was so enjoyable that you'll probably want to see it twice. There's been a lot of talk about the startling ending, but I'd love to hear how the director planned out the interaction between the characters so well that you have to get to the end of this film to "See" what you were missing. This sounds vague I know, but that's why at the end you'll think "I have to see this again, now I understand!" The Sixth Sense is a movie lovers film. It's slightly slow to start even though all scenes are needed to make the story just right, with a great build up and ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one may actually redeem the summer '99 movie season.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, like many others, have been a little disappointed with the summer 1999 movie season. I had seen the trailers for this movie and decided to give it a shot. Once agian, in an attempt to bring in movie goers, they gave away too much of the movie in the previews. Luckily, this movie managed to be great despite this. Writer/Director M. Night Shyamalan gets his vision across. Bruce Willis shows he hasn't forgotten how to act in a movie that isn't all one liners and explosions. The supporting cast, including an unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg, are top rate. The most impressive thing about this movie was Haley Joel Osment. This young actor made me believe he was living with this torment. It is a nice change of pace to see a young actor who isn't just a cute face on the screen. This young man can act, far out classing any one else in the movie. I look forward to more from him. The refreshing lack of special effects and an ending that will leave you slack jawed are a definite plus. I will be going back to see this one again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow! Incredibly subtle...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is brilliant, even better than The Usual Suspects and The Matrix... It's one of the few movies I've watched lately and then realized it had no plot holes that I could find. I thought I found one at first, but realized it was merely a case of seeing what I expected to see rather than what was actually shown.At one point, Cole comments that the ghosts can't see each other, they only see what they want to see. The ending makes the same point TO the audience ABOUT the audience, and does it with a demonstration that cannot be argued against.The writing, direction, and acting are all great... I knew Willis could act, but I was surprised to see than Donnie Wahlberg (that's right, from the New Kids On The Block) can do some impressive acting, as well--at least in the brief appearance he makes as a former patient.There's one scene in particular where surprisingly good acting from a child combines with brilliant direction to allow you to see exactly how Cole feels having to go to the bathroom alone in the middle of the night, knowing that the dead will appear, but knowing when or how... I've never seen a movie convey emotion this way before.You really should see this--not to be scared (which you will be, suddenly and with no warning, at various points in the movie), but to be made to THINK, in the way that good science fiction makes you think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the year's best, certainly the best ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been in love with stories of death, horror, and the supernatural since I was 10. I am now approaching 46. I have seen a great deal of death and horror, both fictional and real. Most fiction does not get much out of me, not a shudder, not a chill.Until I saw "The Sixth Sense" (TSS), my favorite ghost story was "The Haunting", the 1963 version. It was followed by "Jacob's Ladder". "TSS" now is in first place.This story is filled with pain and compassion, kindness and fear, and failure and redemption. This is a lot to get from a ghost story. And in the end, it all makes sense.Bruce Willis as the psychologist, and Haley Joel Osment, as the troubled child have a wonderful chemistry. You believe they desperately wish to work with each other towards ending the child's torment. Furthermore, the terror and emotional pain the child displays is totally believable. This is what gives this movie the power it possess. When an emotional foundation is built, one does not require special effects and blood to engage us.I heard the audience around me gasp at some of the scarier moments. Personally, I had the hair on my arms and the back of my neck raise. For a jaded cynic like me, this seldom happens.If you have a weak heart or have religious convictions which would interfere with your enjoyment of a ghost story, do not see this movie. To everyone else, go see this movie. Then, after thinking about what you saw, see it again.</fullReview>

Bruce Willis might be one cool dude, but this character isn't supposed to be cool, he's supposed to be a psychiatrist, damn you! Bruce can't seem to get rid of his "cool stare", get Nic Cage for this part and ya got my blessing... but i have to confess to one thing:after watching the movie, and thinking about it, everything adds up, it was well plotted, but it didn't have the "whammies" a movie needs to keep you nailed to your seat. "Raiders Of The Last Ark" is a good Whammie exapmple. first ya got a great action sequence, followed by a boring lecture... but at least they have your attention. well, altogether i give Sense #6 a 6.0, that's what it deserves (perhaps after watching it it deserves more, but i am still pissed off at the fact that i was bored during the first hour)... that'll take down yer average, lamers!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I concur with the majority of comments thus far: The Sixth Sense is an outstanding example of the horror genre. Like The Shining, it is genuinely creepy, but like The Dead Zone, it retains its humanity; the combination makes it so affecting.I was worried that the trailers had tipped too much, but I was wrong. While I could have done without them, in the end they did little to dilute the pleasure and power of this fine film. Even if you are not usually inclined to view horror films, or Bruce Willis films, for that matter, I highly recommend that you catch The Sixth Sense soon, in a real theater, with an audience. It is well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE SIXTH SENSE. M. Night Shaymalan's "The Sixth Sense" is an enjoyable ghost thriller, sometimes funny, sometimes creepy, and surprisingly rewarding. Bruce Willis is excellent as a child psychologist named Malcom Crowe whose latest patient is a nine-year-old kid named Cole (played stupendously Haley Joel Osment) who claims that he can see dead people. What follows is an intriguing and effective chiller that relies much more on characters than special effects. Rated PG-13. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mystery and horror for the mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is probably the best non-action summer movie this year. Featuring a very subdued Bruce Willis as a child psychologist who finds himself in the worst situation possible, a vengeful patient who returns.On the night he is honored for his skills, one of his patients comes visiting, asking why he did not help him. Donnie Wahlberg does masterful work, portraying a tortured soul. As instantly as he arrives, he exacts his revenge and ends his torture with a gun. We forward to fall, when Willis is helping a small child adapt to a single parent home and very peculiar behavior. This movie is a combination of Heaven Can Wait, Ghost, Beetlegeuse, and Jacob's Ladder. The difference is that The Sixth Sense is directed, edited, and acted much better. It has some scenes that are downright chilling and and ending that you never see coming. Unless you see it again and look for clues, you never see it coming. There is one scene that I actually found downright stunning. Most of that is due to Haley Joel Osment, who plays the young boy who should wake up when the nominations for the Oscars are announced.This movie is a must-see. Forget about other "horror" movies out this season. The Sixth Sense should be your first choice. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is a good thriller. It is superbly acted by Osmen, and Willus(in a different role) is good as the psychologist who tries to help the child. But Osmen is really good as the disturbed boy. I think he's probably the best young young actor to come along sinse Miko Hughes in Wes Craven's New Nightmare. But Osmen's performance was probably more realistic than Hughes'(but both of them make that kid in S.W. Episode 1, look pretty dull).This film, being shot in philadelphia(my home town of course:-) was beautifully shot. It was kind of funny when in the beginning of the film, when it mentions an exact part of the city, and it looked quite different than what most philadelphians are used to(my dad knew it though). It was neat trying to find out and recognizing the places the film took place in and around.Anyway It is a good film, some slow spots, but its taught, well acted, and has some nice shocks toward the end.Oh and to the guy who said that "people who are easily entertained" will like this film.

		<fullReview>This movie was quite entertaining, and there are two main ideas that make this summer blockbuster a masterpiece. 1) Director M. Night Shyamalan knew just what to do with this movie (considering he wrote it) to make the audience really WANT to see it a second time. The ingenious surprise ending will make viewers want to come back and watch the movie again with the knowledge of the ending. Shyamalan's choice of camera angles is subtle, with a slight reminder of the angled view of Mission: Impossible. He also used James Newton Howard's eerie yet inviting score to entrance the viewers. Shyamalan uses his directorial touches to make this movie a true work of art. 2) Haley Joel Osment delivers the most powerful performance I've seen out of a young actor in a good long while. He is reminiscent of Justin Henry of Kramer v. Kramer. His natural naivety makes the audience really tune into his character. (After seeing this movie, I'll bet George Lucas kicked himself.)I'm sure the Academy will recognize the hard work of such a bright young star. He has quite a future ahead of him. The Sixth Sense is a movie that I've been planning to see since I saw the very first preview. I practically counted each day until opening night, and I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to be at the premiere in my own home town! This is a movie I definitely plan to see multiple times.</fullReview>

Night Shyamalan knew just what to do with this movie (considering he wrote it) to make the audience really WANT to see it a second time. The ingenious surprise ending will make viewers want to come back and watch the movie again with the knowledge of the ending. Shyamalan's choice of camera angles is subtle, with a slight reminder of the angled view of Mission: Impossible. He also used James Newton Howard's eerie yet inviting score to entrance the viewers. Shyamalan uses his directorial touches to make this movie a true work of art. 2) Haley Joel Osment delivers the most powerful performance I've seen out of a young actor in a good long while. He is reminiscent of Justin Henry of Kramer v. Kramer. His natural naivety makes the audience really tune into his character. (After seeing this movie, I'll bet George Lucas kicked himself.)I'm sure the Academy will recognize the hard work of such a bright young star. He has quite a future ahead of him. The Sixth Sense is a movie that I've been planning to see since I saw the very first preview. I practically counted each day until opening night, and I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to be at the premiere in my own home town! This is a movie I definitely plan to see multiple times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A creepy and very moving film, one that proves beyond any shadow of a doubt that Mr. Willis can do more than just blow things up. If anyone tells another person who has not seen this film the ending, they have robbed that person of one of the best moments in recent film making and should be ashamed of themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without spoilers, I am not sure that you can guess the ending of this movie. Like The Usual Suspects, the final revelation is logical on a certain level, but still not predictable or expected. And, like The Usual Suspects, the ending forces a review of what new meanings and levels of meaning result from this unexpected twist. The relationships change, who is the savior/saved changes, and all of this results in a more complex and enjoyable movie experience. The acting is subtle and utterly believable. The movie belongs to Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment, both of whom are riveting. I especially liked the final resolution and the acceptance on the part of the boy's character. You might have expected the nightmares to be vanquished, rather than understood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of those rare movies that uses the conventions of a tired genre to to express a deeply humanistic vision.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Within one month of each other, 2 watershed movies have opened that have, each in their own way, done more to shake the hoary old genre of horror movies to its foundations than any movies in decades. One is the Blair Witch Project; the other is The Sixth Sense.The horror genre has been mired for some time in the baroque self-indulgence of superficial and ornamental special effects. The Blair Witch Project has come along like the cinematic equivalent of punk rock---stripping away the self-indulgence to help rediscover the elemental core of the genre.The Sixth Sense is quite another matter entirely: it is quite simply a great pop movie----deeply felt, humanistic---and almost certain to be overlooked and underestimated. It is a movie that uses the conventions of the horror genre, but bends them to its own purposes. Like the movie ET, which taught us that not all aliens are unfriendly invaders, and in so doing, liberated the alien/sci fi genre.......so to The Sixth Sense steadfastly refuses to view the spirit world as some adolescent frat-party of frights. Instead, it reacquaints us with the age-old lore that tells us that the dead shall walk the earth as long as their spirits are troubled. The dead do not haunt the earth, and our memories, just to scare us---but because they want something from us, some grace note that gives their lives meaning, and settles old hurts and misunderstandings, but not in the immature and vengeful way that the horror genre had descended into. And we the living want something from the deceased who have left us: we want them to be proud of us, to give us their blessing. And so this movie, incredibly enough for a movie that plays almost straight with the conventions of the horror genre, is a subtle meditation about love and connectedness and relationships, between the living, and between the living and the dead. It is a movie about redemption. And one thing it helps to redeem is the genre that it arises from.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look out for Haley Joel Osment. This kid can act. He is so convincingly frightened, so depressingly sad that he pulls Bruce Willis up to his level, even dragging real tears from the tough guy. The directing is excellent, and the cinemetography extraordinarily beautiful for a suspense/drama. The intriguing plot and excellent acting (by Osment and Willis, anyhow) make up for the slow pace. The only standout drawbacks are the acting of Olivia Williams, playing Willis' wife, and an odd fifteen minute transitional sequence near the end in which it seems footage may have been cut to leave time for the fantastic ending. See it and you'll know what I mean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A taut excercise in directorial discipline...truly thrilling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is that rarity in American Popular film, a true director's picture. M. Night Shyamalan wrote and directed The Sixth Sense, and it is so carefully constructed in every respect that it creates a world with its own natural laws, in the way that Hitchcock's or Ford's films do. Every cast member is in perfect tune with the director's mission here. Bruce Willis, Toni Collette and Olivia Williams play each role beautifully, in service to Shyamalan's story. Haley Joel Osment, as the psychic child Cole, and Donnie Wahlberg, as a homicidal psychotic, deliver two of the years' most powerful performances.This is another of those films about which the less said about plot, the better. Suffice to say there are thrills and chills but no gratuitous violence of any kind. This may be one of the least melodramatic "ghost" pictures in the history of cinema. In tone, it's closer to a movie like "Little Man Tate" than to other horror films which feature children, such as "The Shining" or "Poltergiest". And that subtlety is much to the credit of the director, from whom I'll be looking for great things in the future.PKL</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By far the film that Bruce Willis has done in a while but that is not to say that he carried this film. Bruce really needs to let himself into roles like this more often. He wears them well. If he kept it up he could be the American version of Mel Gibson. Cinematography was solid and considering Tak was behind the camera, it doesn't surprise me. Young Osmet actually appeared to put some thought into his acting. Most child actors appear to be nothing more than parrots for the director, mimicking the commands of the script but not having the experience or emotional base from which to truly act the scene. Not in this case. Haley Osmet did a wonderful job making his character emote. Have seen most of the better films of the year and so far this one captured me more than any of the others. I really truly believe that to honestly experience a good film you must go into the theater weaponless, bring nothing but what you are, your life experiences. Otherwise, the experience always becomes something that was preconceived and you guard yourself from participating in the story. This one rattled the chains of my fathers death while I watched it. Anybody who has had someone close to them pass on will connect to this film in varying degrees. Things left undone and unsaid and so on. It is a tender and meticulously, well thought out story and it *will* get you in the end. Go see it and try to honestly find anything wrong with it. Some of you may be able to pick out the plot early but it shouldn't disrupt your enjoying the film. Doesn't depend on overwhelming buckets 'O' blood or viscous, needless cursing and people lathering each other with their tongues or computer generated whiz-bangs. Even a little spooky in places.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well let me say after seeing "The Jackel" and "Mercury Rising" I was almost giving up on our old friend Bruce. He was good in "The Siege" but that was Mr. Washington's movie. But after seeing "6th Sense" let me be one of the first to say......BRUCE IS BACK, BRUCE IS BACK. As Peter Travers from Rolling Stone said, we finally get to see Bruce Willis the actor for a change. To talk about the plot/story of the film is to begin to taint it for those who have not seen it. Don't read reviews, don't listen to people talk about it, just go see it. With all the supernatural thrillers, I was the most excited for The Blair Witch Project. After seeing that terrible film I was happy to see a movie that could scare me or at least creep me out. For everyone who makes a big deal about the unseen terror well wait til you see what you can't in 6th Sense ( if that confuses you don't worry). Hopefully upcoming thrillers like "Stigmata" and "End Of Days" are as clever and well-crafted as this film was. I am happy for Bruce and most of all happy to see such a good film to come out this summer to keep this summer's trend of excellent movies (for the most part)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Willis away from greatness...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sixth Sense"When Bruce Willis decides to act, it's an important occasion. When slogging through misfires like "Mercury Rising" and pure junk like "Armageddon", Willis never gets a chance to show the more dramatic side to his personality. "Sixth Sense" is the first product of the new Willis-no-guns philosophy that Bruce recently has made public. While it aspires to be "The Exorcist" for 1999, "Sixth Sense" can only muster the atmosphere of an off episode of "X-Files". A downright incomprehensible thriller that is too concerned with mood to care about the laughable story.The real star of the picture is young Haley Joel Osmet (the easy bio is to say Forrest Jr. in "Forrest Gump"). He plays a young boy named Cole who has the ability to see the dead. The life-challenged repeatedly harass and torture him to a point when the entire world the surrounds Cole views him as a freak. While his mother (gifted Toni Collett) cannot understand the secrets Cole keeps, a child psychiatrist (Willis) finds himself drawn to help the young child. The two set out to crack the mystery of why Cole is the chosen one.Written and directed by first-timer M. Night Shyamalan, the film has all the trappings of a debut movie. It's careful with every detail, visually flat, and has trouble sustaining interest throughout. What the film does just right is creating some creepy moments. Moments that could have forced the film to take a more disturbing note, thereby making the movie memorable. What Shyamalan does is punctuate each heightened situation with a orchestral bang or any other Dolby scare tactic used by every modern film to grab a scare. I keep wondering why directors do this. Sure, it gets a jolt out of the audience, but it's an easy one that isn't earned. A real horror film shouldn't have to lower itself to get a fright out of the audience. In the end, "Dolby scares" do more harm than good. "Sixth Sense" had the goods to really disrupt the audience, instead it hits all the same notes.Bruce Willis swearing off action films might be the worst mistake Willis has made. His best work has been in this genre (the "Die Hard" series) and giving it up leaves him with a plethora of father and psychiatrist roles to play for the rest of his career. We meet a kinder, gentler Willis in "Sixth Sense". It's a performance that isn't among the actor's best, yet is far from an embarrassment. Willis plays his character rather muted, never once opening up for the big emotions. You could say that was his character, but I suggest that Willis just doesn't know how to play anyone who doesn't have an urgent situation to take care of. I love Willis, but "Sixth Sense" doesn't require much from the actor except pursed lips and a really obnoxious hairpiece. Ten year old Haley Joel Osment, on the other hand, has a remarkable depth and range for a child his age. It is his acting that grounds "Sense" emotionally. I enjoyed his work here very much, and a simple scene of mother and son bonding in a shopping cart clearly showed the chemistry Osment shared with on-screen mom Collett.A victim of crass Disney mismarketing, "Sixth Sense" isn't really much more than a light thriller with demonic overtones. Shyamalan's script often goes on wild tangents. Scenes with Willis and his wife (shockingly unused Olivia Williams, seen last in "Rushmore") that are supposed to pay off at the end of the picture are left wide open for questions dealing with simple logic. Another moment in which Osment helps a little dead girl to justice seems from a different movie. The entire film appears to make little sense, yet to question what you're watching is obviously not the point. Shamalyan's script is also without dialog, just characters delivering speeches to each other. It's all tiring after an hour or so.Like this summer's "Arlington Road", the entire film hinges on a last minute plot twist. A twist that is supposed to knock you off your feet. While I was surprised by the ending, it's such an illogical and implausible plot turn that it's hard not to laugh at it. Coming out of the film I was disappointed in the PG-13 "Sense". The next film to try this plot (Scorsese's next, "Bringing Out The Dead", features a similar idea) should just try to take the material more seriously, give it a chance to creep us out instead of forcing it. "Sixth Sense" is just another forgettable thriller.---------- 3</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a change, this is a ghost story that does not rely on over-drawn special effects or excessive gore. What remains is a well-crafted script attached to a remarkable film. This movie is genuinely frightening, in ways that I haven't seen in years.The plot is quite simple on the surface. Bruce Willis plays a troubled psychologist who has difficulty communicating with his wife. He takes on the case of a child who is frightened by something mysterious and who also resembles a case that went horribly wrong, resulting in a break-in and a shooting.When the little boy tells Willis that he can see dead people, the movie becomes remarkably chilling. It is a sort of thrill ride without a hack-and-slash plot, leading up to a surprise climax that is worthy of written speculative fiction. All of the leads perform marvellously, and are truly convincing.Perhaps the only flaw is that once the surprise twist has become known, several fairly large plot holes arise as one thinks back on the film. However, this is a remarkable enough film that they do not detract horribly from the experience.Definitely worth seeing, and worth the money for admission. 4/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie mostly because of the review I read in the paper. It reminded me of an anxious child who had been sworn to secrecy over something but was dying to tell you anyway in that the basic tone of the review was "it's so incredibly good, but I can't tell you why!" The last line of the review was even something to the effect of "after you see this movie, don't tell anyone how it ends." I went into the movie a sceptic. Now, I'm approaching this comment with the same enthusiasm as that excited reviewer.For starters, I'd never seen Haley Joel Osment (Cole) in anything before. I hope to see him again. Many times. The child was amazing. He did a better job than most adult actors I've seen. I'm very impressed.Also, not many movies cause me to lose sleep at night because I have to double check the shadows on the wall. "The Sixth Sense" is one of those that does. This is one of those movies that leaves you with "one of those feelings," the kind where you go home and drag the dog around with you "just in case."If you're one of those "I don't know if I want to see it..." people, I strongly suggest you do. Even if it's only for the last fifteen minutes (which, trust me, are what make this one of the most original movies I've ever seen), you will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought The Sixth Sense was simply stunning. I was prepared to see a scary ghost movie, but I ended up watching a film which combines elements of many genres effectively. I enjoyed the acting thoroughly, as well as the plot. The ending was a real twist, a great wrap-up, if somewhat anti-climactic... Overall, I'd rate this movie highly and recommend it to anyone not impressed by the so-far uninspired summer blockbusters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie I've seen all year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most horror/thriller movies see how far they can go to scare the hell out of a person. They'll usually start with a grisly murder, or something that foreshadows the many grisly murders that will occur during the movie. Though this formula can sometimes be effective, it gets old and sour faster than you can scream bloody murder.The Sixth Sense, however, defies all the conventional horror rules. Instead of putting together a series of unlikely events that ends up as a bloodbath at the end, it slowly draws the audience into its web of mystery and thrills. Though it does start with an event that foreshadows events in the movie, it does it in a way that nobody will expect. In a tense yet nuanced style, it keeps you enthralled in the plotline while finally blowing you away at the end.The performances are Oscar-caliber, at least by 11 year old actor Haley Joel Osment. Though Bruce Willis's performance isn't bad (and a very refreshing change from his usual action fare), its this kid that carries the movie, and drives the emotion home. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing all the crappy "scary" movies that I've seen in my life, I was very reluctant to go out and see yet another "thriller." But little did I know that The Sixth Sense is one of THE best (and scariest!!) movies that I have ever seen, if not THE best. The acting was superb, the plot was frightening and original, and all the great plot twists made the movie excellent. This movie makes the Haunting look like crap. The Sixth Sense has no sex, very little violence and cussing, and manages to give you the scare of your life without special effects, blood and gore, and cheap thrills. But if you are one of those druggees who only thinks that slasher+sex movies like Scream are scary, this movie is too complicated for you little brains to handle. So, I ORDER you to go out and see this movie!! Believe me, you WILL NOT regret it. At all. Have fun!!"The Sixth Sense"---- rating~********** (out of 10)-2001Rulz</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the president of a ghost research team, I'm always looking for "good" ghost movies. And I rarely find them. (The last "good" one I saw was "Poltergeist." How sad is that?) I took in this movie and "The Blair Witch Project" back-to-back, with "The Sixth Sense" as a matinee, and "TBWP" as an evening movie. I wish I had seen "TSS" second. I was less than impressed by "TBWP"--and completely blown away by "TSS." Not only was the story good, the directing good, the acting top-notch (though the editing could use some work)--but it was VERY well researched. It's hard to find a ghost movie that has any bearing on what those of us in the ghost researching field believe to be true of ghost phenomena ("Poltergeist" is actually a good example of not-so-hot research). Whoever wrote this did their homework--I saw each piece of evidence before it was explained, because of my background. And the ending...I'm the sort of person who needs to know the ending ahead of time. I didn't in this instance, and for once I'm GLAD I didn't.Incredible. Don't let your fear/hatred/disgust of Bruce Willis keep you away. He's quite good, and Haley is absolutely wonderful. SEE THIS MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Willis away from greatness...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sixth Sense"When Bruce Willis decides to act, it's an important occasion. When slogging through misfires like "Mercury Rising" and pure junk like "Armageddon", Willis never gets a chance to show the more dramatic side to his personality. "Sixth Sense" is the first product of the new Willis-no-guns philosophy that Bruce recently has made public. While it aspires to be "The Exorcist" for 1999, "Sixth Sense" can only muster the atmosphere of an off episode of "X-Files". A downright incomprehensible thriller that is too concerned with mood to care about the laughable story.The real star of the picture is young Haley Joel Osmet (the easy bio is to say Forrest Jr. in "Forrest Gump"). He plays a young boy named Cole who has the ability to see the dead. The life-challenged repeatedly harass and torture him to a point when the entire world the surrounds Cole views him as a freak. While his mother (gifted Toni Collett) cannot understand the secrets Cole keeps, a child psychiatrist (Willis) finds himself drawn to help the young child. The two set out to crack the mystery of why Cole is the chosen one.Written and directed by first-timer M. Night Shyamalan, the film has all the trappings of a debut movie. It's careful with every detail, visually flat, and has trouble sustaining interest throughout. What the film does just right is creating some creepy moments. Moments that could have forced the film to take a more disturbing note, thereby making the movie memorable. What Shyamalan does is punctuate each heightened situation with a orchestral bang or any other Dolby scare tactic used by every modern film to grab a scare. I keep wondering why directors do this. Sure, it gets a jolt out of the audience, but it's an easy one that isn't earned. A real horror film shouldn't have to lower itself to get a fright out of the audience. In the end, "Dolby scares" do more harm than good. "Sixth Sense" had the goods to really disrupt the audience, instead it hits all the same notes.Bruce Willis swearing off action films might be the worst mistake Willis has made. His best work has been in this genre (the "Die Hard" series) and giving it up leaves him with a plethora of father and psychiatrist roles to play for the rest of his career. We meet a kinder, gentler Willis in "Sixth Sense". It's a performance that isn't among the actor's best, yet is far from an embarrassment. Willis plays his character rather muted, never once opening up for the big emotions. You could say that was his character, but I suggest that Willis just doesn't know how to play anyone who doesn't have an urgent situation to take care of. I love Willis, but "Sixth Sense" doesn't require much from the actor except pursed lips and a really obnoxious hairpiece. Ten year old Haley Joel Osment, on the other hand, has a remarkable depth and range for a child his age. It is his acting that grounds "Sense" emotionally. I enjoyed his work here very much, and a simple scene of mother and son bonding in a shopping cart clearly showed the chemistry Osment shared with on-screen mom Collett.A victim of crass Disney mismarketing, "Sixth Sense" isn't really much more than a light thriller with demonic overtones.

		<fullReview>As the president of a ghost research team, I'm always looking for "good" ghost movies. And I rarely find them. (The last "good" one I saw was "Poltergeist." How sad is that?) I took in this movie and "The Blair Witch Project" back-to-back, with "The Sixth Sense" as a matinee, and "TBWP" as an evening movie. I wish I had seen "TSS" second. I was less than impressed by "TBWP"--and completely blown away by "TSS." Not only was the story good, the directing good, the acting top-notch (though the editing could use some work)--but it was VERY well researched. It's hard to find a ghost movie that has any bearing on what those of us in the ghost researching field believe to be true of ghost phenomena ("Poltergeist" is actually a good example of not-so-hot research). Whoever wrote this did their homework--I saw each piece of evidence before it was explained, because of my background. And the ending...I'm the sort of person who needs to know the ending ahead of time. I didn't in this instance, and for once I'm GLAD I didn't.Incredible. Don't let your fear/hatred/disgust of Bruce Willis keep you away. He's quite good, and Haley is absolutely wonderful. SEE THIS MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Willis away from greatness...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sixth Sense"When Bruce Willis decides to act, it's an important occasion. When slogging through misfires like "Mercury Rising" and pure junk like "Armageddon", Willis never gets a chance to show the more dramatic side to his personality. "Sixth Sense" is the first product of the new Willis-no-guns philosophy that Bruce recently has made public. While it aspires to be "The Exorcist" for 1999, "Sixth Sense" can only muster the atmosphere of an off episode of "X-Files". A downright incomprehensible thriller that is too concerned with mood to care about the laughable story.The real star of the picture is young Haley Joel Osmet (the easy bio is to say Forrest Jr. in "Forrest Gump"). He plays a young boy named Cole who has the ability to see the dead. The life-challenged repeatedly harass and torture him to a point when the entire world the surrounds Cole views him as a freak. While his mother (gifted Toni Collett) cannot understand the secrets Cole keeps, a child psychiatrist (Willis) finds himself drawn to help the young child. The two set out to crack the mystery of why Cole is the chosen one.Written and directed by first-timer M. Night Shyamalan, the film has all the trappings of a debut movie. It's careful with every detail, visually flat, and has trouble sustaining interest throughout. What the film does just right is creating some creepy moments. Moments that could have forced the film to take a more disturbing note, thereby making the movie memorable. What Shyamalan does is punctuate each heightened situation with a orchestral bang or any other Dolby scare tactic used by every modern film to grab a scare. I keep wondering why directors do this. Sure, it gets a jolt out of the audience, but it's an easy one that isn't earned. A real horror film shouldn't have to lower itself to get a fright out of the audience. In the end, "Dolby scares" do more harm than good. "Sixth Sense" had the goods to really disrupt the audience, instead it hits all the same notes.Bruce Willis swearing off action films might be the worst mistake Willis has made. His best work has been in this genre (the "Die Hard" series) and giving it up leaves him with a plethora of father and psychiatrist roles to play for the rest of his career. We meet a kinder, gentler Willis in "Sixth Sense". It's a performance that isn't among the actor's best, yet is far from an embarrassment. Willis plays his character rather muted, never once opening up for the big emotions. You could say that was his character, but I suggest that Willis just doesn't know how to play anyone who doesn't have an urgent situation to take care of. I love Willis, but "Sixth Sense" doesn't require much from the actor except pursed lips and a really obnoxious hairpiece. Ten year old Haley Joel Osment, on the other hand, has a remarkable depth and range for a child his age. It is his acting that grounds "Sense" emotionally. I enjoyed his work here very much, and a simple scene of mother and son bonding in a shopping cart clearly showed the chemistry Osment shared with on-screen mom Collett.A victim of crass Disney mismarketing, "Sixth Sense" isn't really much more than a light thriller with demonic overtones. Shyamalan's script often goes on wild tangents. Scenes with Willis and his wife (shockingly unused Olivia Williams, seen last in "Rushmore") that are supposed to pay off at the end of the picture are left wide open for questions dealing with simple logic. Another moment in which Osment helps a little dead girl to justice seems from a different movie. The entire film appears to make little sense, yet to question what you're watching is obviously not the point. Shamalyan's script is also without dialog, just characters delivering speeches to each other. It's all tiring after an hour or so.Like this summer's "Arlington Road", the entire film hinges on a last minute plot twist. A twist that is supposed to knock you off your feet. While I was surprised by the ending, it's such an illogical and implausible plot turn that it's hard not to laugh at it. Coming out of the film I was disappointed in the PG-13 "Sense". The next film to try this plot (Scorsese's next, "Bringing Out The Dead", features a similar idea) should just try to take the material more seriously, give it a chance to creep us out instead of forcing it. "Sixth Sense" is just another forgettable thriller.---------- 3</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A welcome breath of fresh air...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a change, this is a ghost story that does not rely on over-drawn special effects or excessive gore. What remains is a well-crafted script attached to a remarkable film. This movie is genuinely frightening, in ways that I haven't seen in years.The plot is quite simple on the surface. Bruce Willis plays a troubled psychologist who has difficulty communicating with his wife. He takes on the case of a child who is frightened by something mysterious and who also resembles a case that went horribly wrong, resulting in a break-in and a shooting.When the little boy tells Willis that he can see dead people, the movie becomes remarkably chilling. It is a sort of thrill ride without a hack-and-slash plot, leading up to a surprise climax that is worthy of written speculative fiction. All of the leads perform marvellously, and are truly convincing.Perhaps the only flaw is that once the surprise twist has become known, several fairly large plot holes arise as one thinks back on the film. However, this is a remarkable enough film that they do not detract horribly from the experience.Definitely worth seeing, and worth the money for admission. 4/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well this movie was just so easy to guess it wasn't even funny, the previews were the best parts of the movies, there wasn't anything in this that you couldn't of guessed, the ending was a little tricky even i didn't pick up on it, but it appears there might of been a really huge plot flaw in it, i loved guessing what would happen down to the word but if you want a dazzling masterpiece of cinema do not see this movie, it's got a great idea and the idea and images are great but the actual movie leaves alot to be desired, bruce willis was great and so was the little boy but oh dear on the rest, of the movie, it was a somewhat original idea but the script didn't follow through it was all rehashed over used crud that i could of written it had a little twist here and there but not enough to keep you really entertained if you like movies, if you don't see movies very often and are easily impressed by them as a result you'll like this it's enough to keep you watching but not enough to really leave you very entertained and you certinally won't talk about it for years to come, the idea is great though...maybe someone else should give it a shot this time with a better script writer and director...at moments the movie was funny even thouhg it shouldn't of been i'm not exactly sure why the left in those parts but oh well...see it if you are easily entertained and being able to guess the movie doesn't bother you.</fullReview>

They're not at all overtly scary or shocking...but they will disquiet you.Between this and "The Blair With Project," perhaps film-makers are learning that size (and noise, and blood) doesn't matter after all.

		<fullReview>i stayed away from reading any reviews for this movie, so that i would be able to go into it unbiased. i only knew that every time i saw the commercials, i got the heebie-jeebies. from two minutes after the movie started, i had the unexplained goosebumps. nothing was shockingly scary, the movie just creeped me out. the story was not dragged out, not overloaded with unforseen twists and turns. the haunted child is completely believable, and is mainly responsible for conveying the creeps to me. i found myself sympathizing with him as a nonfictional human who really was haunted by real ghosts. i remembered how scared i was as a child when an unexplained noise at night freaked me out, and i realized this poor kid must be terrified a million times beyond my level. that spooked me out even more. i won't go into the ending, except that i thought it was quite startling, and well hidden. it was coming, you just didn't know it was coming, unless maybe you were really looking hard for it. go see this flick, it is well worth the high price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful movie, even without the shocker ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie because I like 'scary movies' and this one looked halfway intellectually stimulating. It was that and more. This film will make you feel every emotion- happiness, sadness, shock, fear, pity, anger, fear, shock, joy, fear, shock...did I mention fear and shock?I would recommend this to anyone who likes to be scared, not by gore and special effects, but by psychological twists and turns. Oh, and for all you gore fans, there are a few scenes with blood. ;)Even without the last 15 minutes, this film would have been worth my ticket price. But the last 15 minutes had my jaw on the floor in awe and shock-one of the few times a film has done this for me. Go see it.Bruce Willis gives a haunting performance as a tortured child psychologist trying to make up for a past failure, all the while losing the most important thing to him, his wife. The boy who plays Cole, the child who can see dead people, (I just looked his name up but it escapes me right now) is wonderful. This is one of the few child actors I don't want to smack around 5 minutes into the film. The woman playing his mother also gives a very convincing performance of a woman who desperately loves her son and feels helpless in how to help him.My recommendation: Go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what to expect when I went to see this. The last time I saw Bruce Willis helping out an abnormal young boy was "Mercury Rising", and well, I wasn't that impressed.This movie made me re-evaluate Bruce's acting ability. I now know that he has some. (Quite a lot, actually.) Everyone in this movie seems perfectly suited for their roles. The writing, directing, and orchestrations are all excellent. Why am I singling out incredibly vague points about this movie? Because it is one of those movies that cannot, and should not, be spoiled by anyone, reviewing or not. If anyone tries to tell you anything about this movie (other than that you should see it), cover your ears and yell, "I can't hear you, la-la-la!" You'll thank me later.Though only PG-13, I'd be hard-pressed to recommend it to younger audiences. I'm an adult, but I may have a nightmare or two from this one. But trust me, it's worth the risk.I give this a well-deserved 10. I smell an Oscar or three...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>damn good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Sixth Sense" for the first time last night at the world premiere right here in the City of Brotherly Love. After having read the script beforehand, and after having even seen a few of the audition tapes I was very eager to view the finished product. Now, I'm going to move all my criticisms aside and say that this was a damn good film. This film is intense, uplifting, sad, and downright chilling. I tell you I will NEVER forget the scene when the amazing Haley Joel Osment, who plays the haunted little boy, Cole, is revealing to his mother, Toni Collette, his "secret". The chemistry between Haley and Toni is absolutely stunning.I really think that this is the BEST movie out there right now. My hats off to the writer/director M. Night Shyamalan. He will go very far--perhaps even so far as the Oscars. You never know right? One more thing, if you are at all skeptical about seeing this film, please, just see it for the ending. You won't believe what you see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My faith in the movie industry is slowly being restored. After years of seeing more bad then good films released that insult the intelligence of the audience I was almost ready to give up. In the last two weeks I have seen two fine well written, well acted and well directed films. The latest is the Sixth Sense. This is what moviemaking is all about. How do you scare the crap out of people without using cheap shock gimmicks? See this movie and you'll find out. This was also done in the original movie The Haunting. If you've seen the new Haunting then you know the difference. This movie has the spirit of some of the best Twilight Zones and is also why after so many years that TV show is still a classic. I think Rod Serling would have loved this film. All I can say is thank you to all involved in the making of The Sixth Sense! You have succeeded in creating a film that will stick in the minds of many for years to come!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Haley Joel Osment deserves an Oscar nomination. He's a young boy who sees ghosts, and understands how they've died won't let them rest It causes him to be introverted and isolated His mother is single and works 2 jobs, so he doesn't want to bother her w/his problem. Enter Bruce Willis as a gifted, child psychologist who's suffering from alienation of his own caused by a tragedy some months earlier in his own life. Bruce feels if he can help Haley, he'll make up for another little boy he failed. Bruce is wonderfully restrained, as is Haley, and lets the story carry him along to a unique conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoroughly remarkable filmmaking!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caught The Sixth Sense at a sneak preview. I'd only had the trailer to go on to know what to expect, and besides thinking that trailer suffers from the ?give-too-much-away-itis' that most trailers seem to suffer from these days, I had little clue what to expect. I'd never seen any of M. Night Shyamalan's work, never saw Toni Collette in anything and only had Rushmore to go on in knowing Olivia Williams, so I can tell you I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw tonight. Shyamalan has written a corker of a script, stylish and lean, and his direction is truly remarkable. The pacing may make some impatient gonzos squirm (as it did with the moron behind me who kept muttering back to the screen), but this is no cheap-scare-a-minute wild-cutting frightfest. Instead, we get a moody, creepy and suspenseful masterwork, with a gripping story and great, great performances from the whole cast. Toni Collette and Olivia Williams are excellent, but it is Willis and Haley Joel Osment (Forrest Gump Jr.) that are the backbone of this film, and their work is incredible. Will you be frightened? Yes. Are there scary moments? Yes. Are there any gross-out ghoulies jumping out at you or outrageous FX to make you realize that ?this is the scary part and I'm supposed to scream now?' Most definitely not. What you do get is a convincing and unnerving film that crawls under your skin and waits for the right moment to grab you. Shyamalan is a talent to watch out for, and Willis continues to amaze me with his keen eye for odd projects that turn out to be fantastic movies. Can't wait to see it again. One bit of advice: Go in cold. Don't read reviews, don't talk to friends. Trust me on this, you'll thank me later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw a sneak preview on Friday night, and I must say this is the best work I've ever seen Bruce Willis do. The kid is astounding; this is really an Oscar-caliber performance, especially out of one so young. One of the two movies I've seen so far this year that I would want to see again, and I felt like seeing it again immediately.It does move at a much slower pace than the typical "thriller". Think "Vertigo", not "Psycho"! I agree with one of the other reviewers who compared this film to the original THE HAUNTING. Sometimes a slow buildup is necessary for the full effect of a brilliant film.Go to be thrilled, but don't be surprised to find yourself moved and maybe even a little bit enlightened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A subdued thriller with a pleasant surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sixth Sense: What if you could interact with ghosts? This is the "gift" that 8-year-old Cole (Haley Joel Osmont) must deal with every waking moment, never knowing what disfigured spectre will cross his path next. His teachers think he's dysfunctional, his classmates call him a freak and his mother doesn't know what to make of him. Enter Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), eminent child psychologist (Bruce Willis) who sees Cole as a chance to redeem himself for perceived past failures. First let me state that the advertising for this movie is somewhat misleading as this isn't a horror movie in the classic sense. Given the premise it may sound strange to say that, but the bulk of the movie is spent trying to make us understand Cole's situation rather than trying to scare us every thirty seconds. That said, there are some very good scares.Osmont does an excellent job as the troubled Cole, showing maturity beyond his years - he conveys the terror of his situation without being melodramatic (if only he'd been available for Phantom Menace?). Expect to see a lot more of him in the future. It was also nice to see Willis given a chance to display his acting talents for a change, rather than just blowing things up (not that I don't enjoy that as well). Maybe this will finally give Willis some well deserved credibility and more challenging roles in the future.Finally, although this movie does not exactly keep up a blistering pace, it had one of the best surprises I've seen since "No Way Out".Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Far better than any Bruce Willis movie that isn't directed by Gilliam or Tarantino has any right to be!! He actually is pretty good in it too! An ode to such great 70's thrillers as Roeg's Don't Look Now and Friedkin's The Exorcist, this film is moody, disturbing and visually fascinating. Using all forms of symbolism, including arches, frames within frames (and sometimes frames within frames within frames), spirals, shapes, Dutch angles, cinema verite and deep reds, Tak Fujimoto proves once again why he is one of the most respected and sought after DP's in Hollywood. Toni Colette, I love you!!! I forgive you for Cosi!! She shines in this film. She could have gone for the whiny over the top single mom but instead she walks that fine wire between realism and a typical Hollywood stereotype. Fantastic! If she decides to stay in Hollywood I hope she continues to find great scripts and roles she can make her own. I have decided that Haley Joel Osment is one of those Webster people who only look 10 but are really 60 because no child should be able to emote so well! Lucas, watch this and realize what you could have had! Jake Lloyd, watch this film 40 times and go back to acting school! Mark Whalberg. Wow! I didn't have a clue that it was him until I was reminded in the closing credits that he was even in it. I knew he could act before but he brings intensity to this performance that stays with you throughout the film's duration. Well done. If I have one complaint it is that I felt the jumps and make-up effects were unnecessary. We have seen a child throw up green pee soup before, we don't need to see it again. But it doesn't break the mood. Proof that Hollywood can punch out eerie and smart films when they want to. {If you like this one, and even if you don't, check out Roeg's Don't Look Now!! Maybe it will inspire you as well. Or at least make it harder to fall asleep!}</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just left a sneak preview. A sold out show. A packed house. When the lights came on EVERYONE was weeping. I thought I was the only one trying to hide the sweeping emotional pull that this movie delivered. Yes its spooky (Very). Yes it's a slick production, a summer movie. But THE SIXTH SENSE unmasks itself in an ending that is totally unexpected and shattering.The bad news, a glaring technical flaw about twenty minutes into the film (A boom microphone is CLEARLY visible in TWO shots) that drew a roar of heckles from the audience and came very close to wrecking the movie up to that point.Even with this flaw, the film was STILL able to deliver a knock out-have to see it again to get the full effect-experience.Makes me wonder...How could the film makers not SEE THAT MICROPHONE!It looked ready to pop Bruce Willis on the head! It's hanging close to dead center of the screen for what seems forever! One scene, Willis ACTUALLY SAYS "I feel like I have something hanging over my mind". Yea, the boom microphone! Could they not re-shoot the scenes? Crop the picture? Re-move it digitally? They were simple scenes in what was happening (Room Conversation). If someone knows, drop a line.For this reason ONLY I give it a 9 out of what would have been a well deserved 10.See it with someone you love. You'll know why when the lights come up.</fullReview>

It seemed to sort of hit a bump and they were just randomly tossing scenes at you to past the time, but after seeing the ending I'd had to say it is well worth the wait. The thrills were done well too. It wasn't constant or over bearing, just at the right moments.

I'll be the first to admit i like his full on, big budget, action films, but you also have to admit for every good one (Armageddon), he does a bad one (Mercury Rising). But this is a big massive change. He gives a good performance, not over the top, but just right. A possible oscar nomination? As for the film, well you have to see it. It has everything, a good story line, and a great plot twist. We even have a film, in which a young actor is suprisingly good. Other that stand out is Donnie Wahlberg.

		<shortDescription>One of those movies you can never see the same way again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is directed by M. Night Shayamalan and was released in one of the greatest years for movies ever, 1999. This movie took so many people by surprise, especially being the director's first film. I literally tried to find a flaw with the movie and I'm usually very picky with these things, but I just couldn't find anything wrong with the Sixth Sense. It's a beautifully shot, surprisingly expertly directed movie that is a blend of horror, mystery and suspense. I remember the first time I saw the Sixth Sense, I was terrified. I still find it very scary and even though I know exactly how everything is gonna play out, it's still very suspenseful. The acting is terrific by pretty much everyone, but I have to give a special mention to Harley Joel Osmont, giving what is probably the greatest performance ever by a child actor. Much like another one of my favorite movies that came out in 1999, Fight Club, the Sixth Sense is simply a movie you never see the same after the first viewing. Is this a positive? Absolutely. The Sixth Sense is one of my favorite movies of all time. The only thing I don't like about it is I wish I could erase my memory and see it again for the first time, to be left in awe once again by one of the greatest movie twists of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M. Night Shyamalan on the Map</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense did an excellent job of combining drama with suspense. The cinematography has slow pans and long shots which allow you to sit with each scene and take it all in. From the beginning M. Night Shymalan draws the viewer in with the stillness of the scenes, and immediately you are sucked into the world of Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis).Dr. Malcolm is an award winning child psychologist; however, the story focuses on his feelings about his failure to one of his patients. He sees a second chance for himself in Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), and is determined not to fail this time. Malcolm has self admittedly been detached from his home life and believes that he won't be back to normal until he helps Cole. Cole is a young boy who is the odd one out at school. He fears events that happen around him that no one else can see, and he is afraid to tell anyone his secret. Cole doesn't have any friends and his mother (Toni Collette) is not always able to see everything going on with him due to the responsibilities she takes on as a single mother. M. Night Shyamalan creates a wonderful film that follows the relationship between a troubled young boy and the doctor trying to help him. It begs the audience to suspend belief as you delve deeper into the story. Shyamalan has made a classic that you have to at least see once, but gets better with multiple viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malcom Crowe is a trained psychologist who deal with kids with psychological issues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sixth Sense Malcom Crowe is a trained psychologist who deal with kids with psychological issues. Malcom Crowe was awarded by the city for his enormous contribution in the lives of broken home kids with psychological problems. The same night Malcom received his award, an ex-patient Vincent who claimed that Malcom Crowe did not help him entered Malcom Crowe's home and then shot him. Because of this incident Malcom Crowe took it upon himself to help Cole Sear who happened to have similar problems as Vincent. Cole believed that Malcom was the only one who could help him.The theme of the film "Sixth Sense" is that people have the will to correct their mistakes even after their death. In the film, Malcom was shot dead by Vincent mainly because he could not help Vincent to solve his psychological problems and this made Malcom Crowe to make a committed decision to help Cole a nine year old boy whose psychological problem was increasing. Malcom felt like a second chance was given to him to finish his uncompleted work and so when he got that chance he stayed focused to help Cole Sears. As human beings we often do mistakes that contribute to our downfall but in our struggle we fight our way back to try to correct those mistakes. When people have the opportunity to correct mistakes, they do all what they can to make sure that they get it right. As it was demonstrated by Malcom Crowe, he was able to help Cole to come out of his psychological problem.The lighting in the film Sixth sense is mostly Low-Key lighting and somewhat dark. The lighting does not look bright and that indicates sadness or that something terrible is about to happen. Taking a close look at the opening scene, at the basement where Anna Crowe the wife of Malcom Crowe was picking up a wine from the shelf, it was dark and that presuppose that something terrible was about to happen. Lo and behold, Malcom Crowe was shot by Vincent shortly after they entered their bedroom.Sixth Sense film's camera movement was very extraordinary in the sense that shot were taking close to the characters. These shots illustrates the characters emotions. The shot taking at the scene where Cole Sears was talking to Malcom Crowe while he was in bed, shows that he was crying and timid and that is the best form of him expressing his emotions.Sixth Sense is an incredible film. It touches the bases of the effect of broken home, Doctors commitment to help kids with psychological problems and the treatment giving to kids with psychological problems at school. I think broken home parents should be committed to do their best to help kids with psychological problems and also schools should make sure that kids with psychological issues are protected by so doing past mistakes will be corrected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghost Humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Initially, right now I'm really interested in humanity-subject. Not the kind of human race, but the human-feeling inside. I mean our conscience, or our human instinct. Yes, human as true human, not just a slave, weirdo, crazy-man, or etc. And The Sixth Sense (1999), just give another kind of human, a gifted boy as human. Yes, for such a talented boy, not everybody will accept him. The protagonist, Cole Sear, is just another ordinary child who also need to be loved, listened, and appreciated, in spite of his sixth sense. Before this, I just want to make a clear side about how I see the ghost itself. So, honestly I still believe in ghost, in other dimension of our world. The "cinema reason" is so that I can enjoy the horror-movie and movie like this. Yes, maybe just in the movie I believe in ghost. But, usually ghost-movie is identical with horror, and The Sixth Sense make the very opposite perspective. A ghost-cinema with humanity approach. There are two main idea of this review, humanity in people who sees ghost and in spirit itself.The basic idea is human knows to be human. So for this case, Cole really knows how other people really think of him. And how he should do to be normal-child. But, he just can't hold this ability. He sees dead-people everyday, he is afraid as a normal human. The problem is, nobody cares of him, what a pity. He just need someone who doesn't think he's nuts. Until he met a child psychologist, who on the first time doesn't believe in him. This is one of the essential human needs, the needs to be appreciated and accepted. Human can't live without this. And this movie delivers tiny message of it.The other humanity is in ghost itself. In movie, I believe in ghost like I said. So, from this movie, we learn that they are also need to be listened. However, not all people see them. And someone who can see them, such as Cole, afraid of their scary physical body. Let's say, if you look people with leprosy or other horrible disease, you will afraid of them, especially help them. This is what I get, everybody even ghost need to be listened. In real life, you can learn from people with acute health or physical problem. Of course, it takes time and great bunch of tolerance, but at the end we can see the joy of caring other people.From the core of movie, let's review the extrinsic part. So twisted and simple. The story is just nothing but superb. That's why I rated it 8 out of 10. Why not 9, because the cinematography is also simple, the setting is monotonous. But, what's good in movie, is just the original yet unique idea. This movie just make another breakthrough of how should we see ghost added by wonderful story and natural acting. Just another great cinema in 1999 epic year of movie.</fullReview>

And the acting is different enough to keep you intrigued.However the plot is so bad that I was really disappointed in the end. Half way through the movie I figured that Malcolm was dead himself, but decided again that it wasn't so. Too many events were contradicting this conclusion. So when in the end Malcolm turned out to be really dead I felt tricked. So I watched the movie back and concluded that this plot was really unrealistic and badly written.I didn't get the fuss around this movie in the 90's and still don't get it. This movie should get a very low rating, because the storyline is just terrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By now you've probably heard about the legendary fame the ending of the sixth sense has gained, and ultimately I'd say thats one of the only reasons for this films success.The film stars Bruce Willis as a psychologist who after being attacked in his home by a patient he failed to help, tries to put his career back together by helping a troubled child played brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment who claims to be able to see dead people.The movie is quite slow moving although has some OK laughs, but while its not terrible, the core bulk of the film is mostly forgettable.The acting is mixed, Bruce Willis does OK although I've seen him act better, Haley Joel Osment on the other hand acts amazingly, in what I'd say is one of the greatest child performances ever.Its really the ending that holds this film together, I can say if you already know the ending somehow before watching the film the it won't be anywhere near as good as what it would be.Overall its a film worth a watch, but after you know all the films surprises then there's really no reason to watch again.</fullReview>

Either way, I guess you'll see it to find out what all the fuss is about.Haley Joel Osment is fantastic as the little boy whose sixth sense haunts him and singles him out as a freak. Willis, in his best role since "Pulp Ficton", is ideal as the troubled psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe, who tries to help young Cole and exorcise his own demons at the same time. In support is Olivia Williams, strong as Crowe's distant wife, and the amazingly talented Toni Collette; who does a marvellous job as Cole's distraught mom - even her subtle accent is precise.Much more could be added; suffice to say all credit to Mr. Shyamalan's finely tuned screenplay and his astute direction.

		<fullReview>Dr Malcolm Crowe is a child psychologist trying to help Cole, a boy who suffers from extreme anxiety. After gradually gaining his trust, Cole tells Malcolm his terrible secret; he sees ghosts all around him. But Cole also knows something Malcolm doesn't ?One of the most beautifully crafted and thought-provoking American movies in recent times, this is an unforgettably spooky thriller with a final twist of such deliciously clever proportions it rivals Les Diaboliques, Psycho and The Usual Suspects. What makes it so terrific for me though is Shyamalan's quiet, concentrated style; his film is the opposite of something like The Omen - it's slow, subtle, intimate, but highly focused and intense. A lesser horror movie director uses loud noises and screaming performances; Shyamalan doesn't need to. His story, characters and grasp of film grammar are so strong that pulling the focus down into long, loosely composed shots results in a much richer picture. Scenes like the one where Cole's mother loses her temper with him over the pendant are typical of this - one simple shot of a little kitchen, where what's going on emotionally carries a tremendous dramatic wallop. If only all directors as young as this guy understood how to do this. Similarly, the casting of Willis is a real masterstroke - an action actor known for barnstorming pyrotechnics reigned in here to a slight, slow, careful performance which is arguably the best in his career. Equally good is the amazingly mature Osmont (who was eleven), at once convincing us of his fantastic predicament but also grasping the tone of the story perfectly. The other crucial element here is James Newton Howard's tingling score, which slides around the wintry Philadephia streets, creeps up behind us when we're not looking and creates an almost tangible sense of fear and danger. Horror movie music is the hardest to write and the most effective when done well, and this is a classic case of how to do it right; Shyamalan has wisely secured Howard's services on all his subsequent films. This was a deservedly big hit on release, probably because it effectively combines horror, thriller and drama elements, and appeals to fans of all. In essence however it's just a great story, four fascinating characters, great photography (by Tak Fujimoto), scary music, and enchanting viewing. Trivia - the director appears in his customary small role as the doctor who talks to Cole's mother at the hospital.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie a few day's ago. It is definitely worth watching. It had a good cast. The three leads performed their characters quite well. (Toni Collete, Bruce Willis, and especially Haley Joel Osment). This movie actually wasn't all too scary. It was very suspenseful while I was watching it (which was late at night). The strange thing is I experienced more anticipation in this movie than any ever. As far as horror goes anyway. It really had me on the edge of my seat in some scenes, with my heart thumping. Then again, movies are a lot scarier in a quiet setting with the lights off. It also made the hairs on my arm stand up. (you can hear an explanation of why this happens in the movie). I appreciate scary movies like this a lot more than the graphic ones. They have more depth and are not built just around shocking scenes. I enjoyed The Ring, and 1408.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best "thinking" movie all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will not be reviewing The Sixth Sense. I will be reviewing M. Night Shyamalan's flawless masterpiece.First off, the acting in this movie is beyond excellent. Haley Joel Osment delivers a great performance as the character Cole, and Bruce Willis as Dr. Crowe delivers an equally good role, if not a better one. But who plays the better role is out of the question when you are talking about a movie of such quality as this. Shyamalan did such a great job with the writing of this movie and like my summary suggests, this movie really makes you think. And by the end, all of the loose ends or missing puzzle pieces come together and everything makes sense. You can watch this movie several times over and you will always pick up something you missed the last time. I have seen a few movies that had a big twist ending, and this has gotta be the 2nd best twist ending of all time- Only behind Stephen King's "The Mist." But when you look at the entire picture, Sixth Sense is the superior film, The Mist only had the superior ending.I suggest you drink some caffeine before watching this, because you need to watch it at night with the lights out, but you can't be sleepy, because you're going to need your thinking cap for this. But as long as you give it your attention (while still having a good time watching) you will thoroughly enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Review: If ever there was a film so terrifying, so perfected, so spine-tingling and so awe-inspiring in the world today then i don't think there could be any other like this in it's class, and The sixth Sense is that film. To state this movie as a masterpiece is stating the obvious, but The Sixth Sense is so much more than mastery. It's a carefully perfected and orchestrated phenomenon of a film that will touch every nerve in your body and will shake you to the very core.M. Night Shyamalan, the work and brains of this unique film has created a film that is bound to live in our memories for ever.Verdict: A powerful and spine-nerching horror thriller that should rightly take it's place among the greatest films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A clever, gore-free horror thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though many believe it to be true, The Sixth Sense is not M. Night Shyamalan's directorial debut (in fact, it's his third movie), but that myth holds up well because no one knew about him before this film. Not his proper first, then, but the first significant one, and deservedly so.Influenced by TV shows like Tales of the Unexpected and The Twilight Zone, Shyamalan crafts a slow-burning, low-key thriller that grabs the viewer right from the beginning: psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is enjoying an evening at home with his wife when he's suddenly attacked by a former patient (Donnie Wahlberg). Months after this shocking prologue, Malcolm's marriage is in jeopardy and he needs some kind of redemption for what he believes to be a professional failure. He finds that redemption in the shape of Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a young boy with a terrifying psychic gift, best described by the kid himself: "I see dead people!".That line has been aped countless times since the movie's release, as has the now legendary twist ending, which has become a Shyamalan trademark. But knowing about the twist, or guessing what it is at an early stage of the viewing, is beside the point: it isn't the ending itself that matters, but the build-up. Consider other famous "twist" movies, like The Crying Game, Psycho, The Usual Suspects or Fight Club: the revelations at the end or halfway through those features are brilliant, no doubt, but if the overall film is bad it will diminish the epilogue's impact, no matter how smart the latter is.As such, when watching The Sixth Sense, the attention shouldn't go to the climax, but to everything that precedes it: how Shyamalan creates tension with very few camera movements, most of the creeps coming from James Newton Howard's score; how the story evolves slowly and naturally, enabling us to care for the characters and their inner struggles; how the subdued Willis and the creepy Osment constitute one of cinema's best on-screen duos, with able support from Wahlberg, Toni Collette and others (Mischa Barton's cameo is one of the scariest things of the '90s).The trick is in the smaller details, and that's what makes The Sixth Sense an immensely satisfying experience. Instead of gore and monsters, Shyamalan uses psychology and subtle chills to construct a memorably unsettling atmosphere, adding emotion on top. And, of course, the unsurpassed ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie by accident when I was visiting my friend, we were a bit bored and so we decided to watch a movie, and what a great choice it was. The sixth sense.At the first 30 minutes of the movie you'll be a bit bored, but after that the excitement begins and you start thinking about what is really happening.The films is an awesome horror, an exciting thriller and a magnificent mystery that will make you say,'Wow, Oh my god that's brilliant'.When I looked at IMDb best mystery films, I was surprised that the film was not on the top. This film should have won every Oscar that it was nominated for including best picture, because I don't think there was a picture better then this film in 1999.My advice to everyone is to watch the film as soon as they can, just watch it and do yourself a big favour.</fullReview>

Otherwise though, I have enjoyed watching the film again and noticing the twist unfolding once more. The standard of the questions for coursework is shocking though, and you have to write about the smallest things, like the camera shots and angles. The film was enjoyable though, and I would recommend my friends to watch this film. I think the twist is excellent though, really unexpected. Hats off to the director and writer!Amy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved it, it made me cry. It wasn't my favorite, well actually it WAS. M. Night Shyamalan made this brilliant movie of a boy who has the sixth sense, seeing dead people. It was great because you don't know whats going to hit you, and thats how a real movie should be. It was the best movie i have seen in years. And like my brother even told me before i saw it, it will stick with you forever. The plot was great. Everything. Haley Joel Osment did a wonderful job. anyways you knew what was going to happen when you were about to watch it, but then that is when the movie hits you, at the end. Pay close attention to the details in this movie. It can be watched by younger people, but its not a highly recommended movie to watch with very young people. I hope this review helped</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a truly amazing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is an absolute gem, it is one of those challenging films that will stick in your mind and have you thinking about it for weeks after watching it. The plot is downright genius, it's so cleverly and precisely orchestrated that the resulting twist will just leave your jaw rightfully on the floor! The twist is so shocking, I will avoid the overwhelming temptation to give it away, watching it in ignorance will ultimately have the best effect.The cast is superb, Hollywood superstar Bruce Willis gives a refreshing change of pace performance as award winning child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe. Joining him is the critically acclaimed child actor Haley Joel Osment, last seen in Artificial Intelligence. The acting talents of this young boy are phenomenal, I have never seen such powerful presence, he is mature beyond his years.Haley thoroughly deserved recognition in the form of an Oscar nomination for his role as 'Cole'; a gifted young boy with the exceptional ability of having the sixth sense. Possessing this gift however only serves to create fear in the mind of a nine year old, and scepticism in everyone around him. Cole experiences terrifying, unwanted visits from the spiritual world, which inevitably leads to his social isolation. Dr. Crowe recognises Coles behaviour, and remembers many years back when he had a patient with the same symptoms. This patient however left a painful impact on his conscience, as he was unable to help. Dr. Crowe then seeks to redeem himself by doing everything in his power to help troubled Cole.As Cole is alone in seeing and hearing these suffering spirits, it is also he who must help them rest. To do this Cole must confront his nightmare. It is only with Dr. Crowe's suggestion to listen to them, he makes the discovery that they are not there to haunt him, but instead only want his assistance in their unfinished business.With the riveting intensity you'll find thoroughly chilling and utterly forgettable, The Sixth Sense is a must see movie.The 2 disc collectors edition has wonderful special features, including exclusive interviews with the cast and writer/director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A daily comment from Midget Emma: The Sixth Sense (1999)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A creepy little spook movie to watch on a Saturday night. The Sixth Sense will remain a classic for a very long time if not forever. 10 star performances and a little twist at the end makes a good movie.I don't like movies that keep me up at night. This didn't but it had me turning around a lot hoping for a spirit not to be standing behind me. This is one of those movies that will scare the hell out of some and will not even make some jump. It depends on what sort of person you are. If pale ghosts with slit wrists walking past doors scare you then you may not want to see this movie.The twist was good. I didn't see that coming. But some will see it coming a mile away. It was ruined for some by 50 first dates.WARNING: DO NOT WATCH 50 FIRST DATES BEFORE WATCHING THIS. IT GIVES THE ENDING AWAY.Check out my 50 First Dates comment: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343660/usercomments-enterLuckily i had seen The Sixth Sense before i saw 50 first dates.Now the acting. It is extremely rare to find a great performance from a kid. But Haley Joel Osment gave me the greatest performance i have ever seen from a child. He is disturbing and a cursed kid. Bruce Willis plays a very different role then the hero John McClane. But he was still good. But the one who stole the show was Toni Collette. She was just so natural and great. She played Haley Joel's mum. She was just excellent.You might be thinking why has she said it is so good and then gave it an 8/10. Well i am not a fan of this movies at all. But on its own it is a great movie. Make your own decision. I recommend it.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the best horror movies ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen and it really proves what an excellent film maker M. Night Schymalan is. I don't think the pace of the movie is too slow, it's necessary to build up the right tension. I saw the movie three times in the theathres in 1999 and I was just as scared every single time. Just like in all movies by this director the ending is very surprising. Still, I don't think that Schymalan has ever made a movie this good again. Unbreakable was a decent movie, so was Signs and The Village but they're not even close to The Sixth Sense. Haley Joel Osment is with out a doubt the best child actor ever and it's too bad you don't see him in so many movies today, except for that time in the news when he was caught drunk driving. In my opinion this is a movie that everybody should see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most frightening scenes in this film which people rarely seem to mention is at the beginning when that guy with no clothes on jumps into the house of our child psychologist, the speech he makes before he hits the trigger sent a shiver up my spine immediately. Its a cold scene that shatters the warm atmosphere they are in before he appears. Our child Psychologist becomes obsessed with helping one of his patients, a terrified young boy who sees dead people, the two leads are magnificent, a good script even if you guess the downbeat ending, at the time I did not because these kind of twists were still just about becoming in vogue. Actually when I saw this film I loved it because it had a new recipe to horror movies, it struck new chords inside which is not always easy. The parts I found very creepy is that our camera inside the house plays the eyes of the dead, which I found very threatening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Two Cents on "The Sixth Sense"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My congratulations to a fine direction by M. Night Shyamalan. His film, The Sixth Sense is a spectacular movie, with special effects and especially the way it plays out. Shyamalan does such a great job concealing the secrets until the end. But those secrets are only good when it is the first time you are watching the movie. The second time around, you know what is going to happen, and the suspense suffers quite a lot from this layout.The storyline was wonderful, and this is something that could happen to people. The Sixth Sense is a spine tingling good time, that anyone will enjoy, at least the first time viewing it anyway. Bruce Willis did such a great job acting as Malcom in the film, you wouldn't suspect anything to be up. It just looks as though he an his wife are not speaking. To know the real truth behind "The Sixth Sense", you have to see this thriller for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine what seeing this film would have been like if you had known the ending in advance. All those oh-so-clever scenes where Willis's character alternates dialog with the character of his wife... they'd be about as gripping as a magic trick when you already know that it's done with mirrors.Well, that's how it was for me. At the moment he meets the boy in the church, I turned to my wife and said, "He's ____." Honestly, I had not seen any of the promos, nor heard any of the hype, for this film. My wife picked it. So, when I got the "punch line" early, the next hour or so became a dreary, repetitious slog, with me dumbfounded by the inability of the rest of the audience (I spent about as much time watching them as watching the screen) to see what, I thought, was so blazingly obvious.Great idea(s) in this film, but hanging so much of it on one "surprise" at the end was a dumb move, in my humble opinion. For those of us who saw it coming (and, really, I'm not the most perceptive fellow around; can so many folks have actually been fooled?), the surprise was that we were still awake to hear our neighbors gasp.</fullReview>

His casting with Hayley Joel Osment as Cole and Bruce Willis as Dr. Malcom Crow, Toni Collette as Cole's mother work so well together. Bruce has thrown his blood stained vest in the garbage to do this role, he is utterly believable. I never once thought about his famous catchphrase from his Die Hard film, Yipee Kie hey Mother ******! Hayley Joel Osment is such a great actor beyond his years, it is the first film I have seen where a child actor totally captures such an emotional role. His eyes, face say more than his words, Hayley is a fantastic actor and I hope to see him in more films soon. Toni Collete I think is brilliant in the role of Coles mother she is captivating and has such a fantastic screen appeal. The story has a twist at the end which I think is clever. Overall this film gets 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is one of the celebrated movies of all time more because of its mind-blowing climax. To me however, the movie stands for much more than just its ending. In particular, the two relationships in the movie, that between Cole and his mother, Lynn, and between Malcolm and Anna were handled with great delicacy.Toni Collette has delivered a flawless performance as Cole's exasperated mom who tries in vain to understand her son's psychological nightmares. The scenes between mother and son are few in number but have been constructed with great care and meticulousness and go a long way in describing their relationship.In the case of Malcolm and Anna, the former's confessions to Cole about his marital problems and Anna's vacant stares into space also describe their strained marriage effectively.The scenes where Cole confesses his biggest secret to his mother and Malcolm talks to Anna in her sleep are, in my opinion, Shyamalan at his very best. With minimal but very effective dialogues, he shows why he is the master of underplay and subtlety.The Sixth Sense truly is M. Shyamalan Night's masterpiece.</fullReview>

I can see that it was well made and that Bruce Willis played a different kind of role, sort of a caring, sensitive persona.i kept waiting for the movie to get better and since i have friends who all have big mouths and told me the ending, maybe that was why I did not enjoy it as much. Nonetheless, I found it boring and drawn out. "I see dead people" was probably a giveaway, but still it lacked excitement and substance.Maybe it is me and I am just too critical, but I have often found myself not liking movies that everyone else seems to think are masterpieces.I like Bruce Willis and he has made some good movies, some bad ones. This one falls somewhere in the middle. i really tried to get into it, but maybe it was too deep for me. I am willing to see it again and maybe, even though I know the ending, I will appreciate it more.It was not a disaster though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I'am very confused about myself concerning this film. The first time I saw it (about two years before) I was greatly impressed and its end really shocked me. Recently I recommended it to my wife and proposed her to see it together. The video player started and I was sitting by her ready to respond to her admiration (as I expected). What happened really shocked me. It was not about her but rather about me. I discovered a sluggish scenario, an intolerable cool looking Willis, an unrealistic performance by a 10 year old child, gaps, Jumps and oversimplifications in the story and so on. Approaching the end my wife told me, what kind of crap you made me see and lost my evening, he is also dead isn't he? I surprisingly responded, how did get it? well!! piece of cake, she replied, even a child can foresee it. That was the end of all. She has a good judgment of movies so her phrase shock me. The magic was all lost. Conclusion. This is the first time it happened to me. Usually when I see a film again it is because I am sure 100% that it worth it. I am a voracious film eater and I cant be wrong. Final comments. A childish scenario, a commercially promoted film that otherwise could be a masterpiece in another director's hands. If I rate this with 3 then "The others" and Nicol Kindman as the key actor is rated 10.</fullReview>

Good plot-no. The acting was acceptable. The sets were good. The suspense, not bad. But a screenwriter has to do better than just "trick" you. If there's going to be a twist, or lots of twists, fine. But make sure that they make sense. So many movie makers believe that if they can merely put together a piece with lots of twists and turns so the viewer can be fouled, they have succeeded. But it takes more than that. A lot more. Where's Satyajit Ray when you need him?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie about love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 6th sense is an intelligent movie about love, set in a slightly supernatural environment. It isn't very scary, even though you may feel your hairs rising once or twice (mileage may wary). The story is very well told, and it's worth seeing at least twice. I recommend this movie highly. 10/10.Most of you already know what this movie is about, but I'll warn anyway:*** SPOILERS ***The main story is beautifully portrayed, and the twist at the end was as good as they come. Some claim they saw it long before, I think most who didn't know there was supposed to be a twist like this, found it wonderful. I did.As the one line summary says, I think this was a movie about love. The ghost story is not very scary, although interesting. But the real theme here is love. Not the boy loves girl, girl is in danger/lost/whatever, boy and girl gets back together cheesy movie. But the mothers love for his boy. The mothers love and mourn for her mother. The doctors love for his wife, and her love and mourn for him. The fathers love for the little girl mistreated and killed by her stepmother.Love is the central team all the way throughout the movie. And it's beautifully portrayed all the way.In my opinion, this is one of the most intelligent and touching movies ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch the movie OBJECTIVELY and you may be shocked.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Make aside the Hollywood tones that have hurt the genre in the past, "The Sixth Sense" deserves a chance. The movie is not overrated, it has been viewed incorrectly. Most people watch it only for the hype it created but if you watch it as a HORROR movie you will get the director's message.ACTING. A surprisingly good performance by Bruce Willis. He's performance is very solid that you actually believe him. His contribution to the genre won't be forgotten, believe me. Hailey Joel Osment steals the show and gives probably the second best performance by a child actor in a horror movie (Linda Blair is still the best). The boy can make the audience feel his fears. Toni Collete also gives a touching performance. Solid performances this time.DIRECTION. M. Night Shyamalan's direction is stylish, classy, and creepy. The man knew how to create a scary atmosphere with dark settings and situations when not expected. Creative shots and camera angles support the good direction. The correct use of lightning and darkness is wonderful. This is a "ghostly" direction. Great job.F/X, SCORE, CINEMATOGRAPHY. -The f/x are pretty good. The dead people look scary. Shyamalan perfectly knew how a big part of the audience visualizes dead people. -Great score. -The cinematography is very Hollywood. It's perfect but very stylish for a horror movie. The "Hollywood" look doesn't helps the "Sixth Sense" in being 100% scary. Still it's pretty good.*SPOILERS* "The Sixth Sense" has made great contributions to the genre. Positive and negative contributions. First, it brought back the "ghost" sub-genre and in the best way possible. The story is solid and very well crafted. The events are connected perfectly and that's the main reason that the ending is "that" shocking. Many people say that this movie isn't scary, that the audience can guess the ending at the first half of the movie, that the plot twists do not impress, blah, blah. You know there's a lot of people like that...I bet that 99% of these people, if they watched the movie OBJECTIVELY; were actually shocked by the movie's ending and goings. The so called experts in the genre (most of them are obsessed with the 70's horror movies) can't accept the movie's originality and success. I'm not a big fan of these kind of movies but I accept it's an original horror movie with a great ending. The bad thing about the movie is that it served as model for many horror movies that try to create a shocking ending but fail miserably and disturb the audience. The ending in this movie is carefully planned, it connects all the situations perfectly with the scare factor. Unlike other movies that abruptly come up with a "shocking" ending that angers the audience (a la "The Village").The truth is that the movie is very original and offers something that no other horror movie had before (or at least it wasn't very popular and in the reach of the fans of the genre). The movie is not only about horror or scares; there's drama (a mother worried about her son), a message of respect to the phenomenons that science can't explain, and a message of life (the whole Bruce Willis situation with his wife). The movie is by no means scarier than the brilliant "Exorcist" but it's a movie that commands the new generation of horror movies. It's the reference to the late 90's horror and that's something that will forever mark the genre. It was about time for evolution.8.5/10 One of the best horror movies that catches the attention of the viewer since minute 1. Not many big budget horror movies can accomplish something like that. And it's harder to find them in this new century that seems to be making a a lot of damage to the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M. Night Shyamalan has done it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan's "The Sixth Sense" is a very haunting tale about a boy who can see and talk to people that don't know they're dead. Some scenes in this movie are disturbing, and some are upsetting. But if you listen closely to everything the actors say, even if it's hard to hear and hard to remember, it all makes sense in the end. Much like "Holes" and "Signs", another fantastic movie directed by Shyamalan. The ending of this movie is a humongous surprise, which makes you feel different about the whole movie. Just like "Signs", this movie made me bawl my eyes out. 10/10* An excellent motion picture. It wasn't much of a horror movie, but it was very creepy indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Go Down In Cinema History As A Brilliant Hitchcockian Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*-Catch it on TV **-Worth a Rental ***-Buy it Used/On Sale ****-Buy it New/Top Dollar *****-Worthy of a Blind BuyThe Sixth Sense was M. Night Shyamalan's first masterpiece. For the two people who have yet to see this film I will clue you in on what it is about. The Sixth Sense is a supernatural thriller about a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (played by Bruce Willis) who discovers that he made a mistake with a former patient named Vincent. Enter Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a troubled young boy with remarkable similarities to Vincent. Malcome makes it a personal mission to help Cole so that he can feel better about his former patient. By the way, Cole's problem is that he can see dead people.There are very few ways that this film could have been better. However, one way to make it better has nothing to do with the film itself. If the promos for the film hadn't shown Haley Joel Osment saying the famous phrase, "I see dead people" over and over again than the film would have been much more surprising. Image the surprise in learning that the reason that Cole is so messed up is because he is haunted by ghosts. Not that it needed to be anymore surprising. The big twist at the end has been regarded as both brilliant and ridiculous for the past five years. I am one of the many who believe it to be brilliant. After seeing it for the first time you will be blown away. The ending is not the only reason to see the film.Bruce Willis strayed away from his traditional action hero roles when he starred in this film. It was all around a different character for him and he nailed it. Willis makes Malcome Crowe come alive and conveys his emotions easily in the film. Haley Joel Osment was great as Cole Sear. I am not quite sure if he was good enough to merit a nomination for best supporting actor though. His constant whispering got slightly annoying but was necessary considering the plot.M. Night Shyamalan's screenwriting and direction in The Sixth Sense is nothing short of incredible. The pacing was slow and it added to the tension Night so brilliantly created. A lot of people find Night's style boring and difficult to watch (especially in his later films). I love the slow development of the story and characters and increased "creepiness." James Newton Howard was the film's composer. His music fits the film perfectly and makes it even more suspenseful. M. Night Shyamalan gave himself a name with The Sixth Sense and raised the bar for all future supernatural thrillers. The Sixth Sense is a ***** film and, I say this a lot, but if I believed in organizing a list of my favorite films than needless to say this would be pretty high up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first Shymalan's flick and i have to say that he made a good work creating a dark environment which is essential for a thriller. I guess the end was also a bit unexpected which gave some points on the project. Thats all with the positive side of the film. I'm afraid that the negative overcomes the positive easily. When i first saw this film i thought it was OK. I gave the creator the benefit of the doupth since it was his first movie and all.This changed rapidly after watching his second movie.You see i didn't like the first one, i didn't liked it at all, but i convinced myself i didn't hate it cause i thought the director, as a first timer, having a low budget to work with he presented at least a honest effort to the public. Later on, after i watched Unbreakable and realized that this was the way that M.N.Shyamalan really wanted to direct i let myself free and expressed my true opinion. This movie sucked as his second one. The budget of the flick wasn't small(we are talking about 60.000.000 dollars) and the absence of the visual F\X wasn't something of a trick to cover the absence of money in production. The Matrix was shoot with the same amount of money and you can see where the money went. Here nothing really happens. The action is slow, the acting is just tolerable and the script was a bit boring except the very original ending. This is one of the few ghost stories that i've seen with absolutely no visual effects(the others were mostly b-movies and low budget cults which by the way i enjoyed more). I don't want to get into details but i've also noticed some mistakes-gups in the script which, i'm sure, most of the people that have seen this film also noticed. The only thing that's annoying for me is the money that this film gathered at the box office, which were a lot. Watching all of Syamalans films makes me believe that he tricks people to watching them. He selects catchy topics for his movies and then he plays a game. The game is shooting the movies using minimum f\x trying to gather maximum people at the cinemas. I can say that he does this with success but i think that he is already a castaway in the minds of the true Sci-Fi of Horror fans. Don't take me wrong, i'm not into senseless use of CGI effects which can turn a movie in a video game(see Van Helsing) but when the topic is from the world of fantasy the director should add effects and substance creating a unique result.Anyway i believe that people who haven't already seen the "Sixth Sense" should probably do it but i "sense" that this will be a one way ride and probably will never watch it again......I sure didn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poorly-made fluff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I'm sure anyone who hasn't seen the film yet (and hasn't had it spoiled for them) has already been subjected to numerous accolades for Director M. Night Shyamalan, I'll get right to the point of my review: no, Sixth Sense is not a good movie. It is a mass of poorly-joined, generally pointless fluff, punctuated by a hilariously-contrived and completely predictable "twist." This is unfortunate, because due to the weakness of the material surrounding it, the entire production sinks or swims on the strength of that one plot twist.Ergo, A. If you figure it out before it happens, B. If somebody spoils it for you, or C. You're not surprised by anything in movies, then the film is absolutely worthless.Shyamalan does get bonus points for creating a creepy-as-hell atmosphere--but creepy atmosphere doesn't make a good movie. The Sixth Sense lacks quality character development, decent performances (Bruce Willis is flat, as is Haley Joel Osment), and a plot that is involving, or at least coherent. In place of these key factors is merely a series of unrelated events, each of which inevitably--and predictably--ends in a telegraphed "boo!" moment, complete with an atonal stab of music and a jumpy edit. Fine for the Scream crowd, but I look for a little more intelligence in my horror movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Just Have a Feeling About Films Like This.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sixth Sense" is one of those rare films that really gets under your skin and stays there. Young Haley Joel Osment (in an Oscar-nominated role) is slowly going crazy due to the fact that he is seeing dead people who literally walk around as ghostly spirits. Enter child psychiatrist Bruce Willis who is having marital problems and blames himself for the demise of one of his former patients. Together they go on a harrowing journey of unexplainable phenomena which culminates in one of the greatest surprise endings in the history of the cinema. Indian director M. Night Shyamalan (Oscar-nominated in writing and directing) shows Spielberg-like potential with only his third production. Toni Collete (also Oscar-nominated) is adequate as Osment's answer-seeking mother. However, it is Osment who keeps the audience on its toes and Willis' equally riveting turn that are at the heart of "The Sixth Sense". 1999 was a year of disappointments in the movie world, but this picture was one of the few that really delivered on its pre-release hype. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like everyone else, reviews of The Sixth Sense and its box office records had me literally salivating at the thought of watching a movie whose plotline was, at the time, considered as utterly ground-breaking. Well, it seems that everybody had been living under a rock all this time and woke up only to see The Sixth Sense.I'll start with the good points. Willis is great here. It's nice to see him finally taking up real roles, and abandoning the brainless guys. And it was a surprise to see him perform so well in what is probably his best role ever. So is Osment. That kid has real talent, and really shines in the movie, going as far as totally annihilating Willis. Other so-called actors like Ben Affleck and Lucy Liu would certainly learn a lot from him.And that's all.The Sixth Sense is neither original nor intricate. I'll agree that Shyamalan at least gave it some good directing, but hey, this movie is not the only one to benefit from it. Maybe I'm being somewhat harsh. Having watching and understood Shirow's Ghost in the Shell, having been amazed and enthralled by Kojima's Metal Gear Solid (Kojima, you rule!), I know what makes a complex and original story and what does not. And, in both aspects, those 2 works actually lived up to the hype. They made me believe all kinds of things, totally destroyed them at the end, and, even then, left me to think and think about what really happened. Ghost in the Shell even required me to view it a dozen times before I completely grasped it, and even then, I'm still confused by a few points (and I dare anyone to state he COMPLETELY understood it). Metal Gear Solid is different; it's not hard to grasp everything, but the story is really intricate and totally drags it in.The Sixth Sense has neither of that. On my first viewing, I figured the whole plot as soon as Osment told Willis about his ability. And, for me, that is a bad thing! It means the story is predictable; it means Shyamalan himself apparently got lost while writing this plot, which is why there are so many plot holes in it, and a couple of scenes actually had me cringing and cursing out loud.The movie also has no atmosphere whatsoever. I felt no excitement at the revelations, nothing at all. The so-called scary scenes are also not very scary, and suspense is non-existant. Having now viewed it 2 times, I still do not understand why it become so popular. Do yourself a favor, and go watch a real intricate movie. Like Ghost in the Shell.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As close to perfection a movie can get, that's what i felt about this movie, it is almost a perfect movie in every aspect, i can't as i sit here now right after i saw the movie think of anything where there was an obvious flaw, even the smallest thing as i tried to see them in the end worked out. An amazingly thought through movie that is both engaging, intelligent, original, shocking and best of all it does not reveal its end until the very final moment, beautiful!Shyamalan have with this movie constructed something that is gribbing in so many ways, there are so many feelings all around and they are put together so damn well, not only by the script and directing itself, but the sound and the cinematography is stunning, as the music and sound gives life to the picture, an example is the first real "horror" scene, where the camera is handheld, it gives a fantastic realistic view to the scene and makes it come alive a lot more than it would have if it had not been for the handheld camera, and the raw and tired look of the scene. Absolutely stunning work.I am as one can read very impressed with the movie, color filters, crookedness on the camera, everything has been used to create a movie full of atmosphere, it really reaches beyond and grabs you, it's amazing, shyamalan is sheer genius with this movie.For the acting i must say Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osmond is just amazing, this must for one be the best performance by a child actor i've ever seen, nearly without a single flaw from such a young man, even the scenes where he have to display raw feelings he does well, fantastic. All the supporting actors and actresses gives a good performance too, doing their share of lifting the movie to a top notch level.Stunning movie, it's a joy to see that movies like this can still be produced!10/10</fullReview>

One of the biggest wastes of time I ever experienced, and that includes my environmental science class from high school.This movie was not only stupid and a waste of Bruce Willis' talent, but it was also insulting to the viewers intelligence. There are holes in the plot large enough to move troops through which are covered up by silly lines and ghosts. This movie is an over produced monstrosity which should be avoided at all costs.

		<shortDescription>Very Good Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. The Sixth Sense was undeniably one of the best films of 1999. Director-Writer M. Night Shyamalan claims he is a fan of Hitchcock and it definitely shows. I am not saying The Sixth Sense is a rip off of a Hitchcock film but its definitely Hitchcock-like. If Hitchcock saw this movie I am sure he would be very impressed. The genius of The Sixth Sense is definitely in its script. The dialogue is well-written, but most importantly its very well structured. The Structure is relatively simple but it hides the twist at the end while revealing some clues along the way. None of the clues gave away the ending for me. The twist is simple yet very effective. I was blown away at the end of the film. Shyamalan has written a very, very good screenplay. The Script is probably the main strength of the film, but the acting is also quite good. Bruce Willis is surprisingly good in a restrained performance as a psychiatrist. Haley Joel Osment is excellent as the disturbed boy, Cole. Toni Collette is very good as Cole's mother. Shyamalan is fine in a small cameo. The movie is also atmospheric and chilling. So many memorable scenes, but one scene looked very awkward to me. Its a scene between Bruce Willis Character (Malcolm Crowe) and Cole that seemed a bit too sentimental to me. Other than that, Sixth Sense is a very good thriller.  </fullReview>

There were so many better movies than this that year, like All About My Mother, Boys Don't Cry, and others. But I won't get into that.The concept is great. A psychiatrist (I don't know how to spell it) helps a little boy who sees dead people (Hence the famous line, "I see dead people"). Everybody, who found the ending a huge surprise, I will admit it, I didn't see it coming. But the ending I thought was so out of nowhere, it just seems as the movie is nothing than a total blow. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing and original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not the biggest fan of "The Sixth Sense" and don't believe it deserved quite as much word of mouth as it received, but I can't completely discredit the film. It is well-done and quite intriguing. I recently bought the DVD, since it was used and I purchased it for a cheap price. Plus, I was curious about how it would feel watching it for a second time. I watched it in theaters and thought it was pretty good, but like many others I wanted to see it again to try to uncover clues I didn't perceive the first time around and discover certain elements that I may have overlooked. I still don't think it's a great movie, but it was interesting watching it and keeping in mind the big plot twist at the end. As I watched it, the twist made a lot of sense and M. Night Shamalyan didn't just sneak it in for shock value. He obviously put a lot of thought into both creating this big surprise and making it credible. When I accessed the "Rules and Clues" feature on the DVD, that confirmed my theories and exposed a few details that I didn't even notice on the second viewing. The acting is good all-around. Bruce Willis gives, probably, his most low-key performance up-to-date. He is both compelling and convincing, not getting in the audience's face with a showy dramatic performance. Haley Joel Osment was the perfect choice for Cole, and I don't think the phrase, "I see dead people," would be the same coming out of any other child actor's mouth. A good child actor is hard to find, and Haley Joel is one of the few who I can actually say measures up to a good deal of adult actors. He's not "good for a little kid"; he's just a good actor period. His Oscar nomination was well-deserved. His acting is very subtle, not broad in any way. Toni Collette also deserved her Oscar nomination. I don't live in Philadelphia, so I can't technically judge whether or not her accent was "on target," but I know for sure that she pulled off a flawless American accent. And she went the extra mile by taking on a dialect. Just like Osment, her acting is very subtle and you sense the pain and anguish she feels as a single mother of this estranged kid without her having to continuously sob and burst into tears. Actors should know that you don't need to cry to express sadness. 9 times out of 10, people try their best to hold back the tears--at least when they're in public or in front of other people. Donnie Wahlberg makes a short but memorable appearance as one of Willis's former patients, and actually plays an important role in the story as you will learn. What I didn't like about "The Sixth Sense"? Altogether, it's slow-moving and surely could've used some editing. And some of the dialogue is corny and stilted. I wouldn't classify this as a "scary movie." Some have deemed this as one of the scariest movies of all time. To that I say "Hell no." I think of it more as a sci-fi/mystery. It's not always entertaining, but it's intriguing and gives your brain a lot of work. If you decide to rent or purchase the DVD, another fun feature to check out is Shamalyan's (very very) first movie--as in he was 12 years old and shot it with his own video camera. They only show a clip from the movie and, as he said, it's awful--but it's always fun to watch famous or up-and-coming directors' work back when they were starting amateurs. Like he says, if you watch this crappy movie, you will understand why Shamalyan doesn't do special f/x. I gotta admire the guy. If I were releasing one of my films on DVD (in the far future) I wouldn't show my first movie--a crappy "X Files" film that I shot back in junior year of high school as a project for my TV Production class. That really takes guts. My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT!! With all the hype surrounding this movie, naturally you are going to see it with high expectations. It's one thing to have an ending which is 'surprise' because it was clever and the audience didn't think of it, but quite another when the 'surprise' is because the ending simply doesn't make any sense. The audience feels cheated in that case. I mean, come on... *SPOILER* - a year living with his wife as a dead person, and he doesn't make the connection until the end of the movie? All I can say is their sex life must have been non-existant. I realize that there is always some measure of 'suspension of disbelief' in films, but when the entire plot devise is centred on something illogical, it should not be forgiven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film exudes intelligence on a level I have never seen before.Either you are smart enough to figure out what is going on,or you are completely fooled,which I am ashamed to say I was.When it comes to trying to fool people,bad films usually fail,good ones succeed.This film falls into the latter category by a mile.Bruce Willis gives us a fine performance here,definitely among his better efforts.Haley Joel Osment gives the finest effort from a child actor ever,as Cole,a boy tormented by disturbing and very macabre visions.There is not much to say here without giving most of the plot away,so you will just have to see for yourself.Look for a much thinner,barely recognizable Donnie Wahlberg in a very brief but frightening role.Thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*spoiler warning* Without the performance of Osment, this blockbuster would've been lackluster...It's amazing to me that moviegoers loved the ending but considered the ending of "Jacob's Ladder" a cop-out. Bruce Joel Rubin, a Buddhist, wrote the screenplay to "Jacob's Ladder" to portray the after-death bardo state, but was unable to get it produced, so he wrote a mass-market romantic-comedy version, which won him an Oscar for "Ghost." Perhaps a simplistic version is better than none ("What Dreams May Come"). For great bardo films, see "Mulholland Drive," "Waking Life" or "Dead Man." 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie, but overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoilers* I can start out by saying that I am somewhat biased to this movie because I do not like child actors. Their characters are just never believable in my opinion. That aside, this movie was pretty well done and had an alright story to tell, but what was the overall point to it? What was the lasting emotion or thought on the movie? The whole movie seems to center around Bruce Willis trying to get inside the kid and get him to accept him. Seriously, this takes up almost three fourths of the movie. Then, at the end, it seems like the director realized that he did not have very much time left in the movie and kind of threw in that last little bit about the mother poisoning the child and rushed the big climax where Bruce Willis finds out he is dead. It seems that the entire movie had just been put together for that one twist of an ending. The ending is very good, but an ending cannot make up for the rest of the movie.The movie does have some genuinely scary and creepy parts but for the most part seems indecisive as to whether its a drama or a horror movie. There are some parts where I was left questioning, "huh?" after watching it a second time. I don't remember too well but did they not skip three months between the time Willis was shot and when the actual movie begin? What was Bruce's character doing all this time and where did he think the time had gone if he truly did not know he was dead. I did not know about red being used as symbolism until they told me about it after the movie and that is probably why they put that segment at the end. No one picked up on it because it had almost nothing to do with the plot of the movie. It's almost like the director threw that in there so he could say, "Hey, everyone, I'm smart, I can use subtle symbolism." The symbolism itself is so broad that its largely ineffective for when something red appears it just has "something to do with dead person," even if a dead person had just touched it or something.There are certain saving graces about this movie. Bruce Willis turned in a good performance and it did makeyou think in some parts, but ultimately a movie that will quickly be forgotten, maybe faster if everyone would stop making parodies of it =). Overall, not one of my favorite horror/dramas. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really dont understand why people like this movie so much. Most of the time it was unexciting and bland, and the storyline just seemed to drag on to an implausible ending of confusement. bruce willis was absurd as usual, when is this guy gonna give up trying to act in what could be top-notch thrillers and go back to meaningless action romps? Osmond was okay, you have to give him credit for working with such a 'twilight-zone' script, though I must admit Toni Collete did outshine as the disturbed boys mother.The simple fact is, for me at least - this movie would have looked better on the small screen as an episode of the X--files or the Twilight-Zone. It just didnt have the strength in characterisation or thrills to make it exciting as a two hour holywood movie. And of course.. like most hollywood entertainment reviewers do..they hyped the movie up and it was applauded by all alike, just beacuse the genre was 'unique' and 'different' from the rest of the crap that hollywood produces.Though the storyline and genre are certainly unique. And the movie is interesting to watch..it certainly isnt as brilliant as what everyone makes it out to be.</fullReview>

Then it fades into dumbness (why would dead people ask certain kids to do obscure things ??)... not even the strange twist at the end of the movie may save the whole thing from being more than a C-Picture Storyline. You could feel the twist coming right after 30 Minutes and that makes it booooring like hell. Two or three nice shocking effects are not enough to make a good suspense thriller out of nothing. Sorry, but there are way better supernatural thrillers on the shelve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has a first rate cast giving first rate performances. The cinematography &amp; style of directing is also first rate. Unfortunately the same can't be said of the script. The twist is very obvious &amp; the film does not have anything else to say really in terms of plot. Also what I found annoying was the way the script tried to compensate for the holes in the twist. How could a man not know he is dead? Why can't he see other dead people? Well lets neatly answer that one for you! "They don't see each other. They only see what they want to see. They don't know they're dead." Despite this it is worth seeing. As already mentioned the cast are all excellent &amp; although this is his first major feature Shyamalan has already established a distinct directorial style. His next film Unbreakable is a far better movie which doesn't just rely on a gimmicky twist ending .Although it does come with a twist in the tail its plot has much more to offer.</fullReview>

A lotta flash and not much substance. And, I am sorry, but Halley Joel Osment is not the rebirth of Shirley Temple. I don't see much talent differential between him and Macauley Culkin at this age.

		<fullReview>Neither a terrible movie nor a great one. Just one of the many movies that fall in the middle, despite the hype. The supposed "twist" at the end is telegraphed early on, and so isn't surprising when it comes, although it is well handled when it finally arrives. While Haley Osment and Bruce Willis are good actors, the dialogue between them is stilted, and the movie drags for a long stretch in the middle. When the situation between them finally gets resolved, it is handled in too perfunctory a fashion given all the time spent leading up to it. A lot of time is spent between Willis and Osment accomplishing little, then one incident is shown leading towards the resolution, and then the situation is resolved, and that's it. 4/10.</fullReview>

But having said that: one great twist can't make up for this boring story with very bad acting performances. So let someone tell you the story, fast forward the movie and then watch the end.

The phrase of Latin which meant *nothing* to the plot, the ineptitude of a man who, after a year of trying to eat or go to the bathroom without avail, discovers that he is a corpse only through a child, are only two of the many silly elements in the plot. A cute kid actor and a committee-written plot certainly seemed to play well with the public, but when you look beneath the hood, there was very little there.

And he notices that when he sees his wife crying over his wedding ring or whatever (I can't remember exactly). And that's supposed to be very powerful. In fact we're given clues (no one ever really speks to him, but it's not very obvious so you can't guess). Well, that's just PLAIN STUPID ! How can the guy hang around for month without noticing he's dead ??? - No one speaks to him - How can he open doors ? Does he walk through walls ? - How can he eat ? If he doesn't then he should realize there's something weird, shouldn't he? etc etc etc (See slothfratelli's review, it's more complete !! ) In one word it is impossible. I really felt cheated when I saw this. So, please if you liked the end, check it twice : you've been cheated.By the way, I read some reviews where the author supposedly guessed everything and found this movie predictable. I wonder how you can predict such an illogical end. Really, I wonder.Above all, I still don't understand why such a small amount of people noticed the conclusion of this movie was awfully illogical (less than 10% if we admit IMDB reviews are statistically representative).Considering all this, the 6th sense deserves no more than 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is a two hour magic trick, of sorts. There are a few good scenes here and there -- viz. the opening, the funeral twist, etc. -- but I have no doubts that Shyamalan came up with the ending before he wrote the movie, and as such the first two hours only exists to avert the audience's attention from the twist ending that is really the point of the whole movie. There are upsides, of course: Osmet's acting was a pleasant surprise, the direction was dark and somber (which -- though it may just be me -- was very appealing), and the score. However, as a whole, it seems like a tedious exercise with a pay-off that doesn't make up for the two hours of dullness that precedes it. That being said, see the movie anyway, because if public opinion means anything (and it does, I reluctantly admit), chances are you'll love this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sixth sense" is in many ways an extremely beautiful movie and contains some utterly brilliant acting - for example, the initial scene at the Crowes' house made my acting appreciation organ, whichever one that is, turn somersaults. But...Every fictional story depends to some extent on the suspension of our disbelief in impossible things. A film's ambition at seriousness signals that the suspension required will be relatively small, i.e. that the script attempts to be plausible. "Sixth sense" obviously aspires at being a serious psychological drama, so one would expect a rather high level of plausibility.Whether or not you can accept the basic premise, that souls have individual existence independent of the body ("ghosts") and that they can influence some living people, depends on your own religious standpoint and fundamental view of the universe, so let us leave that aside. But one unconditional premise in a story that aspires at any kind of plausibility is that all individuals of a certain species are subject to the same basic constraints: e.g. people can't fly, fish can't talk, ghosts can't handle material objects... and if the script writer decides to let an individual go beyond these constraints, the audience is entitled to an explanation.WARNING - SPOILER AHEAD!Now, in Sixth sense we find one ghost who can look perfectly ordinary (and even change clothes) while others only show themselves in the state they were in when they died; the same ghost can enter a church, a place where no other ghosts ever show up; he can throw rocks, play audio recordings and take notes, while it's crucial to the story that a "regular" ghost can't by herself move a video tape to where it will be found... All this simply because we aren't supposed to know that he's dead!!! And we get no hint of an explanation why this particular individual is Mr. Superghost!Another serious hole in the fabric of the story is the gimmick of people "not knowing that they are dead". These people walk about and perceive their surroundings, but they don't notice that there's been a funeral, that their bank account is gone, that they can't get service in a store, that they themselves have stopped eating etc. etc. etc.???Bruce Willis is normally a committed, thorough actor who does his homework and delivers the goods. Even his superheroes and inhabitants of the future are primarily people, who we know can get bored, have a headache or need to go to the bathroom. That's what makes them so easy to identify with and their stories so compelling. - Now, in "Sixth sense" individual scenes are beautifully acted, with a gripping psychological reality, but the plot holes indicated above effectively prevent the film from making sense as a whole. Simply speaking, Mr Shyamalan and Mr Willis are too involved in visual and psychological artistry to care whether Crowe goes to the bathroom, and if not, why. And, what's worse, they expect us viewers not to notice. To quote a more traditional Willis hero, "What do you think I am, stupid?!"Obviously, on an artistic level, Shyamalan and Willis work extremely well together. But, for it to become beautiful music, we must hope for a better score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whew, with the hype that went around this movie, you got the feeling that you miss out on elemental cinematic history if you don't see it. Unfortunately, that's not true. "The Sixth Sense" tries hard to be a good psycho-thriller and in fact the idea behind it was good. But as the script was written, someone must have had the idea to put the real big bang in there, something no viewer can guess to happen, the totally total of all story twists there ever were. But, bad luck, the grand idea has to fit into the rest of the script, so you have to modify it and make compromises. And really, I was disappointed with the end. Not because of it, but because everything else was set up for it. I didn't guess the twist because it was so sneaky, but because it was completely implausible. To clarify that I will try hard not to give anything away, in case you didn't see "Sixth Sense" yet, so I will ask only one question, which you'll understand later: how do you get into someones apartment without ringing the doorbell or knocking? There are numerous more points like that but by stating them I would give away the surprise. It's too bad the whole film had to suffer just to get that in.And then there are horror scenes, not too many, but I guess the writers figured that the movie had to give some more than the general idea and the last big bang. And again, they just serve the purpose and are badly integrated: young Cole, they boy who can see ghosts, later finds out that they want him to help them. I think even a ghost can anticipate that scaring someone to death isn't a good start for getting help.Probably the best asset of the movie is Haley Joel Osment, who played "Cole." Marvelous what this young boy could do with his role. Bruce Willis stays a little unbelievable as a psychologist, but that could be the script as well. So far I yet have to encounter a psychologist who handles therapy that way. Well, nice idea, nice movie, but nothing overly sensational. Horror movies greatly benefit from taking part in our world and incorporating the horror into it. But then they have to stay true to rules we all are familiar with and to those they need to set up to make us bite our nails. If "Sixth Sense" would have mastered both, I'd be yelling "great one!"</fullReview>

The writer's maintenance of the 'surprise' left the script so full of holes that it looked like a lace curtain.

		<fullReview>I'm glad to see that a few users did find this movie completely overrated...'The Sixth Sense' was uninteresting, and though with reasonable character development, there were some basic flaws that I could not shake while watching this movie (and some later flaws that were pointed out to me that made me realize that this film was the most overrated film of 1999)...Firstly - about a year had past since the time Willis was killed, and yet, had he never attempted to talk to his wife? What logic was being used when the audience is led to believe that Willis lived with his wife for a year without talking to her? Not only this, but the fact that most likely the first night that Willis, after being killed and him returning to his house, would have realized something was wrong...this fact ruined the movie...On top of that, other major flaws were made apparent to me (by others) after watching the film - firstly that the dead people were only seen in the areas in which they were killed, raising the question of 'How did Willis manage to walk around town?'...The second major flaw is that surrounding the fact that the church was a safe-haven for Osment's character - i.e., dead people couldn't enter the church; yet Willis does it on more than one occasion...I respect Bruce Willis as an actor, but I feel obliged (as I sometimes do) to point out certain aspects of films when they receives unduly recognition - in this case, the film was cast as truly thought-provoking and intelligent...The ending was indeed different - but that in itself, in my mind at least, was not nearly enough to compensate for the stagnation that was the rest of the film (which was neither thought-provoking as a whole, intelligent, or entertaining)...I would have given this film [2/10], but since Bruce Willis was in it and did the best he could, I honor his talent...[3/10]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an avid mystery film buff, I refused to read a single review of "The Sixth Sense" ~ to the point that I wandered away when any of my friends began discussing it.That's how serious I was about trying not to accidentally stumble upon "the big secret."So, having missed it at the theaters, I pre~ordered the DVD and waited.And waited.Yesterday it arrived. I decided to hold off on watching it until tonight, my birthday [shameless effort to receive multiple emailed birthday greetings].Words cannot describe my shock at having "discovered" the "big secret" a mere SE7EN minutes into the film. So amazed was I that I was certain that the obvious answer must have been a red herring: surely anyone with half a brain would have determined the incredibly obvious secret when I did.I was expecting a sock~me~in~the~gut~I~never~saw~that~coming surprise, a la "The Usual Suspects." Or even "Shallow Grave." Or at the very worst, "Carnival of Souls" or "Rosemary's Baby."Nope.It was exactly as I suspected.This is a well~acted, nicely~paced, moderately~interesting thriller.Haley Joel Osment's performance is memorable and, along with Jude Law's in "The Talented Mr. Ripley," was the best of 1999's Best Supporting Actor turns. For the first time in several years, a child actor actually delivers a riveting, completely~believable performance. For me, the problem with young actors is that [because by definition, they *are* young] they always seem to be acting. This kid is world~class.But contrary to popular opinion, this is decidedly *not* Bruce Willis' best work to date. Although he's good here, that honor would go to his tortured Vietnam vet in the excellent "In Country," which I urge you to rent.Toni Collette does well as Osment's caring mother, but this is no Oscar~worthy turn: she's simply not around enough to serve as much more than a plot device.The famed "I see dead people" line finally rolls around at :47 and if you haven't cracked this by then, give up and fast~forward.***SEMI~SPOILER ALERT***Disregard the reviews here which claim that if you fail to realize the importance of "The Sixth Sense" then you just didn't get the complex dialogue. It's not complex in the least. At best, it's serviceable. The story is lifted from the original "Carnival of Souls."

		<shortDescription>A well-crafted suspense movie that makes you think about your own 'hereafter'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was able to watch the Sixth Sense on DVD on its first release today. As enjoyable as this movie is, the 'extras' on the DVD make it twice as enjoyable. Included is a fine interview with the writer/director that helps put the whole story in perspective, which includes his personal and family influences.The votes currently place this movie at about #23 on the top 250 movies of all time. That's probably a bit of an overrating, considering all the other fine movies in the list. However, for any person who sees it and loves it can also make a legitimate case that it is their favorite of all time.My "review" doesn't really say anything about the story itself. That is because it is best viewed if you know nothing about it first. Except to say that it is one of the very few movies that gets high ratings from viewers of all ages, and genders! If you haven't yet, then see it. The DVD version if you can, and watch the extras after. Jan 2007 update: I watched it again yesterday. Even though I knew the basic story, and how it would turn out, it was still a worthwhile re-watch. Night may never match his first effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Overrated Film in the Past 25 Years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****CONTAINS SPOILER****WARNING!****WARNING!***** Where to begin? I'm not usually surprised at the bad taste of filmgoers, making such colossal hits out of Home Alone and The Lost World, however this film takes the cake. I enjoyed the performances, particularly Toni Colette, Haley Joel Osment, and the vastly under-appreciated Bruce Willis. However, as much as I admire some aspects of the film, the denouement is so predictable and frankly, insulting to any thinking adult, that the success of this film astounds me. If the film had been like "The Crying Game" where the "surprise" twist is interesting, but more importantly, a mere plot device to further the film in it's storyline, I might have had less problems with this movie. I was shocked that anybody would have been fooled for a moment about the health of Bruce Willis' character. If American audiences are dimwitted and unobservant not to notice the THOUSANDS of obvious hints that preceed the unveiling of the truth, then this is the film for them. It was insulting to have to sit through the final minutes of the film, being forced to relive earlier scenes that any intelligent moviegoer should already have noticed. The mere fact that Willis doesn't change his clothes ONCE should have tipped off everybody!Well, my comments certainly won't stop those people that make hits of such movies as this, but I must raise my voice in protest since the last year has seen such incredible movies as Three Kings, Magnolia, Election, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Boys Don't Cry, American Beauty, Being John Malkovich, Topsy-Turvy, Eyes Wide Shut, The Straight Story, Sweet &amp; Lowdown, All About My Mother, and underappreciated gems like The Limey and Go, and a half dozen more that will be remembered much longer than this slim piece of celluloid.</fullReview>

Slow, conventional, with just two or three interesting moments,so... why so many nominations? Seven deserved them more in 1995.

		<fullReview>that's right why???? what is so good about this film? I can't figure it out for the life of me. Well I can. The ending is. and the little hints pointing to it during the film. And Haley Joel Osmont, he's good. But the oscar nods (apart from HJO) simply go against all belief. Best film??????? please. Best script. How obvious. people see the ending and the hints (the script was probably written with the ending in mind, so the hints are easy to place) But what they fail to see is that apart from those the script is decidedly average at best, with forced or sometimes outright bad dialogue, and hardly any excitement at all. And then there's directing. This gets a directing nod???? this kitschy oh I dunno. It just makes me mad that this average and kitschy directing gets nominated when Paul Thomas Anderson does not. And finally Toni Colette. She annoyed me the whole film. Every scene with her was like the ultimate proof of what I said before. (though that might have been her dialogues as well, butr even then, just look at Angela Bassett in Strange Days to see just how overblown and absurd dialogue can still be made great - Can you imagine 'I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all' sound believable? It did there, Toni Colette doesn't even come close)But now don't get me wrong, I don't think the sixth sense is a bad film. It's just ... average on all accounts. and if you already know how it's going to end, well it's not even worth a rental anymore :(</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the big deal? (This review may contain some spoliers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading all your enthusiastic comments about this film... Knowing that it was one of the big hits of the summer in the USA and the rest of the world... Hearing that common people and movie critics (even Maltin) loved this film...After all that my expectations about "The Sixth Sense" were "knocking on heaven's door"... and it really hurts to fall from there, my friends!!"The Sixth Sense" was, at last, showed in my country this month and I virtually ran to the theater to be one of the first to watch it. I was very careful to avoid reading too much about the plot, because I had heard that there was a "great" twist, and I didn't want to ruin the surprise. I've never been so disappointed.The fatal flaws:1. The trailer was too explicit: So I think that everybody already knew the Cole's secret ("I see dead people"). Then the scene where the boy tells Willis his "secret" (after an hour of boring round and round, without important scenes, with the good doctor trying to find out the "secret"), is as cold as The Haunting's "scares". It's just uneffective and predictable, there's no surprise, actually there's no any feelings or sensations at all.2. Wwhhyy It's ssssoooo ssllooww ppaacceedd???: I would have appreciated this movie if it had been released last year because I had some problems to sleep. I would have a good time (sleeping) at the movies. There are too many unnecessary scenes and the actors seems to be speaking t-o a f-i-v-e y-e-a-r-'s o-l-d c-h-i-l-d. Without the commercials, and X-Files episode goes by 40 minutes length. There's more substance. And "The Sixth..." is a 2 hour feature.3. The twist: Movies like "The Crying Game", "The Usual Suspects" or "Fight Club", would have been stunning movies even if the screenwriter wouldn't have added their great twists that made them unforgettable films. Why? Well, because the rest of their stories were great. In "The Sixth Sense", if you're a middle-skilled watcher, you'll discover the "famous" twist after 10 minutes, and it will ruin your experience, because the rest of the movie does nothing else that "almost scream-it-on-your-face". The story isn't interesting, because you already know all that could be interesting.4. The scares / The end: Two scares, one for hour. Happy end. Think in a cross between "The Shining" (Great film!) and "Good Will Hunting" (not bad). Isn't it like Coke with Corn Flakes?The Best scare:What happened you, Donnie Whalberg!!!!????I rate this one: 1. (It's a shame we can't vote 0) I feel guilty because Osment does a great effort, but the rest of you, voters, have put this film to close-of-the-top, and I think that It has to be placed in the right place (out of the top 100, at least).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A single unexpected twist does not make a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most surprising thing in the ending of this film is that it actually ended - it seemed to drag forever, never getting anywhere. Bruce Willis, after getting tired of standard issue action films, became rather irregular in choosing scripts. After the superb "Fifth Element", I had high hopes for the "Sixth Sense", but, other than the ending, there is nothing original here, it's just "Ghost II - The Mission".Of course, once you accept the existence of supernatural phenomena there are very few surprises left; anything is possible, since the supernatural laws seem to be very flexible. In this film there is no evident clue to strictly define it as a "supernatural phenomena" sort of film, so I kept wondering if there would be a natural explanation that put everything back in our physical universe, transforming it from the "terror" to the "thriller" category. No such luck. We get the same old story, so many times told. "Some people are able to see ghosts and become scared by them at first, but ghosts are just people who died with their missions in the Earth incomplete, and they need help from living persons to finish their tasks so they can progress further to their final destiny". Please, tell me something new, this story can become boring after a century or two.All in all, it's a linear plot, corny, absolutely humorless, full of clichs, with flat characters. Its only redeeming quality is the photography, appropriately dark, cloudy outdoors and sparsely illuminated indoors.Better see again that old Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore tape, rather than waste your time watching this crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm baffled by the popularity of this film -- it is excruciatingly slow, only halfway through it do we find out anything of interest (that the boy can see ghosts), the plot of the movie starts flat and stays flat throughout (the final twist at the end excepted, but that, in my mind, does not save the two hours of drudgery), and the characters seem uniformly one-dimensional. The little boy talks more like an adolescent that he could not be (his performance is good; it's the writing that's not believable), and throughout I felt instead of touched, emotionally manipulated (here's the music for you to feel moved, never mind that the dialogue and the situation is thoroughly cheesy). The story means well, but it feels like the screenwriter's bad first draft -- it needed substantial polishing. If you decide to see this film, know that you're in for a fake, manufactured experience without satisfactory plot development or resolution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the years best films--with a jaw dropping final twist. ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE SIXTH SENSE (1999) ***1/2Starring: Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, Olivia Williams, Toni Collette and Glenn Fitzgerald Written and directed by: M. Night Shyamalan 106 minutes Rated PG-13 (for much intense material and some related gore)By Blake French:"The Sixth Sense" is one of the years best films. It brings together effectively and efficiently every concept of why horror films exist. So many movies these days do not live up to the promise of their genre, but "The Sixth Sense" does it so perfectly and convincingly that it is almost hard to tell weather this film is based on actual events or not."The Sixth Sense" tells the story of a psychiatrist named Malcolm Crowe, who, in the film's opening, is confronted by a past client who has broke into his house waving a gun over his head screaming things like "You lied," "You did not help me" and especially mysteriously "Do you know why you are afraid when you're along--I do." He shoots Malcolm and kills himself.The film then cuts to months later, where Malcolm is curious to investigate a nine year old boy, Cole Sear, who has the same rare symptoms as his patient that killed himself recently. He feels it is his duty to cure the child's illness to make up for his slacking off on the other unfortunate patient. After investigation, and some bonding between the curious Malcolm and the always terrified Cole, he discovers that the boy has a secret. One that is so personal and unbelievable Cole has never explained it to anyone, including his struggling single mother. Soon, however, Cole tells Malcolm his concealed message, "I see dead people," the young boy whispers, "they walk around like everyone else...they don't even know that they're dead," he explains. Naturally at first Malcolm disbelieves him, but as new evidence arrives, and issues involving his wife arise, he must choose between the one he loves or the boy he'll never forget.The story setup to "The Sixth Sense" is thought-out and detailed enough so that we ponder upon it and become involved. It is handled with such delicacy that even the slightest flaw would have destroyed the entire film in which its basis is held together with. Through character issues and the personal territory this film covers, we are weary about entering the character's lives; this is private area hear and it is none of our bussing what is going on inside the head of young Cole Sear. Surly some audiences will feel intimidated about learning his secret since it is so built up with a peek of high tension. The adult terror material is all in line with the film's subject matter; there is no excess violence or gore, nor is there any sub-plots that distract the story from its final message. There is some distraction in the relationship with Malcolm and his wife. But by the end, everything fits together like a perfectly pieced mind puzzle. The film is not without flaws, however. Though the subplots do not sidetrack the film, a few of them do not provide enough information to serve a purpose in the plot. For instance, there is a subplot where a dead girl asks Cole to deliver a secret tape involving her death to her father. It has some revealing and emotionally on target material, but we know so little about the characters involving this story that I felt a little lost. And some particular wounds found on the bodies of the individuals inflicted with the "sixth sense" seem significant, but are never fully explained. At times in the movie I felt like the characters were dragging on and on, and felt myself shouting inside phrases like "come on, get to the point."For the most part, however, the characters pull the plot through tedious moments, like the ones I have listed. The movie has a final twist that excels beyond any other twist revealed in any other thriller I have ever seen. More perplexing than "Entrapment." More jaw-dropping than "Wild Things." More compelling than "Goodbye Lover." And more awe inspiring than "Arlington Road." It is disturbing but somehow completely believable. I am very tempted to describe the content of the final five minutes to you--but I am afraid that it is up to you to figure out. This twist is so neat that it will make you want to see the movie over again, in order to see if throughout the production the film lived up to the material. This is a very tricky ending to succeed with, but "The Sixth Sense" does it wonderfully.Brought to you by Hollywood Pictures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it does not surprise me that most people like this movie so much. it is often well-acted, has a well concealed plot twist, and many, albeit canned, touching and startling moments.unfortunately it just isn't very smart.one can imagine the writer(s) asking this question, "what if some people with apparent psychological maladies really have insight into another world?" wouldn't that be nice. unfortunately this is not the world i am familiar with. in my world death and grief, the cruelty of human beings and the bonds of love, these things are mysterious. it is not that my imagination of the variety of 'what ifs' is pedestrian. it is that i have a wild imagination and am still wracked by uncertainty.this film glosses over the fundamental human theme of this uncertainty and instead assumes a fantasy world of magic and ghosts and purposefulness to every event. by showing us the ghosts, not only are we assaulted with cheap special effects, but all uncertainty evaporates...the struggle of the boy and the psychiatrist are a foregone conclusion. we are left with just the fantasy world.and it is not a rich fantasy world. it is mundane. it is commonplace for us to assume that our lives have meaning and that everything in them is somehow, given just the right perspective, understandable to us. this film supports that common assumption. that, i imagine, is why this run of the mill prostitute caked in obvious musical make-up is so attractive to many. it confirms their unquestioned biases.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps careful editing, or a director who's work didn't so resemble a 30 second commercial..there are lots of things that might have made this movie worthy of an exceptional premise, unfortunately - it just ain't here.I like Bruce Willis - he can play drama, but here, he's given nothing to do but smirk meaningfully while the plot, drags on and on, getting to the point we all know it's going to get to. I actually appreciate movies that cut out all the standard, "coming to believe a fantastic tale", bit. You know the routine - character sees strange things..stranger finally tries to make other character believe strange things..plot creaks along until other character finally be;lives strange things exist. That might have played well the first hundred times it was used, but I'd just as soon get to the meat of the matter and move the damn plot along!Anyway, several scenes are so obviously staged that I found myself watching the extras in the scene, wondering what the assistant directors had told them to do..For instance, take the scene where Willis is late for dinner in the restaurant...The setting and filming looked so obviously staged that I couldn't pay attention to the leads.Or - a long shot of Willis and the kid walking up the street, just when an entire little-league team walks across the from of the shot..obvious and clumsy, slice of life touches that distract instead of feeling a natural part of the scene.But - great ending, serviced by the outline of a great plot that was poorly filled in and poorly directed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE SIXTH SENSE is a refreshing and absorbing ghost story that is much more than meets the eye. It is great to see a major Hollywood release go back to old school fright methods. Do not expect to see thrill-a-minute, falsely produced chills. This is a truly original piece of atmospheric filmmaking that earns the viewer's responses, which include frequent oohs and aahs and an occasional scream.Writer-Director M. Night Shyamalan, a Philly native, presents a plodding build-up to one of the best payoffs I have seen in a thriller in the past few years. Seeing the film, I knew the young boy (played incredibly by Haley Joel Osment) has a "gift" and sees certain people walking around no one else can see. Shyamalan seems to have taken a page out of Spielberg's JAWS, where the shark is never fully seen until crucial climactic scenes, and applied it to the boy's problem. It is most definitely a problem if you are interacting with people who supposedly no longer walk the earth. You may be unsure as to what he really is seeing until the great frights and charms of the picture hit you. You know when Shyamalan means for us to get it and become involved.Bruce Willis is so reserved it is scary in itself and he plays off the boy very effectively. SIXTH SENSE takes place on some other plane of existence it seems. That is how I felt. Sometimes you wonder whether people are seeing the main characters, who are all, in varying ways, mixed up in this whirlwind of terrifying sights and dimensions. It is not manipulative and the scares do not need manufacturing. We are led through them as a good script should put an audience through.Toni Collette has picked up a good South Philadelphia accent and is simply flabbergasted as to what the hell is going on with her seemingly gifted, yet sick, young son. Osment as "Cole", the boy star of the film outshines even Willis and shows he is capable of playing a character deeper than Forrest Gump Jr. (yep, that's him). There is a lot of religious reference to afterlife which is fitting and the so-called "twist" is indeed a twist to remember.All involved in this surprising production should be proud of the fact that you can still keep an audience in traction with moody story-telling and visuals and NO computer-generated effects. Compare this to the current release THE HAUNTING and realize how much better these bare bones are.Rating ***1/2</fullReview>

However, there are too many plot holes. I just don't understand why some ghosts can move things and some can't, why some ghosts can't see/realize their own wounds... The atmosphere is great though. Also, ghosts that walk pass like normal are much horrible than ghosts which just look scary &amp; dangerous. The story makes me feel depressed too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the previews of "The Sixth Sense", I was itching to see it. The idea was great, the story seemed great. However, after sitting through this film (along with 1000 other people in a sold-out theater), I realize that there was one thing missing - interest. I wish I had $1 for every person that was falling asleep around me. This film is the poster child for boring. Once again, they lured me in with awesome previews, took my $$, and kicked me in the ass. This film makes you feel like you have just been violated.I DO have to say that the ending was unexpected, and the five minutes that made up the ending was decent. It doesn't, however, make up for a horrible film. What was Bruce Willis thinking when he read this script? I mean, Willis isn't the best actor in Hollywood, but he should have at least had the brains to let someone else suffer through this (well, I mean someone BESIDES the people who saw it ... we suffered the most).I feel that I need to mention Haley Osment. This child can act. His character could not have been played any better by anyone else. His performance stood out and he should be recognized for being a glimmer of light in such a terrible film.I implore you .... take the $5 and either rent a good film from BBuster or better yet, flush it down the toilet...because that's where it will go ANYWAY if you spend it on "The Sixth Sense". Wait until it hits video and borrow it from a friend when HE rents it."Frightening"? "A Thriller"?

This is the best ghost story I've seen since Robert Wise's classic THE HAUNTING. It's smart and very moving, while still having the requisite thrills. It doesn't cater to the "jump out and yell Boo! every six minutes" theory of thriller, but it has a number of genuine shocks (and a fabulous twist toward the end). Bruce Willis is wonderful - subdued and intelligent in his best dramatic performance since IN COUNTRY. And Haley Joel Osment is simply superb as the haunted Cole. He never overreaches or overacts. He simply experiences and reveals. It's one of the best dramatic child performances I've seen in years. If you liked THE INNOCENTS or THE HAUNTING or even GHOST, I highly recommend this film to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Puzzling, absorbing, good twist as the final touch...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To fully accept the premise of THE SIXTH SENSE, you first have to accept BRICE WILLIS as a prominent child psychologist after seeing him in all those DIE HARD films. He goes from an action star to an intense doctor absorbed with a child patient (HALEY JOEL OSMENT) who claims he can see the dead.Struggling professionally after a maniacal ex-patient has shot and wounded him in the heat of rage, the psychologist is determined to help Osment from going off the deep end the way his former patient did. That is the crux of the story.It involves flashbacks, flash forwards and all kinds of camera tricks to keep you guessing how it's all going to end, since the big hype about the film was that it had a twist ending. Well, it was a surprise to me--but now, years later, after seeing so many films of this ilk which are obviously copycat types that deal with ghosts or the supernatural--I'm not so sure I'd be fooled so easily again.However, a surprise it was for me and it's done so cleverly that you'll want to revisit the film to see just how the trickery was managed.BRUCE WILLIS cannot quite do away with the smirk he had as the anti-hero in many a film, so I have to reserve some criticism for his performance. But it doesn't matter since the film revolves around the dark secrets and behavior of HALEY JOEL OSMENT, very good child actor who manages to keep the plot believable and interesting.Absorbing thriller, even if it starts out a little slowly and doesn't really build up its suspense in a taut way. But that ending is clever!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly segments completely ruin the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can a ghost throw an object at a window? How can the grandmother, who is a ghost, steal a physical object? They might as well have ended the movie with the same absurd outlandishness as the utterly silly movie "Ghost" with Patrick Swayze, and just have Bruce Willis hug and kiss his wife goodbye at the end. They already ruined it as a serious, believable horror movie, so why not finish it off in the same ridiculous manner. I mean if Patrick Swayze as a ghost can beat up a fellow with a physical body, and Bruce Willis as a ghost can pick up and throw corporeal objects, why not go all out and just give the movie an ending with the same silly elements they already added in to the movie. At least they would win over people like my elderly mother who would rent it for the silly, "feel good" 100% Hollywood ending. As it stands now, mature Horror fans rate this movie closer to "Ghost" due to the superfluous inane segments, far away from something more sophisticated like "Rosemary's Baby", which treats its subject matter with more seriousness, depth, and overall respect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan offers one of the best movies of the 90ties</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Shyamalan released THE SIXTH SENSE, the world expected tons from this guy, and that's not weird. Because with the talent of making such a movie as this, you're obviously having a huge knowledge inside movie making, though the three movies he has made later have none challenged this.We get to know Dr. Malcolm Crowe that's a child psychologist. He's trying to help Cole, a little boy that hides a terrible secret from the rest of the people he knows. His unbalanced mental side makes big problems with his mother that tries helping him out, but soon it's obvious that the only person being able to help Cole, is Malcolm...The movie shocked when it arrived, not for being extra violent or using more "f-words" that usual, this is just such a original, brilliant and story based around a fabulous twist. Bruce Willis stars as Malcolm Crowe in a great way, his truly fine performance of a child psychologist who's failed once and truly can't forgive himself for that - is a character that Willis does in a great way. Haley Joel Osment delivers one of the best child performances of all time, giving such a fright and sense to it all that you just got to be stunned.THE SIXTH SENSE gives you frightening scenes picked from the best of horror, and also pure humanity scenes with dialog and getting to know the characters in a absolutely wonderful way - and Shyamalan's unique way to mix together freaky horror with human drama, is without doubt one of the thing's that makes this, and all of his movies so interesting, exciting, smart and well made. This movie is his greatest achievement, because it reaches to the drama scene better than any of his other movies - but though shall be said; M. Night Shyamalan is a wonderful director that's delivered the goods on all four / UNBREAKABLE, SIGNS and THE VILLAGE.Shyamalan also does a cameo as in the rest of his movies. THE SIXTH SENSE is terrifyingly good and filled with details that will truly excite a film lover's heart. "I See Dead People"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did my video chop the last 10 minutes off?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers ThroughoutI was in shock at the end of this film. But, because of how ridiculously it ended and more so because most of the questions hadn't been answered, and indeed still haven't. Up until 10 minutes from the end it was pretty good. 10 minutes later it had degenerated into a complete farce.Where do we start?Are you telling me someone can go 9 months or so without realising they're dead and not a single person speaking to, or even acknowledging him in that time? What has he been doing for food in that time? I guessed this outcome right at the start but then dismissed immediately after as it wouldn't have worked.Nobody I speak to seems to know for certain whether the child knew Bruce Willis was a ghost. If he did, then why was he not scared of him? What made Bruce so special? and did he not see the patch of blood on his mack? and how come only he can change his clothes and not appear in the state he died in?And how come Bruce is able to lob a lump of rock at a shop window or play a tape recording yet all the other ghosts need to attract this kid to do anything. Why could the girl at the funeral not have just put her video tape somewhere where the dad would've seen it?Ghosts also go nowhere near churches and I thought maybe there might have been a link as to why either Bruce or the kid were particularly special or gifted, despite constant refererences to his past. If you look closely enough, his Wife does acknowledge him at their anniversary, so does the kids mum when he walks in their house.It does not suprise me The "Great Unwashed" of Britain and America consider this an amazing and clever ending. Anyone who has watched an Agatha Christie film would be use to it. Anyone who has watched 'Jonathan Creek' would get endings twice as brilliant and complex as this every week, where everything is resolved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS...... ....Everyone who saw this movie said that it was great, but for all the hype, I was very disappointed. I REALLY don't see how anyone could not have guessed the ending, it was painfully obvious. The man never changed his clothes, interacted with anyone. I also don't understand how Malcolm didn't realize that something was up with him. "Hmmmm...I don't talk to anyone and no one talks to me...wonder why?" All of the "red" clues were obvious as well, but not exactly brilliant.I also don't think this movie had much of a plot. It just kind of moved along, at a rather boring rate. I understand that Cole was there to help the dead people, but if that was the whole outcome...why didn't we see him helping more ghosts? Just that one girl. They could have done a lot more. I was also waiting for more to come of Cole's dad, especially the way Malcolm emphasized it so much in the beginning.In summary, a thriller which didn't create suspense with a boring and obvious outcome. I think Haley's a good actor and did a great job, but other than that, this movie gives nothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My lovely friend Emma's review!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my friend Emma's review!'The film starts off with Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and his wife Anna Crowe (Olivia Williams) getting drunk as a celebration of Malcolm's honour plaque given to him by the Government/Council. After running upstairs, ready to jump into bed together, they hear a noise in the bathroom. It turns out a mental ex-patient of Malcolm's has broken in ("Vincent Gray"), and in the end of the scene Malcolm is shot by him, but the audience don't know yet that he is, in fact, dead.The first plot hole my friend and I came across was the notes Malcolm has on Cole Sear, his new client. How did he get the notes? We don't know. As it turns out in the very end, Malcolm has been dead the entire time, so he finds out for himself then why nobody has spoken to him for such a long time (yet another plot hole, because you WOULD notice that). You can rule out the idea that 'Coles mother filled Malcolm in with all the details' because Malcolm is dead and nobody can see him. A ridiculous detail I found out was that Bruce Willis had to write with his right hand in this film (he is naturally left-handed) to hide the fact he is not wearing his wedding ring since his death in the first scene. Plot hole number three comes up soon after, when we find Malcolm and Cole's mother sitting opposite one another in chairs in the Sear's resident lounge. I started to wonder; how did the very-dead-and-invisible Malcolm actually get into the house in the first place? Did he simply knock on the door and dart in as a confused Mrs Sear opens the door to an empty space? That, of course, would be ridiculous. So we are left wondering how the Hell he got in. Anyway, it is "cleverly designed" to make it look like Mrs Sear was speaking to Malcolm before Cole enters the house, returning home from school. Of course, when you figure out he's dead, you end up thinking how stupid that technique was because it was pointless and confusing, NOT a 'twist' in the plot. Later on in the film, a few scenes later, there is the scene where Malcolm is supposedly 'unravelling the secret' Cole has about his sixth sense, seeing dead people. The scene is where Malcolm is listening to a recording of himself and Vincent years ago in one of the counselling sessions. This scene soon gets on your nerves as all you can see is a confused Malcolm with a ridiculous expression on his face listening to what sounds like an out of tune radio. Yes, spooky, Shymalan. Apparently, from the "information" Malcolm gets from this event, he "figures out" that Cole has a similar condition as Vincent did. Diddy-Mao, Malcolm, we already figured that out for ourselves scenes ago! Now would be an opportune moment to mention that the actor that played Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) is incredibly irritating throughout the film. He gives off that 'theatre-brat' attitude that makes you not want to give him any sympathy for his issues, but instead put him in a cage and throw away the key.After a scene where a pathetic Malcolm tells Cole of his "explanation" regarding the ghosts Cole sees, that the ghosts are actually wanting to have Cole's help, they summon up this idea for Cole that he should indeed help the people he sees. The acting is, again, ridiculous and melodramatic as Cole sees more hanging dead people.Plot hole number 5 occurs when Malcolm visits Cole in his school play. Why didn't anybody sit on him? He's not there, after all.In the next scene or so, Malcolm returns to his home, where he finds his wife asleep on the couch with the couple's wedding video on in the background. As she sleeps, Anna's hand releases Malcolm's wedding ring, which he suddenly discovers he has not been wearing. Ding, ding, ding! Plot hole number 6! A shocked Malcolm has only JUST realised he hasn't been wearing his wedding ring! Oh dear! What an atrocity! I think not, just plain stupid. He then attempts to open the cupboard door he attempted to open on more than one occasion during the film, and then realises he can't open it because Anna has blocked the door with boxes, as revealed by the camera as it falls back to show the boxes. Yet another unfulfilled, pointless, random scene. Wouldn't you notice the boxes before then? A confused and upset Malcolm then rushes upstairs to the bedroom and discovers his wound from the gunshot. Cue plot hole number 7; who in their right mind doesn't notice a gaping hole in their stomach for over a year? Malcolm really isn't on the ball is he? Anyway, he realises he's actually dead now and puts two and two together as to why his wife has been ignoring him. After a few flashbacks we realise Anna wasn't actually in a mood with Malcolm, she just never saw him! Oh the twists and turns of this film just get worse, don't they? Cheesefest. Malcolm has a conversation with Anna, as Cole told him to. He says he loves her and that she wasn't second best to his job. Oh, what a lovely ending. The screen then fades to black. Fin.Another plot hole/random 'detail' I noticed was the amount of red props used in the film (Lynn's red nails, Cole's red sweater, the red balloon at the birthday party, etc). The camera makes a bee line for all these random red items but we never really find out why. According to Shymalan, it symbolised something the audience had to figure out. I didn't figure it out, it's just too out of place and stupid.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bruce Willis looks appropriately grim throughout thriller about a child psychologist who attempts to help a troubled young boy who claims to see ghosts. Surprisingly popular other-worldly yarn (surprising because the film is so old-fashioned), it goes to sometimes hokey means to get a scare out of the audience, but is nevertheless very well-made and engrossing. Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, the picture is low-keyed, somewhat ambitious, but not very delicate, with plot-holes and moments where there seems to be no driving force behind the narrative; for such a deliberately-paced movie, Shyamalan doesn't show much grace, only technical finesse. "The Sixth Sense" is like a good "Night Gallery" episode: occasionally suspenseful, with solid, non-showy performances, but with the general feeling that we've been down this road before. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."The Sixth Sense" (1999) was one of those movies i couldn't get enough during upon its release almost 17 years ago. The mystery, performances, script, directing, horror and THAT unforgettable and once in a lifetime twist at the end that left me speechless - this is definitely one of my all time favorite movies. This is still the best movie M. Night Shyamalan has ever created, and seeing his movies now, he will probably unfortunately won't top this one. That said, i liked many his movies post "The Sixth Sense", but nothing came closed in comparison to this masterpiece. Overall, as you have probably seen this movie more then once, there isn't anything new that can be said about it. It's definitely one the best movies of all time i think, that works equally good as a mystery, horror, drama and character study. One of the kind movie experience.</fullReview>

You may think that this film is the very horror movie, but you fell some strange as you watch. Firstly, a man who is psychiatrist is ignored by his wife, despite they are loving each other, and around people. Secondly, the scene which the couple is threaded by murder cut in sometimes, but you can't know the outcome. But you can solve the mysteries at last scene. Though this movie is a horror film, the ghosts don't show up frequently because this film focuses the mystery of the man and the suffering of the leading character who can see ghosts. So the performance of them is so important in this movie. And this film is so good to give us the fear without showing up ghosts. It is the scene when the leading character is eating lunch with his mother. After his mother comes back from other place, all of shelves in the kitchen open surprisingly. The phenomenon shocks us strongly and you can't forget the scene forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For anyone who has no background knowledge at all surrounding this movie, it is hard to discuss The Sixth Sense without spoilers, but I'll try my best.This is by far one of my favorite films from the 1990's, if not one of my favorite films ever. Throughout the entire film, you get a very powerful feeling of suspense that simply leaves you craving for what's next. The Sixth Sense leaves you guessing one more thing after the next, and then completely turns your beliefs around and practically alters the movie's reality. It hooks you right from the start, with an opening scene that will leave you questioning what in the world just happened. But as the story unravels, things piece together and your jaw will drop multiple times.It is also difficult to talk about this film without at least mentioning the affect of its ending. The Sixth Sense has one of the most unexpected and powerful endings of any movie I've ever seen. When it pieces every detail together at its end, you may still be thinking about it 3 hours after watching it. It's movie making at its best.Before M. Night Shyamalan made crap like The Happening and The Last Airbender, he made some truly powerful films. The Sixth Sense is one of those films, and it is undoubtedly a movie experience you have to witness before you die.Rating: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M Night Shyamalan's sleight-of-hand masterpiece.A child psychologist, Dr Malcolm Crowe (played by Bruce Willis), is shot by a deranged former patient of his, Vincent Grey. Grey then kills himself. A few months later he is counseling a boy, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who shows similar symptoms to Grey. He is worried that Cole will go down the same path. However, Cole has certain special, supernatural abilities...Great movie with a brilliant twist at the end. For the most part it feels like a slow-burning horror movie. Writer-director M Night Shyamalan, directing his third movie (though the first two were very low-key), expertly builds the tension and intrigue. The twist, when it comes, is so unexpected, but works so well and fits so perfectly with the plot. Even watching the movie a second time you are hard-pressed to fault how the twist fits in with the plot.Some great drama too, and quite emotional at times, especially towards the end.Solid performance by Bruce Willis in the lead role. Good work from Haley Joel Osment as the boy. Good support from Toni Collette and Olivia Williams. Osment and Collette got Supporting Actor/Actress Oscar nominations for their performances.Just a pity Shyamalan couldn't reproduce this form in any of his subsequent movies. His next movie, "Unbreakable", was good, but not brilliant. "Signs" was mediocre and "The Village" was okay, but not great. After that his movies were very bad - "Lady in the Water", "The Happening" and "The Last Airbender" were very silly and pointless. One keeps hoping for a return to the creative brilliance that was The Sixth Sense but, considering how his movies seem to get worse with every attempt, this may be hoping too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DISCLAIMER: Analytical writing, along with most other forms of writing, are definitely not my strong suit so if this review feels rushed, choppy, or not well thought out it was not my intent.Very rarely do I see a movie where after wards I feel as if my life was changed in a meaningful way. Most of the time the films I watch serve as two hour diversions, brief respites in the midst of often long, tiresome, and occasionally depressing (at least for me) days. THE SIXTH SENSE triumphantly resides in the former category. In both of my viewings from the opening confrontation in Malcolm and Anna's apartment to the pitch-perfect finale, I was inseparably wrapped up in the events on screen. Through flawless direction, disturbingly convincing performances, and a beautiful yet mysterious score, this movie managed to not only invest me in the action, but even went as far as to occasionally make me forget I was even watching a film; such an occurrence happened during the car scene between Cole and Lynn.I know that I haven't elaborated much on the details of the plot, or even on a few of the film's inconsistencies, but in my opinion the best way of viewing this film is to not know too much about it going in. Avoid message boards, FAQs, and even the original theatrical trailer as best as possible, all of which are laden full of spoiler-filled information that'll reduce the intrigue. That's not to say that knowing the plot beforehand, which is what happened to me, will prevent you from greatly enjoying the film, but it will lessen the feeling of discovery that can come from the experience.Watching this movie on New Year's Eve was a lot of fun last night, and right next to black eyed pea dip I'm definitely going to make it a New Year's tradition.10/10</fullReview>

There are some warm human moments as well as some bone-chilling scary moments (like the opening scene).

Night deceiving everyone and more importantly, he challenged everyone because it is very difficult to rely on such an idea without falling into any error or lapse, and even to use this idea to increase the mystery, dazzling and challenge . I've watched a lot of movies that continue to impact on me for a long time, but this movie has a continuous effect for years up till now. As a continuation of creativity the 3 actors that participate in this work (Willis, Haley and Tony) performed their roles very literally and creativity to release Unforgettable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been few movies that have generated so much buzz and mystery.Many films in this genre have scared the pants off of their poor audience, with a special nod to "The Blair Witch Project," but this movie is very different (and much more engaging). The Sixth Sense tells you with its story, its pace, and its acts that something will happen, but you can't put your finger on it until the very end. The Sixth Sense offers no "cheap scares" present in movies like Scream in which things just jump out at you. This film will make you anxious and it will make you afraid. Long after the film is over (think Psycho, which left so many afraid of showering after). At the same time, you will smile and find bittersweet hope in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Job, Shyamalan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan gets a lot of hate for making a lot of horrible films. And, I must admit, a lot of his films look pretty horrible to me, but I haven't seen them yet, and this film is pretty great!Although flawed, "The Sixth Sense" manages to be full of some genuinely powerful moments, and a very smart script. Seriously, it is amazing how they were able to pull of the twist ending and STILL have the whole film make a lot of sense. But, it isn't a film just about horror and twist endings, it is also a very good drama film, and I'm surprised a film this bleak and emotional has actually gotten tons of attention from the general public.However, as I mentioned earlier, the film is flawed. One of the biggest flaws is the delivery. Now, the acting in this film is very well-done, but it'd be even better if not every character spoke...so...slowly...and...whispered...every...line. Also, I DID unintentionally laugh at some sequences, but those scenes are very few, although they were kind of odd.Overall, SEE IT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a man called Malcolm who works as a doctor to care children's mental. He has wife, but they don't have good relationships. One day, he meets a boy Cole who has unusual ability. He can see dead people in a daily life. After he tells this secret to Malcolm, he comes to be relieved a little bit, but of course he seems scary. When they notice that those dead people tell him what they want to tell them, they started to do something instead of dead people. The secret is not told except Malcolm, but Cole decides to tell it to his mother, and they come to have good relationships each other. It means Malcolm manages to cure his illness. For me, on the whole, it was so surprising that I think I want to watch it more and more. I think that is why so many people watch it a lot. As my teacher recommends me to watch, I would like to do the same thing to my friends. It is well-created, and the quality is really high. I really like the movie, but it is a little scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow, Entertaining Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It amazes me to think about how old this movie is. It's from 1999. This is most likely the actor Haley Joel Osment's, most memorable film. I haven't seen him in films in awhile, and if you look at recent pictures from him, you'll think about how he was a cute kid, but he hasn't aged well. That being said, I'm a little older than Haley Joel Osment and if you saw me you'd think I look young for my age. Like there are employees at work who once guessed I was 14, and then said I look 18. 14 is a little too young, I don't think I look that young. But, to people who feel old one thing is for sure and that's not all of us age the same. Some look old for their age, while some look young. You could look at names of celebrities who don't age online and celebrities from Modern Family would come up, like Sofia Vergara/Gloria, and Sarah Hyland/Haley. You'd also see names like Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. But, if you look at celebrities who have aged badly, you'd see Haley Joel Osment's name.OK, talking about aging was off topic. But, I just wanted to leave a random message on an IMDb movie review. That's if you're feeling old, remember there's nothing you can do about your age. How old you are since when you were born. What you do with your body might age you faster or slower. But, we are not as old as we might think we are. Because, apparently not everybody ages the same.So, to get to my point this movie is a great Thriller. It was like the top film back in 1999 next to The Phantom Menace. It's been well received and well remembered. It also more than likely is the director M. Night Shyamalan's most memorable/successful film. Some of his more recent films like The Last Airbender, and After Earth haven't done well. Another film of his is coming out tomorrow, The Visit. That film looks entertaining, but looks like it will be more cheesy and like it's a modern version of Hansel And Gretel. That film like this film is also taking place in my home state and has scenes in Philadelphia. Man, I don't hear about these movies in the news being filmed locally, or see any sign of a film crew around. I wonder if I could have been an extra in one of these movies? They show a scene in The Visit at the train station in Philadelphia 30th Street Station. I've been there lots of times, but never heard of a film project over there. It's interesting to think where movies have been filmed, and how the director of both movies who grew up around Philadelphia has his movies from there.So, I've mostly been off topic. But, what makes this movie great. Well, up until a couple of years ago I hadn't seen this movie for more than a decade. I remembered it, but it wasn't a movie I cared to see. I mostly remembered the movie being dark and depressing. Like yeah, even if you haven't seen it you more than likely are familiar with the line, "I See Dead People" from this movie. Also, we see the character played by Haley Joel Osment sad in a lot of scenes including deleted scenes. It almost seemed like a young, lonely, isolated boy who had problems that wouldn't go away, and focusing on dead people. Also, it seemed a little like a quiet dark movie, which it is. This isn't a fast paced horror movie. But, it will definitely keep you entertained. My perceptions from this movie have changed from the last couple of times I saw it. I even last saw this movie when I was having a depressing day myself, when I normally don't have depressing days. The movie definitely helped put me in a better mood, and I was able to laugh at a couple of scenes. I got myself into the movie both times I saw it, and it's not as depressing of a movie as I remember. This movie also is a clever story. Being able to see dead people. Though, if you look the the story wasn't something M. Night Shyamalan came up with on his own. He came up with the idea from an episode of Are You Afraid Of The Dark. He already would have been an adult when that episode aired, and got his idea from a kids TV show. Though this movie won't feel like it's a kids movie even when the main character is a kid, and even if it was inspired by a kids TV show. It will also seem more serious than a TV show like Ghost Whisperer, which also involves a girl being able to see the dead.I ought to say, I won't tell you what it is, even if you haven't seen it you probably already heard of the twist. This movie is famous for a Twist At The End. Almost nobody who saw this movie for the first time and wasn't already told what it was, could figure the twist out that's revealed at the end. There are even clues leading to the twist, but they most likely won't seem apparent to anybody who doesn't already know what it is. I heard the movie coming out tomorrow, The Visit is supposed to have an ending Twist, and I'm not sure what it is?I'll give this movie an 8/10. It's not my favorite movie, but it is still an entertaining movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting and surprising</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of Cole, a boy who has the gift of seeing spirits of the dead, and that is helped by Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a child psychiatrist. Directed by M. Night Shyamalan, with the participation of Bruce Willis (Dr. Crowe) and Haley Joel Osment (Cole).It is one of thrillers most successful nineties, covering topics that always consider interesting and which are recurring in films of this genre. However, Shyamalan's approach is innovative and different, because the main character is an absolutely skeptical individual. The film contains some scenes which eventually became famous, even scoring Haley Osment career. But one of the most interesting points of this movie is the ending, a surprising twist that makes the movie less predictable, as well as being one of the trademarks of this director. Although he already has a few years and be well known, this is a film that always worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the greatest reveals of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) celebrates an award win with his wife Anna (Olivia Williams). Deranged ex-patient Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg) breaks in and shots Malcolm. Vincent then commits suicide. The next fall, Malcolm is treating distressed Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) who lives with his single mom Lynn (Toni Collette). His suffering leaves him an outcast at school. After another episode leaves him in the hospital, he tells Malcolm his secret that he "sees dead people".This is one of the best reveals in movie history. It's not simply a shocking twist. Anybody can write a random twist that aims to shock people. This twist is well-planned and constructed from the first moments of the film. Shyamalan lays out not only clues but the right amount of clues. It is a twist that people are unlikely to foresee but then beat themselves for not forseeing it. He gets the perfect balance.The other question is whether this is a good movie without the twist. The great thing is that the intensity does not rely on the twist. HJO has the perfect wise innocence quality. It has great creepiness. It's a traditional ghost story and a well made one. The intensity ramps up as the ghosts reveal themselves. This would be one of the great horrors even without the twist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Storytelling done right and child acting at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing about movies with major twists is that the film needs to stand up once you know the end. The Usual Suspects is an engrossing and complex crime story with a great screenplay and acting. The Empire Strikes back is a soaring space opera with iconic dialogue and memorable characters. Seven is a sprawling bore that's so dark it's almost pitch black. And The Sixth Sense is still a surprisingly touching, often horrifying and incredibly clever film. Picking apart Shyamalan's incredibly detailed screenplay for all the little clues about the big twist is so much fun.The best thing that The Sixth Sense could ever have done was make Vincent and Cole similar cases. A massive misdirect for all who might have otherwise seen it coming, Shyamalan presents you with a doctor who failed one patient and seeks to make it up with his second, to the extent that he's grown distant from everyone. Just that alone makes me respect Shyamalan's storytelling ability. Beautifully shot and directed sequences, with the editing team knowing just when to cut away, are almost gleeful in feeding you hints buried under a seemingly legitimate and normal conduct. Shyamalan's use of the colour red shows beyond a filmmaking passion ? it's attention to detail in a story he had to see done right. Shyamalan also has key focus for directing horror ? sudden blasts of jolting music and dramatic reveals of ghosts and their life-claiming injuries are just horror done right. I was just as terrified as Cole. But Shyamalan also has a flair for directing some of the most tender scenes in the film ? a funeral where Cole reveals the deceased girl's cause of death to her grieving father, and the aforementioned scenes between Cole and his mother could have been directed by Sam Mendes or Frank Darabont, they were so gentle.Haley Joel Osment has just soared to one of my all time favourite child performances. The Sixth Sense has only confirmed to me that 1999 was a brilliant year for supporting actor performances ? Michael Clarke Duncan in The Green Mile, Tom Cruise in Magnolia ? but Osment rightfully stood out as one of the year's best. I never doubted for one second that this strange child was one who has been tortured day in and day out by the souls of the dead. His tearful scenes against his disbelieving mother (an equally good Toni Collette) are utterly heartbreaking, as is his quirky behaviour leading up to a horrific incident where he is shut in a crawlspace. As audience members, we wish we could just leap into the TV and protect Cole from all the problems ? and Collette does an exceptional job of the protective mother. Bruce Willis anchors the film adequately, but this film is all about Osment.There are times where the film gets a bit schmaltzy, such as a "happily ever after" scene where Osment is now popular, the lead in the school play and the bully is relegated to "village idiot." I also found a scene where Cole screams "stuttering Stanley" at his teacher to be a relatively silly way to end what was a powerful scene. The final sequence with Willis and his realisation, whilst powerful in the twist department, felt a little too like Ghost to be effective. However, I cannot give The Sixth Sense less than an excellent review, because Osment's acting and Shyamalan's storytelling can earn four stars just between them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense (1999): Dir: M. Night Shyamalan / Cast: Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams, Donnie Wahlberg: Thrilling shocker about the inner talent of a boy who claims to see things that others cannot. Bruce Willis stars as a doctor who is shot by a patient in the film's opening. Haley Joel Osment plays a kid driven to paranoia with visions of dead people. His widowed mother is concerned and protective. Osment believes that Willis can help him but Willis lost faith after he lost communication with his wife. All of this weaves together into a shocking conclusion of truth and discovery. Directed by M. Night Shyamlan who details the plot with surprising developments while hinting the obvious. Great performance by Willis as a man trying to piece together both his home and professional life. Osment is brilliant with a power he cannot comprehend. Toni Collette plays his frustrated mother who struggles to understand her son's trauma while being made to face her own. Olivia Williams plays Willis's depressed wife who ceases to function or embrace reality. Donnie Wahlberg has a brief but pivotal role as a disturbed patient of Willis's. Great suspense shocker full of spine tingling visuals and a narrative full of ideas. It raises questions about unresolved circumstances that numb our understanding and all our senses.

		<fullReview>Sixth sense is a story about a famous child psychologist who is shot by his own former patient whom he failed to diagnose properly. He then becomes obsessed with the case of a small boy who exhibits similar symptoms. Although M. Night Shyamalan's career has seen a lot of ups and downs, The Sixth Sense is the film he will always be remembered for. A great supernatural thriller which never lets your attention lose while presenting this sensitively told tale of a small boy who is living in constant fear of the dead who seem to be stalking him. Although the famous twist in the tale has been the biggest point for discussion, it's amazing how well the story stands up even when you know that it's coming; you find yourself admiring the wonderful performances, particularly by Haley Joel Osment whom considering his age at that time was frankly astonishing. One of the best films of its type and an achievement for all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the film that boosted M. Night Shyamalan career in the movie making business. When this movie came out it was a direct hit and brought something new to the horror genre. It was creepy, thrilling, suspenseful and yet still had that heartfelt elements. What I liked about this movie is how it didn't really on gore or jump scares to get the audiences attention. But because it brought that clever detailed build up that a lot of the horror movies now a days are missing out on. As a matter of fact this is a film that the whole family can watch without really offending anyone...Much. But it's still a really good film. The two main leads were the perfect match for this film. Bruce Willis's role as Dr. Malcolm Crowe was perfect. As a matter of fact I heard that Dr. Malcolm Crowe actually wrote the role for Bruce Willis. And Haley Joel Osment was amazing as an actor when he was little. Overall this is a great horror filmmaking and was a clever idea when it came out.8.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good story and not very horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I were to sum up this movie in one word, it would be: unexpected. The twist at the end is by its very definition unexpected, though I'd read about the ending beforehand so it didn't really surprise me. However, the movie also unexpectedly well thought out, breaking from the precedent set by other horror movies, and is surprisingly un-scary. It really isn't a horror movie at all, but rather a drama with the horror elements as a bonus. It's kind of like the more intense and high-octane scenes in Interstellar, where they aren't what makes the movie great but are just kind of an added bonus. At it's core, the movie is about two people helping each other deal with a problem that no one else knows about and about redemption. I'm sure there are a lot of dead people in real life (is that a paradox?) who wish they had another shot to make things right.The story moves at a nice pace and presents the exposition and state of affairs at the beginning of the movie well. Everything that needs to be addressed is addressed, but in a plausible manner without unrealistic expositional dialogue. There are subplots with Cole having to tell his mom about his gift and Malcolm dealing with his strained relationship with his wife, and they weave nicely into the main plot line of Malcolm helping Cole find a solution to his being a ghost seer or whatever you want to call it. His ability is kind of like the inverse of The Lovely Bones, where a dead person helps the living and in this film a living person helps the dead. I've heard that the ghost seeing plot basis is a very old concept in cinema (which is probably what people will start saying about retired hit-man movies in a few years). Whether or not that's true, I still felt like the story here was strong enough that I don't care how recycled it is.The characters are the brightest spot of the movie. They may not be the most memorable, but they are very well written, scripted, and acted. Cole isn't very relatable given his plight, but he is easy to sympathize with and comes off as pretty convincing in his description of the ghosts that he encounters. He's realistically scripted. Not too cute like a clueless little kid, but not way too intelligent like kids are in a lot of kids movies. Malcolm clearly takes pride in his work and cares about his his patients, which makes him a likable protagonist. Besides that, he clearly wants to retain a positive relationship with his wife Anna, who doesn't have much screen time but is kind of important. Cole's mom does her best to raise him alone, but seems to be under a lot of stress the whole movie, though we never quite learn why. Anna is a fairly static character, but has a lot of personality and provides a bit of an Achilles heel for Malcolm.It's impressive it's execution, but not mind-blowing. There aren't any great special effects, but the directing, lighting, and shooting are great. The script and acting, again, are top notch in a very subtle and simple way.For perspective viewers, I'll just say that you're in for a good story, quality execution, and some good characters, but nothing scary, and nothing flashy. Watch it in one sitting if you can and make sure you're in a distraction free environment because there is a lot of quiet dialogue. There's a little gore, but nothing too disturbing unless you typically get skittish over blood. I'd recommend it to pretty much anyone and hope that they keep in mind that the Sixth Sense is not a horror movie. Overall Rating: 8.4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even thought this isn't the beginning of the month, but for the next month and a half I will be talking about all of M. Night Shyamalan's movies.All of them?..(shutters)But luckily I will be taking about his first and best movie, The Sixth Sense. This is one my all time favorite movies, and definitely my favorite ghost movies.One of my favorite aspects about this movie is the unsettling atmosphere it creates with some of these scenarios. A lot of scenes that could be boring are the exact opposite because of how much tension there is in almost every scene. It isn't really all that scary but the scenes that are scary, are more effective because of the tension produced.Another thing that was amazing about this movie, that was absent in Shyamalan's other movies, were the performances. The most notable performance of the movie being from Haley Joel Osment, who gives probably one of the best child performances ever. Child actors aren't really known for being very good, but this was an absolutely amazing performance. Bruce Willis is also very good in this as well, playing the child psychiatrist who tries to help the boy. But Haley Joel Osment is what make this movie legendary (in my opinion)And the final thing about this movie that is love is that you can almost always notice something different every time you watch it. It almost always a different experience when watch it again.So to end this off, I think The Sixth Sense is absolutely perfect suspense mystery and I feel it gets better every time I watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that still rates as one of the best "scary" films of the 90's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is creepy, scary, brilliant, dark, funny, sad, twisted but awesome. There aren't too many jump out of your seat scary moments but the overall tone of this movie was dark and kinda creepy. Bruce Willis is a psychologist that works with children. The opening scene is intense when a former patient has broken into his house and i thought it was a great way to start. Haley Joel Osment is a big reason why this movie is so good. He plays a kid, Cole, who has issues (the main one being he can see dead people). His friends, or classmates rather, call him a freak. Cole has never told anyone he can see dead people. The first person he tells is his new psychologist who he believes can help him.9/10 Even if you aren't a big Bruce Willis fan, this is a really interesting movie that never slows down. Although the twist ending was very well done by Shyamalan the tone, atmosphere, casting, and acting in this movie is what really makes this a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all time favorite films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I see dead people. Walking around like regular people. They don't see each other. They only see what they want to see. They don't know they're dead."When asked what my favorite films are, M. Night Shyamalan's psychological thriller The Sixth Sense tops the list for me every time. I know he hasn't been on a role lately, but that doesn't stop me from having high expectations for any of his upcoming projects because I was deeply influenced by this film. Even his following movies, Unbreakable and Signs, rank among my favorites, and I went as far as defending his work in The Happening (which is a guilty pleasure of mine). His latest films have disappointed me, but I still admire his storytelling and the way he builds suspense in his films (he's heavily influenced by another favorite director of mine: Alfred Hitchcock). I'm looking forward to the release of his new TV series, Wayward Pines, which seems like a return to form for this talented director. But I'm even more excited about his upcoming film, The Visit, which will be released in September. I was 18 when this film came out and I had just passed my final High School exam so I decided to treat myself to the movies that night to celebrate. Up to this point I was simply a casual viewer of movies and enjoyed pretty much everything I saw. I had no idea about film criticism, and when I got to the theater I decided on The Sixth Sense simply because it starred Bruce Willis. I didn't know anything else about the film and was surprised it wasn't another action vehicle from Willis. The film had a very slow and creepy opening, but I was sucked in by the story and the building atmosphere. I was enjoying the strong chemistry between Willis and Haley Joel Osment as the pair were trying to figure out what was causing these freaky visions. There were several surprisingly scary scenes that made me jump out of my seat a couple of times. The score was deeply effective as well. I was hooked from the very opening scene, but I was not at all prepared for the surprising and revealing twist at the end that left me completely blown away and speechless in the theater as the credits began rolling. I was in love with The Sixth Sense and from that moment on I have not stopped praising it. I can't believe all the signs that Shyamalan leaves behind for the audience while he is telling the story, and we still couldn't see the twist coming. He practically has Osment spell it out in his famous scene with Willis. It was a movie I had to rewatch simply because of that twist, and the second viewing allowed me to appreciate the film even more by catching up on all the symbolisms and clues that the director left behind. In my opinion it is the best twist ever because you never feel cheated by it. I credit this movie for getting me interested in film as an art form, although the transition didn't happen from one moment to the next. The performances from Willis, Olivia Williams, and Toni Collette are all great, but Osment stood out, and it remains one of the best child performances I've seen from a Hollywood film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I knew that The Sixth Sense was very popular, I tried to find a reason why it was one the AFI list of Best Thrillers. It was on Netflix. I watched it and boy was it scary! The Sixth Sense is one of the best films I have recently seen all summer. I like this movie because it goes into a realistic tale of human elements and the supernatural field to it. But it goes into the psychological and in-debt look into the story while still trying to be a horror film. I love it. Bruce Willis is amazing in this role. I thought he looked good in Die Hard, but man never has he been good in this movie when playing a three-dimensional character in a humane horror film. Haley Joel Osment is great. I really like him in this role, even in other roles when he is child. The story of this movie amazes me to see how M.Night can write and direct a good film with the proper techniques. But overall I adored this film. I would recommend this to every person who wants to make good movie or maybe even a horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sixth Sense (9/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The older and more experienced I get in life, the more I seem to appreciate The Sixth Sense. M. Night Shyamalan took his time writing and directing this tremendous work of film. I find it cornball when people proclaim movies as art that are all about themes and expressionism, but I'm starting to understand that feeling after my most recent Sixth Sense view. Every time I watch the movie there seems to be something new I pick up that I didn't previously notice. The story is so solid, there isn't one crack in it. To go along with such a fresh screenplay was an amazing cast that headlined Bruce Willis, which I don't think it's crazy to say that this is his best work. The Sixth Sense is more of a drama than a horror film but when the ghost scenes occurred they were terrifying and unforgiving to the viewer. On a lighter note too, it was nice to see the family dog make it through a scary flick for once. Definitely check out The Sixth Sense (9/10) because it is still worthy of a watch even if you know the twist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is clever in more ways than one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is one of those movies that each time you watch it, you can pick up something new. M. Night Shyamalan and his crew created a world and characters that were easy to believe in as well as engage in. There may have been one or two scenes that were necessary, but the movie never felt like it was dragging on. It also doesn't rely on just scaring the viewer, but draws out all sorts of emotions.The biggest thing about this film is its cleverness. Everyone mentions the twist at the end, but I argue that this film was good without it. The film is complex enough to keep interest. Yes, the twist is what this movie if really known for, but I think that it sometimes over-shadows the story of a young boy who sees dead people. All of the parts of the film work really well together and I never felt there was something that was out of place.The cinematography is not ground breaking, but it creates lots of contrast that definitely adds to the story. I thought the music was a great fit as it was not too overpowering at emotional moments, but was able to create suspense when needed. Haley Joel Osment's acting is fantastic. He looked as professional as the great adult actors. Although Bruce Willis acts this part very well, I may have gone with a different actor because of his reputation as hard edged characters. As I said before, it is as rewarding if not more rewarding to watch it more than once. It has many little ins and outs that make this film more complex than most. Overall, this film is very entertaining to watch and I think has more to say than what is on the surface.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic chiller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr Malcolm Crowe is a happily married, successful child psychologist, of course he isn't entirely successful and one of those children he couldn't help changes his life for ever when he breaks into Dr Crowe's house and shoots him before committing suicide. Some time later Dr Crowe has another young patient; a troubled boy named Cole; a boy with a secret. Cole reminds Crowe of the patient he failed; this time he is determined to succeed. At first he doesn't know what is troubling Cole; he suspects abuse but he has a loving mother and there are no other obvious suspects and there is definitely something strange about the boy; he knows things he should not know? mostly things involving people who died in unpleasant circumstances. That is Cole's secret; he sees dead people! Will Dr Crowe or anybody else be able to help him cope with his situation?I doubt many people have managed to avoid this films main twist however just in case somebody has I won't spoil it here. The story is well told with details being drip fed to the viewer rather than everything being explained at once; indeed the 'I see dead people' revelation doesn't come until the film has almost reached the half way point. Bruce Willis is on top form as Dr Crowe but it is young Haley Joel Osment who dominates the film as Cole; a character who is gentle, somewhat troubled and at times more than a little creepy. The support cast, which includes Toni Collette as Cole's mother and Olivia Williams, who plays Dr Crowe's wife put in solid performances in their smaller roles. While this isn't a horror film there are some chilling moments but none too disturbing. Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan did a great job in what is probably still his best film? it is certainly the best of the ones I've seen. Overall I'd definitely recommend this; even if you've seen it before or know the twist it is worth watching as there new things to be spotted when you know certain facts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sixth is a modern masterpiece that contains perhaps one of the greatest twist endings in cinematic history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A boy who communicates with spirits that don't know they're dead seeks the help of a disheartened child psychologist. Malcom Crowe is a child psychologist who receives an award on the same night that he is visited by a very unhappy ex-patient. After this encounter, Crowe takes on the task of curing a young boy with the same ills as the ex-patient. This boy "sees dead people". Crowe spends a lot of time with the boy (Cole) much to the dismay of his wife. Cole's mom is at her wit's end with what to do about her son's increasing problems. Crowe is the boy's only hope. Roger Ebert wrote "I have to admit I was blind-sided by the ending. The solution to many of the film's puzzlements is right there in plain view, and the movie hasn't cheated, but the very boldness of the storytelling carried me right past the crucial hints and right through to the end of the film, where everything takes on an intriguing new dimension. The film was written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, whose previous film, "Wide Awake," was also about a little boy with a supernatural touch; he mourned his dead grandfather, and demanded an explanation from God. I didn't think that one worked. "The Sixth Sense" has a kind of calm, sneaky self-confidence that allows it to take us down a strange path, intriguingly." The Sixth is a modern masterpiece that contains perhaps one of the greatest twist endings in cinematic history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my recollection of seeing this movie, and I saw it twice.My girlfriend had decided to study in Spain for Spring Semester 2000, and I didn't like that at all! We decided, however, to go see The Sixth Sense in January, shortly before her leave. It fascinated me by its fresh approach to horror, quite different from the stuff I'd seen before.Unfortunately, the strain of not being together for half a year, save for my visiting her for a month, resulted in breaking up.In July I decided to try various devices in order to cure my heart, and one of them was going to the pictures alone to see The Sixth Sense again that was still running. I thought I'd be scared happy, or something...To my chagrin, the scary scenes didn't scare me at all, as I could anticipate them. On the other hand, I realized that underneath the horror layer was a layer of sadness, of loosing someone dear to you etc. (Remember the scene where Willis tries to grasp the check, and his wife snaps it up and says: "Happy Anniversary!") This, and all the typical couples in love who surrounded me in the dark of the theater, forced me to make a holy wow never to go to cinema once more without female company!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly made and acted with a thriller element.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this before when I was younger and could still remember some of the scenes that had ingrained itself in my brain. My memory of this film was that it was horrifying, but after watching it again, it wasn't as scary as I'd remembered. But M. Night Shyamalan definitely did a good job in keeping the thriller feel of the movie throughout.This film is just so brilliantly made and considering that it was made before the turn of the century, the visual effects were pretty good too. Every scene is so carefully executed with utmost precision that I had actually forgotten the crucial element of the story when I was watching this.The acting is also magnificent. I had just watched Pulp Fiction prior to watching this (and I'm sorry but I do not get what Pulp Fiction is about and probably won't even review it) that I was somewhat taken aback at the change in Willis' character. Willis really got into his character here and you can really see the drastic difference between the characters he usually plays. Haley Joel Osment, is just my favourite child actor ever. The other movie he was in; Pay It Forward, is another favourite of mine and I don't know how the learned to act when he was so young but his face just makes the audience empathize with him. Toni Collette who plays Cole's mother is also a vivid character in this. She plays the conflict of loving her child and at the same time being frightened of him, perfectly. Her expressions were very readable.The music in this?I don't think I noticed all that much. But what made this film all the more scary and which horror films have become experts at, are the sound effects. Whenever something is about to happen, the sound build-up matches the rising tension and then the brief sound explosions further enforces the impact when something appears. I think I probably got more frightened by the sound effects than the visual input itself.Overall, this film is a masterpiece, however the ending was a bit abrupt for me. I did not fully understand what the closure was.Read more movie reviews at: championagels.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good movie. Among the 2-3 better movies that Shyamalan directed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bruce Willis is Dr Malcolm Crowe, a decorated psychologist and happily married man living and practicing in Philadelphia. Suddenly one night an armed intruder enters his house and shoots him in front of his wife. Crowe appears to be badly injured but lucid enough to realise that the shooter (a young adult man) used to be his patient years ago when he was a child.The scene terminates and we see again Crowe a few months (or a year) later providing counseling to an 8 year-old boy (Cole Sear) who lives with his mother. The movie is centered on the interaction between the psychologist and the child. Crowe also is shown to speak to his wife throughout the film but she appears oddly aloof, something that suggests marital problems or at least some detachment of the couple.Anyway, Crowe tries to help the troubled kid, and to understand the cause of his problems and heal them. Curiously most of their meetings do not take place at the doctor's office; it is obvious that Crowe makes larger than usual effort to help the youngster and visits him also at home and at school. Soon we start to wonder about the source of the kid's anxiety and fears and how these are related to Willis' character. The movie answers these questions.My rating is 9/10 for this movie. One among the 2-3 better movies by Night Shyamalan. But not the best. In fact the 'Sixth Sense' reminded me of another Shyamalan movie 'The Unbreakable' which I think is the best movie that Shyamalan ever directed. Bruce Willis has again the central role. The 'Unbreakable' and the 'Sixth Sense' have some things in common. First, the place is the same. Both movies take place in Philadelphia, which is a Greek name (of the old Byzantine city of Asia Minor) and literally means the City of Brotherly Love. I believe that Willis character (in both movies) tries to do just that: to help his fellow human being inside the community. Secondly, the theme in both movies has similarities: in both movies the central hero is haunted by some event from his past. This event drives his actions and in both movies it is revealed to us at the end.</fullReview>

Leaving us with small hidden details and using symbolism to reveal certain information throughout the story, only later to find out the very well constructed plot. Completely unique and very original in it's creation. There has been yet another movie as skillfully planned out. Bruce Willis playing the role of Malcolm and Haley Osment playing the role of Cole, the character choices couldn't have been more appropriate. Thoroughly enjoyed this movie which left me hanging at the edge of my seat the entire time. I loved how this story circled around from beginning to end. Simply revealing little details and information one at a time and if you were lucky, you were able to catch on to the idea of Malcolm's true interactions with Cole and the reasoning behind them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know weather it is the fact that maybe I was just having an off day or I'm just slow but it is amazing how I managed to sit through this film and the fact Bruce Willis is a ghost all along never even crossed my mind I mean we never see him change clothes, no one ever addresses him how did I not notice any of this? The film is good the ending really was the best bit it just made me really cry what he says to his girl and when he realises it and accepts it just very cute. Also the film was abit scary many parts in it did manage to give me the chills and made me look behind my shoulder a couple of times it is very intelligent in the fact that I'm sure many people along with myself also didn't click onto the ending. I'm glad I watched this film it has been out for a while and I felt I was missing out when I heard people saying 'I see dead people'. That quote is clearly associated with the film and I wanted to know what it meant so I watched it. Definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

In Japanese edition, Dr. Malcolm Crowe says "There is a secret in this movie." at the beginning. Just like that, there is the big surprise in this film. Before I watch this, I think it is horror movie, but it is sad and little oppressive. Dr. Malcolm doesn't death himself, but Cole knows everything. They become friends, and Cole becomes open, but at the ending, they say good-bye. Dr. Malcolm never talk his wife. This film is sad story. The Sixth Sense is my recommendation.

		<shortDescription>Doesn't feel like the genre its in, yet works either way,...mostly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Die Hard (1988) had permanently made actor Bruce Willis a go to action star, he could couldn't get himself out of it. He did manage to snag a few roles that were out of the action genre but none of them really stuck. At least, not until he decided to take part in this little project. There's also something to say about this films director, M. Night Shyamalan. It may not be his first directorial or writing job, but he certainly shows the kind of potential he had from the beginning. Of course, for many viewers now a days he's missing his mark to the point of no return. However, that is a discussion for another time. Ghost stories are not a new thing; they've been told several different ways. However, something about this particular story does make it quite different from the rest.Psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), is given a case where a child, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) is considered an outcast among his single mother and classmates for being strange for his own reasons. Along with this is Crowe's own subplot dealing with him trying to reconnect with his distant wife. Among the rest of the cast are other good actors which all pitch solid performances. Not one actor here gives a performance that isn't believable. In fact, for a horror film, it had several significant emotional moments along the way that helped define the its characters and gave them depth. Of these actors, Bruce Willis gave his most realistic showing that is not seen all too often. Frequently, Willis is playing sharp, hot-headed, wise-cracking characters. Here, he's the exact opposite - cautious, soft spoken and well-mannered. It's a nice change in character.And of course with this inventive writing comes the respective errors. One big error is the continuity. The laws of how ghosts work are not kept clear to what their limitations are. An example of this would be how ghosts can touch certain physical objects and not others. Certain rules like these are difficult to follow, especially when it comes to certain plot points. When it came to the horror elements of this movie, it was effective in some areas, while others not so much. What did look well done were the practical effects. This helped create some disturbing images. Unfortunately, what didn't assist in making these images even creepier was the lighting and camera work. Tak Fujimoto, the cinematographer for Silence of the Lambs (1991) also worked for this project and his selection of lighting doesn't assist any of the jump scare moments in any fashion. If the whole scare shot is in total bright light from beginning to end, how is that going to be scary?Musically related, James Newton Howard's score did its job accordingly. For the horror elements there were screeching strings and sudden percussion for the scares. This is typical but also doable. For the scenes with the more creep out factor, Howard used piano frequently that only relied on a number of keys to give that uneasy tone. Piano was also used for the more emotional scenes and they were probably the most effective due to the execution and writing behind the composition. It certainly did not have a memorable theme but its overall listening experience can be done solo without watching the movie. It is a decent movie with some apparent problems, but it still entertains.Continuity flaws and authentic scares are not its strong points, but its creepy imagery, music and realistic practical effects help recover that loss. Along with that is Bruce Willis' most likable human performance to date with an interesting story and other believable showings from other actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PG-13 horror. Oh wait a minute this is more like a thriller. It was not really scary at all. Why is it considered horror? Barely anything to consider it horror. Only thing going for it is the actors. The rest is not that good. If you watch this for scares, then you have to be young.There is no way this could bother a true horror fan. Yes, true horror fan watches anything rated R or Unrated. So yes, gore is the way to true horror happiness. No I don't do the things I watch on the big screen. Its just better to watch something interesting, than to watch something you will fall asleep in.Luckily this has Bruce Willis in it to keep you interesting, but if he wasn't in it, then I probably say it was really bad, and only give it a 1 on the vote. 5 is for Bruce Willis. I only like it, because I was not the one who chose to rent it.</fullReview>

I said yes he was...By the end of the movie the twist that he was dead was made. My wife asked me, how I knew. I told her he never interacted with anyone but the kid, even when there were other people in the room. Why did he keep wearing the same clothes every time he was with the kid? and I don't remember him ever touching anything or anyone.

		<fullReview>I have to admit, when I saw this film the first time, I never saw the twist coming. I'm thinking now I should have, like I should have been paying closer attention to the principals and their relationship to each other, but somehow they sneaked one past me. This film and "Unbreakable" made me a Shyamalan fan for a time, but then he went ahead and squandered it with "The Village" and "Lady in the Water", but that's another story.Movie fans tuning in expecting to see a down and out horror flick here might come away disappointed. It's got some scary stuff to be sure, but I don't think that was the point. What the director was going for here was a treatment of the life after death theme, and the concept of lost souls hanging around until their mission in life has been accomplished. Watching the picture a second time, the clues become obvious, as when Dr. Crowe (Bruce Willis) responds to young Cole's (Haley Joel Osmont) question whether he was a good doctor - "Well, I used to be". 'Used' to be! Willis' character telegraphs the punch line for the viewer without making it overtly obvious, and that's the brilliance of the film.I think this kid Osmont has a wonderful career ahead of him if he doesn't get sucked into the Britney Spears/Lindsay Lohan school of dysfunctional celebrity. Though he looked younger here than his actual age (11), I thought he did a superb job, especially during the heart wrenching admission when he confesses his ability to see 'dead people'. It was at that point that believers in the hereafter got on board with the theme of the film, that there's a life after death and that there are things that can't be rationally explained once a spirit passes on. Dr. Crowe realizes that it's time for him to move on once he's helped Cole get beyond his grief over a father that's abandoned him. In Cole Sear's case, it meant dealing with the visions of spirits who departed in conflicted circumstances instead of peacefully passing on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid if underwhelming work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is a solid supernatural melodrama, whose reputation as something far better may leave new viewers underwhelmed and pondering its accolades. Known as the film that made M. Night Shyamalan a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood (a reason to be annoyed with it right there), the film is well written but follows a relatively unsurprising path up until its "shocking" twist climax which apparently had rather dull-witted viewers who had never before seen a film inventing superlatives to describe it. The story focuses on a young boy (Haley Joel Osment) with the ability to "see dead people" as the film's notorious tagline informs us and the relationship that develops between his stoic psychologist Bruce Willis and himself. There are a number of things to like about the film. It is atmospheric, solidly constructed and features a truly amazing central turn by young Osment, who is both believable and sympathetic as the beleaguered young boy. Toni Collette is also memorable as the boy's concerned mother. There are a few jolts here and there, but the film somehow never manages to be truly terrifying - largely because sharp-eyed viewers will intuit early on that the specters mean the boy no harm. On the downside, the film would be benefited from a better leading man. Even fans of Willis must admit that his cinema acting can be divided into two classes: smarmy or lifeless. The more serious the drama, the more lifeless Willis becomes. His chemistry with Osment is often as chilly as the temperature drop that precedes a ghost. In fact, the very tenor of his performance helps give away the much heralded surprise climax. One cannot discuss this film without touching on the climax - which is really the aspect that pushed this film over-the-top, but it is hard to explain why since many viewers will figure it out within the first 20 minutes and will not be the least blown away by the final revelation. The fact that the revelation really has no bearing on the plot itself or the personal outcome of the young boy's future is bad enough, but even worse is the fact that Willis' detached demeanor robs it of much in the way of emotional punch either. A good, but not a great film from a director known more now for his missteps than his classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't have any preconceptions about this film when I watched it for the first time because I wasn't aware of anything about it at all which is remarkable in itself considering I watched it about seven years after it was released. I liked this film because it was innovative and not really that shocking but it worked for me on all sorts of levels because it was clear to me that a lot of care was taken in its production. All of those involved deserve congratulations on a job well done. The storyline was relatively easy to follow but like a lot of other people I wandered willingly up the wrong path and was pleasantly surprised by the revelation when it came. The film is about as good as the parts that make it up which means that I would give this film 9.5 out of ten but since I cannot do this I will give it a 9. When I watched it for the second time I took particular note of all of the interactions and it was then that I saw how good the film is. The central characters are strong apart from Bruce Willis who in my humble opinion didn't quite step up to the mark. I do not know enough about acting but I do know that there was something about Willis which didn't quite set well within the film. It wasn't a major flaw but the 'feel' was not always spot on. Maybe I am being overcritical here but it was my feeling. That aside it is a remarkable piece of work and I would recommend anyone watch it and fortunately it is good enough to be watched repeatedly</fullReview>

I have to say I enjoyed watching it, but I find it rather overrated. The thing that strikes me the most is Toni Collette's great acting as a troubled mother. She portrays her stress and distress well. For the plot itself, maybe it's because I already knew the ending when I watched it, I did pick up on the clues related to the ending twist.

		<fullReview>This is one trick film in the final analysis but survives as a result of the strong yarn-spinning interest of M Night Shyamalan and a superb central performance from Haley Joel Osment. Bruce Willis' natural brow-beaten mien is also a gift; there seems to be meaning in incidents which again only acquire their substance after the final twist. Willis' langour also allows the drifting narrative to find a good pace whilst Osment rushes around trying to escape his paranormal paranoia.Olivia Williams and Toni Collette are also very conscious of the process of making this elusive film and give well-calibrated, if discreet performances. Syamalan was rightly lauded on his success - despite the exponential depreciation rate of this formula in subsequent viewings (i.e. if you know what's going on the surprise vanishes) the film stands up well. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In other words, an M. Night Shyamalan film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was preparing to sing the praises of this film like I hadn't done for any film in such a long time. The first 95 minutes formed one of the most hauntingly beautiful (or beautifully haunting?) horror stories I've ever seen. Osment's performance completely blew me away, and Willis didn't stop short of earning his paycheck either. Willis' performance as a troubled psychiatrist struggling to understand and help save this fear-wracked boy was a pleasant reminder of the man's true, unsung versatility.And then the ending happened, and forgive me for somewhat glossing over the film's good points, but just thinking about how thoroughly wasted all this greatness was just has the effect of getting me angry all over again.First, I should make it clear that, having heard the "I see dead people" line, I knew mostly what the film was about (though perhaps this would only have delayed how obvious the "twist" became). So from the end of the first scene onward, I was simply proceeding, as I assumed I was meant to, with the knowledge that Dr. Crowe was dead. I kept waiting for the emotional "reveal" scene that would provide the impetus for the film's final act, but I never imagined that that scene would be the *ending*. I thought we would find out that (for instance) Crowe survived the shooting at the beginning, only to somehow have Cole (or Cole's absent father) cause his death later. I also want to know more about Cole. Does he ever stop seeing the ghosts? Does he grow up and get his own TV show? Does he eventually snap anyway and go on Vincent's homicidal rampage?But no. Shyamalan was too busy being flashy and trying to get talked about to wrap up his beautiful story in any meaningful way. Is this what we have become as a society? Are movies really getting this dumbed down, so that we're at a point where we won't trust anything a director doesn't smash over our head? Fine, fine, I'll get back in my seat; this was nine years ago, after all. Nobody knew that M. Night was an arrogant hack. Now that we do, I think it's high time we got over this film, and just allow M. Night's career to begin its inevitable petering out.For a film to be bad is one thing. This film is not that. For a film to make you feel angry and used, to the point that you wonder why you even bother watching movies anymore, is quite another. Then again, I suppose that's what I get for taking an M. Night Syamalan film seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>convoluted and dragged out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to confess I didn't figure the plot out in the first 10 minutes.But that's because I was so BORED I didn't waste neurons trying to figure it out. This film has no alternative to being boring because the screenplay has to carefully keep Bruce Willis from engaging in conversation with any other adult for nearly two screen hours! This give it an oddly staid funeral parlor cache between the gripping beginning and end sequences. That said, it is artistically done, well-edited, and well-acted, despite being so drawn out.I agree with other reviewers that it would have been perfect for a 30-minute Twilight Zone episode, or longer treatment at the hand of Alfred Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary, but overall a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the scariest movie I've ever seen (and trust me, I am not a scary-movie person.) Well, at first I saw the edited TV version, which was creepy, but not scary. Then one day my friend came over and we wanted to watch something creepy, so we decided "Sixth Sense". Oh my gosh, I was so scared! We couldn't go to sleep for that night, and sometimes I will still have nightmares.Anyways, it was a good movie. It kept you on the edge of your seat and was pretty interesting too. I liked it. The story is about a man, Dr. Malcome Crowe, who wants to take control of his life. His wife isn't talking to him anymore (even though they live together) and he isn't doing to great with his job anymore (he's a child therapist.) Until one day he meets Cole, a little boy who has a huge problem: he sees dead people. So Dr. Malcome Crowe has to try to help the little boy.If you're a big scary-movie person, you should watch it. If not, watch the TV-edited version (and in the day). It'll keep you on the edge of your seat and it'll keep your heart beating fast!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Usual Supects" syndrome strikes back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(r#92)I will start out by saying that at no point did I not enjoy this ghost story from M. Night Shyalaman, who gets everything right in "Sense" that he got wrong in "Village". It is a very solid thriller, very original in terms of plot, slow-paced but never boring, and it has at least one scene which really freaked me out. The acting is brilliant, Bruce Willis is Bruce as usual, his raspy voice perfect for his troubled character, even though some will find it hard to buy John McClane as a child psychiatrist. Haley Joel Osment continues to prove why he's one of the best child actors working today, putting wide-eyed Dakota Fanning and that mugging kid from "The Omen 666" (or whatever it's called) to shame. His performance is great, neither over-the-top nor underacted, and unlike most of his kind, he's not annoying, thank god. Toni Colette is also very good as the depressed mother, although she was even better in "About a Boy" as a deranged hippie. So overall, an intriguing and often tense film and probably one of the best of a very strong movie year.But is it really that good? Is it one of the 250 best movies ever made? I enjoyed it so much I'm willing to agree. Although, if you-know-who wasn't you-know-what, there is no way that this flick would be in the top 150. It seems that according to IMDb's questionable rating system, every movie with an ending you can't see coming deserves a 10. Case in point: This movie in the top 250, The Usual Suspects, of all movies, in the top 20, the trashy exploitation flick Saw with a score of 7.6, already being hailed as a masterpiece.Is a twist ending all the average movie buff craves? Well, 'Manos' the Hands of Fate has a twist ending, I don't see that one on the top 250. Think before you vote, people. Not every movie that goes out with a bang is brilliant. For anyone who has been unlucky enough to discover who *thatdude* really is, The Sixth Sense will be a disappointment. For me, it definitely was. But it's such an enjoyable disappointment I'm willing to give this an 8/10.PS. What the hell happened, Schyalaman? You went from memorability to mediocrity so fast. You could've really been one of the all time greats, but you screwed it up. Well, at least you provided David Zucker with material with your borefest "The Village".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I so far dislike M. Night Shyamalan's works after seeing "Signs" and "Village".I finally saw more of Sixth Sense, more like Six Cents in someone's pocket.About Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a child physiologist portrayed by Bruce Willis who meets with Cole Sear, a kid in Philladelpha who is mentally challenged, and living with a single mother.Cole can also see the dead, in other words he can see ghosts walk around like regular people. And the dead sometimes don't know they're dead at all. This frightens him a lot, and makes his mother worry. And thinks he need serious help. While Dr. Crowe does all he can to help Cole out with his unexplainable power.I can't say I enjoyed it at all, I didn't expected it to be great or anything, since I hated the way Signs and Village were. I'm just saying that Sixth Sense is a movie that doesn't seem well done. it needed some more plot wholes to explain the stuff they didn't even bother to explain. Least it wasn't as confusing as that "Village" movie which had so many flaws in it.Bruce Willis was the only actor I know in the entire movie, he was alright in this one, but he's done way better roles in other better films than this one.That and Cole is nothing compared to Danny from "Shining" or the "Omen" kid. In other words I give this film a 5 out of 10. I'll see about checking out the rest of M. Night Shyamalan, for my full opinion on the Indian Director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was creepy and not as bad as some I have seen, but still it was far from what I call a "good" horror movie. It was basically just about a boy who sees dead people, and the twist at the end was rather confusing.The actors are all a bit depressing, and maybe the movie is supposed to be like that or something, but M. Night Shyamalan has made much better movies than this, and I think the ghost scenes were all a little too exaggerated.This movie would have worked a lot better if it was a psychological thriller, not with supernatural events, like it could have turned out that Cole's condition might have had something to do with his mind, like he thinks that he is seeing dead people, or something like that, something similar to what Gothika is based on.This movie is OK to watch, and can get a little scary in places, but I still think it could have been a lot better without all these supernatural events actually being for real, it would have helped me to enjoy it a lot more, and the ending could have been a much better one, for example Malcolm helps Cole but realises that he's not actually dead and then gets reconciled with his wife or something. (I know this sounds confusing, but bear with me because I'm not a very good critic!). Anyway,I would like it if he talked with his wife at the end and then got reconciled with her, and it ended out that he's not dead. I would have liked that much better.OK - 4/10 stars but I've seen much better</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sixth Sense isn't just scary: It's an un-predictable and smart drama that will surprise you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Famous horror-movie director, M. Night Shylaman made his career (Or made his name known amongst fans) with "The Sixth Sense." Child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe has just received an award, praising his abilities and skills in the psychological department. However, the joy is soon halted when a naked man (Well, he does have underwear.) breaks into the Crowe residence. This man claims to be a former patient of Malcolm's, and knows the roots of primitive human fear. This scene is very touching- or, shall I say: powerful? The reason for the power in this scene is because it makes us connect with the insane person inside all of us; the person who feels ashamed or angry; the guy in this scene (Vincent) is the crazy person within us.After that scene, Dr. Crowe feels ashamed and guilty about what he brought onto the patient. So, he tries to redeem himself when another patient visits him: a young boy named Cole.At this point, the film seems to be more or less dramatic and thrilling than the beginning. We learn about Cole, who doesn't seem to be the most normal child around. He's bullied by kids at school. He has scratches all over him. His mom doesn't trust him. Plus, he has one big secret? and one very famous line: "I see dead people." We learn about Cole, and start to wonder about him before we sympathize for him. When his relationship with Dr. Crowe becomes tight, the film begins to become more and more dramatic and thrilling.To paraphrase another IMDb user, The Sixth Sense doesn't just give us scary stuff, but it shows what fear is. It makes the characters think about fear. Just listen to Vincent's speech at the beginning.I'm not sure if this is totally true, but I can tell you what is true: The Sixth Sense takes oh so many twists in the story. It seems un-predictable. I have frustration trying to guess the ending, because I didn't even know if Cole was seeing things or not. If he was, what was going to happen next? Of course, the biggest twist is at the end. It's probably the most famous thing in the movie. I mean, it isn't like one of those movies where they say "He was the murderer!" The film hides the twist, but it introduced it to us at the beginning! The film doesn't hide the possibility of it; it just doesn't expect the audience to guess it. I guess it's hard to explain without adding spoilers, so I will just say: See the film.But, don't see the film purely for the ending. See it for the acting, the suspense, the story and the pure quality of the film. See it because it's a good movie.I shall end with that.9/10 Good: Very suspenseful and dramatic with good acting. It's also close to un-predictable for me.Bad: I can't think of anything for now. It seemed kind of slow moving.Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sixth Sense - I see dead people......I also see high Box Office!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember in 1999 after the movie was ended, all the audiences were all stunned and remained sitting on their seats... This excellent masterpiece is directed and written by the genius Indian director M. Night Shyamalan. He brings the traditional Indian concepts of human's life and death to the Western country via his movie. Then it becomes a fresh idea for the Westerners. The story is quite scary on the first part of the film. However, it also contains emotion between parent and child. It is really touching. When the BIG surprising ending comes in, all the questions in this movie have been solved, and the whole story becomes very touching (Dr. Malcolm Crowe to his wife) Overall, this story (screenplay) is such a clever one which I haven't seen for years. this movie is not only to scary people, it also makes people believe in their faith. In addition, the soundtrack composed by James Newton Howard is great. it can create the mysterious atmosphere and terror for the film. Even though Bruce Willis is not that good in acting in this movie, the way he acts is still far greater than he did before. Most people may notice the supporting role Haley Joel Osment. He seems to be a natural born actor. I love his performance in the sixth sense (including his later movie A.I.) I think one day he can get what he deserves for academy awards. By and large, a clever story + a good director + good acting = extremely great box office and good reputation = The Sixth Sense</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It just played on ABC, (I managed to stay awake through 73 minutes of ads!), and was surprised that there are some parts of the dialog throughout the movie that are worth hearing a second time around because they make more sense. I also heard stuff I must not have paid enough attention to the first time maybe because I didn't have to try to analyze anything.For example, the first time I watched it, I didn't really connect the two 'halves' of a 'particular' exchange between Malcom and his mother at the end and found out in the second viewing that they go together like book ends. The first time I may have been scrambling to recall what else I already knew from earlier in the movie about the 'subject' of the first part of their conversation and missed that the basis of second part is a direct result of the first part not an added amplification of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hehe, it's only a joke, but really, this is the kinda of Horror movie I like. At the beginning I couldn't understand very well what my mom told me about this movie, so I went to see it (6 long years ago), and well, let's say that I went home wishing not to have one of those senses, 'cause I couldn't live knowing that my friends, people I know, some familiars, the guy full of blood that its at my side right now, or other people were dead.Not quite sure what was the most scary part of the movie, when the dead guys appear or when the profess becomes mad and almost breaks the table with one hit. Of course, in many scenes we saw many dead guys, and when they appeared I almost become one of them.This is the kind of movies someone wants to see in the theaters, not movies made by 19000 dollars (wished I had all that money in my pocket), or made by a hand-camera that only can hold for thirty seconds, or that appear bad actors, or that the story sucks.VERY RECOMMENDABLE: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>actually 3 different movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sixth Sense" is a creepy, atmospheric puzzler about a child psychologist who is trying to help a depressed little boy come to grips with the fact that he sees ghosts. There's more than meets the eye, as everybody knows by now, and the first time you see it, if you don't know the surprise, it's an excellent movie.Like I said, everybody knows the secret by now, it's like the sled in "Citizen Kane" or the penis in "The Crying Game", so it doesn't even feel necessary to warn that there's a spoiler herein. Bruce Willis is dead! Now, if you were one of the people who found this out before seeing the movie, I bet it ruined it a little for you. And this is the problem with this movie; knowing the surprise spoils it a little bit, and since the surprise is nothing more than a gimmick (albeit a well-done gimmick), I think this movie relies a little bit too much on the gimmick to be considered a great movie.I didn't know the first time I saw it, by the way, and I was blown away. In 1999, it was one of the best movies of 1999. Make no mistake. It wasn't until it was released on DVD that things started to go downhill.Let me explain. I said at the top that this is actually 3 different movies, and it is; it's like a chameleon.1)You're seeing it for the first time, and you don't know how it comes out. Excellent. The surprise is terrific; I figured it out, but not until about 5 minutes before it was revealed anyway, and I know there are definitely people who didn't figure it out, even though they were trying to figure out something. The first time, you really appreciate the performances by Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Ozment, and Toni Collette. They all do outstanding jobs, and this is the one aspect of the movie that really does hold up over time. 10/10.2) You're seeing it for the second time. You know that Bruce Willis is dead, and you appreciate the work that went into concealing this fact, paying attention for some little slip-up and not finding it. But really, let's be honest; on the second viewing, and probably to an extent on any subsequent viewings, you're giving your full attention to the execution of the gimmick. And it's still good, there's a lot to appreciate here. 9/10.3) You're seeing it for the third time, and any time after that. You know that Bruce Willis is dead, and you know how artistically this was hidden throughout. So what's left? Well, the fine performances, and the creepy atmospherics, and the entertaining story. So let's not penalize the movie too much at this point, but over time, the quality definitely does wear down, because to some extent, you're still constantly thinking about that gimmick. 7/10, the rating I gave above.And really, there's a fourth aspect to all this; you're seeing it for the first time, and some dip**** spoiled it for you. Well, you may actually be in a pretty good position. You know Bruce Willis is dead, so on the one hand, you're not pulled in so much by the gimmick, and you can appreciate the other aspects that made this movie good; on the other hand, the surprise is lost on you. You see, it's a completely different movie if you knew the gimmick the first time, and you will never see it the same way as others did. That's a shame, but at least you weren't trying all along to "figure it out", and thus, the performances by Willis, Osment, and Collette may seem all the brighter. I can't comment on how viewers would have rated the movie in this position, because I wasn't one of them. But I think they would have liked it.So there you have it. AT LEAST 3 different movies, and at least 3 different ratings. I do give it points for being able to change so much on repeated viewings, but I have to take away some, because the power the movie has over you is influenced so much by that gimmick. It's not that it has become a bad movie over the years, but it has lost its status as a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Ground-Breaking and enduring film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan intelligently wrote the script for this film and brilliantly directed it. He carefully made the film which causes many audiences to misinterpret the storyline before being surprised by the plot-twist ending. It is not just the shocking ending that made the film. It is the solid character study and good social commentary that makes the film a timeless cinematic gem. After repeated viewings, the surprise is long gone, but it still manage to move me.Some complain that this film is not scary. I admit that the scare factor is minimal, and there is not much suspense. However, though marketed as a horror-thriller, it is not really meant to be scary. In fact, I feel that the chills are just a bonus. The key genre of this film is drama-mystery. A story which deals with the agony of a child psychologist (well played by Bruce Willis) over his marriage, a career failure, and a difficult patient which reminds him of his failure. A story of how a boy (Haley Joel Osment) having to survive emotional and physical torture, and coping with his worried single mother's (Toni Collette) suspicion over his well-being and abnormalities.After my careful observation, certain scenes are not just meant to trick audiences or drop hints for the now famous ending. Each of them mean something. However, I am not going to analyze how I interpret them to avoid spoilers. I will just say that this film deserves multiple viewings. Not just to fully comprehend it, but also to appreciate the powerful performances by Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.Their Oscar nominations are well-deserved. Osment portrays the emotion of Cole Sear to perfection. Not only does he bring life into his role, he also effectively controls the atmosphere of the film. It is no wonder that this film earns him international recognitions. Toni Collette, in a relatively small role, plays Lynn Sear with complexity. Her screen time is limited, but her portrayal of the character speaks a lot. The rest of the cast are also good. Bruce Willis is humorous and has great chemistry with Osment. Olivia Williams convincingly double-play her role which is very crucial to the plot twist. Greg Wood is also subtle as a father who lost his daughter.All in all, an influential masterpiece which, I strongly believe, inspired the well-crafted but inferior "The Others", and many other pretentious films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only regret for me is that the movie recently be appreciated,a little be later than I expected, this movie is no doubt one of the greatest masterpiece of M. Night Shyamalan.If somebody tells you that the sixth sense is a horror movie,he is definitely wrong about the subject the director want to show us.I like the tactic of this one a wee same with the Alejandro Amenbar's The Others or Opern Your Eyes which is also my favourite. M. Night Shyamalan is so special and focusing on every little piece and you are supposed to connect it step by step throughout the movie to find the director's destination.Don't get confused,when you grab the thought of the little boy Cole Sear(Haley Joel Osment),you are getting closer to the core of the movie.Additonally,the twist end is classic and be the moment you will find why this movie has been rolled into the Top 250,it's generally accepted by most our audience friends.The doctor(Willis) eventually waked up and knows where he belongs to and it's also time for leaving resulting from the inter-belief of Cole,who is always haunted by the ghost in his world.Cole is the only hope for these ghosts to appease themselves, M. Night Shyamalan reveals the two aspect of human character simultaneously,the ugliness and the beauty with the help of the successful figure of Cole.The clues in the movie are invaluable,with which you may totally understand the whole subject of this movie,the mind of M. Night Shyamalan whose conception is of a little bit audacity and breakthrough.It may not be the best film in dozens of years,however,it does hit a lot of people both mentally and physically,encourage people's normal life!!

		<fullReview>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** "The Sixth Sense" is the work of perfecting deception and scenarios, of mastering the art of keeping the audience at the edge of their seat for one chilling sequence and surprise after another, and it is by and large the work of an extremely talented, conscientious, and ambitious filmmaker- M. Night Shaymalan. The premise of this ingenious thriller involves the relationship of a disparaged child psychologist (Willis) and a curious, coy, prodigal young boy who is uniquely troubled, he "sees dead people", and is lost as to how to embrace the spirits he encounters. Yet, being the master of deception that Shaymalan synonymously is, one cannot merely accept this as a single premise, for there is much, much more beneath the surface of this curious relationship. In viewing a film such as this and defying its deceiving premise, it is important to note and consider all of the facts throughout the film, as there are so many clues pertinent to the "stupefying conclusion" that the "surprise ending" is almost pronounced by Shaymalan, and you can hardly fault him for being unfair and disloyal to the facts, for upon review, it is the oblivious viewer who has been stumped by the subtle Shaymalan. Here is a film that provides plenty of chilling suspense, enticing dialogue, and confounding mystery, and even manages to conclude on one of the most ingenious, adroit notes in film: the filmmaker is controlling all of the shots here, and the viewer is merely following his lead! Excellent direction from Shaymalan, brilliant acting by Willis and Osment, interesting and original screenplay, and overall, an ingenious cinematic effort that is more intelligent than it seems.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense in many ways was excellent. The actors were great, Bruce Wills on behalf is good in mostly in all of his films and Haley Joel Osment, at that time was in the process of a new actor and he did great. Most kids in movies are little punks that I can't stand and are just flat out terrible at acting but Haley put up a strong performance and that's why, now he's a successful and famous actor (mostly because of this film.) The story was very interesting about a kid who sees dead people and comes to a man to seek help and they both become friends as he is trying to let the fears out of him. In the beginning of the film, I was quite confused of what was going on until the very end I was quite surprised. The ending had one of the best twists I have ever seen in a film yet. It keeps you at the edge of your chair and your like, " Oh my god, that is so weird. All this time, throughout this movie I was wondering what was going on and now I learned. Wow, that's quite amazing." That is what you will be thinking. The film was extremely interesting and detailing. There will be many parts in the movie when you can't watch and will have major goosebumps but that's the fun in thriller and horrors, shouldn't be? Good film and very enjoyable to watch and listen to.Hedeen's outlook: 9/10</fullReview>

This truly is a thrill ride that will leave everyone on the edge of their seats wondering what will happen next. I'm very glad to see that I was fortunate to figure out what the movie was about the first time I saw it. I have since seen several times and it keeps getting better each time I have seen it. The plot is laced with twists and turns that will keep the mind working well after it is over. Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment kept me on my toes wondering what would happen next with each scene they were in and each word they spoke because it was a clue to the finale. "The Sixth Sense" was so powerful and thought provoking that I wanted to be in it because I wanted to find out what it was like to be in one of the year's best movies.I can't give enough praise to the young actor Haley Joel Osment who gave one of the best performances by an actor young or old. Bruce Willis has finally found has made the best decision of his career by selecting the role of Dr. Malcolm Crowe. Bruce Willis makes me glad I watch movies because he is just so good. I was surprised to see how good Olivia Williams was in this film. I saw her in "The Postman" and she was not quite used to her full potential. I'm glad that this role allowed her to flourish as an actress. She has proven to be a hot commodity in Hollywood and deserves to be in more movies.I'm proud to say that this is one of the best movies I've seen in my whole life.</fullReview>

So did my family, it's my mom's favorite film. "The Sixth Sense" has a wonderful plot, which makes the movie very interesting.(the movie doesn't have a single dull moment)."The Sixth Sense" tells the story of a boy named Cole who has a sixth sense(the ability to see and communicate with dead people). Cole starts seeking help from a children's psychiatrist, Malcolm, and then the plot thickens.I think everyone should see this movie because it surely is one of the greatest films ever made. I give this movie a full 10/10 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I See A Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I See A Great FilmThe movie The Sixth Sense was written by the upcoming, outstanding director and writer M. Night Shyamalan. This movie is considered to be his first breakout hit in the box office. This movie is about a child psychologist, Dr. Malcolm Crowe, played by Bruce Willis who is treating a young boy with the gift of a 'Sixth Sense.' Dr. Malcolm Crowe specializes in children and extremely mentally troubled children. The movie starts out with Dr. Crowe and his wife in their house and a burglar enters. The burglar is a former client of Dr. Crowe. After many confrontations back and forth between Dr. Crowe and his former patient, Dr. Crowe is shot. The movie picks up months later down the line. Dr. Crowe starts helping the young man with the 'sixth sense,' Cole Sear played by Haley Joel Osment. After many sessions with Dr. Crowe, the young Sear reveals his horrible secret: 'I See Dead People.' This movie has many twists and turns that will keep the spectators on the edge of their seat. The critical intention of this movie is used to explain to the spectators that we really don't know what is out there in the world we live in. How does the spectator know that there aren't people in the world who have extra senses like this one? If someone told another person about a sense like this, most likely that person would be sent to a mental institution and never heard of again. The critical intention is telling us to keep our eyes and ears and every other sense we have open to different situations in this world we live in. The critical technique of the Sixth Sense was used in almost every frame of the movie. In this movie when a character gets very cold or we can see his or her breath because its cold, a ghost is about to appear. Also every time a ghost is in frame, the color red is somewhere in the frame to be seen. I haven't exactly found out why some of the character's hair in this movie has blond streaks in them. I'm sure it serves some purpose though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most overestimated films in recent years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mystery novels are probably the most abundant. Not to say they're not enjoyable or that many of them, or their authors, aren't remarkable. But the immense majority of them could possibly not exist and few would notice. In cinema, probably the situation is not identical: there aren't as many mystery films (although there are a LOT) as there are mystery novels. But the impact of a medium-size story in cinema or in literature is the same: it can be a pleasant reading (or a pleasant flick, in this case), but you can forget about it few days later. The thing is that people aren't that accustomed to read. The basis of the success of "The 6th sense" is the fact that people today isn't familiar with all the mystery stories of the XIX century and before. Otherwise, there wouldn't have been so much fuss about it. This is a movie that is well told, yes. It's story, at a certain level, is effective. But there is nothing else to it. Except for the overwhelming performance of H.J.Osment (that should have made Bruce Willis ashamed of his).</fullReview>

I also loved "Unbreakable", "Signs", and I can't wait to see "The Village".Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, and Toni Collette all did wonderful jobs in the movie, especially Haley. Although he didn't win his nomination in the Oscars, he still deserved to be nominated. This film is wonderful, M. Night's best film yet. This movie is good for pre-teens, teenagers, and adults, although younger children will get frighten by some of the scenes here, especially the ones with ghosts and just suspense throughout the film. This movie had one sexual situation at the beginning of the film, but was interrupted. Has some mild langauge.*MAJOR SPOILER*Bruce Willis who plays the doctor helping Haley's character is actually a ghost and is really dead. Since Haley's character could see dead people, he could see Bruce's character. The ending is a bit similar to "The Others" if you've seen that movie. And if you watched the movie "50 First Dates" it gives away the ending of "The Sixth Sense".*END OF MAJOR SPOILER*But this is an excellent film. I totally recommend it. If you haven't seen it yet, you should! I give this movie an A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Something of a rarity these days, a thriller that makes you think and does not rely on the tired old plots than many of the thriller/horror films do these days. M. Night Shyamalan in this film was like Alfred Hitchcock in his prime. Lots of plot twists and a surprise ending (well for most people, I knew halfway through).If you are one of the few that have not seen this film then go out and rent it right now! This film belongs in the top 10 thriller/horror films of all times!It is also notable because it was before M. Night Shyamalan became a selling point for his films. I can't wait for his autobiography, "M. Night Shyamalan presents the life of M. Night Shyamalan. An M. Night Shyamalan Production, written by M. Night Shyamalan, preface by M. Night Shyamalan". Yes, M. Night Shyamalan is getting annoying! He should take a note from the masters in this genre and let his films make it on their own merit and not his name. This film proves he has the talent...if not the modesty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit right up front that I had the "twist" ending figured out about 20 minutes into this film. That didn't stop me from enjoying it, however.Bruce Willis is a child psychologist who has recently taken young and troubled Haley Joel Osment under his wing. It seems that young Haley can "see dead people." As Bruce's marriage slowly dissolves and Haley suffers from cruel ridicule inflicted by his classmates, the two form a bond and try to find a way for Haley to accept his lot and somehow turn his frightening experiences with the dead into positive ones.There are more than enough frightening moments here, as Haley encounters the ghost of an angry, abused woman in his kitchen, a constantly vomiting little girl and a slave locked inside of a coal chute. There's also a great moment featuring Willis and a tape machine, when revelation strikes him with the force of a fist. All of these encounters are spooky, eerie and unsettling, but also highly satisfying, especially in the case of the poisoned child whose murder Haley solves. The film is quiet and sedate, even a little washed out, but highlighted with brilliant spots of red at climactic moments. It reminded me quite strongly of "The Ring" and its Japanese predecessor "Ringu" with its stark, cold landscapes and profound silences. I was a tad disappointed that I couldn't be surprised along with everyone else at the twist ending, which indeed was quite a nice shock, but I still very much enjoyed this innovative ghost story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, first of all ,you won't find any spoiler in there, so you are safe. I won't go through the movie because it has already been done. I will just say that although this movie has very good acting and directing, it is not a "thriller-masterpiece". It is more like a good human tragedy, with a lot of feelings expressed. If you expect something frightening or thrilling, you will either be disappointed or maybe you are just an easy spectator not asking much from a movie, no offense intended. The whole problem with the 6th sense is that if you pay attention to what really happens, which you should do with any movie, you understand right away what it is about, and it lose the taste that made people vote 10/10 for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible spoilers This was a good movie because of the exploration of the characters, especially young Cole, not particularly because of the plot. There were suspenseful moments-high-drama type score and the shadows of ghosts before they actually appear-but I thought the kid's torment over being constantly haunted was rather simplisticly wrapped up, frankly, and can you really tape a spirit? The performances are all outstanding, especially Donnie Wahlberg in a very brief but pivotal role at the beginning, and HJ could teach seasoned "celebrities" like Tom Cruise and Richard Gere a thing or two. It's the ending that makes people think this is a greater film than it is, though-I remember sitting there thinking, "oh, MAN!! Why didn't I see that COMING??"

		<shortDescription>Good job, but one of the top 20 of all time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1999 a movie was released that was the topic of conversation around office water coolers throughout the country. People were amazed at slow pace, but ever engrossing ghost story that culminated in an ending that no one saw coming. The movie was M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense and its success went on to soak up over $300 million at the domestic box office and even garnish its young unknown star Haley Joel Osment a Supporting Actor nod at the 2000 Academy Awards.The thing is, that still to this day, I don't understand all the hubbub. Was it a good movie? Yes. But was it so revolutionary that it deserves its standing as 19th on the all-time grossing films list? Hardly.For those of you who have been living in a cave waiting for peace in the Middle East, The Sixth Sense stars Bruce Willis as Malcolm Crowe, a psychologist that we are introduced to being shot in the opening scenes. After what we expect to have been a speedy recovery, Malcolm befriends a new client, Cole Sear (Osment) who seems to have a gift/curse of being able to see and communicate with dead people.Malcolm tries to comprehend what Cole is facing and this all leads to a revelation of his own that ?shocked the movie world' back in 1999 and has been copied and parodied countless times since.To spend any more time on the plot would be counterproductive. Most likely you have seen the film and on the off chance that you are coming out of a cave, well then, you might be lucky enough to be surprised at the ending without anyone telling you what to look for before it unveils itself.So let's start with the good stuff first. Director M. Night Shyamalan did a superb job in keeping us interested in the story and the characters when everyone seems to be speaking in a monotone. Shyamalan directed only two films before Sense (Praying with Anger and Wide Awake) so no one expected the phenomena that resulted. The Sixth Sense was also written by Shyamalan we all know how rare it is to find a talented writer/director now of days.Also good are the performances. Bruce Willis veers away from his macho persona he usually exudes and Osment and Toni Collette (who plays his mother) are great and were both deserving of their Oscar nods. Hell, I would even give chops to Donnie Wahlberg who has but a small, albeit important, role at the beginning of the film. All around, an A- grade for the actors.Then there was the scary stuff. You know, the things that go bump. There are a few genuine scares with rousing musical scores in tow but it is the quiet softer moments that really made the hair on the back of your neck take notice. When Osment utters, `I see dead people' or when we see the imprint of a palm evaporate on a kitchen table, you are swept up in a world that is more spooky that scary and the movie is better off staying on this path.There aren't many things that are wrong with The Sixth Sense and that is where I contradict myself. I agree that The Sixth Sense was one of the better movies released in 1999. I also believe that the premise was interesting and trend setting. What I didn't understand was the sheer fascination from audiences around the world that put this movie into such lofty lists (80 million people had seen the movie after its release to DVD/Video in 2000). Were we all that brain dead in '99 after Star Wars: The Phantom Menace and Toy Story 2 that this film stood out so indiscreetly? In researching for this review, I can honestly now answer that question with a definite, `YES'. Evidenced earlier with The Usual Suspects and then again in 2001 with Nicole Kidman's The Others, the movie going public has proven at the box office that if you can dupe them an dupe them good, they are willing to go back and back again in hopes of trying to figure out how you pulled it off the first time. So hats off to you Mr. Shyamalan. Although your succeeding efforts (Unbreakable, Signs) were better films, you did set a standard with a slightly better than average film, and hey who doesn't have time to stand at the water cooler and talk about your use of the color red in the film. Good job.www.gregsrants.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible spoilers...Bruce plays a child shrink who gets attacked by a former patient and it sends his life into a downward spiral. He eventually gets caught up in the life of Haley Joel Osmont, a kid who claims that he "sees dead people". What follows is a truly creepy epic of red, the undead, and an exploration of personal problems and dysfunctional relationships. What is the meaning of the 6th Sense?One of the best of the many anti-Die Hard Bruce Willis performances, he has rarely been better in a film elsewhere (except "Die Hard"). HJ himself isn't bad as the kid with the title sense, but his follow up work has been a bit much to digest.I think this is actually the only film by Mr. M. Night Shyamalan or however you spell his name that doesn't make use of water. See it for Bruce.</fullReview>

This was one that just cant be watched over and over again like say Army of Darkness (lol).If you evaluate the movie on the whole then it is good but take away the last 5 minutes and you have a so-so film. I understand the whole lets put a "wierd twist on the end" thing and im not gonna sit here and say that i had it figured out when i watched it the first time because i didnt. In fact that is the best part about it. No one knew what was going on until the very end and it was done very well. All i am saying is take away the end and it is a dull movie. Its not scary, or weird, of freaky, or exciting, or romantic, its just plain dull.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** SPOILER WARNING! ***I had a rotten time with this film because I thought the "twist" was the plot from the very beginning. At the start, when we see Bruce Willis being shot at point-blank range, I just assumed he was dead, especially because the camera zoomed out from him and then faded to black -- a classic Hollywood scenario for death. Then he's sitting peacefully on a bench wearing a long, black overcoat, so I thought he's angel, just like the "Wings of Desire" angels. That's how I read the entire film. So when the "twist" was "revealed", it made no sense to me whatsoever. Oops.In its defence, some scenes, especially the single take where Toni Collette goes into the laundry and comes back to find the kitchen trashed, were superbly executed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Sixth Sense' is a good movie but it depends too much on its ending. So much has said about it that the surprise there was less surprising. In my opinion a lot of people think about the surprise exactly as it will turn out, something that would not have happened if it was unknown that the movie had such a special ending. Of course I will not reveal it and I have to admit it is a great ending for a movie.There are some scary or exciting moments and the story develops in a pretty good way, but it plays a little slow. Some people will even say it is boring in some parts and I can understand that opinion. Other things make up for this. Bruce Willis, Toni Collette and especially the young Haley Joel Osment give some very fine performances, there is a creepy atmosphere throughout the movie and the direction from M. Night Shyamalan is great.</fullReview>

This is the kind of movie that is creepy when you think about it afterwards. It doesn't have to be something gorey that makes you wince. It's something that sticks with you and makes you think about just how creepy this world can be. This movie has this potential. The only problem is - once you see the end of this movie, it really becomes a lot less interesting. You know the secret. What's the point in watching it again? Once you know Bruce Willis's character is dead, watching the movie over again lacks any major appeal. The movie is good - one time.</fullReview>

I didn't really find the ending very shocking, but then I watched this one on video and not the theater so I knew to look for a surprise ending. The story of the movie is that of a boy who sees ghosts and has other problems. Bruce Willis is a doctor who wants to help him.

		<fullReview>Horror films are usually garish and camp. But this must be the most understated entry ever in the genre, with its mood of quiet portentiousness and overwhelming solemnity. And though the final twist is neat, its also very clearly telegraphed. What saves The Sixth Sense is some fine acting, from Bruce Willis as the so-concerned psychologist, and Joel Harvey Osment as the child who sees ghosts. It's very nicely done, but not so original. Other films (Truly Madly Deeply, Kieslowski's No End) have played with similar material; and put some more life into death than we see here.</fullReview>

Didn't he find it odd that he never needed to go to the toilet, or pay the gas bill, or eat, or drink, or brush his teeth, or drive a car, etc etc for a few weeks or months prior to finding HJO. And how come he found the kid, anyway? AND in the same neighbourhood!It's a well directed film, but I always find holes in this kind of film. Sorry to be picky, but I have to suspend so much credibility that there's no point in the plot by the end.I never liked the Osment child, but I have to admit that his performance is good in this. The film has redeeming qualities, but the basic premise is too flawed. The only bit I liked was the dead girl's video for her father. That was quite touching.Someone's comment says he watched this film 27 times (has to be a bloke). I won't be watching this again. 7 out of 10 for direction, photography and performances (esp Toni Collette).</fullReview>

Stir of echoes is less predictable and scarier. The sixth sense could have been a better film but it wasn't, 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What twist? (Possible spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't give away the ending, but overall I found the film disappointing. This is because THERE WAS NO TWIST. The ending was not a surprise, it was signposted within about the first ten minutes of the movie. While the performances and the suspense factor was excellent, I felt the whole film was a set-up to say,"we're going to take you by surprise with the ending". When this didn't happen, I felt it ruined the whole film for me.The 'twist' in no way compares to The Usual Suspects or the original Planet of the Apes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is an attempt to bring horror out of the ironic slasher genre which has to be a good thing following their horrible decline since Scream.The film, however, fails to deliver. The promised spooky feel to the film is absent and instead resorts to loud noises and swells in music to bring cheap jumps to the audience. It takes an unnecessary cliche in the story of the little girl and her twisted step-mother.I cannot however fault the films performances, Bruce Willis continues his rise from action film star to sensitive character actor, Haley Joel Osment defied my expectations as a new American child star to hate with a marvelous turn as the outsider child (surely the best USA child acting of the late 90s?). The smaller parts of the film where also perfectly cast and handled well by a new director.*SPOILERS* I would say that the film leaves many parts left open in it's twist ending to keep audiences asking questions for a long time (Where did the man keep a gun while wearing briefs? wouldn't he notice a huge hole in his back?) this can be expected with all twist films though. Far from being an original ending, it appears that Carnival of Souls and Jacob's Ladder both had similar "shocking" conclusions.The film deserves at least a 3 out of 5 but not the classic status that it will surely gain in years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense, while rated PG-13, succeeds at being genuinely SCARY, a feat which few other films can boast of achieving. With unbelievable cinematography, a HIDEOUS soundtrack (in a good way), amazing acting, and a twist ending that, dare I say it, MAKES SENSE, this film truly deserved the Best Picture Oscar over Shakespeare in Love.To briefly summarize the plot, Bruce Willis plays a child psychologist who, after celebrating a prestigious award from the mayor of Philadelphia, is assaulted by a former patient. This patient, screaming "YOU FAILED ME!" opens fire at Bruce Willis.Zoom ahead to the next fall. Bruce Willis is now healed, and is beginning to investigate a little boy, Cole. This boy appears to have numerous psychological problems plaguing him, and Bruce Willis wishes to help him.The two bond, and it appears that Cole harbors a truly strange secret. He is able to see ghosts, and they don't know they're dead. He wants them to go away. How is this conflict solved? Watch this truly frightening thriller.Haley Joel Osment is an unbelievable actor. I pray he got the Best Actor nomination, for he truly deserved it. Bruce Willis gives a surprisingly UNBELIEVABLE performance, showing that he isn't just an action movie star.M. Night Shaynaman's direction makes those scenes with the ghosts FRIGHTENING. The film is more of a thriller than outright horror, but it is just plain SPOOKY to watch. Who isn't frightened by normal people turning heir bodies to suddenly reveal part of their body tainted by blood?Would I recommend this film? INDEED. 10/10</fullReview>

You have this guy played by Bruce Willis, who spends most of the film talking to a little boy. The little boy is the most annoying thing about the film. Even Brucie looks good beside him, which is not an easy thing to do. Anyway the film is just the little boy looking scared and sinister. The acting is terrible. His wife is a nice looking girl, too good for a ruffian like Bruce. Bruce is just about the worst actor there is. There is supposed to be a really suspenseful atmosphere to the film. Cobblers. This film is just a big mess with no atmosphere or funnies. And if you like bad endings you'll love the ending. Overall, i give it 1/10, not 0 because Brucie's wife is nice.(the wife in the film, not demi)</fullReview>

The version I saw on video had an exposition by the creators of the story's rules ? too bad they could not explain the half-dozen glaring plot holes and inconsistencies.True, Osment as the kid is every bit as good as everyone claims, but what is Willis doing here? I suppose if Tom Cruise can be tapped for Eyes Wide Shut, then anything is possible, but I can think of many actors off the top of my head who would be far more likely to be able to breath some life into the part.</fullReview>

The ending completely took me by surprise. Plus, although there were scenes throughout the movie that seemed creepy, once I understood the reasoning behind the boy's "sense" I was able to reflect back on those scenes as thought-provoking instead of scary. The performances of all of the cast were marvelous, especially by Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment.I highly recommend this film to anyone; even if you do not like thrillers, I believe you would enjoy this --- I can testify to that.Needless to say, along with MANY others I have rated this movie 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great script with particularly well written characters. Excellent acting, with a special tick for Toni Collette as the confused, frustrated but tenaciously loving mother. There is clever use of psycholological suspense, coupled with some genuinely disturbing images. The story unfolds at an unhurried pace which works well to build the necessary atmosphere for what is about to happen. The dead enter quickly, catching the audience with a sharp change of pace. Of particular note was the way that the audience is asked to identify with them. We are asked not to turn our heads away in fear but to follow them... a great technique which tends to take us deeper into our own fear! The story may be flawed, the suspension of disbelief stretched, but this is nonetheless a gem in its genre. Much has been made of the twist, but this remains a bonus not the intrinsic value of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have to say that The Sixtth Sense ranks right up there as being of my favorite movies of 1999. But the fact is, as soon as I heard that there was a surprise ending, I made a guess as to what it was. And as I sat at the theatre watching the movie, I started nodding to myself that my guess was indeed acurate. All being said, the Sixth Sense was quite spooky and did create a wonderfully eerie type atmosphere. The writing was wonderful as writer/director M. Night really got into the minds of the characters. Plus, this film probably serves as a classic character study and makes you question the world around you. Well done M. Night, Bruce Willis, Haley Joel and the rest on a job marvellously done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>?is not the ?number one thriller of all time' as the tagline may suggest. It is not even among the best, the most inventive, the most scary, clever or devious. In fact, if you pick out the no-surprise ending in the first ten minutes, chances are you'll be bored throughout.There is a little thrill when you watch a film first time round and spot the clues. Often when you don't, a second viewing releases so much more. After an hour of having the ?clues' drilled into your skull, this film appears to degenerate into phony sentiment and compromised plots.Even if the twist is not original, the potential is there to stretch the characters into three-dimensional human beings. The chance is sadly wasted.And one more thing. How can anyone in their right minds consider any Bruce Willis picture a "surprise" or "sleeper" hit?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I did not know exactly what to expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I initially entered the movie theater to watch The Sixth Sense, I did not know exactly what to expect. I liked the genre in general, and I had heard good reviews about this film from people I knew. However, I did not expect it to be nearly as good as it was.Several elements made this film a success: the plot, the acting, the special effects, and the filming staff.First, the plot was excellent. It was well thought out, and I was not expecting the ending. Usually, I find most films lately to be predictable with minimal plot and a high dependency on special effects and explosions to sell themselves. This film was different. It led you one way only to let you know at the very end that your perception of the situation was way off course. The plot had enough twists and turns to keep me interested in seeing more, and I actually watched it a second time a week later just to catch everything that I had missed the first time.The acting was excellent.Haley Joel Osment puts forth an excellent, believable performance as the tormented Cole Sear who claims that he "can see dead people." His performance is so real that you forget that he is acting. He definitely is a young actor with a lot of potential, and I hope he wins the Best Supporting Actor award for this movie.Bruce Willis shows his full range of acting abilities in this film as well. He portrays a Dr. Malcolm Crowe, successful child counsellor who is troubled by the fact that he ultimately failed on one of his former patients. He is using Cole Sear, a young boy with similar problems, as a way to (in his mind) compensate for his former failure. Bruce Willis should have been nominated for Best Actor for this film.Toni Collette does an excellent job as Lynn Sear, Cole's mom. She deserves to receive the Best Supporting Actress award. She portrays a mother who is perplexed by her son's unwillingness to communicate with her and by her perceived lack of esteem in her mother's eyes.Olivia Williams also does a great job as Anna Crowe. She believably portrays a wife who is depressed by her seemingly degenerating relationship with her husband, Dr. Malcolm Crowe.Donnie Walhberg's brief (pardon the pun!) cameo at the beginning of the film is spooky to watch as well.The special effects of the film were well done. The film really built up suspense in various key parts. The makeup and props for the dead people were done very well.Finally, the staff did a good job making this movie. M. Night Shyamalan did a good job directing this film. The music complemented its respective scenes very well.Overall, this is a good film with lots of philosophical depth. I definitely recommended it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror films of all time, and an allegory of alienation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last week, when I left the theater after watching this film, I had the strange impression that I had just watched something great. Today, one week later, I'm still convinced that I was right.When the Horror genre seemed to be poured out into mediocrity with films such as Blair Witch Project or The Haunting, a new one has just appeared which with no doubt deserves one of the highest places at the all-time horror movies top list.Nowadays it's very difficult to surprise people with a horror movie, or simply to scare people. Everything seems to have been said and done yet. But The Sixth Sense really does both things, so we wonder, where is the secret of The Sixth Sense, if there is any? To find it out we can start by analyzing some of its aspects. Firstly, Bruce Willis does one of the best performances in his whole career (if not the best); Secondly Haley Joel Osment does an Oscar-deserving performance as the boy Cole; thirdly, the secondary actors are close to perfection; fourthly, the screenplay is one of the most imaginative ones we have seen since lots of years ago, with the best ending I could ever have imagined; and finally the music and the sound effects are really impressive, raising the stressing moments to the highest level.Until now, what we have seen is plenty of good points, excellence in all the film details, but not the real secret. The real secret is (and only can be) something present in every aspect of the movie and at the same time independent from each other. What I mean is the DIRECTING. I certainly could write a thousand lines about the directing of this movie, about its structure, about its developing, about the visuals, about the ideas we could extract, but the only thing I will say about it is: Stanley Kubrick is born again! Shymalan has just become a new star in the movie sky, a new director and writer to add to my all-time top ten list. In fact, when I went to see The Matrix, what I expected and didn't get was something like this, and now I'm so glad that Cinema has finally given it to me. Thank you very much, Mr. Shymalan.This film can also be viewed from another perspective: it also shows how some people are not able to see that they are emotionally dead. There's a lot of people in the USA and also in other countries who only see what they want to see, just like in the song Nowhere Man, by The Beatles. The psychiatrist was trying to cure the boy, and he didn't realize that it was *his* problem. Sigmund Freud suffered that kind of problem, and now his teachings are extended all over the USA and other countries like France and Argentina.</fullReview>

Anyone who didn't like it simply didn't GET it.Like that other phenomenal blockbuster of 1999, The Matrix, the intertwined story is presented in an unusual and intelligent manner. You do have to think about what you're watching. And you find yourself mentally reviewing the storyline the more you watch.I wondered while watching it why so many people had gone to see such a cerebral film more than once - until the shattering denouement. Suddenly, the whole film falls into place and hits you like a sledgehammer. The boy's performance is inspirational, but with the realisation of that ending, it moves onto a whole other level.If you want to hear a cinema audience go suddenly silent more than once, this is the film to see.

		<fullReview>I decided to watch this movie, because I know M. Night Shyamalan and his works. Before that I saw Signs, one of his best movies, so I've expected a lot from this movie. The story (I read just a short synopsis of the movie) was really good and the actors also (I like Bruce Willis in almost every movie) promised a good movie, so I expect to see a really good and intense paranormal masterpiece. The story is very good: a young kid is seeing dead people all the time. Her mother is trying to help him by calling a child psychiatrist, who wants to find out, what is going on inside kid's mind. Really promising and interesting story.But: I was disappointed. Really disappointed. Instead of being frightened to death (some people claimed that this movie is more scary than The Exorcist), I was bored to death. Yeah, this movie is boring, because nothing is happening for about one hour. Characters are just talking all the time, from time to time a kid is seeing dead people, but that's it. The last hour of the movie is even more boring, I had a feeling like this stuff was not directed by Shyamalan at all. The movie Sings was really intense, funny and interesting. Sixth Sense is completely different; slow, uninteresting and not even scary, despite the fact that a lot of people said that this movie is so scarry as The Exorcist. Wrong. The Exorcist was much much scarrier and Linda Blair was very convincing as a little girl, possessed by the devil. But here everything is so boring and painfully slow. The most funny episodes of X - Files were scarier than this. Willis is the only great thing about this movie. His acting is great and it prevents me from not to fall asleep while watching this movie. I don't say that Sixth Sense is a bad movie, it's just overrated. It's not scary and intense. It's like watching the movies about haunted houses but with no ghosts. Like Halloween without Michael Myers. Like The Blair Witch Project without the forest.Overrated and boring paranormal movie. Bad episode of X - Files.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was all the fuss about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry, but this movie didn't do it for me at all. I didn't watch it then and only rented it, because I thought, well, what if I'm actually missing something.Truth is: I probably am missing something.To me it was just plain boring.The kid played well, I thought, as for Mr. Willis. For me he works best in other, lighter movies. Music was OK, nothing overwhelming, but it did work. I liked the camera and lighting of the film.Too bad I wasted time on this. Should have known better. The next time I will just have to listen to my instincts more closely as usually they are right on the money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just don't understand why people like M. Night Shyamalan's movies. This is his most acclaimed and simultaneously most typical movie: despite a decent performance from Osment, nothing actually happens. There is virtually no dialogue, and despite the claims of reviewers, little if any suspense. If you have enough time and money to rent this movie, it would be more entertaining to light the money on fire and try not to burn down your house. Seriously, just don't waste your time on anything by this director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I HATED IT!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, this movie was crap. Best Picture? Best Director? Best Supporting Actress? This was a gimmicky, non-scary horror flick with a sappy hook ending that paled in comparison to the similar ending of Fight Club. It was cheap entertainment at best that causes me to completely lose respect for the Academy Awards. To totally disregard an innovative, thought-provoking film with some semblance of cultural relevance like Fight Club and then nominate this piece in almost every major category is ridiculous. What does the audience get out of this film besides thinking of ghosts the next time they get goose bumps? The hokey plot was lame, the kid was annoying, Bruce Willis was Bruce Willis, and what was with the classroom scene with the microphone visible at the top of the screen? Granted I went in expecting to hate it, but this film was decent for a horror movie at best and not nearly in the same league as Being John Malkovich, Magnolia, or Fight Club.</fullReview>

I Think that this film just wants to be the half way between "Ghost" and "The kingdom" but it doesn't have either the charm of Demi Moore or the deepness of thought of Lars Von Trier. The result is a "half baked" film, not good as a comedy, not good as a horror, not good as a psycological film. I apologize with other commenters...but this is my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would place this movie in the "nondescript" category. The acting was definitely very good, but I guess my blah reaction is caused by everybody else's reaction to "that cool ending." Come ON, people!!!! I knew nothing about this movie when I walked into the theatre (except that it was apparently a clever movie), and I was able to figure out the ending within the first half hour. It was that obvious. It seemed to me as if the screenwriters were having such a good chuckle knowing what the ending was going to be that they kept beating you over the head with little inside-joke clues. Frankly, I felt as if I were bleeding from being beaten over the head during the hospital scene and the jewelry store scene. If those two scenes had not been so incredibly overdone, then I would have been a lot more surprised at the end.</fullReview>

It has a plot that clatters and bumps along. The characters are poorly developed. Scenes are added for seemingly no reason and left unexplained. Bruce Willis character apparently is a complete moron. The utter lack of basic screenwriting ability of this film's author is astonishing. This movie is not worth seeing at the cinema or renting on video. If you do have the misfortune to see The Sixth Sense you will be wishing for the two hours of your life you wasted viewing it back. As for the ending, it stinks too.

		<fullReview>But the problem was with the director's choice of inspiration.M. Night Shyamalan started with what could've been a classic in my book, until i saw the whole package and realized that it was just too familiar. It was in 1999 when I saw the movie with my father and we had gotten into the film from the shocks; Haley Joel Osment is such a talented actor that he truly deserved the Academy Award for the best supporting male role. Bruce Willis did much in this drama as the psychologist trying to help Haley Joel's character, which shows a rather different approach than him killing bad guys as John McClain.My complaint had to be the infamous ending where when i saw it in theater, I recognized immediately that Shyamlan took the idea of an episode from the Nickelodeon show "Are you afraid of the Dark?" called The Tale of the Dream Girl using the same premise. Yet, the director got a nomination for original screenplay that he never mentioned his so called "Inspiration" to anybody.Haley, don't stop acting in dramatic movies; M. Night, don't based your movies on TV plots next time.</fullReview>

A "surprise" ending telegraphed well in advance. The gulf between the talents of the actors and the writer/director have rarely been so obvious.I suppose if you like M. Night Shyamalan's work, you might like this as well. The only thing on his resume which would recommend him to me is as the writer of "Stuart Little" - and even that was hardly world-class!If, on the other hand, you like the works of directors such as Steven Spielberg, Stanly Kubrick, Mimi Leder, or Joe Dante as I do, "The Sixth Sense" is a pretty poor waste of a couple of hours of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike some people I will admit to the fact that I was totally surprised by the ending, but in my book the ending does not make the movie. Even still the twist at the end, did not live up to it's hype and was not as good as movies like "The Usual Suspects". I am a fan of Bruce Willis and he has his moments in this one, but I for one cannot stand Haley Joel. I believe his best movie was Forrest Gump and thats because he had few lines and was in 5% of the movie. I am not saying that "The Sixth Sense" was a terrible movie, but it does not live up to it's hype and certainly not to the IMDb top 100 rating. It was a very uneventful flick with boring dialogue and a very dry plot. To put it bluntly it bored me to tears. After weeks of hearing praise and worship after the viewing I was severely disappointed. The ending was good, but the rest of the movie was just average. If you want to see a good M. Night movie, watch "Unbreakable", I think "Signs" was just as overrated. All in all I gave this movie a 6/10 or maybe a B-. Like I said before, it's not a bad movie, it just didn't live up to the hype, and was not worth paying to see.</fullReview>

Recomendad for any lover of film, although children should be cautious to see the few explicit scenes of horror.I would love to see more titles in the genre as well made and instantly become classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed and written by M. Night Shyamalan, The Sixth Sense is a supernatural thriller that is truly a riveting and electric roller coaster ride with enough loops and turns for a lifetime. Not only was this film groundbreaking with its horrifying plot, the acting in it was elevated to an unprecedented level in the way it connected the audience to the personal stories each character had with themselves and the other characters. The relationship between Cole and his mother was one that conveyed the unbreakable bond a mother and child holds. Now, I'm not going to spoil anything, but M. Night Shyamalan really has a way with leading your brain one way in interpreting the movie, and then ripping the rug right out from under you. The plot twist in this film was so surprising I found myself screaming at the television in shock, excitement, and utter fear. The Sixth Sense goes down in history as one of the best horror films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most thoughtful and spine-chilling horrors films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt that M. Night Shyalaman has made some highly disappointing films in the last decade. However, this was a time when Shyalaman was a more respectable director for his supernatural themes and shocking plot twists in his films. This is best demonstrated in his Oscar-nominated horror film Sixth Sense that left many viewers that the edge of their seats in the late 90s. In this film, Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crowe, a once gifted child psychologist is assigned to a new patient no one other than Cole Sears (played by Haley Joel Osment), a shy and emotionally disturbed nine-year old boy who is discovered to have a mysterious ability to communicate with spirits of dead people. The further Malcolm goes his research, the closer he gets learning the shocking secrets behind Cole's unique gift.Hollywood has made many scary and heart-pounding horror flicks dealing with ghosts and the afterlife. However, none of them come nearly as original or thoughtful as this one. This is not one of those typical ghost movies where characters are possessed or attacked by frightening entities. Directer M. Night Shyalaman takes the paranormal horror genre and takes to some unique directions. With an cogent screenplay and direction, the film brings an insanely scary atmosphere by not spewing the audience with pretentious jump scares, but by steadily lets the suspense creep on the audience. In many scenes, audience watch as people appear out of nowhere as seemingly normal people, but when you take closer look you see that they are not as alive as they appear to be. These scenes aren't type of scenes that audience jump, yet there are still very unpredictable. These scenes can easily give chills to your spine as dead person can appear out of nowhere at any minute when you least expect, and the eerie music score by James Newton Howard greatly adds to the scary tone. The film manages to stay captivating throughout its run up until the final scene when the audience is hit with the one of the most shocking and unpredictable twists that leave many jaws dropping.Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment gave some exhilarating performances. The chemistry between the two is so well that they seem so natural on screen together. The then 10-year old Osment's performance was one of the best performances I have seen by a child at such a young age. The fact that he receive an Oscar nomination for his performance is definitely no surprise. As of Bruce Willis, this is probably the best role of his career aside from John McClane in the Die Hard series. The Sixth Sense is one of the best horror films Hollywood has to offer, and certainly the best film by M. Night Shyalaman. I really hope one day he will return back to the glory days of his film making career and he will making some truly intriguing films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Most Original, Clever &amp; Intelligently Made Horror Flicks Of The Past 20 Years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blending the emotional depth of a heartfelt story with the chilling vibes of a modern horror, The Sixth Sense is M Night Shayamalan's breakthrough feature film that's patiently crafted, skilfully narrated &amp; efficiently performed and still remains his finest directional effort to date. Noted for its foreboding atmosphere, brilliant use of visual motifs &amp; that final masterstroke, it's an excellent example of quality storytelling.Set in Philadelphia, the story of The Sixth Sense follows a child psychologist who is shot by one of his former patients on the day he was honoured for his work. The plot then jumps to next fall where we see him clearly affected by the whole incident as he takes on a new case of a 9-year old boy who's exhibiting signs of the same illness that his ex-patient did. When he commits to helping him, the boy confides his secret to him.Written &amp; directed by M Night Shayamalan, The Sixth Sense remains the only film that I've seen of his and the patience &amp; maturity with which he has translated this scripted story on the film canvas is no short of amazing. The screenplay makes sure that each character has a well-defined arc, the symbolic &amp; thematic elements are nicely addressed, those twists n turns are cleverly placed and it keeps its secret well-preserved until the final revelation.Set pieces, shooting locations &amp; overcast weather conditions really help in creating a dark setting, the fluid movements &amp; sustained focus of its camera, in addition to proper lighting &amp; correct colour tones, add more enhancements to its ominous setting, Editing provides a smooth flow to the whole narrative &amp; unfolds it at a steady pace. James Newton Howard's score comprises of tracks that effortlessly integrate into the storyline to further amplify the whole experience.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osmont, Tori Collette &amp; Olivia Williams, with Willis &amp; Osmont impressing the most. Willis is very restraint in his performance here, Osmont wonderfully captures the plight of his character &amp; is able to express it convincingly, the scenes between Willis &amp; Osmont are surprisingly fascinating, Collette does well as the concerned mother and the arc of each one of these characters is fully realised on the screen.On an overall scale, The Sixth Sense delivers the chills without for once discarding its firm grip on the viewers' senses, maintains a stunning balance between all filmmaking aspects, and continues to be counted amongst the most original, clever &amp; intelligently made horror flicks of the past 20 years. While it'll definitely surprise the newcomers, the only drawback The Sixth Sense has in my opinion is that its effect begins to wear off more n more on each subsequent viewing. Nevertheless, it's a must for every horror fanatic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last ten minutes really made this movie make sense, before the movie was over, i already jumped to conclusions and thought - oh, this movie seems completely illogical, since nobody ever speaks to Malcolm, Cole's mom didn't even hire him nor there were any conversations between them. Also he never had a conversation with his wife where she really spoke to him. An unusual movie for Bruce Willis, because he was in this movie i was unsure whether i wanted to see this or not, luckily i did and his performance didn't disappoint me, in my opinion, definitely one of his greatest movies. Also for a Kid actor Haley Joel Osment's acting was superb, he was incredibly mature throughout the movie, despite him being so young. It is not really made clear whether Cole knew Malcolm was dead or not, Malcolm was the only ghost Cole wasn't scared of and the only one who could help him. Through helping Cole, Malcolm found his path and accepted his death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very average ghost movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very average ghost movie about young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osmont), who sees spirits of the deceased who do not know they're dead, and seeks the help of a child psychologist (Bruce Willis) to deal with his problems.There are some scary moments in this movie including the appearances of the wandering and pale-looking ghosts, and the part where Cole utters the classic line "I see dead people" while cold breath is coming out of his mouth.However, I think the lack of emotion in the film overshadows the horror elements, making this a pretty dreary movie at times. Most of the characters lack emotion passion and appear very wooden, except for Osmont's character. And, the plot was slow-paced and the cinematography was dull. I guess this is director M. Night Shyamalan's style, as other movies I've seen of his use the same elements. But, this style isn't really appealing.Again, overall, this is a very average movie.Grade C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most poignantly-told ghost stories of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Nuanced and subtly creepy, and oftentimes heartbreaking and sad. A perfect showcase of M. Night Shymalan's unique storytelling talents.Haters call M. Night Shymalan the "one-hit wonder" so aggressively that they seem to forget just how effective that "one-hit" was. His first real big hit (but not his first film), THE SIXTH SENSE is a perfect introduction to the unique and rarely seen (in Hollywood)) storytelling talents of M. Night Shymalan, something that wasn't appreciated for too long. But I doubt anyone will disagree that THE SIXTH SENSE is a triumph of storytelling; a ghost story told in a most original and subtle way and achieves to sustain our interest without much use of heavy effects. But it's actually more than just another well-crafted ghost story, It's also actually an interesting drama grounded in semi-supernatural elements. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a gifted psychologist; his friends and his wife (Olivia Williams) thinks his talents is a gift, but he on the other hand considers it a curse due to a failure to cure a kid in the past that since has haunted him. Meanwhile, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment, a career-making performance) is a quiet, problematic boy. He gets picked on by his bully classmates and his mom (Toni Collette) isn't exactly comfortable when he isn't telling her what's wrong. And you thought seeing dead people was tough! The film says ghost see only what they want to see. So that doesn't make them any less different from the living. Here, Cole sees his ability to see and communicate with folks from the other side as a curse; something he wished he never had. But when he discovers how to wrest control of it, he starts to see what it really is: A gift in disguise. This plays a very strong part with the film's still shocking ending (a gimmick Shymalan would use in his later films), but actually plays (among with other issues) throughout the films. THE SIXTH SENSE is more than just a well-crafted genre picture; Shymalan uses it as means to tell a story dealing with some personal issues.Most will remember THE SIXTH SENSE as for its shocker of an ending, a great example of a true and shocking payoff that provides the perfect closure to a perfect film. But the pleasures of THE SIXTH SENSE doesn't begin and end there. The relevant issues tackled throughout the film (more prominently, family issues like divorce, mid-life crises and rejection) is unnerving just as some of the film's "jump-from-your-seat" moments are subtly creepy. But among the things that truly grabbed me about THE SIXTH SENSE is it's true emotions. Haters can call Shyamalan whatever they want, but he knows a thing or two about emotions. The scene where Cole talks to his mom about how he gets frequent "visits" from grandma starts out creepy, but really is sad and heartfelt, and Shymalan doesn't make use of any faux emotions whatsoever; just the simplicity of the staging of the scene. Then there's the ending (which I will not reveal for the sake of the small number of people who have not seen it or don't remember it), which was intended to shock the audience. But come to look at it, I realized just how sad and heartbreaking it really is.The setup for his later films would be similar to THE SIXTH SENSE, from the nuanced slow-burn setup paid off by a shocker ending. But like THE SIXTH SENSE, Shymalan's later films have an interesting story told in a most unique way not seen in most typical Hollywood movies. There's always something to look forward to in his films. Ever since his success with THE SIXTH SENSE, we are introduced to an unqualified talented storyteller; often hated but nevertheless one of the most underrated minds in Hollywood today.Rating: ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is not a thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The #1 Thriller Of All Time"?Yeah, Right!(spoilers)"The #1 Thriller of all time!" is how the movie, The Sixth Sense, is advertised. But is "thriller" the best way to describe this story? Certainly there are many shocking, startling scenes. However, the story seems to be more of a psychological journey, colored with melancholy and sadness than most thrillers. Granted, The Sixth Sense has many scenes that employ "scary graphics". But these graphics look like they were designed by a seven-year-old. And does the movie fit within the thriller genre when it does not have chase scenes? The closest scene would be Malcolm walking after Cole when he had missed an appointment! Not exactly startling or thrilling.Although we have had this movie for a couple of years, I had not watched it until October 29, 2005 because my little brother kept telling me how terrifying it was. I found it intriguing, but was surprised that it did not frighten me more. I even watched it again on Sunday the 30th so that I could go through and look for slip-ups on the whole "Malcolm is a Ghost" idea.The over-riding idea within this movie of Malcolm not knowing he is a ghost carried a solid emotional punch. I found myself afraid that Malcolm's wife, Anna, was cheating on him and no longer loved him. The director, M. Night Shymalyan, did an excellent job of masking what the truth was and because of this, when it all became clear at the end, it was even more tragic. Throughout the movie Malcolm was under the impression that his wife was leaving him, but in fact he was the one to have left her! He had displayed all of the symptoms of a ghost throughout the movie, but because he had been presented as a living therapist, him being a ghost was not evident. The clues were not something that the viewer would focus on until the end of the movie when Malcolm remembers what had happened the night that he was shot. I love the scene where he realizes that it was never his wife's fault that she was not talking to him, but that she was in fact still very devoted to him. She repeatedly watched the video of their wedding, and went back to the restaurant he had proposed to her in. It is a powerful scene when Malcolm comes to understand that the loneliness that he feels is about a hundred times worse for Anna because she cannot see, hear, or smell his presence any more. She just gets cold when he is angry.The graphics in this movie were simplistic and unimpressive. Scary scenes were often blurred and bloody wounds were lavishly covered in fake blood. For instance when Malcolm is shot, the camera zooms in on a clean bullet hole through the his shirt and then a growing blood stain on his back - not exactly high tech. It was evident that a hole punch was used for the shirt, with an extreme close-up to make it look bigger than it actually was, and then fake blood from a pump was used to make it look like progressive bleeding. In the scene where Vincent kills himself, they simply move him out of the range of the camera! All that is heard is a gunshot and icky, squishy sounds. And then there is the makeup used for each of the ghosts to show bruises and wounds that looked fake. When the back of the young boys head was blown off it looked like strawberry jelly slathered in his hair. And when the little girl ghost was throwing up it looked like oatmeal with yellow food coloring in it. The graphics seemed absurd and predictable to me and therefore, not very scary.Unlike most thrillers, this movie carries sweet over-tones. The child, Cole, who has the sixth sense, is successful at maintaining his innocence no matter how horrific the ghost scenes are. And when Cole finally tells his mother his big secret, that he sees dead people, it does not make her look at him any differently. She loves him just the same as she always has. Although I believe that the genre this movie was placed in was ill suited, it is still on my small list of favorite movies. It contains messages of love and the need to understand others within the context of their lives. Because of this, I will watch it over and over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A child physiologist (Bruce Willis) with a rocky marriage comes to visit a troubled boy (Haley Joel Osment) who claims to be seeing the dead.The problem with movies is that someone has always been there first. I was lucky with Psycho in that I didn't know anything about the film before I saw it - although I would have dearly loved to see it on a cinema screen. Here I was told there was a "twist" and having been warned I looked out for the clues and got them.(Not so sure I would have done if I had come in stone cold and just let it wash over me, though!) Osment - as the little eight year old boy - is a revelation. He acts like he is thirty year old dwarf rather than a child. How does he do it? When I was that age I could barely prepare a piece of toast, Osment has to carry a major motion picture by his emotions alone. Truly as good a piece of acting as I have ever seen from a pre-teen. Willis lowers his voice and tries to compete - but he is being outclassed and he knows it too!This is a throwback picture in that the threat is outside and little glimpsed. It has the best of Hitchcock and a million B's to steal from; and this includes the reverse-of-norm wide shot - rather than close in on tragedy the camera pulls back as if not to intrude. There is a car accident scene where a medium-expanding-to-long shot is used in a masterful way.There isn't a lot to write about this film beyond general platitudes about performance and moody setting. This is clever in that it never gives you too much to hang on to - no barrel chested hero about to come charging to the rescue. It wants to throw you off balance, keep you off balance, lead you to believe that it is going one way and then shots off in another.True, there is nothing really essential about this film. Nothing that is going to change your opinion on anything - not even whether there really are ghosts and people that can communicate with them.Manoj Night Shyamalam might not be Hitchcock quite yet, but at least he has learnt a few of his better tricks and has even added a few of his own.Just because it is only escapist entertainment doesn't mean that it isn't also very good. It is actually very, very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERSEvery few years there appears a certain director who creates a series of films which are heavily praised. M. Night Shyamalan is one of these directors, a man who creates these mystic, emotional thrillers which are designed to grab the attention and then reveal a sinister twist which appears obvious. In "The Sixth Sense", Shyamalan wrote and directed his first famous feature, which sadly is inferior to his later work and grinds on the skin a bit too much.In this popular film of 1999, Bruce Willis plays psychiatrist Malcolm Crowe. Treating Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), Crowe discovers a child with apparent mental problems, but who will in the end help himself and Crowe too.Perhaps the personal problem with "The Sixth Sense" is that like so many others I had the twist told to me before witnessing the film. Told on Channel Four's "Eleven O'Clock Show", I lost all chances of being shocked at the end. At the same time, this film does build up to the scene well. Even if it does appear predictable when looking back on it.On a wider scale, the key problem with this film is that Bruce Willis is not good in it. Grinding on the nerves, Willis is infuriating as the psychiatrist with apparent marital problems. Sadly he isn't alone in the awful acting.Whilst it feels entirely likely that Haley Joel Osment will one day become a first rate actor who demands ridiculous films for movies and wins countless Oscars, as a child actor, he gives off an aura of annoyance as personally I feel the urge to slap him round the face. Certain children are annoying, it's part of a childs development, but Osment is so annoying that it's a wonder he's lived to the age of sixteen. Perhaps not as bad a performance as his role of David in 2001's "Artificial Intelligence", Osment's role as Cole still causes me discomfort and makes me wish pain upon him.The question regarding "The Sixth Sense" is whether the actors or the characters are the annoying ones. Willis and Osment annoy me constantly, but Willis is often superb in different films, so potentially it could be the scripting for the character. Unlike his later films, Shyamalan seems to have written characters which are neither appealing nor interesting.Ultimately, this film is just a bit too disappointing. With intended tension, maybe it possesses this to those who have absolutely no idea of the plot before viewing, but to anyone who has even the slightest idea why this child is suffering, it suffers hideously. Improving slightly towards the end, by the time we are given one answer to our questions half way through, any interest has disappeared and the film becomes irrelevant. Shyamalan has a nice idea here, and for it to feature so highly in the internet movie database shows it appeals to some, but personally it feels slightly too monotonous and daft. Over-rated and disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(Spoilers!!!) Never understood what all the fuss was all about...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie on video a couple years back on the recommendation of a sister of mine, who was very excited about it. Towards the end of the movie (again: Spoilers!!!) as the "big twist" finally manifested itself, she looked at me expectantly with the beginning of a smile on her face.Well, as the summary line of this review makes clear, I had to disappoint her. "That was *it*?!?!?" basically sums up my reaction.All through the film, what really intrigued me was *why* Bruce's character was going through such rough times. Why was his wife ignoring him so cruelly? What had he done that was so wrong in his treatment of that patient that the guy felt he had to shoot him for it? How had Bruce's character fared after that dreadful shooting? All of those questions were answered very simply by the "startling revelation" that Bruce's character never *had* survived the shooting. Except the crazy guy's reasons. (Guess him being crazy was explanation enough, huh?)All the stuff about Osmont's character seeing ghosts and the little adventures he and Bruce had with the various apparitions were entertaining, but nothing special in my opinion.What's even worse, in my opinion, is that the big "surprise" of the movie is not even very original. A major character not realizing they're dead was part of "Ghost" (1990) as well. I remember seeing the idea in a "House of Horrors" comic (I believe it was called) in the early eighties as well.All in all "The Sixth Sense" strongly reminds me of "Twelve Monkeys" (also with Bruce Willis, also with a number in the title... hmmmm....) - More Spoilers! - a movie that basically revolved around giving the viewer the wrong impression and delighting in making clear that you had been fooled once again!I see very little of any substance in "The Sixth Sense". The "he's really a ghost!" plot twist has no relevance for Bruce's character at all, while all the little adventures with the other ghosts do not add up to much of any substance either, in my opinion.The Verdict: 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good (POSSIBLE SPOILER)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I watched this I became increasingly exasperated by its failure to go anywhere, indeed by the impossibility of its going anywhere because of the plot gimmick it saddled itself with. The gimmick is clumsily concealed, requires cheating throughout (some of which the film tries to excuse by making up its own "rules" as it goes), and was a bad idea from the outset, making the story ultimately silly. The construction of the script is deformed accordingly. And it isn't a skillful script: much of the dialogue is awkward, many of the characters' lines and actions are unprepared for and are never followed up on, and almost any moment that works superficially seems false and unfelt, and is usually contradicted by something else later on. Fortunately, the direction is better than the writing. I recall at least three good moments, all due to performances of supporting players. But the leading actors are all miscast--even the kid--and the visuals are a catalog of borrowings from other, better ghost movies. More fundamentally, this film goes against a central rule of fantasy: fantasy says openly that what is not so is so, and if the reader or viewer rejects it, so much the worse for him. It doesn't try to con its audience, to put something over on them. And I should say that that is even more true of sentimental fantasy. If it has to trick people into accepting it by impersonating a horror film (and inserting twenty minutes of one into itself so it can be sold that way), it shows scant confidence in the genre it has chosen, matching its scant skill in manipulating the conventions of that genre. Ghost didn't need to pretend to be The Shining. I like ghost stories and sentimental fantasies; this is an uncomprehending and, in my view, insincere example of both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sixth Sense is one of the best films in the century. It's a fantastic story with incredible atmosphere and a tension that won't let you at all. It has everything you'd want in a perfect and brilliant film: very good plot, fine special effects and a good performance of all the actors/actresses in the film.I must admit that Bruce Willis does a great performance, but I think the best actor in the cast crew is Haley Joel Osment. In my opinion, he does the best performance I've ever seen from a young actor. The way he acts, transmitting the feelings of Cole Sear is amazing. I think he'll win an OSCAR.So, everyone should go and see The Sixth Sense, because that is a good example how a film has to be done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, but not ingenious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a good time watching this film. It had a good plot, and the acting was definitive. This and signs, which will come out two years after this film, are the only two shyamalan films that have impressed me. The plot summed up is that an impeccable child psychologist is gunned down by one of his old patients. A year later, the psychologist appears to have made a full recovery. He meets an emotionally unstable boy, who appears to have a few mental, and social problems. After meeting the boy, he learns that he has a secret dark gift: he is able to see dead people.The acting was great. For being only 11 years old in this film, Haley Joel Osment did a fantastic job portraying an outcast, who is terrified of his own shadow. Definitely one of the more talented child actors of this era in film. Bruce Willis did a fantastic job of playing a workaholic psychologist, who is in some marital problems. His reaction to the uncovered secret at the end of the film was almost perfect, until after he calmed down. That one scene ruined his performance for almost the entire movie.The cinematography was up to par, but up to par only. It really wasn't anything game changing, or ground breaking. These are the old cinematic tricks, and I feel that these are the only thing that Shyamalan knows. Close ups, hand helds, and gods eyes over and over again. It was done well with what he had, but it was really bland after a while. Considering most people don't watch a movie for its cinematography, I can't really take off a star for that.The writing. Okay here we go. Some of you may hate me, some of you may love me. This is 16 years after the film was released. I will say that for the time, this was a good plot twist and almost something new. Just because the famous plot twist at the end was new, doesn't mean it was good. It really was kind of expected and didn't surprise me at all. We see a lot of clichs in this movie. Single mom with two jobs, emotionally unstable social outcast with a secret gift, workaholic with marriage problems, bully who is superior in every way ends up being the outcast in the end, and so on. It's fine that he uses them in his writing, but they just don't impress anyone in the end. Oh here we go again! The elephant in the room. The ending. The plot twist at the end. He was dead all along! Gasp!* but not really. Yes it was clever for him to be dead the whole time, but he made the clues too obvious. He never talks to anyone, his wife never makes eye contact, he almost always wears the same clothes, nobody acknowledges he's even there. I mean for gods sake, the dude was shot in his kidney. You pretty much knew he was dead when Cole said he saw dead people. The twist was delivered horribly as well. The ring falls on the floor. okay? So she had his ring? Who talks in their sleep like that anyways? You're telling me that in all the time that he spent away from his wife, he didn't notice that everybody was ignoring him? Nobody heard a kid talking to air since normal people can't see ghosts? This is a very noteworthy paradox that nobody seems to address. Why didn't the boy tell him that he was dead? Surely he could see that the counselor was dead, so why didn't he tell him? Why wasn't he afraid? Why was he scared when he said he was getting a new counselor? He wasn't talking to a counselor in real life anyways. Another thing, is this seriously the only case that a child psychologist deals with? You see at the beginning, he has a folder full of cases, and this is the only one he is dealing with?Overall, I think the movie was a very creative, very fun ride from start to finish. I just see lots of plot holes. This was a great film for its time, but to me, this film is not something that I will remember forever, and it is not staple in film. For the repeated plot holes, and poor clichs, I take off 3 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow! What a picture.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were so many pleasing things to concentrate on in this film. Let me see if I can recall a few.First off, that adorable child. What a remarkable job, casting that lead. He was what - only ten or so? Remarkable. And we weren't let down by the rest of the cast either. His mother was just fantastic; I don't think I've empathised with a single mother like that before. Bruce Willis, playing the child psychiatrist, really had his work cut out acting next to her, but boy did he pull it off. He really deserved that award. Good job.But credit where credit's due, without the top notch script I doubt even this cast could have pulled it off. When seriously original works like this one get green-lit you know that some people still care about bringing depth -- that only an engaging drama/thriller can -- back to our cinemas. I missed the boat on that one, but it certainly did well in my living room.Dramas can always be measured by the dizzying heights of their joy and the plunging depths of their despair. This rolling masterpiece went so far, so fast, it brought me into a state of spatial disorientation. It will hold you on the edge of your seat until gradually you shuffle back into a comfortable position. Periodically, it will make your hair stand on end until you tug it flat in bunches, wide-eyed with anticipation. There are enough sad moments too, but I won't spoil the surprise.None of this would have been possible without the groundbreaking soundtrack: it really tied the room together. Whenever I felt the uncertainty of a solitary tear the strength of sorrowful strings would fill our eyes to bursting. Gradually the brass would begin to climb... where was I being taken, how far, did anyone know, were they coming too? A sudden, sharp parp would bring us a foot not only out of our chairs, but our skins too. LOL Now you've reached my twist ending, where I can reveal that I actually felt the complete opposite of what I've written. The same catatonic slight-handedness you can expect from following this devoid centerline for two hours. Those who saw through my laboured ruse, give yourself a pat on the back and think about how you spoiled absolutely the greatest comment of all time for yourselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A hundred megabucks to Mr. Willis for this ponderous pile of celluloid psychic - psychotic? - parrot droppings? Wildly popular? Doesn't that explain why we're now richly paying for the brain-dead 1990's? Sixth Sense in one sense is prophetic. It prefigured breathtakingly dull snore-gasbord of pretentious films and TV shows in which actors make it so small they become gassily hissing statues. Whisper, whisper, whisper. Reductio ad absurdium of 'make it small' 90's method. Subtlety run to ground. Mark of manipulative hackwriters who've nothing to say. This moribund arthritic film strains constipatedly along at glacial speed like a tortoise with lumbego. Actors whisper softly, their words lost in a maelstrom of soporific hissing. No matter. They're saying nothing. Sixth Sense is cheezy manipulation exemplified. Making it small lets viewers project themselves into the action. Well and good. Make it too small, whisper interminably and what? We're privy to sacred yet uninteresting secrets of the ancients? Hidden albeit inane wisdom of the condemned?Viewing Sixth while typing. Scary? You bet. Film so boring, ready to hit Circle-K, load up on Jen &amp; Berry's High-Viscosity Frozen Cow Secretions and wash them down with bushels of Choco-Chip Suet Snaps. Goal? Induce insulin shock to forget I squandered an elegant tropical Saturday night on this beautifully photographed snore.Bituminous scenes of Willis meandering thru gutted garages are marginally interesting. Yet not even that and a compelling soundtrack can save this dreadful 90's polemic-lite. More economical and less fattening: turn in early, enjoy good night's sleep.A few minutes of this New Age Chapter 11 filing does the trick faster than flocks of sheep bearing jeroboams of ether.Paul Vincent ZecchinoManasota Key, Florida16 July, 2006"Truth leads a wretched life - and always survives the lie."- Cathy O'Brien</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So then I just felt like disclosing after a rather intense paranormal encounter that this does indeed happen to me. There is a parallel universe that your spirit can go to that is very much apparently simular to this world. I would imagine God runs one side and gods wife runs the other or in other words one is ying and one is yang. It is very difficult to know even which one you are in apparently. I cross over every once in a while out of my control entirely. It's a very difficult thing to understand even from my perspective and it appears to be sense orientated as Mr John from crossing over might have sight or sound or something he's a little elusive. I have touch for sure i know anyway. It's not all that useful to me and rather strange and a little scary for these ghosts can indeed hurt me if they want to but mostly these are just people meandering around and they have little motive to do to much harm. The other day a lady ghost I think that I have been sensing for some time rubbing paint on me pushing me once and waking me up in the morning the most vivid being me losing control of my mind and visualizing falling into the wall possibly upstairs and the wicca lady says that was possibly me reliving possibly her death then awaking and a spirit looking as a shadow running fast down stairs and being exited and rubbing while looking at me up and down my body. It wans't snowing and then I went up stairs and it was snowing hard. So it seems that she was exited about the snow and not too concerned with her death. Maybe she was old and just fell who knows.

		<fullReview>Some movies manage to scare us, and some movies manage to move us, and "The Sixth Sense" is a film that successfully does both. It took me three separate viewings to finally realize the genius of it all. I was not exactly impressed after seeing it for the first time on network television, after hearing so many good things about it. Then I stumbled into a theater playing "Signs," and I was blown away by M. Night Shyamalan's directing style, and I decided to revisit "The Sixth Sense" again and again--and finally, all in one viewing, everything struck me as a wonderful, perfect whole.The film begins ominously in the cellar of a dark house. We see Anna Crowe (Olivia Williams) wander into the basement and grab a bottle of wine. We follow her upstairs where she finds her husband, Malcolm (Bruce Willis), drunk on rich wine and admiring his newly-acquired plaque, given to him by the city of Philadelphia in honor of his work in the field of child psychology. He thinks it would look good on the bathroom wall.Then everything falls apart. Malcolm is shot by an old kid whom he failed to help. Some number of months goes by before we meet up with Malcolm again, as he walks down a street in Philly, watching Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). Cole has been having trouble at school. He seems to be haunted by something, but Malcolm is unable to place a finger on what's wrong.Then Cole tells him. He sees dead people. ("They walk around like they don't even know they're dead.") Considering Cole a sort of "do-over" for that kid he failed to help so many years ago, Malcolm makes it his personal vendetta to get to the bottom of Cole's troubles, and perhaps even face the most terrifying of all realities: the kid is telling the truth.John Travolta had "Pulp Fiction" and Willis had "The Sixth Sense." This film reanimated Willis' somewhat faltering career, and for good reason: it's one of his best performances. Sure, the fake wig gets a little tiring, but the mystery surrounding Malcolm and his interest in a patient will connect with most viewers. We're a lot like Malcolm, at first, trying to figure out what's wrong with the boy. Then, later on, we find out that we were really viewing everything through Cole's eyes.A major problem with movies about kids is that kids often can't act very well and rely on their cute, forced one-liners for audience approval. Not Haley Joel Osment (who was nominated for an Oscar due to this film). He actually acts, unlike most kids his age, which is refreshingly satisfying. He's no Macaulay Culkin--and I mean that in a good way.You may not be as scared by "The Sixth Sense" as you will be haunted. The movie connects with a primary fear of our inner psyches that we all experience starting as early as childhood: the supernatural. A realm where rules of the mortals do not apply. There's a sort of satisfaction in knowing that only so many things can happen in this world that we live in. We know there's a limit as to what can appear before us, or what restrictions apply. But anything could be possible in a separate realm, and that is what most supernatural horrors miss. They mistake true nail-biting fear for creepy images of ghosts. M. Night Shyamalan doesn't. He strikes a chord with the audience by respecting them more than that.Shyamalan is a self-confessed Steven Spielberg fan, and also admitted that Spielberg was a huge influence on all his films. I'm not too terribly surprised. Indeed, "The Sixth Sense" carries a sort of elegant structure that some of Spielberg's early features such as "Duel" and "JAWS" contained--some sort of majesty about the curiosity of it all. We never saw the truck driver; we rarely saw the shark (and when we finally did it was truly startling); and here the supernatural overtones of the movie carry a sort of otherworldly mystery that this genre often lacks. I can see how "The Sixth Sense" may have been ample straight-to-video effort. A kid who sees ghosts. It's not exactly brilliantly conceived.But its execution and surprise ending (that almost everyone knows about by now and few actually guessed ahead of time) are what make "The Sixth Sense" something more than just another supernatural thriller. It's more of a tender, subtle character piece with spiritual overtones. Shyamalan has created an eerie second presence in the movie that is a lot scarier than showing ghosts parade about. "Signs" wasn't about aliens. "The Sixth Sense," despite what people tell you, is not *really* about ghosts. I think that's part of what makes it engage the viewer, and seem so very intriguing, even to this day. After setting a groove for films of the genre to later follow (and knock-off), "The Sixth Sense" stands strong and proud and strikingly different. You have to admire both its ambition and respect for the audience, two fundamental elements of which are often lacking in many of today's motion pictures.5/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low rent but high cost version of the "Twilight Zone" or "The Outer Limits"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caution -- contains spoilersSuspense? What suspense? The twists are so predictable and the plot so thin that it almost seemed that the script was nothing but an outline for a bad episode of the Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits. In the last part of the film I half expected the ghost of Rod Serling to appear and say 'Been there, Done that'. The so-called twist at the end is easy to predict and is something that would happen in a script written by fifth graders to scare each other in summer camp. The characters are trite to the point that Mr. Shyamalan should pay royalties to other filmmakers.A new hyped ?Genius? has been anointed. This movie puzzled me because of the hype around it. The question is how such a sub-standard movie can become such a hit with audiences and critics. Is the quality of the product from the studios so bad that this predictable, hackneyed film can be considered art? Apparently so because most the votes here on IMDB are way above 7.The acting is a mixed bag of okay to really bad. Mr. Willis can act and has in such films as The Kid, The Fifth Element, and The Story of Us, not to mention Moonlighting but in this film and the other waste of film stock Unbreakable his talent was not needed. I kept wondering during this film if Mr. Willis?s performance was so stiff because he thought he should play dead through the whole film or if perhaps acting with such a bad kid actor as Mr. Osment caused massive boredom. Ms. Williams is pretty but underutilized in this film. Ms. Collette can also act but again she had to act in scenes with Mr. Osment. This kid was really bad in this film with zero charm or screen charisma and even worse in AI. I kept waiting for his charactor to be killed in a really gruesome manner to add some sort of emotional spark to the movie. If Mr. Osment wants to stay in the business perhaps some acting lessons would help but it?s doubtfull.Rated 1 out of 10. Don't lose 2 hours of your life to this movie.For real suspense and great acting from everyone try Blood Simple from the Coen brothers. It will really surprise even the most jaded movie fan.</fullReview>

"I see dead people"...and..,.what's your point, we knew that from the trailers. This piece of crap movie is such a piece of crap. The acting was great, but the litttle boy crying throughout the whole movie p**sed me off, except when he told off the teacher. The blair witch had diiferent elements, this movie had the same one's. AND IT WASN"T EVEN SCARY!!!!!!!! I don't even know how people found this scary, it was just two hours of non-sense. And the jump scenes in the movie didn't provide any jolt for me since, yet again, it was featured in the trailers. TAKE IT FROM ME, you want to see a good SCARY movie, see "blair witch" because that will stick to your mind. this was stupid</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I swear, this movie is the most god-awful creation I have seen since I had to review "Holy Man" for my school paper. Osment did a good job though as a small kid having to deal with seeing dead people. When it comes to Bruce Willis, any role that doesn't include a gun, grenade, or explosion is beyond him. I warn you, do not contribute money to this film in any way, shape, or form, as it only encourages more new filmmakers to produce this kind of drivel. If you still feel the need to see this, drive over to your friend's, and do not chip in for the pay-per-view. After you sit through it, I have no doubt you'll even want him to reimburse you for the gas you burned on the way to and from his house.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched the most pointless movie of my life. I'm gonna make this really short.This movie has no plot what so ever. This guy dies and his spirit stays alive so he can help people.( which takes almost the whole movie to get to ) and there's this freaky KID who is scarier than anything in the world. that does noting except help other dead people. and takes like the whole movie to get to that point.so in the end you have almost 2hrs of your life wasted to get to this stupid point. and the point is when you die your going to have to help people or some idiotic thing.the scary parts of the movie are sooo pointless i don't even get it the kid sees dead people for like 90% of the movie. and than Bruce Willis releases his dead!! ONLY TOKE 2HRS OF MY LIFE TO GET TO THATITS SOOOOO SLOW MOVING THEY TAKE 10SECONDS IN BETWEEN EACH LINE TO GET OUT WHAT THEY WANNA SAY !!IM SO angry at this i cant believe its rated 8.2! out of 10sorry about my spelling and grammar im not that good of a writer but i know good movies when i see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Beginning of the End (of good horror films)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank you, M. Night, for beginning the trend of PG-13 horror flicks. You know what I mean, the movies that come out every quarter and are gonna be the "hottest scare fest" of the season. Of course, It'd be great if we could just leave out the part about this film and it's predecessors choosing to appeal to jumpy amphetamine-laced 13 year old girls that shriek hysterically whenever a loud noise plays on screen. It would be just peachy if the fact that ever since this film, the scare factor of most modern horror films makes Goosebumps look positively horrifying, could be ignored. Unfortunately, it can't. What we have here is a "modern-horror classic", and indeed, it has all the makings of one. It brought horror filmaking to a new level, the "I wonder how many sixth graders will jump when we play that jump sound and something pops up on screen". It brought the career of rising star "I see dead people" to astonishing heights (shudders). It also got studio executive interested in the horror genre again. Too bad the genre become so badly butchered that it's practically unrecognizable. So, on to the film. The story is about a young boy who can see dead people. It's also about his shrink, who is trying to help the boy get through his "dillusions". Of course, as we see right away, the kid really does see dead people, and what follows is the kid wandering around seeing dead people, and the shrink wondering why, until the "unpredictably and surprising" twist ending. Ah the twist ending, yet another technique in film that the Sixth Sense transformed from original to clich. The pacing of the film is repetitive and dull, and the directors laziness when bringing "scares" to the screen is appalling. My score for this film, while abysmal, does not reflect it's production values. The acting, cinematography, and special effects are all top notch. So why such a low score? Well, put simply, this film was responsible for a crumbling away at a fantastic genre; a genre that was called "horror" for a reason: it's supposed to be scary.Enter my feelings on the entire "PG-13" genre of horror flicks. The rating limits the possibilities of the filmmaker so much, that fear can never incubate within the viewers mind. It takes disturbing images, characters, mood, and shock, to truly scare most viewers. Simply isolating the "shock part", and cutting out the rest may sell a lot of tickets to 13 year olds, but that doesn't convince me that these films are any good. I understand that, as a filmmaker and fan of the genre itself, I can be a little jaded when it comes to horror. Maybe the reason I thought "Boogeyman" sucked was because I'm immune to terror, and that movie really was scary. But for some reason, I doubt that. Good cinema, for me, is about pushing the envelope of human emotion. If it's a romantic comedy, and it's not funny or romantic, it's not a good romantic comedy. And if a horror film is not scary, it defies what the genre is supposed to be. Therefore, as a fan of horror, I am disappointed with this film and the trend of films it started.In one final note, I would just like to thank Asian cinema for not backing down. Films like Audition and Ju-On continue to push the envelope and create truly terrifying worlds for the viewer. And this is a warning to Sam Raimi. I loved the Evil Dead movies, but if you try to ruin another great Asian film by having it remade, you'll be hearing from me.</fullReview>

Sixth Sense is about as cliche a thriller as can ever be- disturbed kid, hated by others, draws violent pictures in school and has touch with the supernatural. I really don't understand the hype on this one. Couple of quality scary images, but basically just a bunch of psycho-drama. This should have been titled 'The Shining II- Danny moves to Philly and gets therapy just to learn he and the therapist are dead.' Semi-interesting film, though Mr. M.

		<fullReview>This isn't such a good film. I think one of the reasons it has achieved such popularity is because critics everywhere decided to write it as being brilliant. Viewers think they should love it, so they agree to. I can remember sitting in a theatre several months ago and being very disappointed in this film. The Blair Witch Project did a lot more for me. Willis does not do all that great of job in it. The kid (his name fails me) does. The script was OK. The directing was actually poor. I won't give away the end, for the two or three people who have yet to see it, but I will say that the director gives it away by the end of the second act. When I went to see it, I knew how it would end with about a half hour left. This disappointed me. The thing was blocked poorly and the camera could have been used more effectively to keep the viewer in the dark. The thing felt like it was shot before it was really fully conceptualized. Also, there were many moments where I found myself wanting the film to be more graphic and frightening than it was. I get the feeling they were aming to get the PG-13 from start to finished. This hurt the film.Not the worst thing I've ever seen, but disappointing non the less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being involved in the industry and having read so much about this film for several months, I have to say that it is a great disappointment. Bruce Willis was badly miscast. With so many close-ups the part needed an actor with a greater range who can convey tension subtly and convincingly and not the one dimensional comic book action hero looks with the acting ability of a turnip. Bruce Willis trying ever so hard to be restrained is like torture to watch. Even the much-hyped ending is not so difficult to predict. Too many sub-plots with the dead people cropping up here and there with little point except to try and scare the audience - a hand shooting out from under a table - is all old hat. Stephen King fans will be underwhelmed, and as Hitchcock might have said, it is too slow and lacks humour. Seriously Dull!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's one of those movies in which several key characters would have to be stupid, or laughably inattentive, to behave the way they do, and in which the director repeatedly has to cut away from certain scenes and move hastily on, in the hope that we won't notice. Cheap trick. There were a couple of well-executed startles, which are always fun, and the drizzly autumnal atmosphere was just right. Bruce Willis is his usual smirky self. The little boy is very good. The "surprise" was figured out in the following order, according to the people involved: my 15-year-old-son (the movie maven in the family), right after the opening sequence; myself, about 15 minutes in; my wife, a couple of scenes before the truth comes out at the end; my 13-year-old daughter, when we explained it to her on the way out to the car.</fullReview>

If anyone in this entire cast receives an Oscar, I will know that the awards are fixed. Did anyone get the feeling that this movie is ONLY about the ending (not even an original one), and they were jerked around for an hour and a half previous just to get to the lame ending? How this movie can be considered one of the best movies of the year by some is far beyond me. This should have been an episode of an X-Files ripoff and not a full-length motion picture. Please don't misconstrue one or two "shock" gore scenes as scary OR intense. And the so-called "amazing" twist ending is not worth the price of admission.

		<shortDescription>Ghost meets Little Man Tate: A dull movie concerned more with "family values," and happy endings than with entertaining its audience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boring, dull sentimental tripe--sadly it will be immensely popular because of this. An example of Hollywood's ability to take an interestingly dark plot and water it down with a touchy-feely child-pathos vehicle. One can really smell Disney's stinking hand behind this. Once young Cole realizes that he is merely a helper-monkey to the ghosts, he returns to his role in society, becoming popular, and beating out a child actor and schoolmate for the lead in a play. Clumsy and heavy-handed.The film also contains a surprise ending that may be surprising to some, but seems extremely tacked-on and poorly handled. You can almost see the pitch for this one, "its like 'Ghost' meets 'Little Man Tate,' with just a little bit of 'Seven's' atmospherics thrown in for color. Sadly, the film's melange does not live up to even one of its parent films (with the exception of maybe the worst moments of 'Ghost').This film is a testament to the dullness of the American thriller at the moment. The ghosts in the film are about as terrifying as the homeless people you'd see on a trip to New York, the tone of the film is unjustly gloomy, and the plot is so formulaic that, in instances, you can see its chemical symbols peeking through. See this only if you like cheap sentiment, mild fear, and a heartwarming, stomach-turningly sweet ending. Otherwise, see Blair Witch, which is a better example of of the power of horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a stupid movie. I cannot believe that this movie is considered #100 on the top 250. I had this movie pegged in 25 minutes, right down to the realization that Willis' character was dead. There were certainly some interesting subplots, but I still found this movie to be utterly pointless and essentially self-congratulatory in its "brilliance". On the plus side, I did think Haley Joe Osment did a fantastic job as the gifted little tyke. But aside from that, I did not find most of the acting to be particularly strong, and I apologize but a little kid's acting cannot save this movie. I just don't understand how a movie as simple as this can be considered "great", especially when you can't watch the movie more than once and enjoy it! However, that seems to be the norm, considering how great Se7en was considered as well (another movie that I just figured out in the first half hour.) Overdone, over-hyped, over-primed, this movie will be forgotten in a few years while the truly great films live on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everybody's favourite "intelligent" horror/mystery-thriller, with everybody's favourite twist ending. You already know the story, so I'll fast-forward directly to the bashing.Shyamalan fancies himself a great artist, not content with "only" telling a story. Fair enough. The last positive thing I will say in this review is that he has a keen eye for cinematography, if nothing else. Unfortunately, pretty pictures and "art shots" are not enough to make a good director, or film, and cinematography is indeed the movie's actual preoccupation. Manoj deliberately tries to carve out visual trademarks by over-staging every scene, and this takes up a large part of the near two hours. The colour red is seen here and there, carrying "symbolic significance". A good director would spend his time inspiring his actors to pass for human beings, but then again, Mr. Night might not be a good director. Few characters in his pictures actually behave like real people.And acting here is non-existent. A vacuum. In Shyamalan's other movies, at least people appear to be reading from scripts. Now, Bruce Willis is one of the few remaining action stars with trace amounts of Y-chromosomes, and has charisma enough to carry a movie, but his talents for "subtle" drama like this are somewhat yonder. Frankly, I can't think of a less suitable actor for this kind of role (child psychologist). Sure enough, within the first five minutes we are treated to a prolonged shot of an award plaque, with Willis' wife actually spelling out for us the superlatives it contains. This is so that we'll know that Willis' character is "brilliant". Manoj misunderstood the concept of "show, don't tell", a fundamental narrative tool, which means that Willis shows us his brilliance through his actions, not by bluntly telling us "he's brilliant!". Low class there, but it gets even worse.The kid does nothing but whisper through the entire movie. This is his brilliant, Oscar-nominated acting? Other than that, people sit around a lot, broods a lot, whispers some more. The kid sees dead people everywhere, which gives rise to a bunch of "scary moments" (with loud music playing every time a closet door suddenly opens, or whatever), but without actually advancing the story. They're just there for cheesy "Boo! I bet you didn't see THAT coming!" effects that were old news in the '70s already. The entire middle half of the movie is superfluous and could be cut out, since it seems to have little to do with the framing device, which is Willis' character. Really, time has never moved slower than when watching this movie.As for weak horror, the kid actually states early on that the ghosts are looking for "help" rather than haunting or causing mischief. OK, so there is not even a threat of harm? Then what is the point of having scene after scene with "made you jump!"-scares, when our beloved heroes are not even in danger at any one point? I'll tell you the point, the point is to water down the "horror" genre to be suitable for children, which ideally will broaden the revenue base. Producers didn't take long to understand this, and now this kind of diaper horror is the norm.Plot holes abound. The biggest is that Willis' dead character doesn't notice, until the very end of the movie, that nobody except the boy (who is some kind of medium) interacts with him. Willis meets with the kid in a professional context, but who made the appointment with Willis, if he was already dead? The kid himself? I don't THINK so. Later, Willis has been let into the house of the boy's mother, and the mother is actually sitting there next to him. They never interact. Yet we are to believe that Willis was let into the house and seated, and neither greeted nor was seen by the kid's mother, who was SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO HIM AT THE START OF THE SCENE. Yet another scene has dead Willis eating dinner with his wife. Apparently, they didn't speak to each other, and Willis didn't notice this? Manoj tricks the audience here, by having the wife talk to herself in such a manner that it APPEARS that she is talking to Willis.There are enough absurdities here to build a ladder to the moon, which M. Night and his fanboys have tried to justify with the cop-out notion that "Willis only sees what he wants to see". Neat, isn't it? Sure spares Shyamalan the effort of wrapping up the mess he created. Suffice it to say that the perhaps most telling sign of a director's incompetence is that he has to cheat his audience in order to keep the story together. Even Spielberg, the devil's handpicked lieutenant on earth, doesn't resort to this low form of audience manipulation.Personally, I find that movies that rely on gimmick twists, as opposed to honest atmosphere and ACTING, do not hold up to repeated viewings. Even if your IQ is likely to turn up on a craps roll, and you DIDN'T see the twist coming, how can you watch this hogwash over again KNOWING what will be the big surprise? The disturbing part is that millions of drugged lemmings actually DID go to see this movie a second time, to pick up all the clues that made them miss the finale the first time around. The nightman got rich, and invested his efforts in another triumphant masterpiece, "Unbreakable".Here's my screenplay: Bruce Willis gets shot. Dies. The end. Osment and Manoj remain unknown.Shyamalan is a disease. I've seen a number of his movies just to reassure myself, and the man is a complete criminal. I am on a crusade, and I will not rest until he is indicted for his offences against art, taste and logic.Lowest possible rating.</fullReview>

His cheesy, weak line delivery was unbearable, as the directors felt that through a quite kid in the mix, and everyone will overlook everything else. Where Stir of Echos gave your characters to root for, against, and others who you actually got concerned about, the Sixth sense gave us empty throw away people whom we really could care less if they died, lived, or anything else. Bruce Willis, who has smartly rebounded since with Sin City and Hostage, seemed that he was hell bent on making a movie bad enough to make everyone forget about the Ishtar of the 90's Armageddon. The film was badly done, from storyline (a mention of the plot holes would generally take up an entire page on the IMDb site), to a false twist ending. You want to know how the story ends. I'll save you the trouble. Go to a music store, and look at the title of the last track on the film's soundtrack. They give away the ending right THERE!!!! M.Night himself rebounded with Signs, but this will forever remain his worth effort, even if he makes Child's Play 7.

		<fullReview>I have yet to see Unbreakable, but judging from The Sixth Sense, I'm guessing it's going to be another mixing of good movies from the past in an attempt to make a good modern movie. My recommendation for anyone who has the urge to see The Sixth Sense, or anyone who will read this and say "That Burke guy's wacked, he doesn't know what he's talking about": Watch these two movies- Jacob's Ladder, with Tim Robbins, and The Shining, with Jack Nicholson. Combine the two excellent movies, and mix it up a tiny little bit, and you get a sub-par movie. The Sixth Sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though this movie had plenty of expensive glitter, an excess of on-screen whispering, coupled with an excess of flashbacks, rendered the plot next to impossible to figure out. But then again, maybe that was the producer's point, to get us to return again and again until we have it all sorted out. Therefore, I also give it 1 point.</fullReview>

It ended too fast and it felt like there was so much to it missing/unexplained. The PG-13 rating also hurt it alot (obviously it got rated as such because it revolved around, well, a kid!) because it put a stranglehold on what they could/were willing to do with the film. It was obviously scenes were missing from a more detail, R-rated cut. THIS IS THE DIRECTION HORROR MOVIES ARE HEADED IN??? Oh man, first Scream, the I Know What You Did Last Summer, now this??? The genre will NEVER recpature it's glory from the late-70's and early-80's, due in part that nobody is willing to make them in that wonderful, amazing fashion were no holds were barred, no rules were set.

		<fullReview>I'd heard a lot about this movie, so was looking forward to seeing it, especially the supposedly 'amazing' twist. Shortly into it, however I worked out the twist which was so obvious I couldn't believe that was it. The rest of the film lumbered on extremely slowly. The music was completely over the top, it was inappropriate to a lot of the scenes. There seemed to be sub plots which did not fit in with the rest of the movie. All in all, quite a painful viewing experience. I seriously do not understand what all the fuss about this movie was, maybe I missed something but I doubt it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A surprise hit of the year, and completely undeserving attention at that. The plot of this slow-building horror-noir, heavily drawing on cult classics like the certain 1980 movie directed by the late, great Stanley Kubrick, is not without merits, courtesy of a poignant treatment of a disturbed, misunderstood child prodigy. The supernatural elements of the film, on the other hand are contrived to such extremes that they are not believable at all and lack the power to truly frighten. Bruce Willis, as the child psychologist with a tough case and an unhappy marriage, should be given proper credit for restrained, realistic acting. But neither he, nor his gifted young patient can fix the holes in the scenery, which, if properly scrutinized, will reveal inexcusable and ludicrous inconsistencies. The consistently solemn, dour tone set to painfully conventional "gloomy suspense" music, does not improve the picture either; and the so-called "surprise ending" which everyone seems to be so fascinated with, makes VERY LITTLE SENSE if given sufficient thought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Why-o Earth- did almost everyone think this was a great movie?" ( warning! spoiler)Come on; with the exception of a few good aspects ( the astonishing end and Osment's performance as Cole ), this was actually a bad movie. Not very bad, but bad!First of all, despite the wonderful plot, which is absolutely convenient to make a very spectacular movie, Shyamalan does not seem to have been able to make use of his "own" screenplay very cleverly. Consequently, the movie which could have been much more breathtaking became unreasonably boring; indeed boring almost all the time!! While watching the movie, I became so bored that I wondered whether that was the real "The Sixth Sense" people were praising all the time! Moreover, I do not approve of Shyamalan's Oscar nomination for the best director; anyone else would have been a nominee due to that wonderful screenplay!As for the acting, I liked Osment's worth-seeing performance, which is one of the few good aspects of this movie.Also, Colliette was outstanding as Cole's mother. But that's all OK with the cast; I especially disliked Bruce Willice's performance as Malcolm Crowe. Actually, he must have played more enthusiastically since he was the leading character. Besides, his face did NOT go with the character of Malcolm Crowe. I am sure that anyone else would have played much better than him. For instance, Robin Williams would have been a perfect choice for this role!Finally,the music was VERY poor; so poor that I had not seen any movie the music of which was poorer than this one! So ask yourself; would you have liked the movie if the end had not been so astonishing? A movie should be charming from the beginning to the end; not in the end, only!!! 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot believe the acclaim this movie has gotten, nor that so many people were surprised by its ending. Wow, Bruce Willis was dead the whole time, who would have thunk it.Shyamanalangianamam locked himself in a corner with the plot. Here he had a dead guy walking around who could only be seen by one little boy, but it had to look like he was talking with other people. So, we get Willis being ignored by his wife at a restaurant. Any other husband would have started to get suspicious when his wife also didn't acknowledge his existence when he got home that night or woke up the next morning...Then there's the scene where it appears that Willis was talking with the kid's mom. Only he can't...because he's dead.Every scene in this movie in which Willis appears to be interacting with another human is a cheat. I mean, come on, how stupid do you have to be to realize that the only person who acknowledges your existence is a kid who sees dead people!! It's bad enough that we're supposed to be shocked by the realization that Willis has been dead this whole time. But it's simply ludicrous for Willis himself to be shocked. Although, I do believe that Bruce Willis could be shocked in real life. After all, he's far too stupid and narcissistic to admit that any reality other than his own--Bush is a better President than Clinton, the Iraq war is going well, etc,--actually exists.If you think this movie is deserving of being listed as one of the 250 best movies of all time, do yourself a favor and take another look. Only this time pay attention to how the director cheats his audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe this movie got an 8 out of 10 score. This whole movie was completely unbelievable. I know you need to have an imagination, but too much is required for this one. Why do I say this? The whole movie Bruce Willis is apparently dead, and is a ghost. You don't find this out until the end of the movie which is when Bruce Willis found out. He is able to have conversations with his wife while he is a ghost for an entire year and not figure out that he is dead? How can such conversations occur? They can't! There is no way possible that he could have gone an entire year and have these conversations with his wife. Conversations like Bruce Willis would ask a question and his wife would conveniently be thinking about the same topic and speak out loud and give an answer while not aware that Bruce Willis was there talking to her. How come Bruce Willis who is supposed to be dead doesn't have any wounds on him like the other dead people do? Why isn't the kid afraid of Bruce Willis like he is afraid of the other dead people? I think the only reason why so many people give this crap such a high rating is because they are just fascinated with the subject of ghosts. What a retarded movie. Too much imagaination required for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say I am not a fan generally of M Night Shyamalan's films, but I absolutely loved The Sixth Sense. It is a beautifully made film with an afterlife that is anything but angels and harps, and the score has lots of subtlety and atmosphere to it. The script is chilling, intelligent and poignant and the story complete with a knockout twist ending(easily the best and only wholly believable ending of Shyamalan's movies) is simplicity at its finest. Shyamalan's direction is wonderfully controlled, which is exactly what the story needed. Haley Joel Osment gives perhaps his best performance here, though he's superb in AI too, while Toni Collette plays the troubled mum very convincingly and Bruce Willis is suitably quiet and reflective. Overall, a wonderful film and Shyamalan's best by a mile in my opinion. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am making 100% sure I don't in any way reveal the surprise twist in this film--too many have and I think those people are evil. So, if you know THE twist, you'll probably not enjoy the film nearly as much when you first see it. But, if you haven't, it's a heck of an enjoyable film.Haley Joel Osment delivers a truly amazing performance considering his age. He is THE reason the film works as well as it does and I wish the Oscar folks had given him some sort of special award to honor his great work. And, in addition, I can't believe I am saying this, but Bruce Willis and the director, M. Night Shyamalan, were at the top of their game as well. The other huge star here is the writing--and it was superb because it was so original, creative and the story bears many repeated viewings as each one reveals yet another layer of complexity.By the way, while nominated for six Oscars, the movie somehow won none. Instead, the darkly cynical "American Beauty" carried off five of the trophies--though I really didn't think this winner was nearly as good a movie. Good, yes...but not great like "The Sixth Sense"....provided some moron didn't tell you THE secret.</fullReview>

All the kid did was sit in a corner, cry and say 'I see Dead People' and cry some more. And not to mention 'Long Unnecessary Pauses' makes another appearance here. (See Traffic review). And COME ON! The egomaniac director just HAD to make a cameo as a doctor.. for what? NO PLOT addition at all! He just HAD to stick his face in the film. He asks the mother if she beat the kid, when we all KNOW she didn't.. did he think that was a unique plot twist? Ye gods! Ok I will admit the final twist did get me. But really folks.. it's a creampuff of a twist when compared to the Usual Suspects or the japanese film, Audition (1999). I just think the general public is easily amused and everything is more intelligent than them, so they easily say "wow that was so innovative!"Watch more movies people!

Please watch the original first before you give all the praise to THE SIXTH SENSE. Furthermore, I don't think Bruce Willis is convincing at all as a "brilliant" child psychiatrist. The only really good point about this mainstream spooker is Haley Joel Osment. He shows how good child actors, unlike all the Macaulay Culkin's of this world, COULD be.

The story/plot, if there even was one, totally escaped me. There was nothing suspenseful or thrilling about this movie; in fact, I felt like going to sleep throughout the movie.

If IMDb allowed for a "0" rating, this movie would get it. I just hope that reporting that there is nothing to "spoil" is not considered by IMDb as a "spoiler."

As of this writing (10-02-99), the average vote of my fellow IMDb members for this movie is a weighted average of 8.8. I cannot understand this score, at all.If you agree, or disagree, with my opinion of this movie, please feel free to tell me what you think--I could be wrong.

		<shortDescription>Unadulterated Trite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a one-trick pony that's far more nag than it is thoroughbred and would be more effective as a half-hour episode of The Outer Limits. Any potential suspense is nullified in the opening 15 minutes, when it is explained that the apparitions seen by Haley Joel Osment's character are appealing to him for assistance, rather than having any sinister intentions. Therefore, no matter in what manner the spectres appear, the audience has already been made aware that no harm is intended to the major character and that to classify the film as a horror is wide of the mark, as no threat or danger is present in any scene. This leads the audience to then cogitate on the big "twist" which is central to the plot (and I would even go so far as to say that it is the only plot in the whole turgid affair). I'm afraid to say that I worked this out within the first half an hour, leading to an excruciating remainder of the film, where it is consistently rammed down your throat that the kid sees dead people, the kid helps dead people and that Brucey's character is seen by the kid. Even my friend (who I went to the cinema with) who didn't work out the ending said that it was unadulterated trite, so I should thank him for my summary line, as I couldn't have expressed this film in a single phrase any better than this. Anyone who finds this film even remotely scary, complex, or views it as a classic psychological horror clearly needs to watch a Hitchcock film and try to raise their intellectual standards above a primary school (6th grade) level. On the plus side, I thought the cinematography was excellent, so kudos to you Tak Fujimoto. Oh, and if you can't work out the "surprise ending" after reading this review, you're exactly the sort of person that will find this film thoroughly entertaining!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler minefield...Between Hitchcock and Rod Serling, our culture has lost something. I admit it, when I was young I tried watching every 'Twilight Zone' episode and learned something that some modern Hollywood writers still haven't caught on to.I hate obvious twists like this movie because it is totally unimaginative. The premise is simple: a 2 hour film about a boy who sees dead people. Make us sit through said film and experience Osment's unbearable acting and silly shock scenes.Then in the end, poke us in the eye and say "Ha ha, it was all a farce. Bruce Willis was really dead all along." As if a thousand episodes of what Rod Serling wrote 50 years ago hasn't prepared us for that.If the film provides its twists earlier enough to have fun with them ('Fight Club') or leaves itself open for new twists ('The Wall', 'Usual Suspects') I can have some fun with it. Instead, Shyamalan wants to be Spielberg and have everything open-and-shut but the material demands otherwise.So, Willis is dead and that's the end of it. Case closed, he ceases to exist. That this is in the IMDb Top 100 is beyond belief.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The line that the poster below mentions may explain why Bruce Willis does not see other ghosts, etc. (SPOILER) But it DOES NOT explain how he "lived" for a year without wondering why nobody could SEE HIM! He lived for a year without ANYONE ever speaking to him? Without EVER trying to say anything to his wife besides "are you gonna get that?" I don't buy it. The twist ending is implausible, no matter how you slice it.Furthermore, the romantic sub-plot is once again underdeveloped and secondary, just a filler for the erroneous twist ending. We could've seen a little more development of the lack of their marriage (showing how he was inhumanly busy for a year, etc.)The script was recycled from "The Shining", a much better film as far as acting, cinematography, music, development of the characters, and most other aspects go. Save your money and rent that classic instead of this fluff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tedious and predictable supernatural "thriller"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING - IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING OF THIS FILM READ NO FURTHER!The Sixth Sense was hyped as a supernatural thriller with an unexpected twist. Well once you know the boy can see and speak to the dead - which you know from the trailers - the ending is predictable from the first five minutes. And there are enough clues for anyone. But the idea that the Bruce Willis character could go for a year and realise that he was dead (whoops! did I spoil the ending for anyone?) is just plain ludicrous. Didn't he notice that everyone - not just his wife was ignoring him? Besides these stupidities the film was slow and dull, and about as scary as an episode of The Munsters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Major disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it really hard to believe that one could highly regard this film given its MAJOR inconsistencies. The idea around which the movie is built is original indeed; it takes, however, a lot more attention to detail to avoid turning it into a major disappointment--which is what actually happened in this particular case. Again, it doesn't take an extremely picky attitude and/or personality to spot the huge incoherencies that plague it from almost the very beginning. Just like in the case of "The Others," illustrating the interference between the realms of the living and the dead turns out to be a very hard thing to do as long as one doesn't give up the requirement of a minimal compliance with elementary logic, and an elementary critical spirit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a very despicable movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film was released, I thought it was going to be scary and a lot of fun. But after I saw it, I thought to myself, what was M. Night Shyamalan thinking? This movie is slow paced, has bad acting, it is boring, not suspenseful, not scary, a waste of time and downright despicable. Watching this movie is like watching your laundry tumble in the dryer for two hours. That is how much I despise this film and that is how boring and slow paced it is. However I have to give kudos off to Bruce Willis for his role in this film. I thought he was the only actor who did very well in this film. If you want to see a really scary movie, I would recommend Event Horizon or The Hills Have Eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only spectacular if you're not a horror buff who's seen old ghost movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not the biggest Shyamalan fan by any means. Of his entire body of work, only The Village and Unbreakable really stand out when originality is concerned, and they're really the only two of his movies that I've enjoyed. The major problem with The Sixth Sense is, who would have guessed, unoriginality. There is nothing?minus the plot twist, I guess?that makes this stand apart from the thousands of other kid-seeing-ghosts movies that came out before it. If you've consider yourself a horror fan, and one that has seen a good selection of ghost movies, you know everything that happens here. And I mean everything.However, there is some good. Mainly being that The Sixth Sense was one of the few groundbreaking American horror films?and yes, it is drama/horror, not a thriller?that brought some weight to the genre. While the majority of horror films in the '90s just focused on cheesy scares, Shyamalan focused on fine detailed, believable, high-quality scares that made the genre cinematic and not just laughable. With that said, The Sixth Sense, like most horror movies, just isn't very scary. A lot like the original Saw was a thriller set in a horror universe, The Sixth Sense is a drama set in a horror universe.That brings out a lot of problems, however. For one, The Sixth Sense follows the same clich formula a lot of Stephen King novels do: heavy doses of drama, with short bursts of horror scattered throughout. That just makes the already deeply unoriginal movie feel even worse because it makes it very boring. The attention to detail I mentioned above as a complement is also a major complaint.Shyamalan's directing/writing skills are both probably both at their best here on a technical level (if you ignore the unoriginality). There wasn't a single shot in the movie that wasn't effectively done, and the plot is laid out well. The plot twist ending brought the plot twist ending into the mainstream, and it's very well done, but still a little clich. The plot twist has been used in a lot of urban legends before, as well, if I remember right, on The Twilight Zone a few times.So, in the end, it just left me with mixed feelings. On one hand I want to praise the movie for being so well done, but on the other hand I want to trash it for the lack of anything that sets it overall apart from every other ghost story out there. Everything was so predictable.Let this be a lesson to all of you who say a movie can be a good movie even if it's unoriginal: you're wrong. Without originality, you're just left with no mystery, and just left feeling: "Eh, whatever. Didn't I see that before somewhere?" And that last thought is exactly my final opinion on the insanely overrated The Sixth Sense. But at least it wasn't as godawful as The Happening, right? 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I thought this movie was well made and featured strong acting, I can't exactly agree with what most other people are saying about the ending. Frankly, I saw it coming a mile away, and there were just too many clues leading up to it, although I won't reveal any specifics for those of you who haven't seen this film yet. It's a 7/10 movie, but it would rate higher if I didn't know what was going to happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People are probably going to write abuse files about my comment, but at least read it first. First off I don't really like M. Night Shyamalan's films. They don't scare me at all, i've seen enough horror movies to know when the "scary" moments and clichs are coming, and sometimes the characters can be pretty stupid. I saw the Sixth Sense when i was only SEVEN, which was the time i was scared of a lot of stuff. When i went to bed that night, i didn't lose an inch of sleep. How it can be in the top 250, i don't know. The "twist" ending was no surprise, i kinda saw it coming. no person can be able to still walk around living after getting shot a million times by a psychotic person. The little boy was seriously annoying. he was always walking around like a ghost, and while it was "scary" for some people, to me it looked like he was drunk. some scenes aren't totally original either. while i was watching, i had this feeling in a few scenes, like "What movie was that from?" or "deja vu". and a few days later i happened to watch "Tobe Hooper's Poltergeist" again and realized what i was talking about. that scene where all the cabinets and drawers are opened is a huge, slap-in-the-face reference to Poltergeist. Also the scenes where the rooms get colder when the dead and unholy are near reminds me of another certain film in the Top 250 that exceeds this film by all standards.BOTTOM LINE: if you're looking for a decent ghost/supernatural being story, see Poltergeist or The Exorcist. If you like Shymalan's films, i can't say i agree with you, but whatever. that's my opinion. 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To all the people who loved the ending, I must say that it is carved off from a well-known horror-film "Dead And Buried", which i recommend much more. I can't say that 6th Sense was a very bad movie, although the characters are rather simplistic. The thing that is good in the film is the off-hollywood dark and depressing atmosphere which is also presented in Unbreakable (a recommended film despite the lame ending titles).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a piece of garbage. This movie was 1 hr, 40 mins long. It felt like 3 hours. Not scary. Plot holes you can drive a truck through. And BOOOOOOOOORING as all hell. So it had a twist ending--big deal--the thing was completely tacked on. The plot of the movie ended and you had to wait 15 more mins for the big "surprise."Oh well, I suppose this is advice for me in my screenwriting career. Come up with a bunch of crap for 2 hours, put a twist ending in, and a movie will pull in $250M at the box office. Hope you all enjoyed Unbreakable too, an even more laughable movie. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense is the best thriller of the year because it has an old fashioned ghost story put in with today's modern thriller. But what really sticks this film out (besides it's over 200 million gross and six academy award nominations) is the acting. Bruce Willis fits in well as a troubled psychiatrist trying to help out an even more troubled boy (played brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment) who has a gift in which he sees dead people. Filled with surprises, scares and great entertainment, this film is worth a look see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A child psychologist(Bruce Willis)comes to the aid of a young mother(Toni Collette), that is deeply concerned about her son(Haley Joel Osment). The young boy not only sees dead people, but seems to be able to communicate with them as well. This is a complex thriller. It is well written and gives your imagination a work out.Young Osment steals the show from Willis. Also in this psychological brain teaser is Donnie Wahlberg, Mischa Barton and Lisa Summerour.Catch it a second time to see what you thought you saw the first time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sixth Sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You probably know the five human senses: Touch, Scent, Sight, Sound and Taste, and this is a terrifying idea for a sixth, from director M. Night Shyamalan (also starring as Dr. Hill). Basically Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a child psychologist recently awarded, and on the same night visited by a mad ex-patient who wounds him by gunshot. A few months later Malcolm is visited by the troubled 9-year-old Cole Sear (Forrest Gump's Haley Joel Osment). He does not tell his secret for a while, but when he does, it is one of the iconic moments of the film, it was number 44 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, "I see dead people". It is because of this he is a freak in school, and his mother Lynn (Toni Collette) is very concerned about his increasing problems. Malcolm is now trying to find out whether he is seeing things or not, and trying to rekindle his relationship with wife Anna Crowe (Olivia Williams). Also starring Saw II's Donnie Wahlberg as Vincent Gray, Glenn Fitzgerald as Sean, young Mischa Barton as Kyra Collins and Jurassic Park III's Trevor Morgan as Tommy Tammisimo. The film has a great conclusion as well with Cole's mother weeping at the idea of Cole seeing his Grandma, and Malcolm finding out why his wife has been ignoring him for so long, he wasn't wounded in that gunshot, he died. It was number 60 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 33 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>.... but strangely enough that didn`t stop me from enjoying it . This even more surprising because I found the start of the film slightly tedious with its shots of city streets and the close ups of characters faces which kept reminding me of the work of Stanley Kubrick , a director I`m not at all keen on . But THE SIXTH SENSE is a haunting film with more than a few spooky atmospheric moments . The more I think about it the more I like it . Here`s hoping that the critics are wrong when they say that M Night Shyamalan is a one trick pony</fullReview>
