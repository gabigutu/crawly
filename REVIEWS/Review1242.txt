		<shortDescription>I cannot respect King Arthur...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not hate this film. It was fairly entertaining, with well-staged battle scenes and high production values. The acting, though often either overblown or slightly wooden, was passable, and Ioan Gruffydd was actually quite good.What bothered me is that the text at the opening of King Arthur promised a portrayal of the "historical" Arthur, and then manifestly failed to deliver. For the record, there is no "historical" Arthur. There are scattered references in the works of Gildas and Bede to an Arthur, or an Aurelius Ambrosianus upon whom the legend of Arthur is based. There is a fairly detailed story of a King Arthur in Geoffrey of Monmouth's History, though most of this seems drawn from Welsh and Cornish folktales of the type later collected in the Mabinogion. There is, however, very hard evidence that there ever was a King Arthur, or battles of Baddon Hill and Celidon forest.There was, however, an invasion and colonization of Britain by the Saxons and other Germanic tribes during the fifth and sixth centuries, following the Roman military withdrawal. And it is pretty clear that the native Celtic and Romano-Celtic population put up one hell of a fight, slowing but not stopping the Saxon invasions. My own opinion is that there is enough smoke to suggest that the Arthur of medieval romance probably had some kind of historical prototype (most legends of this type usually do: a "Dux Bellorum" (war leader) as named in Gildas, possibly this shadowy Aurelius Ambrosianus.So, I had high hopes for the movie King Arthur. After all, the film had the time period right, and the context looked convincing enough. Unfortunately, rather than using the historical material and context, the filmmakers completely ignored them. There was no consistency to this movie, and anyone with even a passing knowledge of the history of the early middle ages (the so-called dark ages) will be more than irritated by the pretended historicity of the movie. Some examples: 1. The film suggests the late-imperial Roman government and policy was directed by the Church, through the Papacy. This is absolutely false. Although the Empire was staunchly Christian at this time, it was the Emperor and his court -- at Constantinople rather than Rome -- that set and executed policy. Bishops did not order armies around. In fact, the See of Rome at the time was a relatively weak power centre at the time, especially compared to the Bishops of Constantinople and Alexandria.2. While it is true that the Romans enlisted soldiers and units from border tribes like the Sarmatians, they were never posted at the other end of the empire. This would have made no sense, since the whole point of the foederati was to create a buffer between the empire and the northern and eastern barbarians. The Sarmatian soldiers were typically posted in Sarmatia.3. Arthur would never have known Pelagius who, though a Briton or Irishman by birth, was in Rome from about AD 405. He was condemned by the Church, but never actually excommunicated or convicted of heresy, and probably died in Rome in AD 420, around the time the "historical" Arthur was born.4. By the fifth century, the Roman occupied part of Britain had been quite thoroughly Romanized. The population was mostly Romanized Britons, and NOT an ethnically British population under the boot of a few foreign, ethnically Roman aristocrats. While there certainly were non-Romanized Celts like the Wodes about, most of the Britain that Arthur would have been fighting to defend would have been populated by Christian Britons who though of themselves as Romans.5. Bishop Germanicus, or St. Germain, was not a former Roman general. He was a former Gaulish lawyer.6. Hadrian's wall was built not to keep the Britonnic Celts and Saxons out of Roman Britain. It was built to keep the Picts and Hiberni -- who were explicitly NOT Briton and in the case of the Picts, probably not even Celts -- out of Britain. It runs/ran from Solway Firth to the River Tyne and thus is waaaaaaaaaaaaay too far north to have had much to do with the "historical" Arthur.7. While the Church in the fifth century was certainly militant (read St. Augustine for that), the portrayal of churchmen as murderous ascetics who tortured and sacrificed pagans is absolutely ridiculous. In fact, by this time, most of the population south of Hadrian's Wall had been converted to Christianity.What troubles me is that there is no reason why the filmmakers should have played so fast and loose with history to make this movie. I understand creative license, but the way in which they claim historicity on one hand, and then create a nonsense fabrication on the other ? to no end other than the fact that they just seemed to want to do it that way -- makes it very difficult for me to respect King Arthur. I can respect Excalibur; at least no one claimed that it was historical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The legend?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a huge King Arthur fan ever since the night that I sat in an empty theater, in my hometown, awestruck by John Boorman's Excalibur.Since then, I have seen the legend of King Arthur mutilated in films such as First Knight and The Mists of Avalon.My high hopes for the movie, King Arthur, were dashed before the film even opened in theaters, by critics who were panning the movie from advanced screenings.So, I stayed away while it was in theaters and most definitely passed on special discounts on the week it was released to DVD.After finally getting around to renting a copy, I am left with just one burning question - Why in the hell do I listen to movie critics? The movie King Arthur has it all - a tight, well written story, believable characters, gritty realism, a great musical score by Hans Zimmer, epic battles, and more blood and splatter than you probably really wanted to see.The bottom line is that King Arthur is a very good film. No, it's not the mythical Camelot, but it does not try to be. Nor, does it trample all over the name of King Arthur by making him a shallow or less than heroic character.This is not Braveheart or Gladiator , but it is a film worth seeing and appreciating. Now that I think about, it's worth buying a copy to add to the home video library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fresh Look On An Old Theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And I loved it!Not just the new take on the King Arthur legend and the able cast, but the colors, the costumes, the landscapes, the horses, and Hans Zimmer's heart-pounding score.I'm no King Arthur scholar but I have always been enamored with the chivalric ideals. It's great to see the knights in shining armor and Merlin conjuring up the mists and casting spells, and the young Arthur pulling Excalibur out of the stone.But I went into this movie with an open mind. I was swiftly transported to that earlier time and happy for the journey. I could see where the elements of the now oh-so-familiar Arthurian themes may have had their beginnings. I found the on-screen chemistry between Ioan Gruffod and Clive Owen to be very powerful and it provided poignant counterpoint to Lancelot's most fateful choice.The love triangle was never my favorite part of the Arthurian legends, so the subtle treatment of it here didn't bother me at all. In fact, I found it more intriguing in this film than in any other King Arthur movie I've seen.I loved that there was no hocus-pocus-type magic. Instead the magic was in nature itself - the landscapes, the forests, the rain, the fog, the ice and snow - all creating an other-worldly atmosphere along with Moya Brennan's haunting vocals and Hans Zimmer's stirring score.I loved the knights. I loved the idea that they were just regular guys and, in effect, drafted into military service. Not the privileged elite who volunteered their services to a king. Yet it is apparent that the Sarmatian knights fought more out of their love and respect for Arthur than any duty to Rome. That comraderie feels very organic and the sentiments, pure. I liked that they're not all wearing the same uniform, that they might have picked up pieces here and there as spoils of war.I was especially captivated by Mads Mikkelson's Tristan. There appeared to be Eastern influences in his tattoos, clothing, sword, and fighting style. I love the idea of Lancelot using two swords. And I learned something about battlefield strategy, too.Whatever shortcomings this movie may have, I found heart and soul in it. It was not only entertaining, it touched all my senses, and I felt good when I walked out of the theatre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all about atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerry Bruckheimer's KING ARTHUR is a shining example of that new breed of mythology adaption. It is similar to Wolfgang Petersen's TROY, in that it dispenses with the supernatural splendour and phantasmagorical intrigue characteristic of traditional tales, and presents the story as (relatively) realistic historical fiction, attempting to convey the "magic" of the story through drama, rather than gaudy special effects.This is a brave venture by Bruckheimer - and director Fuqua- and they are to be commended for executing it with such style and creativity as is displayed in this film. It has, however, enjoyed somewhat limited success, due to the fact that it presents such a radical interpretation of a story much closer to our hearts than that of the Illiad.I believe, though, that if the viewer simply opens one's mind and attempts to enjoy the story purely for the sake of itself (forgetting, for the moment, Rosemary Sutcliff and Barbara Leonie Picard), KING ARTHUR will reveal itself as a truly fine piece of film-making.More than anything else, Fuqua masterfully portrays the atmosphere of the tale, endowing it with a sense of time and place far more eloquent than the rather run-of-the-mill dialogue. The entire experience oozes the ambiance of the early common era, from windswept downs and hills to rugged coasts and snow-cloaked mountains; from the spartan order of a Roman camp to the hellish confines of a torture chamber. Exemplars of this perfectly-presented atmosphere are Arthur's knights(Ioan Gruffud, Ray Winstone, Joel Edgerton, Mads Mikkelsen, Hugh Dancy and Ray Stevenson).These are not the chivalrous, couth, pious Christian knights your mum told you about, but rather a troop of barbaric, lecherous, pagan Sarmatian mercenaries. Together (with excellent performances all round, particularly by Winstone, Gruffud and Edgerton) they epitomise the pragmatic, godless, exquisitely human atmosphere of the period. As Gawaine tells a cowering Roman friar in an early scene - "Your God doesn't live here".The lead actors, too, are outstanding, from Stellan Skarsgaard's sociopathic Cerdic, to the delicious Keira Knightley's dark and beautiful Guinevere. Only Clive Owen disappoints as Arthur himself, lacking the emotion this characterisation requires to supplement his steely resolve.Despite the lukewarm reception to which it was subjected, KING ARTHUR is a finely crafted and memorable item of film-making. Forget all your preconceptions about King Arthur - just float with it, and let the rich atmosphere engulf you. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry, but this film is dire.Primarily it suffers from a BAD case of Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves Geography... Saxons invading from the North of Hadrians Wall? With nice round shields and pretty hair? Surely Mr Bruckheimer is thinking of the Vikings? Only a few centuries early eh Jerry!And Stone Henge on Tintagel?Maybe if you're not familiar with the layout of England and if you don't have even a rudimentary grasp of British history, you could enjoy this film as a mindless bit of action fluff. But if you do posses either of the two above attributes, you will find this film to be another frustrating example of Hollywood not letting silly details like facts or Geography get in the way of a fast buck (a la Braveheart, U571, The Patriot etc.. etc..)So for any non Brits reading this who like a bit of Arthurian action, allow me to give you a few tips...Stonehenge not near sea. Tintagel near sea but no stones. Hadrians wall at top of country... Stone Henge, King Arthur, Avalon, Tintagel and Saxons at bottom of country!See! It's easy when you know how!Oh! And for any Robin Hood fans, white cliffs not near Sherwood Forest. Sorry.Anyway. Poo film. Even without the Arthur stuff, it's just plain wrong in so many ways. Giant frozen lakes in England? Where? Even without the stupidity, it's a bad film.These actors should have known better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The realism behind the magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In recent movies coming out of Hollywood there seems to be a trend towards attempting to unveil the true character behind some of history's most mysterious individuals. With most of us having been brought up on tales of a medieval King Arthur and the magic of Camelot, it was a risk for those who initiated this movie to attempt to expose the man behind the myth, so to speak. In my opinion, through a combination of realistic battle scenes, stunning cinematography and well rounded characters this movie is successful.This tale takes us on a journey with King Arthur's knights as they embark on a final quest for Rome. The issue of religious persecution is raised on numerous occasions in the duration of this movie and relates to contemporary circumstances where religious belief can be used as a form of power and means of superiority. Themes such as this raise the film above the average Bruckheimer production. However, the dialogue is still cliché in places, and mid-battle jokes can fall flat on audiences that have grown weary of them in films such as LORD OF THE RINGS and PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN. Fortunately, the battle scenes are realistic and don't bombard us with Jackie Chan like maneuvers that the knights have suddenly and inexplicably learned.The movie is beautifully shot with a variety of landscapes ranging from Hadrian's Wall to icy snow-covered hills and peasant villages. This ensures that the audience always has something new to look at, but also paints a realistic picture of the poverty and harsh environment of the time.My only complaint about this film would have to be that some of the acting and characterisation was a little disappointing. Clive Owen's 'Arthur' was a little internalised and predictable. While other characters, such as Lancelot (Ioan Gruffud), are fabulously flawed, Arthur is always thinking of others and making the right decisions. His humanity never falters. Owen delivers his lines woodenly and without the passion one wishes to see from such a great warrior and humanitarian. Whilst the writers have dared to put a different spin on the characters of Lancelot and Guinevere (Keira Knightly), they seem to have stuck with the Arthur of legend. Knightly's performance was certainly nothing special. Her role in the movie was unclear as she seemed to only be there to run around in skimpy outfits, although I'm sure the intention was to create a strong female character. I thought her survival in battle was unrealistic as she was much smaller and weaker than the thousands of large trained warriors she was fighting, particularly since she had apparently nearly starved to death after being walled up in a tomb for her Pagan beliefs. Although Knightly is beautiful, her performances in movies thus far have yet to convince me of her acting abilities.Overall, I thought this movie was unique in that it depicted a time not often portrayed in modern cinema. It had strong themes with a good mix of humour, romance and action. Although the film had its flaws, I would definitely recommend it as I believe it would appeal to a wide audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood rewrites the history of England yet again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Arthur is ( according to Hollywood ) a Roman? This film belongs in the same bin as U-571 when it comes to historical accuracy.The Britons appear as blue painted pixies along the lines of the elves in Lord of the Rings. It appears that the knights of the round table are all dressed in armour from all corners of the globe. Arthur is fully Roman, Lancelot looks like a Persian warrior and the others are dressed like Ghengis Khan.The fight scenes resemble Buffy the Vampire Slayer - Kiera Knightly twirling around Thai-style dealing roundhouse kicks to burly Saxons.Another fine example of the Americans trying to rewrite the rest of the worlds history.King Arthur is a deep seated British legend and it is insulting that the story should be twisted in this way. If this was done to a minority group there'd be uproar.I'm looking forward when I can fund the making of the true story of George Washington, the one where he was an Iranian cross-dressing child molester.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>History...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here are the facts about the "Age of Arthur." The Roman legions pulled out in 410 (over 50 years before this film's period). The Saxons were INVITED by King Vortigern in 449 as mercenaries against invading Irish, Scots and Picts (note: they were NOT called "Woads.") Saxons were NOT mono-syllabic troglodytes, but actually warrior-farmers with a sophisticated culture. After a few generations, the Angles and Saxons - led by Cerdic of Wessex - came into conflict with the Romano-Celts, led by Ambrosius Aurelianus. Artorius (Arthur) was apparently one of Ambrosius' generals. He fought ten battles against the Germanic tribes, culminating in the Battle of Badon sometime between 500 and 510 (40-50 years AFTER this film's period).NONE of this information came out in this film. I am somewhat familiar with the "Sarmatian" legend, but there is little evidence for it (in fact, Roman legionaries in Britain came from all over the Empire). As "history," this film gets an "F". As entertainment...? The characters were shallow, the acting was amateurish, and the dialogue was plodding and trite. As a "found comedy," it works rather well - I found myself laughing through most of it. As a serious film and an attempt to portray "history," however, it is seriously flawed. Skip this one and read "Crystal Cave" or "Mists of Avalon" instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ugly movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A roman King Arthur with knights that still have their 'Morte d'Arthur' names even though they come from Iran do some very small scale heroics in the middle of a field somewhere in england. The three people who saw what happened obviously carried the story to us a thousand years later.Small scale, low budget, badly acted, anachronistic and totally unconvincing in everything it tried to show.Arthur was woeful. He simply couldn't decide whether he was in 'Excalibur' or 'Gladiator' so we had this strange roman general who kept coming out with hilarious monologues that bore no relation to the rest of the film's script at all. The last speech on the hill had me in stitches.Merlin was some sort of degenerate mystic who looked meaningfully into the sky and didn't do a hell of a lot else. His band too vaguely resembled some sort of shambling Neanderthals instead of normal Saxon guerilla fighters.One of the worst films I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>~ A Refreshing Change On An Old Story ~</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take all your preconceptions and the years of same rhetoric on the legend of Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table and throw it away save a few simple concepts, and you have King Arthur.A refreshing change on the same old stories surrounding the beloved characters of Camelot. If you're looking for stories surrounding a mythical magic sword named Excalibur, an all powerful magician named Merlin, or a love triangle between Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot....well then go rent another movie. This particular version is based on a group of Knights in the Roman Empire Era led by Artorious Castus (Arthur), and takes place in the British Isles during the Saxon invasion.In this version Arthur is a leader of different sorts, and his Knights are an eclectic band of fighters, each with their own motives and fighting styles. Referred to here as the Samatian Knights, they serve Rome, particularly the church. They are awaiting honorable discharge, but are handed one last mission before they can get it. Guinevere, a woad rebel (people who are fighting to free the land from the Roman rule) and advocate for the land, we actually don't meet until a good bit into the movie. This time though she isn't your regular damsel in distress, but a warrior of vast talents too, which is a nice change. Her role, aside from "love interest" eventually for Arthur, is trying to get Arthur to care about the land and freeing it's people from Roman rule, and the Saxon's who are now attempting to seize it.The fight scenes between the various groups of people vying for control of Briton are good, visually stunning and intense. The acting is good, Clive Owen is a good and believable Arthur and would-be King. The Knights under his wing are also very good, each bringing their own personalities, but maintaining a good sense of camaraderie. Sometimes the banter between them had me rolling on the floor. Keira Knightley as Guinevere was OK, there were a few times where I wanted to smack her because she sounded as if she were a broken record. However, if you could stand her in Pirates of the Carribbean, then she won't entirely grind on you here either. I liked her best fighting...and NOT talking though.A bit slow in some spots, but endearing characters, fresh take on the story, and extremely well done fighting scenes earn it a 8/10 from me. Hope to add it to my collection of home DVD's in the near future.</fullReview>

He, at least, clearly knew a little bit about the legends and history this farce pretends to represent.As a final thought - I don't know why Miss Knightley is drawn to bloody awful adaptations of English legends but I wish she'd stop it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some explanation of how bad it really was ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie without any redeeming historical value other than living in the 5th century C.E. involved a lot of dirt! I do admit I only scanned about 15 percent of the 812 comments available, but feel that this represents a pretty good cross-section of the reviewers.Some things others may have missed.1. The unhistorical armor - obviously inspired by the "visual consultant" to Mr. Fuqua, Chris Achilleos whose fantasy art I adore, but ax blades of the forehead of horse barding? Pity the horse who uses it and brains himself.2. Saxons marching in step on ice - either they are organized enough to march in step and know not to do it on ice or they are like the real Saxons and would not have ventured onto the too-thin ice in the first place. Either way this battle cannot happen, especially on a lake no Brit seems to know about.3. Bors must be the richest Sarmatian ever as he tows around a wagon with what appears to be every hand powered weapon available on earth at the time, true riches to the warriors of the time. (Not to mention he supports 10+ children somehow) 4. Who is Dagonet? Never heard of him. Wikipedia lists him as King Arthur's jester and the guy in the movie is not funny.5. Guinivere pulling a strong re-curve bow only a couple days after getting her dislocated (if not broken) fingers reset by Arthur? Ever dislocated (or even sprained) a finger? Takes a lot more than two days to get the function and flexibility back.The rest of the mistakes are in other posts. The one rating puts this below "Plan 9 from Outer Space" which is so bad as to be actually funny which "King Arthur" definitely is not.Those who 'loved' this movie must have seen some other movie or are using standards vastly different from mine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why even call it King Arthur?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have loved the Arthur legends all of my life, and I am used to people interpreting them differently...but this movie went a little too far in its interpretation, okay, and it was just a bad movie.First of all, the plot was extremely shoddy, patched together and full of holes. I got that Arthur and his men had to do one last mission before their retirement, but why, exactly, was this important Roman family living in hostile territory? And who the hell was Guinevere? Where did she come from...why did anyone pay any attention to her? Other than the fact that she loved to dress up in skimpy little dresses and leather bondage outfits in the middle of winter, that is.Not to mention that all Arthur's gibbering about 'freedom' screamed twentieth century American idealism...people in the dark ages didn't think that way. And Clive Owen managed to deliver these Braveheart aping lines with about as much enthusiasm as a man having his teeth pulled. I especially loved his prayer scenes.The knights were entertaining, and fun to look at to boot. Bors was funny in that bawdy soldierly way, and his bickering with Lancelot gave another side to the normally sullen and glowering Ioan Gruffydd. Joel Edgerton was charming as Gawain (who has always been my favourite knight) and Madds Mickkleson was mysterious and probably the most believable Samarian of them all. The head Saxon was wonderful too, Skellan Skarsgard was obviously having a ball hovering around in his black outfit and whispering lines like 'burn everything...kill everyone.' Whether he was supposed to be funny or not, he made me laugh.Essentially, the names were the same, but other than that the movie had little in common with the Arthur legends. Though I have always like the idea of setting Arthur in the dark ages, where the origins of the story most likely spring from, this particular movie came off like a bad cross between Gladiator and Braveheart. Clive Owen had no charisma whatsoever, though, unlike good old Mel Gibson, so all Merlin's spouting about people needing a 'leader' to help them fight the invading Saxons (who never actually formally invaded Britain) came off as out of tune. Arthur's disillusion about the Roman empire was awkward, and didn't really seem to fit the story and his relationship with Guinevere was so mechanical the audience actually groaned when she said who she was. Essentially, my complaints about the movie, though many, really just boil down to the fact that it was a bad movie. Great shots of men on horses, knightly humour, and lots of battles simply could not this clanking, bumbling, awkward excuse for a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you plan to watch this Movie I recommend the Directors Cut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Directors Cut of this movie must be one of the best ever made. Most times you see a Directors Cut you might get an extra scene here bit of dialog's there and you ask yourself what was the point of shelling out the extra money to see basically the same movie, in the case of King Arthur, you haven't seen anything until you see the Directors Cut. So much more action in the battle sequences, more Saxons, also the original ending, was much cooler than the light airy fairy ending that it received. You got to see the reality of conflict. Seeing Arthur marry Guinevere what was the point, we all know they get married. The theatrical version of the movie or (Arther Lite) as i now call it is OK, but the directors cut is better.Also Keira Knightley kicked butt in this movie as Guinevere she was believable as a warrior in the battle scenes and a lady during the peaceful times. I think I'll have to keep an eye out for more movies by Director Antoine Fuqua.</fullReview>

This film must be the worst waste of money since i don't know when. If i could i would send in my coupon to redeem those two looong hours of my time back.. The film starts out with a long battle before the audience hardly even knows who the characters are, and from there it only gets worse. Luckily none of the actors have that much lines, though Clive Owen crosses the line from cheesy to annoyingly pathetic many a time.I just can't stop wondering where did all of the old myths go? Isn't there supposed to be a book where you could at least steal a few fragments of a coherent storyline?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>worst "historic" movie of the new millennium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so rife with inaccuracies and anachronisms as to be laughable. I couldn't begin to point them out or this would very quickly turn into a dissertation on a movie that is just not worth it. It is just Wrong, Wrong, Wrong... like in a thousand different ways. It would be much easier to point out what they got correct... but that would be quite difficult without re-watching a movie that is so not worth a second viewing.I'm quite particular about historic movies. If they claim historic and not fantasy settings, they have got to be correct or have *extremely* good reason why they can't be. This movie does neither. It's a Hollywood fantasy claiming historicity in the worst way. At best, this is a modern film using a historic setting to get across a modern point, but I'm at a loss as to what that point might be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Move over Mallory. I really loved this one! ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is an excellent story about an ancient contemporaneous-to-post Roman occupation of Britain and the beginnings of the Saxon invasions. Merlin and Lancelot and Guinevere and Gawain and Galahad are all there, but in more ancient and believable roles. It is a different tale never before told and in a different time. The screenplay, acting, scenery, cinematography and casting are all extremely well-done. The men especially are cast well, and Guinevere is perfectly beautiful. The music is haunting and beautiful and fit for the time and reminds me of The Last of the Mohicans. The fights and battle scenes are exciting and done well. The only reasons I have read that some people did not like this film are that they wanted more of the same old Arthur/Camelot tale, and a 14th century setting, which, when you think about it, is totally unbelievable. This, to me, was much more believable and realistic. Move over Mallory. I really loved this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lets face it, the Arthurian legend has been covered many times, and pretty much all of them have been better than this drivel! Radical new slant on the theme is lame, casting is dreadful and whatever budget they had was spent on unconvincing plastic walls, a couple of burning bales of hay and a dry-ice machine! Clive Owen is woefully miscast as Arthur - seems more like an accountant out of place at a fancy dress than an inspirational Kinglike figure! Ioan Gruffudd must have been gutted he didn't get the role - it was obviously much more him than Owen. Ray Winstone plays the same old shouting, beer swilling/spilling character as he did over 20 years ago in Robin of Sherwood, and in everything else he has done since! The Viking Chief seems to be doing some kind of Marlon Brando dressed as a scarecrow impression, and even Keira Knightley can't make much of her clichéd character that appears to have been stuck in at the last minute when someone thought "Oops, we forgot Guinevere!" I ended up laughing out loud at this it was so bad - the investors should have kept their money and waited for something with a decent plot, director and cast to come along!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 'True Story'? Right . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long before I went into 'King Arthur', the latest Jerry Bruckheimer film, I predicted that the film would have three things in accordance with the Bruckheimer formula. 1: A repetitive soundtrack provided by Hans Zimmer. 2: Lots of helicopter shots of lush scenery to make up for the lack of interesting dialogue.3: Explosions. Well now I've seen it, and even though the last item on the formula seemed unlikely seeing as how this was supposed to be a historically accurate telling set in the DARK AGES, it somehow found a way to throw big fiery explosions into this mix of drab and boring mud covered battle sequences and perhaps an even more dry and uninspired love story than the one in 'Star War: Attack Of The Clones'. The humour in this film is locker room at best (a joke from Austin Powers 3 was actually used), and was crafted to appeal to the under 18 'bathroom' crowd. I say 'bathroom' because there are a lot of intelligent teenagers, the humour in this movie is not for them - the jokes in this movie are for stupid teenagers. In fact during one particularly lame joke, I found it hard tell apart the laughter on screen from that of the four 16 year old guys sitting behind me, who were the only ones in the audience to find the joke about one of the Knights having a penis so large it was like "a baby's arm holding an apple" funny. The dialogue is dry and tedious, as is the pacing of the film. A scene involving a gate SO RUSTY AND HUGE that it takes two huge war horses to pull it open takes so long I thought I was going to pass out from lack of oxygen as the audience collectively yawned, and yet later in the film the door is opened by a single mortally wounded soldier in a matter of seconds ? I guess even in the Dark Ages they had some WD-40.The film's logic is so preposterous that it actually makes the simple mistake of KILLING THE NARRATOR and yet having him summarize the story at the end of the film! Perhaps the writer completely misunderstood the purpose of a narrator in a film - that the narrator has born firsthand witness to the story and lived to tell about it. How could the Narrator tell the story if he's DEAD?! Never mind, don't ask questions like that at this movie. At the start of the film Arthur and his Knights are sent on one final mission from Rome to rescue the beloved pupil of the Pope, who for some reason lives with his family in the middle of hostile territory. Why or how the Pope's star pupil came to live in the middle of Barbarian infested England is another question you're not meant to ask. The villain, a Saxon chieftain is like a really bored cross between Captain Barbosa and Darth Sidious, Guinevere looks like an angry 15 year old girl at an Avril Lavigne concert in her battle getup and is about as convincing as one when she's supposed to be noble and inspiring in her queen getup, and Arthur is a completely implausible moral centre of the film. Arthur in this story is a former Roman Centurion who is completely shocked when he witnesses torture. That's right, a Roman soldier, serving the country that invented such lovely devices as the Catherine Wheel and Crucifixion is shocked by torture! I'll leave you to figure that one out for yourselves. A film with the audacity to call itself the 'true story of King Arthur' must be held to a higher standard than that of a fun popcorn flick, which is all this film seemed to be trying for. The sad fact is that this movie doesn't pull off even that meagre feat. This movie is not fun, it's drab, it's uninteresting, and it's boring. You'll have more fun eating your popcorn than you will watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unentertaining with terrible dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can appreciate some of the attempt maid towards being more historically accurate than Hollywood-fantasyland King Arthur films. However, even though it brought some reality where traditionally the tale is told unrealistically, it incorporated strange and unrealistic elements of gross unreality that I did not enjoy. Moreover, it was boring as hell! I am female, and yes, Ioan Gruffudd is hott, but I still could never manage to care about whether any of the good guys lived or died. There's no personal insights, nothing special about these knights other than that they are undefeated warriors. They aren't interesting people in this movie's depiction. The little dialogue there was was bombastic and overinflated speech's about freedom. There have been about a bazillion movies made about fighting for freedom, okay, a reiteration of why freedom is good is NOT NECESSARY. I resent having to listen to such discourse.Had the movie incorporated more philosophy of the time or some way to connect to the character's strife, I would have respected it much more. As it is, I certainly don't recommend it. I"m glad I only spent $0.50 on a bootlegged copy of this DVD in China. If you spent more, you should find someone to complain to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Avoided this one at the cinema and got it on rental not expecting much.....which is just as well as really terrible - set in Britian towards the end of the Roman occupation in 452 AD - which is the first of many howlers - the Romans had pulled out decades before and by this date the Empire itself had ceased to exists - anyway the plot has it that Arthur and his Knights are a bunch of Eastern Europeans from around the Black Sea shipped over to Britain.Arthur(Clive Owen) has led them for 15 years mainly against the Woads who are led by Merlin who is isn't a wizard at all and appears in need of a good wash - the rest of the Knights are a pretty grungy non-descript bunch with only Ray Winstones Cockney hard man of distinction. They are on the brink of ending their servitude to Rome when the local bishop has them head North from Hadrian's Wall to rescue a Roman family from their Villa that is under threat from the invading Saxons - as if by this time any Roman would chose to live North of the Wall and survive more than about 5 minutes.... This brings Arthur into contact with Guinivere(Keira Knightly) who is a woad covered warrior - albeit one with a posh totty Home Counties accent and the rest of the film is the battle against the Saxons led by Stellan Stersgard which entails much hacking and slaying.What lets it down is the lacklustre direction,flat wooden performances - only Winstone enjoys himself snarling and roaring at everyone and Stersgard who has fun peering at us from what appears to several manes of hair - the script is appalling - every scene seems to have the entire cast discussing freedom and what it means to be free until you expect to see George W Bush's name to appear as script adviser - Owen(who is normally quite good) makes like an oak tree and the lengthy battle scenes go on so long you give up caring who is hacking who......I suppose giving a go at Arthur the non-legendary mystical hero is worthwhile but the whole thing is no inept that even that good intention goes down the pan...Avoid...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>if you claim your movie is based on history...please do some real research beforehand!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion what this movie is trying to do is not to reveal the man behind the myth, but to make millions of dollars by exploiting a trend that has become extremely popular lately. King Arthur, Alexander, Troy, The Gladiator; what all these movies have in common besides exciting battle scenes of epic proportions, is inaccurate historical claims. However, some of the movies mentioned above, and others within the genre do not make the claim that what they are telling in their movie is history. In the case of this movie, it starts by saying that many historians agree on the theories they are about to shows us through this film. The truth is that the historicity of Arthur can not be proved until today and there are many theories out there, and the one this movie presents to us is definitely not the most popular, in the contrary most historians do not agree with it. So why claim your movie is based on history if its not? And where in hell did they get the idea of Guinevere carrying a bow? Come on! We all know that showing Keira Knightley half-naked kicking some Saxon ass is pretty hot...but still, was there any account of Guinevere being a post-feminist Celtic warrior-princess? I didn't think so. Hey don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say that this is an awful movie, but rather that the claims they make in the movie are completely ridiculous. This semester we watched this movie in my history class, a King Arthur history class. The reaction from every student was..."Wow, Hollywood really doesn't know what kind of crap they are showing..." Our professor, Dr. Christopher Snyder, is not only one of the top experts in the field of Medieval British and Celtic studies, but the focus of his research is based on the historicity of King Arthur! And to top it off, Disney interviewed him and others historians to put them as part of the extra material in the DVD version, but decided to replace them with Keira Knightley talking nonsense without knowing what she is saying, because the views of these historians did not agree with what the Disney movie was trying to say about the historicity of King Arthur.To finish this long comment let me just say that if you like flicks with a lot of action in them, go see Troy or Lord of the Rings. This movie has certain excitement, but can't be compared to the "blockbusters" of its genre; and the ridiculous historical claims the film makes just show the immense stupidity and lack of historical knowledge that was used in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trashing the Legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2004 movie director Antoine Fuqua bestowed upon American audiences his retelling of Arthurian legend with King Arthur. It is about the worst movie I have seen in my life. And I have seen a lot of movies. Do I mean the acting is poor? No. The characters hiss and snarl with appropriate medieval abandon, and Clive Owen plays a capable Arthur. Do I mean the production quality is poor? Not even that. It concludes with a fantastic battle sequence which appears to be unaided by computer generated imagery. What I mean is, this movie is just plain bad.It is one thing to mess with a well-known legend. It is another thing to give a completely false retelling of history. And it is another thing to tell the story through horrible writing that makes no sense whatsoever, riddled with every thinkable cliché. But this movie somehow manages to do all three things.King Arthur promises to be a historical account of England's most celebrated monarch. But history is a bit sketchy on the details, as Edward Gibbon noted in Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. So the movie is already attempting the impossible. The film begins with the rolling foggy English countryside and the viewer is informed that the year is 425 and the Romans are "pulling out of England" (already this is beginning to sound like Vietnam). All historians agree that the Romans left long before that. Note that there was no Western Roman Empire after 410, when Alaric the Goth sacked the Eternal City. Further, we are told that Arthur's knights originally came from Sarmatia, near what is today The Caucasus Mountains. They were taken captive and compressed into imperial service for a time. Arthur's knights (but not Arthur himself) descended from these "ruthless fighters". So what are the Sarmatians doing in Britain? Also, in 425 Sarmatia bordered the Byzantine Empire, and had nothing to do with Rome. What is going on here? I could go on with the flagrant historical problems, but suffice it to say that someone didn't proof-read the script.The plot is hopelessly nonsensical. Britain is pondering its future as the Romans withdraw and the Saxons move in. Arthur is a Roman soldier and a Christian but his fellow knights are pagans and Britons. This allows the writers to introduce a lot of post-modern prattle about how the Catholic Church is a form of slavery foisted upon the noble savages, and Britons deserve to be free because "every man is born free". Such a concept didn't appear until the Enlightenment, but even the village rabble in 5th century Briton seem to know their Constitutional rights. This is cinema in the age of Iraq and 9/11. Never mind that the Britons were devastated when Rome left the island, causing an influx of banditry which the real Arthur had to bring order to. The Britons in this movie are freedom fighters, led not by Merlin the Sorcerer but Merlin the battle-painted guerrilla fighter, crouching in the jungle like a Celtic Pol Pot. Foreign occupation, as Hollywood constantly reminds us, is always bad. Arthur is an occupier, and a confused one at that.Then there is Guinevere. Played by MTV vixen Kiera Knightly this character is a disaster. The Queen of Camelot is remembered as a lady of beauty and refinement, the height of femininity. In King Arthur Guinevere is one of Merlin's battle-painted warriors, dressed in a ridiculous leather bikini and screaming like a loon. This is the anti-Guinevere. She is the picture of modern confusion over what it means to be a woman. She is meek (Arthur rescues her from the evil monks) yet fierce. She is voluptuous but manly. She is tender but ferocious. She is brilliant but strangely naive. And of course, she reprimands Arthur about how "every Briton deserves to be free". Think Amazon warrior meets Susan B Anthony. We all know about the Arthur-Lancelot-Guinevere love triangle, but this movie disposes with love altogether. Instead, Lancelot (Ioann Gruffudd) wanders into the Hall of the Round Table one night and finds Guinevere there. Without a word they rip each other's clothes off and copulate on the Round Table with all the passion of two zoo monkeys. I must point out that at no point do these two characters speak to one another. So instead of Arthurian Romance we get Arthurian Pointless Sex. Lancelot doesn't have to win Guinevere's affections, because the new manly Guinevere doesn't need such dalliances. Is this progress? Finally there is the horrible depiction of ancient Christianity. One prominent character in the film is Bishop Germanus (Ivano Marescotti), an instrument of the dying Roman Empire. He sneers at the native pagans, who in turn despise the Church because they "just want to be free". Arthur is a Christian, but only because he is from Rome. His faith is challenged when he finds a village where the priests have rounded up pagans and other village dissidents and begun torturing them in a dungeon decorated by icons and featuring an altar. The camera lingers over dead children who have been tortured in grotesque detail. One priest hisses "They must be sacrificed for their sins!" It is interesting that this warped presentation of 'Christianity' is typical Hollywood fare but ascribing terrorism to Islam is completely unacceptable. In the new Arthurian legend the real enemy is not the barbarians who seek to destroy civilization, it is organized religion and civilization in general.In sum, this movie represents revision of history and legend for the 21st century, and all the rules are reversed. The savages triumph over the pioneers, the pagans triumph over the Christians, and sexual abandon triumphs over the lost opportunities of romance. The result is abject confusion. With lessons such as these, there is no point in having legends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A myriad of lost chances and clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just seen King Arthur and what a disappointment! I have seen heaps of movies, and I am able to stomach a lot, having enjoyed mediocre films like, Van Helsing for instance. Van Helsing at least was silly, but had no pretensions of being anything else, King Arthur on the other hand, is a little movie, very predictable, filled with plot clichés that you have seen in countless other motion pictures, but has pretensions of being something extraordinary. Well, surprise, surprise it is not! There is not even enough camp in this movie to grant it a sort of je ne se quois to make it enjoyable. Even the soundtrack is a rip off of Gladiator, without even fitting the movie adequately. Hans Zimmer should know better than to copy/paste from is own work, some of us might notice!Most of the acting is pretty good. I have especially enjoyed Ioan Gruffud as Lancelot and Clive Owen and Arthur, both of them make a very good effort given the silly lines they have, especially Owen who's lines are extra silly. Most of the actors are competent with the exception of Til Schweiger as Cynric and I felt that such a great actor as Stephen Dillane (Merlin) was completely wasted and given no chance to show is quality.The direction was pretty bad and uneven. Antoine Fucqua doesn't show the talent he has demonstrated in Training day or even Tears of the Sun, the movie is a mess from start to finish. Visually, I must admit, it looks good. Slawomir Idziak's cinematography is really good and I hope to see some of his work in the future. I have a lot more problems with this movie which I won't detail much further, with the exception of two that I cannot overlook. First of all, trebuches (the catapult thingies) were invented by the French during the 100 year old war, several centuries later, and not by Merlin. In a movie that brags about historical realism and accuracy, this strikes as odd. Besides, if Merlin had this kind of weapons, why not used it against the Romans in the first place? Another gripe, and this a big one, is the complete absence of gore! Did people in the "Dark Ages" not have blood? The battle scenes are violent but no blood! What's the point? Again if you want to have a realistic take on this period of history, why the absence of realism in the battle scenes? Do the filmmakers think that a PG-13 rating will get them more money at the box-office? Having seen this mess I seriously doubt it!Summarizing, this movie is a complete mess with the exception of some of the performances, namely the Knights and most of all Gruffud's and Owen's acting. As for the rest, it is dumb, predictable, not very original in terms of plot and a complete disappointment! Long live Excalibur (John Boorman) that with it's 23 years it is still the best Kig Arthur story in movie history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To the fans of action, blood and guts, and cool dude lines out of a modern action movie.....well....here's a Disney ride for you to enjoy and root for.However, for the select few how love history and carry with them a deep respect for film-makers who take pains when dealing with such a subject....it is disappointing.Making a historic movie is like handling artifacts at a dig site....you handle what you got with awe and absolute care and then you add a story round it with that little artifact as the germ of the plot.A wonderful idea........Artorius was a roman centurion, who led a cavalry unit and thus became a legend which in time became the most beloved myth we've all grown to love.One problem......the script. If I closed my eyes in certain scenes with the knights....I would have had difficulty figuring out if I was watching a Vietnam movie or Die Hard........ that attention to lines and words was missing. Plus a villain with a Texan accent....nice touch dum-dums! The number of historical errors of time and place are endless. Which is what destroys the beauty of the tale. If the story claims to be historical, then that is a claim it must live up to.In short, you may sell the movie to fools.....but you can't fool everybody.Harsh as that may sound.....its a pity. There was good acting, and good visual effects and even the plot was not too bad. But, you don't stumble over mountains as they say.I wish that directors, when they think of taking up the challenge of movies like this.... especially about characters who are so well known and so widely read about....at least have some historians and experts double-check what's planned in the screen play before you start budgeting and then ruining things under the ever-so-easily adapted "Poetic licence" Isn't there something called "Responsibility to Heritage"???</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie several years ago in cinema and recently I catched it again on TV. It reminded me to be one of the biggest disappointments I've ever seen on Screen. One of the reasons is that I really expected something from the story but the movie couldn't deliver it. The movie is getting better if you don't expect any historical accuracy cause there is none. Great movies like Gladiator also don't have any but at least their sets and furnishing are looking marvelous. This time I never lost the feeling to see a B-Movie. So what they have done with the entire Budget? Even the battle at the end hasn't been photographed well. It's obviously only a punch of people fighting there and you don't get the feeling of a violent mass scene. Where are all the blood and death bodies? Arthur seems to be all the time on something like a heroic suicide mission. One of the most stupid scenes I've ever seen is the scene on the icy sea. The Saxons are portrayed as something like ancient Nazis. In fact they weren't. In reality the Romans and Briton's brought them into their country to protect them against the Pict's. The filmmakers didn't like the name Pict they changed a name of a whole population it into woad's. How arrogant is that? King Arthur is more enjoyable if you see it more like a Popcorn Fantasy Action Movie without any relations to the famous saga. One of the Highlight is the gorgeous Keira Knightley. Unfortunately it needs some time before we see her. I cannot say anything bad about the actors. It's not their fault that they have to say silly lines. I'm sorry even the second time King Arthur didn't convinced me. Some people told me the Directors Cut should be much better with better battle scenes and include a longer love scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't read the screenplay for King Arthur, but I'll bet it's far better than the piece of crap Antoine Fuqua put on the screen. It couldn't have been much worse.If it had been done right, this would have been a compelling story of how a group of Roman soldiers, loyal and devoted to their Empire, gradually realize that the nation they loved is dead and adopt a new country for their home. No other version of the Camelot tale, at least that I've seen, approaches from this direction. It was a very good idea, and it deserved a better fate.But Fuqua didn't understand that this process of British naturalization was the most important part of the material. Once Fuqua is done with it, Arthur is turned into a bore, Lancelot into a whiner, and Guinevere into a . . . I don't know what Guinevere was intended to be, but I know it takes considerable ineptitude to make a largely unclothed Keira Knightley look this unattractive.We hear a great deal about "fighting for freedom," but as usual, only the fighting gets an examination, never the freedom. No thought is put into what freedom means or what impact it has on the lives of the characters. If they had said they were fighting for monarchy, not a single frame of film would have had to be changed.Rating: *? out of ****.Recommendation: TV fare for hardcore D&amp;D fans only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I gave this only three stars. Why? Because the filmmakers seem to have lost sight of presenting the average film-goer with an engaging story or attempting to portray Arthur more plausibly. This last point rankles all the more since the opening text implies archaeological support for the story that follows.Anachronisms, or just plain cheap shots: Steel swords among the northern tribes of Europe at the height of the Bronze Age; a Harris Hawk - from Mexico, no less - when a score of birds utilized in Eurasia could have been had. Why not a Goshawk, Gyrfalcon, Golden Eagle or Eurasian Kestrel? Germanic invasion from north of Hadrian's Wall, when history shows Anglo-Saxon mercenaries were invited to Kent (closest to France and farthest southeast from the Wall) expressly to combat invasion by the tribes the Wall was intended to contain. This, by the way, occurred decades after the Roman evacuation. The mercenaries invited their cousins and they turned on their employer, eventually displacing Celtic kings as far as Wales and Cornwall; Arthur as an innovator of democratic ideals when both Celtic and Nordic practice of assembly and voting predate this story line by centuries; Greek Fire; crossbows; the chief of the army left to fight alone in the field of battle - any reading of old English texts displays the borrowed glory of fighting and dying at the side of the chief; Christianity demonized repeatedly.At least Arthur is portrayed as actually praying. His heartfelt cries to God are the real stuff of prayer, for my experience has shown hope stands where understanding falters.This film desperately needed variety, its air of tension and menace was hardly relieved by the pointless and poorly prepared seduction scene. Are we to believe Guenivere (by whatever spelling) expected to persuade Arthur to love her land and people by offering him her body? The battle scenes could have had greater impact if they were balanced by scenes of hilarity and bonhomie: witness the range of emotion and tone of "Gladiator" and especially "Master &amp; Commander."Fortunately, the dialogue is so tedious this movie may do less damage in reinforcing ignorance than we find in "Gladiator" or "Braveheart." For in one we find Caesar engaged in single combat with a gladiator on the Colosseum floor (yeah, right) and in the other Wallace is seduced by Isabella of France (never mind the implications for the head of a queen consorting with a rebel, nor the 4 children she bore to Edward II, including Edward III).The considerable talents of Keira Knightley hardly persuade me to recommend this film to anyone. She shines more brightly in plenty of other films already. Ioan Gruffudd (nice use of Welsh) is worth looking for in other efforts, as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>anti-historical drivel that ruins the drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this boring, derivative and distracting-due-to-so-many-plot-and-historical errors, yesterday, and have to speak out regarding its historical value:The movie has negative historical value - it represents an ounce of truths packed with a pound of lies.Yes, it's different all right - in all respects, it takes the great Arthurian legend and totally ruins it with a juvenile, hackneyed, phony story that has more holes than swiss cheese and has turned good and bad upside down. Any pretensions to being 'historical' are idiotic; it is far more fanciful, unbelievable and anti-historical than the 'real' Arthur legends that (correctly) place Arthur after, not during, Roman rule. Let's start with times and places: Roman power left Britain in 410AD; Romans were *never* north of Hadrian's wall, and local king (eg "Ol' King Cole") ran Britain. Saxons came only well after Rome left, and came first as mercenaries to defend Britain from other raiders. The story of these knights is pure hogwash. If you want something closer to the truth, Mallory's "Mort d'Arthur" better than this drivel. Maybe once shouldn't be surprised, when Bruckheimer's made nonsensical clunkers like "Day After Tomorrow", but they bill it as having some historical basis.Frankly, there is absolutely NO reason for any Romans in this movie at all. NONE. I think they must have had some leftover "Gladiator" costumes to use. The Roman in a toga ... in what would be Scotland today (when it's snowing!) is one example.What upsets me most about this fictional film is its blatant and gratuitous anti-Christian tone and it phony use of Christian piety simply as a foil to insult it; every religious figure is shown in the worst possible light. (they have some 'monks' with a little prison full of injured woman, a child, etc. eyes rolling.) Adding further injury, the leading character puts 19th century 'free will' (viz. John Stuart Mill) philosophy and representing it as Pelagianism beliefs. Pelagius actually had views on Christian grace and original sin that were viewed as contrary to orthodoxy, "Pelagianism received its name from Pelagius and designates a heresy of the fifth century, which denied original sin as well as Christian grace." Pelagianism can be seen as the anti-thesis of Lutheran "justification through faith". They turned it upside down, and to insult Germanus, even had a line about the church killing Pelagius. A lie. In fact, Pelagius died (peacefully) in Palestine decades, perhaps a century, before the time of Arthur. His theology was condemned as heretical, but he was not.The leading cast was mouthing much modernist freshman-flunk-out level philosophy, that was so annoying, phony and so childish, I'd slap 'em in the face and say 'grow up' if I was there. Whatever attempt there was to make Arthur's cause 'noble', it was lost in his angst not to do anything for the Romans (who the movie made out to be horrible, again making both the history and the drama worse).And the modernist cant rolled on: Trying to make Lancelot a sneering atheist, Gweneviere who in 3 scenes goes from famished, imprisoned victim to lover to hen-pecking-conscience-of-Arthur to flame-arrow-firing warrior princess was over-the-top Hollywood cliché. Then they have pagan 'native' people's talking of Romans as oppressors. Some truth here: Roman power extended into Briton for 4 centuries, longer than Europeans have been in USA, and during that time, Britain was more peaceful and prosperous than it was before and was after (for some 1,000 years). during this golden age, most Britons had become Christianized. An example would be the Briton born in 390AD who was stolen by Irish raiders, enslaved, then escaped, to return to Ireland again as a Christian missionary - Saint Patrick. As for the knights, the whole Sarmatian knights angle was laughable, as was the "Lord of the Rings" style '7 of us, 2,000 of them' and guess who wins. No resemblance beyond the knights of the real legend except the names and - guess what - they have a round table.If the point of their mish-mash of history was to help the drama, they failed; so many of the added elements just slowed the film down (booring); if it was to add historicity, they've mis-educated and failed. The 'real' King Arthur, if there was one, was a Christian and Briton who lived and ruled after the Romans had gone, after the Saxons had arrived, but before the fate of Briton was decided, during 500s AD, in the early 'dark ages'. Arthur was a king or overlord who was probably in the Wessex or Wales area, and made many battles under the banner of a dragon ("Pen-dragon" = head of dragon), fighting Saxons and/or Irish invaders. It would have made an awesome movie from this story. ... Too bad they didn't make it.They made another bowdlerized Hollywood cliché-fest, with gratuitous Christian-bashing, gratuitous sickly-child-on-a-journey (think "Day After Tomorrow"), gratuitous impossible odds (a la "LOTR" with the Saxons as orcs), but most horribly - the gratuitous junking of the "real" King Arthur legend for a far far inferior plot line.SAD. "1" OUT OF "10".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see now why this movie was a box office flop; it is criminally boring. While I know little of the King Arthur legend, I seriously doubt the Guinevere ran around in a two piece painted blue with a battle ax among armies composed entirely of men. This pretty much ruined the historical accuracy of the entire movie for me.The plot: King Arthur and his knights have served the Roman empire gallantly for years and have reached the time when they can finally return to the homes from which they were conscripted. But when the time comes, they are sent on one final, suicidal mission to rescue a family from the Nordic army.Through out the movie King Arthur pontificates on freedom and notions more advanced than enlightenment Europe. Please. Guinevere end up some kind of feminist role model and seems utterly historically inaccurate.This might have been a good hour and a half, but at an ungainly 140 minutes it is simply tedious.*1/2 star (one and one half stars out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Bruckheimer mauling...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As to be expected from a producer at the top of the film industry mountain,Bruckheimer has delivered a glossy film full of all the special effects and sounds that all of the low brow kids around the world demand for the ritual dumming down of their cultural experience. The film LOOKS good (hence the three) but, and sadly this is one hell of a BUTT!, This film is yet another huge slap in the face for the United Kingdom. Where he started to insult the memories and the dead of the United Kingdom with U571 he has continued with King Arthur, it is only marginally more of a shame that British actors played the lead roles although Clive Owen happily plays a terrible part (more down to the poor directing I think than his lack of ability as subsequent films have proved). Arthur wasn't Roman, he wasn't even Romano Briton. He was Welsh, and where the hell the idea of the Sarmatians came into it I'll never know. Arthyr Ap Meurig lived and died in the 600's. A time when he was actually in a position to fight the Saxons. His knights did exist, Camelot did exist and the round table did exist...of a sort. Camelot is a bastardization of two welsh words Caer and Melyn which means the Yellow Fort. This is a small area to be found just outside Cardiff city centre where an old iron age fort once stood. The round table is an amalgamation of a few welsh words (I forget off the top of my head)which means 'A meeting area where all are held to be equal' and as for his kinghts, well I've stood on Sir Bedeveres (Syr Bedwyr) tumulus and looked out over the Severn estuary, I've also walked over the battlefields of Arthurs reign such as Camlann and Myndd Baeden. The proof is there for all to see if a little bit of research is actually done. Bruckheimer quite plainly decided to stick his head back up his ass and trample over yet another country's rich heritage. This is one monument to superficiality!</fullReview>

Based on a more realistic portrayal of "Arthur" than has ever been presented on screen.More REALISTIC? We're not sure if Arthur ever actually existed yet we're going to be ''treated'' to a more realistic portrayal.Dear Movie-Makers, DON'T MESS WITH GREAT LEGENDS!This movie has absolutely NOTHING to do with the Arthurian legend.Its writer borrows the legend's 6 key characters: Arthur, Lancelot, Gawain, Galahad, Tristan and Guinevere, oh and there is Merlin ? again, nothing magical about him or this movie.I can only imagine that the writer thought he was the only person in the world who saw Braveheart, Last Samurai and quite possibly some other buddy western-horse riding type movie, and then thought because he makes Arthur a ROMAN that it somehow becomes more realistic. And what's with Arthur's last name: CASTOR, from the Greek mythology Castor and Pollux, Castor being the brother who was the great horse rider? Again, please stop messing with greatness.What else can I say ... Disappointed! Especially since this writer had written Gladitor ? by the way his next movie is entitled Hannibal ? any guess what it's about? Van Diesel is in it ? Geeze! Somebody help us!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VERY Disappointing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of Autherian Legends and old world england and was very disappointed (AND ANGERED!) by the end of it for making it into a weak Braveheart without the passion. I know they wanted to make it more realistic but i feel they ruined what could have been a good film!Good Points (lets me think hard there's got to be some...) 1. Good Battle scenes but not much blood. 2. Keira Knightly Stars (im a fan) 3. Mostly European actors (bless um they tried).Bad Points (Probably more than i can write)1. I have always seen the legend as very British but they make Arthur half British-italian with a desire to go to Rome - no national pride, at least Gwinavere has some. 2. The knights - only 6 of them, not British but Sarmatian (eastern European origin) with NO SHINING ARMOUR and not looking too much like knights apart from token Roman Armoury. They also talk of 'getting off this wretched island' (Infuriating) 3. Merlin (yes you know the wizard adviser of Merlin) is....Yes a rogue rebal leader of a handful of Britons, who has no mysticism or even apocathary or healing skills to his name. To add MORE INSULT Merlin previous killed Arthurs Mother!!!!! 4. Love story between Gwinevere and Arthur appears out of seemily nowhere, although you know its going to happen. There's no chemistry, no development or effort...its just shoved into the storyline. 5. Keira Knighty goes into battle with the skimpist armour - a couple of leather belts tied round her. Realistic? Not likely...just for the lads. 6. Common poems, tales and historians pin point Arthur to be in 6 AD this is in 13AD ... but i'll let that go...sort of. 7. The Saxons invade Scotland quickly with no resistance it seems from the scots - there nowhere to be seen...hmmm 8. No lady in the lake and a brief scence of how he got excalibur (because of cause hes got it in the beginning with no explanation) so they seem to quickly slot it in...though it should have started with that. 9. A whiff of cheese and a poor resemblance to braveheart which makes you wince rather than empathise with the main characters. 10. Poorly developed characters. They try but you just don't love them. One of the knights has various children but after the 1st couldn't be bothered to call them names...just numbers (is this there attempt of humour? or just making the knight thick - incidentally this knight is played by a guy who looks like he'd fit more as an east-end gangster or a lost Mitchell brother rather than a knight). 11. No affair with Lancelot-Gwinevere but fair enough Arthur has not cemented anything. Instead Lancelot seals his fate by early in the film telling how he wants his funeral - a dead cert he's gonna die then. 12. Costumes...hair...Poor. Saxon leader looks like a viking not a saxon. Only time Gwinevere looks like a "Lady" is at the wedding at the end which is so emotionless and unromantic you would have been forgiven if you thought it was an arranged married (well the director did).I could go on but i won't...I think you got the jist. I guess i was asking to much...i anticipated the uniqueness of excalibur, merlin and the friendship of the knights to battle evil to be akin to Lord of the Rings and the battles to be as emotive and bloody as Gladiator...But it falls short...it could have been so good...if i become a millionaire i'll remake it so its worthy of the Legend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the exception of Ray Winstone,the acting was very bad(in particular that of the actor playing King Arthur.) The film was historically incorrect,as far as one can assess the history of that period and the storyline was very weak. Guinevere would have been better suited playing a role in an eastern martial arts film and she generated not one iota of femininity. The scene where the Saxons were falling through the broken ice appears to have been stolen directly from Eisenstein's "Alexander Nevski"and,please correct me if I am wrong;the crossbow would not have been in use in Romano/British Britain. So,all in all,this film was a complete lot of crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No magic, no romance, no pretty costumes, no legend, no satisfaction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you love the movie "Excalibur'", despite its lame special effects, because of the magical moments in it---like the scene where Excalibur rises from the lake, held by a woman's hand, or later, when it is thrown back into the lake at Arthur's death and a hand rises to catch it, hold it, then sink back into the lake in one swift, heart-wrenching gesture--then trust me:don't go to see the new "King Arthur" film. This film has none of 'Excalibur's' magic, so you'll be bitterly disappointed. If you like the old 'Fifties film 'Knights of the Round Table' with Ava Gardner ,as Guinevere, showing what it used to mean to be a 'lady'-- gracious and sweet-voiced, restraining herself from any act of adultery even as she pines for a Lancelot who even marries another to avoid dishonoring his vows as a knight, you will be unhappy with Kiera Knightley as Guinevere. She has a dirty face throughout, even after a sponge bath, and while it's an interesting idea to make her a spunky Pict woman warrior (like Boudica, a Celtic warrior queen in the same era), there is no suggestion that she loves Lancelot. There is no pining, no sense of loving him while being loyal to Arthur, no stolen kisses, no refraining from kisses, no romance at all. For all the emotion she shows, she could just be checking out his armor when she looks at him.If you enjoyed 'Camelot' for its music and for the many beautiful costumes that Vanessa Redgrave wore, you will be unhappy with the dark green-gray-black colors of "K.A.", the skimpy, filthy rags of Guinevere, the terribly unmusical sound track, and the poor sound quality, which makes it hard to even tell who's who among Arthur's fellow Roman knights, or know what they're saying with their lower class British accents.And the legend itself has been demythologized into a series of skirmishes with Romans and Picts (called Woads here, although I always thought that was the paint they put on their faces), loud and clashing, without a touch of chivalry or magic, with the famous sword in the stone (for example) as something as practical as a headstone on a grave, not as a challenge to knights who want to be the next king, or as a sign that Arthur is the Chosen One. The entire premise that the people Arthur and his knights stem from were captured from somewhere like the steppes of Russia is never explained, despite a few words at the start of the film, and the name of this people doesn't ring any bells. It's also not clear, at least on one viewing of the film, why these people end up in Britain (then a Roman outpost), either. And why has the whole story been set at Hadrian's Wall, farther north than is usually considered Arthur's country, usually thought to be around Glastonbury in south-western England, or in Cornwall?( I don't know where it was filmed, but it looks chillier and damper than even parts of 'Excalibur', which was filmed in Ireland, but which at least has lots of lush green, plus blossoms that magically awaken (thanks to very bad special effects, but who cares?)on the Waste Land when Arthur and his knights ride out to confront his evil bastard son, Mordred.)(By the way, according to archaeological evidence shown on the History Channel, the fort at Hadrian's Wall had Roman baths as well as decent quarters for those in charge. You'd never know this from this film, where Arthur and his knights start out dirty and don't even stop to wash or change before meals and meetings. This is the grunge version of the tales. I was longing to see them lounging in one of the Romans' best inventions, if they had to be living at a Roman outpost, but no. The director seemed determined to make them as grubby as possible--a grunge approach to the story. Worst of all, Merlin looks like he should be begging in some ugly urban center, there is no Morgan La Fay, and anything like Camelot is hard to imagine. In fact, there are none of the legendary figures and places. What's left? Nothing that gives much satisfaction, I'm afraid.The film is unlovable and unlovely. With no magic, no romance, no pretty costumes and no legend, and a forgettable soundtrack, and with the chilly, plain Clive Owen as Arthur, 'King Arthur' has little to move the heart or thrill the spirit. In fact, Arthur's attempt to free the natives Britons and tell them that they are inherently free (a complete anachronism) seems more an echo of the Iraq War than anything else, but even that fails to stir one's blood.</fullReview>

I haven't read any reviews before I've seen this movie so my hopes were pretty high after the opening credits stated the movie is based on latest "historical findings" - yeah right, this movie comes as close to history as Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Note to British, please do not try to make movies Hollywood style, it's not worth it and it will only make you look bad. 3 out of 10, and 2 points out of 3 are for some nice nature shots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film could have been great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had the potential to be a great guy flick like Gladiator, Braveheart, Wild Bunch, Seven Samurai, etc. Clive Owen as Arthur possess a commanding presence and his fellow knights are extremely loyal and devoted and would have rode with him to hell if he asked them to. The presence of the beautiful Keira Knightley engaging in hand to hand combat in a lightly clad outfit, while men have wisely chosen to wear armor, ruins the credibility of the entire picture. Keira without a doubt is a lovely and very sexy woman bringing much to films like Pirates of the Carribbean and Bend it like Beckham. In spite of her exquisite beauty, Franzoni insists upon showing the audience that she is a much better fighter than scores of savage barbarian lusting for blood-she unbelievably manages to whup all challengers. I wonder what sort of politically correct point is being made by showing her engaging in hand to hand combat? Franzoni did the right thing in Gladiator by keeping women out of the fighting. As a former soldier, I'd be willing to bet that Keira would have been slain in the first 5 minutes of hand to hand combat. Women simply lack the physical strength and endurance to swing a heavy sword and kill barbarians in their prime. Keira is no Vasquez or Ripley from the movie Aliens. This film impales itself on the altar of political correctness by trying to have the audience believe that women can kill just as savagely as men-they simply can't and it is the reason why women are still barred from infantry units in the Army and Marine Corps. Instead of joining the ranks of other top notch action films, this film falls into the ranks of 2nd rate films which deserve to be watched only once or possibly twice because it panders to a segment of the audience and films which pander are rarely first rate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But this movie is anything but misunderstood. The beautiful scenery and brooding atmosphere don't make up for the poor writing and formulaic plot.Clive Owen is great. He's a subtle, powerful actor. His eyes alone are capable of showing strength, experience, sorrow, and amazement, all at once.He epitomizes the strong, silent type. No one better to be cast as the legendary King Arthur. His character arc is one of the only believable aspects of the film. I owe it mostly to Owen's nuanced performance, as the writing unfortunately does not support him adequately. According to the script, Arthur's allegiance to Rome is fueled, not by his love of the military, but rather his love of Roman philosophy. Apparently this love informs his compassionate approach as a leader, and turns his loyalties further away from Rome. But this motivation is only given cursory explanation. Repeatedly, Arthur shouts out, 'This is for freedom,' or 'We are all equal.' Even though his passion is believable, we never learn much more about the reasoning behind these generalized statements.Guinevere, played by Keira Knightly, is given some 'girl power' as a rebellious pagan, capable of fighting with the men. But her story is undermined by her laughable romance with Arthur. True to formula, Arthur 'rescues,' her, and within minutes her attempts at seduction begin. Happily this is undercut by a shift in the plot involving fellow rebel 'Merlin,' but unfortunately this part of the story is also under-written. We are given no information about Guinevere's connection to Merlin, especially considering the character's young age. Knightly is barely 20, and it shows. This is nothing remarkable by Hollywood standards, but her performance shows a lack of life experience.Costume and make-up choices for Guinevere were equally laughable; she wears full glamour makeup for the majority of the picture. Later she appears in the costumer's interpretation of pagan warrior garb (a few leather straps and some blue face paint), which is equally unbelievable as effective coverage for battle.The formulaic screenwriting undermines the supporting cast of knights as well. It uses the typical action film technique of giving each knight their obligatory character highlight, or sympathetic moment, so we can be sure to spot them when they fall.In triumphant moments, the underdeveloped theme of 'freedom' returns. Considering England's history, this so-called freedom would be in question for centuries to come. It would have been far more interesting to see how Arthur actually united England in the years that followed. Unfortunately this film instead shows Arthur massacring many Britons, spouting this 'talking point' as an afterthought.I was really disappointed, given the claim about historical accuracy. For an hour and forty minute film, too much time given to battle scenes (which, apart from one scene on ice, were not very memorable). Not enough time was spent fleshing out the script. Or to be fair, perhaps those parts of the script ended up on the cutting room floor. But you could get just as much out of watching the previews of this movie; there's just not much more to it. If you're a fan of Clive Owen, then by all means... But otherwise, don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard that this film was coming out back in the spring, I was excited. I had finished an entire session of analyzing "Le Morte d'Arthur" in my AP British Literature class and I wrote a 35 page paper about the topic. So, I was thinking, "What a great way to apply my knowledge to this film!"Of course, that's not how it turned out.1. The action scenes could have been done much better. Sure, the strategies that the archers used were interesting, and Artorius' attack against the Saxons seemed to be well-planned out, but there wasn't enough blood to be convincing. When a sword is pulled out of the body, there should be blood coming out of the body, right? 2. This particular King Arthur was based on the Roman general Ambrosius, whom existed several hundred years earlier than the more popular King Arthur. After doing a fair amount of research on him, I concluded that the battle was in the right place, but there should have been a reference about Arthur being the recorded Ambrosius.3. Guinevere and Merlin didn't live as Pictis. Period. I liked that Guinevere had a more powerful part as an action hero rather than a damsel in distress, but she seemed to come out of nowhere.4. The acting could have been better; Owens' lines were cheesy at times and choppy at others, but he did make the best of it. Ioan Gruffud was a good choice to be Lancelot; the relationship that he and Owens had as their characters was done with as much as they could give it.Overall, it could have been done better. I give this a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a waste of time, but disappointing in retrospect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like these kind of historical period movies. And although I'm not asking the movie to be precisely historically accurate, I could definitely tell that this movie was stretched and fashioned to appeal to contemporary pop audiences. That was disappointing. I'm no King Arthur (the Mallory literary work) aficionado, but I felt the names Lancelot, Galahad, Merlin and Guinevere -- those names I do recognize -- had no comfortable place in this movie. Their characters could have been otherwise named to leave the pretense behind. Okay, so Arthur is a do-gooder, even when strong-armed to risk the lives of his band of "Merrymen", oops, wrong story, I mean knights of the "hey it really was round" table a.k.a the Sarmation Warriors, conscripted into the Roman legions to defend that godforsaken outpost in Britain. They fight not for Rome, but for each other and especially for Arthur -- a soldier's code in many respects -- all for one and one for all. And oh, beware, the Saxons are coming, the Saxon's are coming! That adds the intrigue (not to mention menace) needed to set this thing off into a strategic war formula, against all odds. And the Saxons take no prisoners: resistance is futile and there will be no assimilation.Despite my attempted sarcasm, I was not mad about seeing this movie. It's a guy-flick. But I was put out by the total rip-off of the battle scene ending from The Patriot with Mel Gibson and Jason Isaacs (not that it was original itself, but it is where I remembered it, and it was better there). Clive Owen is a likable Arthur and a long way from the sniper assassin chasing Jason Bourne in the Bourne Identity and then romancing Angelina Jolie in Beyond Borders -- my previous recollections of him. The rest of Arthur's Musketeers are a cool group. Guinevere seemed a bit contrived given that she was in a death dungeon and pretty near death just days before all of the fighting started. How many movies has Knightley been in lately? Stop a minute and eat something for goodness sakes.One thumb up, one abstention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining as a pseudo-period action movie, but not very historical at all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a bad bit of light entertainment if you forget all about the opening blurb which claims it to be historically based. While there is indeed much research on the subject of the real basis for Arthur, this film matched that research poorly, and compounded it with numerous stereotypes that match the Dark Ages world very poorly.For a start, the fact that the Empire is withdrawing its last troops from Britain means that this film is set in exactly the year 407 AD, which is approximately a century too early for the other events depicted. And in the fifth century, there were no monks in Britain, the Pope had no authority to command Roman troops, heresy wasn't punishable by death, Pelagius wasn't executed, Artorius Castus and his Sarmatian foederati (who numbered about 2,000 strong) had been dead for two centuries, and I could go on and on but you're probably bored already. The biggest thing though was that by this time, Rome had ruled Britain for 363 years, the Britons considered themselves to BE Romans, and far from wanting to drive Rome out they felt abandoned when the legions left.Still, if you ignore the claims to being historical, it's OK. The action scenes are fine, Clive Owen's Arthur was nicely acted, and the tactical scenes were unusually good (apart from the modern PC thing of all the female archers). Minor Spoiler alert:If everyone was so terrified of travelling north of Hadrian's Wall, what was a noble Roman family doing up there AT ALL, never mind in an unfortified villa with just four guards?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Arthur Can't Reinvent the Magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Arthur is that movie that we've all seen before. It's the same and yet we're drawn back again and again to see what hot new faces have been cast in this one. Well, this latest version on the story of Arthur and his knights stars the fresh faces or Clive Owen and Kiera Knightley. Both are good looking and fire-hot in their careers. Still, that promises nothing for the quality of the films they displace their million dollar mugs in.This version claims to be the true story. No magic nonsense but simply fact. Well, if that mean we get pointless dialogue between the knights and the famous sword in the stone becomes the sword in the dirt mound (that gets no more than sixty-seconds of screen time), then maybe we preferred the original version. After all, we're looking for entertainment here. Fact comes from the History channel, which serves as the filler in the commercials during your more important program.Both Kiera Knightley and Clive Owen have shown range in their careers, although each does not span more than a couple of years. It is safe to say that they both do well enough in King Arthur that whatever hardships the film endures, they will go on. This is just a speed bump. Their performances belong somewhere else for they are both strong and well intended.Actually, it is surprising that a movie with this team would come up looking like a freshman's effort. Directed by Anthony Fuqua (Training Day) and produced by the big guns man Jerry Bruckheimer (Pirates of the Caribbean, Bad Boys) you would expect a movie of epic proportions. The only place epic begins to describe Arthur is in the fact that it stole its music from one. Yes, the beautiful sound in the background is trying to ride off the success of The Lord Of The Rings score. If it felt more original it would be more appropriate here. There is no actual problem with King Arthur except that none of it feels new to the audience. Everything from the ?Rings' score to the battle scenes that feel reminiscent of those from the TV movie Spartacus that was aired by the USA channel last spring. And the entire King Arthur notion is not new. It's been around for year in many films and books. Why should we make another addition to that collection if it's no different than the last? It's like rerecording a CD over and over again instead of writing new material. We like the artist and want to hear more of their sound but with each single there should be an artistic growth. With movies we expect no less. **1/2/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice looking rambler of a movie, but even the great actors/actresses couldn't save it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Arthur had a lot of good in it. Intense battle scenes, good imagery, great actors etc. But alas it falls into Jerry Bruckheimer's current trend, of using stories so overused that the hackneyed poor plot can not be saved by great actors. Look at his last few, great actors, awful movies.The biggest failing of King Arthur is the failure to set up a major conflict. Arthur meets the 'villan' just before the last battle, with mere minutes left in the film. Arthur has no clear objectives and rambles a long through the movie, until the end. The knights have no stake in the final battle, and just what you'd expect happens. At the end you will be left wondering how you got to where you did, and why the film took so long to get there with so little set up.Jerry tries to set up some emotion with women and children being in danger. It doesn't work. He tries to make the fights believable. It doesn't work. He tries to get us to feel for the characters. It doesn't work. He tries to get the feel of "Gladiator." It doesn't work. All in all, the stellar actors as Clive Owen (who really does a smashing job as Arthur) and Kiera Knightly, could not save the poorly written screenplay, lackluster plot (should you be able to imagine one up), and ultimately very average movie. This movie may appeal to hardcore movie addicts, but if you are an occasional movie goer looking for a good action film, wait for another movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It is closer to the truth than any other movie about King Arthur. Yes there was some literary license but for the most part I found it more real and believable than any "Knight in Shining Armor fantasy" about King Arthur that has been put out in the last Century... I liked it because it made the knights more like real humans instead of the perfect Chivalry living Holy Warriors of the Fantasy stories. I also liked the way it portrayed the Church as a bunch of conniving lowlife scumbags which they were. There should be no holy cups, lances, 16th century ceremonial armor and Saxons/Vikings in horned helmets. To me the time period at the end of the Roman Conquest of Britain is much more interesting than the later time period when the fantasy Arthur was supposed to have lived. I would recommend this movie to anyone...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps worse than being awful this movie is plain mediocre. It just sits there like a box of hair, never moving to the viewer nor ever impressive. Just there. I know this was an attempt at a historical telling of the story of King Arthur, but why bother doing that with a film? Why not watch a good documentary? If you want to drain the mythic quality out of a great myth, then save it for a History Channel special. Failing that, this movie even failed to even feel 'real.' Peter Jackson and the LOTR series felt much more 'real', despite being an absolutely unabashedly fictional creation of Tolkien's mind and the Weta art department. For a much more exciting telling of Arthurian legend, I highly recommend Excalibur.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start this comment by paying my respects to Clint Eastwood. In his movie "White Hunter, Black Heart", Clint has a very entertaining explanation of what people mean when they refer to "Hollywood" and, more importantly, why this is so. I will not quote the exact text from Clint's movie but only urge everyone who has not seen the film to grab the DVD (or VHS). Anyway, let me sum up my impressions about King Arthur by saying that, as far as production is concerned, it is, for better and for worse, the epitome of what many expect from a typical Hollywood blockbuster- and particularly from one produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. In other words, expect the film to spare no money to hit on you with all the available stupid (and sometimes "dirty") tricks. The script would not be worth any specially good or bad mention if it did not take itself SO seriously. The worst is perhaps that this new version of the Arthur legend is presented to you on screen as being the first historically accurate one, based on recently found archaeological evidence. I watched the movie on the R1 DVD and I was very surprised that there were perhaps only 15 second of the supplementary material featuring an historian talking about the historical basis for the movie. I therefore did a quick search on the internet and ... SURPRISE! The film is simply a very poor mix of various currently fashionable CONFLICTING reconstructions of the events underlying the King Arthur myth. The recipe that was used for this particular meal could be summed up like this: take a character who lived in the second century, make him live in the sixth and do things no one has ever really done. And replace the final touch of lemon by an apparently perfectly innocent, but completely dishonest on-screen introduction. No to mention many parts of the movies feel like rip-offs from recent and/or not so recent truly great films. To make myself completely clear: I am NOT attacking anyone directly, and particularly not the screenwriter. I am just trying to describe the end product.The director does all he can to salvage the picture and, to a certain extent, he succeeds remarkably well. So do all actors, with kudos to Clive Owen in the title role.There is anyway one truly positive aspect of the film. I have never heard of any other movie trying to picture the interaction between the late roman world and the surrounding European cultures. "King Arthur" at least tries to, whatever what might think of the end-result. I'd like to see more movies around this thought-provoking theme.To sum up, let me say this: If you don't mind being cheated, as long as it is done with professionalism, this movie is for you. If you do mind, well...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing that strikes you about this 'realistic' attempt at the legendary Arthurian tales is how haphazard it is. No structure, poor introduction of characters and slipshod editing rule the roost here. Second is how uninspiring and dull this, one the most famous of all legends, is presented. When compared to true epic films like 'Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King', 'Gladiator', or even the much maligned recent effort of 'Troy', this dreary 'adventure' falls flat. There is little feel for the proto-medieval, ( for want of a better word ) 'magic' and the Arthurian mysticism and wonder. Merlin is simply a decrepid tramp who lives in the woods with his 'Woads'. Where is the Sword in the Stone? The Lady of the Lake? Or any relation to the known legends? Sadly they are missing....A brief mention of the acting. Clive Owen makes an unconvincing stab at Arthur, portraying him in a rather two-dimensional fashion. Ioan Gruffudd is given nothing, but is still much more interesting ( those who have seen the TV series 'Hornblower' will know what he can do given a proper script ) than Owen. Keria Knightley is again two-dimensional and has little dialouge of note. The villian is even less well developed, just a 'bad guy', with a curious accent, and even more curious hair. The tin-hat is put on though by an atrocious Ray Winstone, who spends most of the movie talking about the length of his organ, or taking a leak with said organ. All in all if this movie had changed the name of the characters, and removed the briefly glimpsed 'Round Table' at the beginning, it could have been any generic, innacurate period piece - which is not what the Arthurian legends are all about. Very average. *1/2 out of *****</fullReview>

In a land in the dark ages freedom was not the first thing that people probably thought about.. More like "A bowl of oats"! or "death to our enemies". Most Roman soldiers and mercenaries would be thinking more about plunder and gold than freedom.Interesting the saxons shouted something that sounded like Slakta fienden which is Swedish for "butcher the enemy". A bit more rousing than "freedom"..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I initially was content with King Arthur's medieval atmosphere and tone, given that I don't mind grey films, which was one criticism. In this case I didn't care that the violence was PG. The acting was adequate although Ray Winstone (Bors) reminded me more of a British Soccer Hooligan. The film eventually dragged for me and strained my credibility on a number of points. Firstly, I just couldn't see Arthur and his seven or so "knights" single handedly being asked to traipse around the British landscape like some bad gun-slinger/Conan movie (I identified more with Arnold in Conan by the way). Secondly, it made no sense that Arthur kept referring to his cronies as "my knights" since he never actually became king until the end of the movie. Who knighted them and how can an indentured soldier of the Roman Empire have the status of knight? Even a squire has higher status than a slave-soldier. How pretentious can you get?In the end the movie dragged and I didn't feel the sense of connection Arthur had for his people. It seemed as if he hardly knew them, but was willing to make the ultimate sacrifice. The Excalibur explanation also seemed weak and devoid of the meaning that the legend gave it. It seemed almost pointless to include it. I also expected more of Merlin, who really didn't say much or earn his "sorcerer" title. It's unclear, other than Merlin's influence, why the Britons even bothered to make him king. I guess it's possible that he organized the final battle, but you didn't see that in the movie. The only ones he seemed to be motivating were his own buddies, the handful of knights, who for some reason were the only ones who had horses. In short this film needed more depth and more of a connection between the myth and fact. Instead the screen writer just used the ambiguity of history to make up his own film based on a smattering of general historical facts.</fullReview>

Keira Knightley and Clive Owen do their not insignificant best, but they are unable to compensate for the way this film was shot. If it had been shot differently, if it had been more focused on the characters...but all we get is a camera weaving through a blurred haze of growling fur-clad Saxons and howling blue-painted Woads (who could have been so much more interesting!).

		<fullReview>I like to go into movies with an open mind. I see people bashing this movie and I see people supporting this movie, so I figured I'd be able to enjoy it even if it isn't accurate.Alas, I was even disappointed on that scale."New Archeological evidence" must have been something they dug up in their sandbox because it is SO inaccurate and impossible that it hurts.Historically, I expected inaccuracies and I got them. Making all of Arthur's knights Almatians for one.. Bors was the King of Amorica, geez. Picts wore woad, not celts. Celts didn't let their women fight (usually). Arthur lived in a time after most of the romans had withdrawn from the Isle.So, before I went to this movie, I told myself that it would be historically inaccurate. So I wasn't surprised that within the first five minutes, they took everything I'd known and threw it out the window.I'm the sort that can enjoy a movie that breaks with the story, so long as the movie itself has a story. But..this one doesn't. Well, it does, but it is SO weak. The last battle makes me want to choke. NO sane general would let the enemy breach the walls. Anyway.Yeah, the story was weak. So, in conclusion:On the positive side: Lancelot/Horatio Hornblower is good eyecandy. ;) So is Guinevere (but if she was a celt, why not spell it Gwenhyvar?) The battle scenes are relatively OK. Some good one liners.Bad side? Story is weak. Historical inaccuracies will have ANY Arthurian fan squirming in their seat. You'll leave thinking 'Spiderman 2 would have been a better use of my money'I even caught my date checking his watch :/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want a plot, read some of the other reviews. They cover more than enough and there's no need to repeat them.This is probably as close to the "true" Arthur as has been portrayed in a movie to date. If you've followed any of the research into the origins of the legend of Arthur, then you might find this film mildly interesting.To their credit, I think the main characters did a fairly good job with what they had. Unfortunately, what they had was almost nothing. I struggled for hours trying to figure out why exactly the movie just wasn't entertaining given that Clive Owen, as Arthur did an excellent job. Knightly is a talented actress, but she wasn't given much to work with. Skarsgard is also an excellent actor but again, not much of a part to work with. The dialog is incredibly weak.The movie seemed like a really weak version of Braveheart overall. It was as if they had taken Braveheart, removed all the good dialog, weakened the battle scenes, and packaged it back up with new faces.While it's possible you may care about Arthur and his knights, you're just not going to care about anyone else in this movie, and that's really where it fails miserably, I think. It's a shame because the "true story" of Arthur and his knights is as fascinating as the legend it spawned and better writing and direction really could have done something with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Truest Part of this Story--it is BAD, BAD, BAD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The legend of King Arthur is a strong part of English and French literature. Arthur has been the shining example of a hero who stood up to the entire Saxon army and held that army at bay. Arthur was the representation of what was good in man, about honor, dignity, justice and chivalry. Historians have found very little about King Arthur and do not know if the man really existed or if he is just a legend. Myths and legends do take on a life of their own. What historians do know is that someone led a defensive at the Battle of Badon against the Saxons. There have been suggestions that Arthur was the name of a warlord who led the army for the king, but there is no proof. The Battle of Badon happened shorty after Rome left the British Isles around 400 A.D. This fact would encourage one to believe that King Arthur, if he existed, would have been wearing Roman armor. Sir Thomas Mallory, one thousands years after Arthur would have existed, added to the tale to make the legend more appealing to the French people. To do this, he made Lancelot the hero of the story. Mallory added Camelot, Galahad, Gawain and Excalibur to the tale to give it a French appeal.This movie did not capture the essence of King Arthur. It is hard to capture the feel of the man when you do not have a British director who understands the importance that Arthur had on their culture. The acting was lacking. None of the performers stirred any emotion that would make you believe that they were legendary knights of the realm. The script was poorly written and it had a great deal of holes about the Saxons, about the Woads, and about the Romans. I cannot say more about this poor film, but I would suggest that fans of King Arthur would watch Excalibur. While Excalibur expresses the French view, of the story, and the Christian additives--it is a fine movie. If you have an opportunity, read the series of books by Jack Whyte on King Arthur. The first book in the series is "The Skystone". Whyte's books add the flavor of the historical times with the legend of King Arthur. Had the film makers wanted to really do a film with a historical feel, they should have consulted Jack Whyte and not the clueless individuals they had to seek to make a movie this lacking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie should have been called "A Legionnaire Story in a Far Away Land"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard that Bruckheimer was going to do a retelling of the Arthurian legend based on a more historical accounting, the first thing that piqued my interest was how he was going to work in the explosions. At most, I expected some Greek fire. It's almost a given with the guy and I have to say that I wasn't disappointed. So yes, we see fireballs...that really don't do much else other than provide an excuse for pyro.The movie is the 'historical' take on the Arthurian legend sharing little, if anything, with it aside from the names and that is probably its greatest problem. Strip that away and all you have is a story about a Roman legionnnaire fighting for his ideals in a relatively unknown battle that only history majors would probably enjoy picking apart. You are now stuck with a whole new story to try and appreciate. Add to this a cast of characters whose only roles seem to be in filling in the holes where the more famous Arthurian names should go and you've got a movie trying to tell a whole new legend. The characters appeared to be trying to fit into roles suddenly cut free of whatever expectations may have been placed on their shoulders and you could see it on screen. None of Arthur's knights in this film were particularly memorable except for maybe Lancelot. Guinevere was memorable because she's the rebel girl flavor of the month for the film, and Arthur...can't forget him because he's supposed to be the focal point.Instead, the film feels like it's trying to decide what kind of story its supposed to tell and fails by delivering boring characters who disappear just as quickly into the fog that infects nearly every frame. Clive Owen's character of Arthur seems to be the only one with any direction. The others feel left to their own devices. They do nothing to inspire the audience to care with them and when they did in short lived moments, it was never carried and soon forgotten beneath the gratuitous amounts of fog and snow that litter the frames. But wait, even with such a troubled collection of people, surely the plot would save the day? Don't bet on it. It would have required Russell Crowe's character in "Gladiator" to come back from the grave for a cameo to do that, and why not? David Franzoni is the same writer that did the work on "Gladiator". And Antoine Fuqua has proved that he can direct greats like Denzel Washington.So what happened? I'm not sure, but something happened on the way from Rome to England with the plot. It's riddled with quite a few holes, one of which conveniently removes an annoying character. I don't think I've ever seen this degree of convenience since ID4 when Microsoft Windows saved the day because the aliens happen to use the same software we do. It's that obvious and its not the only gaping hole. The flow of the movie is not much better. Just as the characters are deciding how to inspire the audience, the narrative is trying to decide where to go while meandering all over England until its finally cornered and has no where else to drag the audience to.The villains are in even worse shape coming straight out of the local convenience store from the aisle reserved for flavors of "Typical Marauders". They might as well take the form of a dark cloud floating overhead because that's as much personality as you'll get out of these guys. There is some kind of tension between the leader (Speak Softly but Wield a Huge Longsword) and his son (Evil Goatee), but they're merely there to give Arthur and his knights something to worry about and push them from one end of England to the next.There are one or two moments that were pretty exciting and unintentionally funny such as an embarrassing nod to Pearl Harbor (Bruckheimer produced that one, too). The characters can be funny at times before riding off and becoming potential cannon fodder, but the dialogue as a whole was as colorful as the stones making up Hadrian's Wall.In the end, you have a plot that seems as lost as its characters and just as uninspired. In trying to depend on the audience's appreciation for the legend to evoke the kind of 'ooohs' and 'aaahs' associated with pointing out how the characters have changed, there is little else to see in this film to prove that it can stand on its own without it.</fullReview>

Prepare for more thrills, more adventure, and more intensity as the heroic true story behind one of history's greatest legends explodes onto the screen! It is the valiant tale of Arthur (Clive Owen) and his bond of brotherhood with Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), and the loyalty of the 'Knights of the Round Table' as they fight for freedom and those they love. Also starring Keira Knightley as Guinevere, this never-before-seen 'King Arthur' is a longer, grittier, and more explicit motion picture - don't miss it!" heralds the DVD sleeve description.It seems right knightly that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this re-imagined epic, since the last major feature film re-telling of the "King Arthur and His Knights" legend was in Jerry Zucker's "First Knight" (1995), which sought to make the story more realistic. Jerry, Jerry. The trend continues. Mr. Bruckheimer's update boasts "recently discovered" evidence for the changes it makes. It is a dubious claim, of course; and, nothing is added to make the basic story more appealing. Simply put, it adds up to more special effects, and less magic. And, given the presence of luscious-lipped Ms. Knightly, the lowered sex drive is disappointing. There is a lot of penetration, though - in the over-produced battle scenes.***** King Arthur (6/28/04) Jerry Bruckheimer : Antoine Fuqua ~ Clive Owen, Ioan Gruffudd, Keira Knightley, Ray Winstone</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You too can direct a big budget disaster based upon the myths. Of course, Antoine Fuqua, director of Training Day, seems eager to show that the idea that a person can direct only what they know is true- he's a black American homeboy, and his grasp of the legends is not even slender- is true. In truth, the tales of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table are for more entertaining and grand than the déclassé tripe of The Lord Of The Rings saga, but you would not know it in this version. Instead of romance, intrigue, honor, and magic we get 'realism'- or so the director spouts over and again in his film commentary, and in the assorted extras on the DVD. But, please note the ' ' that I used around the word realism. That's because there's not a hint of it in this disaster. First off, the blood and guts fighting is laughably unreal. Ever since Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line in 1998, filmmakers have been trying to be 'real' in their violence on screen. This 'realistic' movie, however, eschews that. Yet, the Knights curse and spit, especially a Cockney Sir Bors (Ray Winstone). They also are not British, nor even French. Instead, they are from Sarmatia- a region that never produced knights in the early 5th Century, when this film is set, nor were they ever at war with the Roman Empire, as claimed. In the tales, King Arthur and his Knights are devout Christians, and Rome is little seen. In the film, Arthur is a Roman Christian in service to the Pope, Lancelot is a heathen, and Merlin (Stephen Dillane) the head of a band of forest people called Wodes who, in this 'realistic' film, never existed. In short, the film centers around Arthur's Knights' rescue of a would-be child church bishop north of Hadrian's Wall before the terrible Saxons sweep in from the North. Unfortunately, the Saxons never occupied northern Britain, they were defenders of the Isle from Scots, Picts, and Celts, and they were not marauding barbarians in the mold of the Vikings a half an eon later- all, again, in this 'realistic' movie.Gwynevere (played by the lovelier than words Keira Knightley -or is it Natalie Portman with an accent?) is a wild warrior woman in the Xena mold- possibly a Wode, although this is never definitively made clear- which she and Fuqua claim is historically accurate, although it's not, but allows the brief notion that the glimpses of her taut, lithe, nacreous bod (and nacreous is a word destined to describe Ms. Knightley's skin) in skimpy leather, in winter- mind you, will soon give way to a great romantic love scene with Arthur (the petrified Clive Owen). But, alas, the one brief romantic scene is lame, Keira stays far too clothed, and Lancelot (Ioan Gruffydd) is a total pussy who seems utterly impotent in the face of Gwyn's charms?. Now, none of these failings would matter in the least were the tale a damned good one, but the only way this script could have been passable on celluloid were someone like a Roger Corman brought in to camp it up. But, humor and camp are totally absent in this hermetically dry waste of time. So, the claims of 'realism' and historical accuracy' are the only thing this monstrosity had going for it- along with the anticipated delight of Keira Knightly in and out of leather, yet it fails miserably on both scores. And the editing is atrocious- with at least three major discontinuities in scenes where snow is seen on the ground, them mysteriously replaced by green grass a second later. Avoid this film, burn the DVD, and read Thomas Malory. To sum up- I still look forward to the day when I can ogle Ms. Knightley's taut form in the way it entered this world, but the hopes that this film would be entertaining or even passable, well- to quote Mistah Kurtz- 'He dead!'</fullReview>

It is all ridiculous, I could have written better myself.The characters are so anachronistic I expected someone to pull out a phone and call for backup on the battlefield.Just because it has a reasonable budget and a-list actors that does not make it watchable or good in any way.Plan 9 from outer space was more credible and at least we got a laugh! 2 big thumbs down!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...And this film stank a hell of a lot worse!Not only does this film TRY to re-invent King Arthur and his knights (failing horribly), but it also TRIES to boast some military tactical awareness... which is simply an insult to anyone with half a brain (oh my GOD! What happened to the horses? How did the Celts get past the wall? Why send in half your troops to be butchered?).This film SUCKS (even rips off all those trashy clichéd army films where members of a unit take turns dying for glory and honour one at a time) and I still can't believe that I paid MONEY to watch this in the pictures (should have just waited until the rental and got it then, or better yet, skipped it altogether).Dire, horrible, woeful, monstrous, crap - I could go on, but there's really no point in writing a thesaurus entry here for synonyms of BAD.I'm still unsure as to what old Ray was playing at: was he DELIBERATELY taking the pee in his role, knowing that it was a joke if film, or is the man really that bad?You decide (or better yet: DON'T - just steer clear).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a movie about King Arthur, but I don't know if it's the King Arthur we all had in mind . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Arthur came out shortly after the huge Lord of the Rings frenzy, and that is probably the only reason I went to it, being on a war movie high, and hey!! It was a movie about one of my favorite characters! Wasn't that the girl from Pirates? Sure, call a friend and let's go! And it was good . . .But what was it? Because King Arthur it wasn't.I'm not professing to be top dog on history of Camelot society and what-not, but I do know that this was not consistent with the story of Arthur. In the first place, since when was murdering Merlin the motive for his drawing the sword out of the stone? Also, his wife Guinevere and Lancelot were alleged to have an affair, and that clearly did not happen, as Lancelot died an honorable death in the end and Guinevere ended up marrying the king. It was tragically beautiful, with the hauntingly gruesome battle scenes and the steamy love affair. I guess if you rent it with the mindset that it is a creative work of art and only a movie, it will flow, but don't expect historical accuracy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks too many things</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film suffers from a number of problems. First, it claims to be historically accurate, which it isn't. Considering that the producer (Bruckheimer) is also behind the highly inaccurate CSI series, that's perhaps not entirely surprising; nevertheless, it's annoying. Because, that's the thing with the legend of King Arthur: it's a legend. It's not supposed to be historically correct, and therefore creating a supposedly 'historically correct' version of it is doomed from the outset. Still, 'King Arthur' manages to stack several more historical errors on top of that.Then again, there are other aspects to a film, but again, it doesn't fare very well there. The acting is only so-so, the dialogue isn't any better, and most of all, the film is slow.It's very pleasant to look at, though: the photography is well done, the landscapes beautiful, and so are the actors. You'll be hard-pressed to find ugly people in this film. Again, the Bruckheimer presence is felt, with the emphasis on looks and blatant disregard for any credibility.So if you're in for some mindless entertainment and eye-candy, look no further. The lovely Keira Knightly, especially towards the end of the film, is almost reason enough for that. However, if you want a film with real substance, this is not for you. In other words, it's a typical contemporary Hollywood film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Arthur and the Cowboys of the Round Table (SPOILERific commentary)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not exactly "The Wild Bunch" or "Saving Private Ryan", but it's still the story of a lone battalion, on their last detail, finding a reason to fight one more time. They get drafted, they find out they're not the good guys, they find the good fight to fight, leading to the big showdown at an abandoned outpost, against impossible odds...Not a movie I'd recommend my kids to watch for school credit. It's a re-imagining of the Arthur myth, like Burton's "Planet of the Apes." But the movie uses the legend to dress up the American chestnut of the imperialist soldier discovers the half of his heart that ties him to the land, uniting a fractured people against the forces that threaten to obliterate. It's "Dances With Wolves." It's "The Last Samurai". Heck, Merlin's a Wiccan shaman that anoints Arthur king of the Britons! All they were missing was a harmonica solo and Gabby Hayes. Against those standards, "King Arthur" is found wanting. It's missing a couple of scenes to make it a banner addition to the genre, and nothing new to help it escape the limitations. Maybe a couple more scenes with Arthur's knights, to show him through their eyes. Or maybe a couple more solo scenes of the King, to hear his mind trying to contemplate his destiny. Decent Arthur, decent Gwen, great villains, underused knights, laughable 'natives', one cool fight in four - add up to a half-great movie. Five of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a student of medieval studies, I thought it was my duty to go see this film. Do not see it. Do not waste your money. I have probably seen and read over 50 versions of the King Arthur myth, some being better then others. However, I have never seen anything even remotely as horrible as this. I don't even know why they called it "King Arthur", since all the character, places and events are completely manipulated and twisted to fit a Hollywood standard. Guinevere wears practically nothing throughout the film. Lancelot is a foul potty-mouth. Arthur is a dark, moody creep. Merlin is Guinevere's father (?!). Who knows where Morgan Le Faye, Viviane, the Faeries, all the other knights of the round table or even a fragment of the original storyline are. They tried to make the myth darker and more powerful, but only succeeded in sounding goofy and silly. They tried to make it more "historically accurate", and so changed dates, places, people and what the technology/clothing would be in 500-800 AD. "The story behind the legend". Right. This is what I have spent my life studying. This is NOT HISTORY. This is a couple guys in Hollywood who decided to add some crude jokes, scantily-clothed women, hunks on horses, swords, torture, and call it "King Arthur" so people would go see it. Please, don't waste your money. Instead, go see or read a good version of this timeless tale. "This Mists of Avalon", or "Excalibur", or even "Camelot"!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anachronistic and Formulaic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part of the appeal of Arthurian legend over the centuries was the mystical and supernatural elements in them. This film takes all that out and offers nothing in return.Historians have been trying to trace the historical origins of King Arthur for years. If he ever existed, he would have certainly been very different from the figure portrayed in myth. This film presents a possible candidate for the historical Arthur, but he gets obscured by historical inaccuracies and anachronism. The epilogue to the film mentions "new archaeological evidence" but we don't see any of that. This movie fails as a convincing historical drama, so what we are left with is a sword-fight movie.This doesn't offer anything new as a sword flick. A ragtag bunch of brothers in arms, a conniving politician who screws them out of what is due, a quest to rescue someone that contains a moral crisis, one of the buddies gets killed, a climactic battle where more buddies get killed, and the main protagonist is left to ponder the significance of what just happened. We've all seen this many times before.This film tries to make up for its shortcomings by going the Braveheart route with anachronistic references to "freedom" and human rights. These notions did not exist until the 18th century. If King Arthur ever existed, he was certainly not an early Rousseau.Keira Knightley was alluring as always, this time adding the Charlie's Angels "Girl Power" element.It's a mediocre movie that is not a complete waste of time, but it won't change anything about movies or how we look at the past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is brave to set the legend within the context of its real historical setting. But what happens is a mismatch of events, is it history, fiction or legend. What is it? So as one who is interested in the richness of this historical period I find it a curiosity. It asks the question of what happens when the Arthurian legend is set in its real historical environment. But does it answer the question? The legend is supposed to be set within a Romanised Celtic culture with the Celtic part running though the legend. But the characters are just strangers to the culture and traditions that the legend reflects. Those who love the legend, love the Celtic mysticism but it's not there, or it's rationalised out.The role of the church is interesting and I'm sure there are many others who are better qualified to comment than I am. But it seems that the church view is characteristic of the 16th century than the late Roman era.I long for movies about this period of history, and would love the see the stories of Hengest and Horsa, King Canute, or Alfred the Great on the screen instead of Arthur who didn't really exist.</fullReview>

Why bother making a war movie if the tactics to win the battle are just plain stupid and flawed. Character development was almost absent from this film.

This movie is sheer nonsense, a Hollywood-style sandals movie about someone called Arthur who pretends to be a knight fighting for Rome's glory. I don't mind calling the Picts Celts (which tey were NOT), but if you consider the historic facts as known today the plot ist ludicrous: As a Saxon, would you sail from Germany to Schottland and attack the Hadrian's Wall in order to plunder England? That's a long and bloody way round if you're heading for London. Dialogue? Well, there is much talking about Rome's Glory and its failings and it's treachery, but nothing of importance. In fact, you won't learn anything about the character's motivations. Action? Plenty of undistinguished fighting. Keira Knighley is the only reason to watch this movie.</fullReview>

The knights staggered around like they were on drugs half the time, Keria Knightly couldn't stop pouting and sounded too posh, Clive Owen just looked embarrassed, Lancelot died half way through and, worst of all, although the film claimed to be based on the 'true story behind the legend' they got it completely wrong. Yes, there was believed to be a real king Arthur but he was actually a Saxon! Yes, a Saxon! Not a half-witted roman, god fearing sissy! a Saxon! And that brings me neatly on to my next point. What possessed them to put merlin into the story. Oh god, the cheese factor was on overload.The only person(s) who made it slightly watchable was the knights. Yes, I did criticised them but they brought a much needed comic relief to the whole sorry affair, especially Ray Whinstone with his bastards.Overall, I recommend you see this film if you don't like strong violence, don't like sex scenes, don't like good acting and are under the age of 12.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film tries to tell, well, ehm, revolutionary (they claim it's based on new researches), story of King Arthur. Original legend of King Arthur comes from Chronicles of Bishop of Wales, Geoffrey (1136), next evolved in story of Knights of The Round Table by Wace of Jersey and also Chrétien de Troyes whose created oldest complete version. In the movie however there are huge changes. The only common things are Knight Arthur and some friends using round table and living in Britain. Time of action is moved back about 200 years to the folding of Roman Empire. There is no magic (of any possible kind). Well, I have known all of this but hoped (at least) for good batalistic scenes, but was disappointed. They are really bad, desperately trying to copy Braveheart but failing due to lack of skills of director and low budget. Very irritiating thing is 'modern' language and 'demands' of characters which contrasts heavily with claimed historical background. Overall movie is very boring, badly acted with irritiating dialogues. The only thing that kept me from escaping from cinema was hope for good battle at the end. I can only say that there was a battle. :-\. You can waste 2 hours of your life for many other things and not pay for it. Sometimes movie is really bad but there is one or two things you worth seeing. Not in this case. 1/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historical Arthur? Ha!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If someone proposes to give an historical version of some legend, there is a lot of freedom to change the story. However, one should at least get the history that we do know right. This movie blunders on so many counts that I cringed throughout. Let me list some:1. Our story starts in 452 with Lancelot plucked from a Sarmatian town in what is now the Ukraine. First, the Sarmatians were displaced by the Goths hundreds of years earlier. And the Goths were pushed out by this fellow named Attilla the Hun. Attila was busy sacking Gaul at this time and causing Rome a great deal of trouble. So how is it these Roman cavalry men have time to ride into lands controlled by the Huns to get this child and send him to Britain, a post that Rome abandoned in 410 AD? Also, why is some Sarmatian child named Lancelot (that's French). All this in the first few minutes.2. Skip forward 15 years to 467. So, the Saxons are invading. Fine, that really did happen but these Saxons are landing well north of Hadrian's Wall; that would be somewhere in Scottland. For those not in the know, the Saxons invaded mostly along the east coast of Britain so these fellows were clearly lost.3. Crossbows? What the heck are the Saxons doing with Crossbows? The crossbow didn't arrive on the scene until the middle ages, long after Arthur. BTW, archery was not particularly effective in warfare at this time since the bows of the day didn't pierce armor and shield, but in this movie archery is the key to victory.4. Arthur is a Christian in the movie and follows the teachings of Pelagius, who we are led to believe he had met. Problem is, Pelagius lived from roughly 360 to 420, so he's been dead for more than 40 years though another character tells us he died only last year (466 AD).5. Stirrups? Roman cavalry did not have stirrups. As I recall, the stirrup was introduced to England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. While I'm on the subject of horses, how is it that 7 knights are so impressive? Arthur's entire command prior to the appearance of Merlin's Woads is himself and 6 men.6. Trebuchets? Okay, now you've gone too far. The otherwise primitive and tattooed Woads somehow have a medieval contraption that flings firebombs? Whatever, I don't care anymore.Now I'll admit I had to look up the part about Pelagius but the rest I just know off the top of my head. This is not stuff that is hard to discover so the writers clearly made no effort at all. So, we have discarded the legend of Arthur to create an Arthur in a history that never happened.</fullReview>

How on earth could KK be seriously compared to Natalie Portman--talk about over-promotion and hype. No wonder KK is now telling the world she is just learning her trade!! Still my guess is that while KK will not establish herself in the larger American market, there will always be a steady stream of work coming from the UK---Working Title is a particularly chauvinistic studio and no doubt will stick with her even as her limitations get more and more exposed. As for Bruckenheimer--the uninspiring Disney will inevitably stick with him---which probably says more about Disney than Bruckenheimer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You thought it would be bad? Think again - it's even worse.Even though producer Jerry Bruckheimer has made some good films in the past, King Arthur isn't one of them. The film is essential his answer to Lord Of The Rings, resembling it very much. And when I say that it resembles it, I mean that it REALLY resembles it. So much in fact, that it borders on being ridiculous. It has Galadriel's speech in the beginning. It has the battle of Helm's Deep. It has Boromir's death. It has an old wizard guiding Arago - sorry - Arthur towards his destiny. It has the crowning of Aragorn. It has Aragorns battle with Lurtz and a Boromir-Faramir type relationship. What it doesn't have, however, are memorable characters, a good script, pretty locations and an interesting storyline. In other words, it has none of the things that made LotR great. Sounds like a recipe for disaster? It surely is. King Arthurgorn is in many ways the worst thing that invaded cinemas the world over in the last couple of months.It does start off promising, though. The film follows the life of King Arthur according to existing - yet controversial - theories about the events that inspired the legend. It's a novel approach, and for a moment it seems to work. The beginning has a hint of depth and some truly funny lines, most of them coming from or based around the character of Bors. It drags on too long, though, because it simply tries to do too many things at once. It tries to establish the setting for the film as well as establishing some political and religious issues (the latter being slightly reminiscent of the film The Name Of The Rose), but it does none of that because it is so badly written and goes on too long. The second half is plain boring, with cheesy dialogues and long scraps between hordes of anonymous warriors. The problem during these scenes is obvious: it has been done before, and it has been done better. The second half essentially destroys the film, because it just drags on and on. It borders on being ridiculous: why would Bruckheimer need 230 minutes to tell a story that is as thin as a piece of paper? It is not without its logical faults either. Why would the Catholic priests build their stronghold behind the walls that protect Britain, in the middle of enemy territory? It just doesn't make any sense. Keira Knightley could have relieved the mediocre plot, but sadly, she doesn't. In fact, she is hardly in the movie. It takes 45 minutes before she shows up in the first place, and after she does, her main role in the film is to look pretty and innocent. There's no depth to her character, and the few cheesy lines that she gets aren't a relief. She does have some rare good moments, particularly towards the ending. In the last scrap she looks quite butch, wiping the blood of her slaughtered enemies off of her warpainted face. It's great stuff - fanboys will love it - but it's a case of too little, too late. So concluding, the film has little entertainment-value and is only a must-see if you want to discover exactly how bad one can make a film. That said, you might find yourself (like I did) laughing yourself to tears during the final scene, just because it was so damn cheesy. But you're laughing AT the film, not WITH it. This is one of those rare movies where you simply don't care if the main heroes live or die, just as long as the film ends as soon as possible. This whole wannabe Peter Jackson-film leaves one question to be answered... Where did they leave the Hobbits?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Arthur as an E True Hollywood Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I had a chance to meet up with King Arthur somewhere back in the ancient legendary time of the sixties, he wasn't a king at all. He was only a squire who liked to go around being called by the nickname Wart. Along came this wacky David Copperfield type of guy named Merlin who thought he could make something out of Wart by turning him into a fish, a squirrel and a bird. All Wart wanted to do was be a squire which kind of ticked Merlin off and he left for a while. Eventually Wart found this special sword called Excalibur stuck in a stone that looked kind of like an anvil, pulled it out, changed his name to Arthur and became King. Of course there's more to the story as told in the unofficial sequels Excalibur and First Night but it has been the Disney version that will forever be ingrained in me. According to Director Antoine Fuqua, Producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and writer David Franzoni however, all those stories are a bunch of hooey. They have taken it upon themselves to bring to the screen, 'the untold true story that inspired the legend.' And apparently, Disney also must have got tired of the big lie being told by The Sword in the Stone because it's their Touchstone division responsible for distributing this film. In King Arthur, it seems that Arthur's (Clive Owen) real name is Artorius but his Knights call him Arthur because if they had to call the film King Artorius everyone would be dazed and confused about the subject matter. The Knights are all present and accounted for though, including Galahad (Hugh Dancy), Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), and Gawain (Joel Edgerton), and they follow their exalted leader Arthur around battling here and fighting there because they aren't just knights they are also slaves of Rome. It seems they have to fight for the Romans for fifteen years to gain their freedom and Arthur is their best bet to stay alive for any length of time. That would make anybody a loyal follower wouldn't it? Unfortunately, on the day the Knights are supposed to be given their freedom, this Roman bishop comes along and says not so fast, you have to do one more little all time dangerous mission for us. It seems the Roman's have problems of their own back home so they've decided to leave Britannia for good. At about this time the Saxons led by their fearless leader Cerdic (Stellan Skarsgard) are ravaging the country and killing everyone they come across. There is however this Boy out there somewhere that is supposed to become a bishop in Rome whom Arthur and the gang must rescue before Cerdic gets to him and his family which means Rome would be minus a bishop and King Arthur would be without any plot. To make matters worse, there are the natural inhabitants of Britannia known as the Woads trying to reclaim the land for them selves. The Woads are led by Merlin (Stephen Dillane), who wants to convince his enemy Arthur to join forces with him to rid the land of the Saxons. Lest you ask why Merlin doesn't use his magical powers, the answer is because in this the 'true story' Merlin is no longer a magician. He's just a guy out there in full guerilla warfare makeup doing army type grunt work shooting arrows and setting traps.Of course any story about King Arthur has to have Guinevere (Keira Knightly) in it somewhere and she pops up here also. She is not the lovely, soft spoken beautiful Guinevere prone to hanky panky with Lancelot. She's a sprightly lass who can shoot an arrow like nobody's business and swing a sword that weighs about ten more pounds than her body weight as effortless as if it were a light saber straight out of Star Wars. So do you want to know how does Guinevere get hooked up with Arthur? Either go see the movie or read some other review because I can't take everyone's world of discovery away can I?As you can tell, most of this is dreary stuff. Arthur, like most film heroes these days spends a lot of time soul searching and questioning his career choices. Of course he is aided by the constant nagging of Guinevere to get him to do the right thing. The Knights tell off color jokes dealing with penis size, bodily functions and illegitimate kids. Their conversations are supposed to lighten the mood but the audience I saw the film with only gave a light scattered chuckle once or twice. They were probably trying to figure out as I was what this dialogue was doing in a story that takes place somewhere around 400 A.D. There is a round table here, but it makes only a brief cameo appearance. Lancelot and Guinevere do eyeball one another a couple of times but I don't think there was any passion involved in those looks. Perhaps they were wishing they could do a remake of First Knight instead of this.Believe it or not there are some good things here. Slawomir Idziak's cinematography is breathtaking whether it's the scenes in dark hidden abysses of the forest, a light snow falling in the countryside, or a trek through the snow covered mountains. I will admit to the fact that a couple of times it irritated me how blue the sky was during one fog covered day, and during the early scenes of snow falling to the ground but that's a minor quibble. The battle scenes likewise are well stage and are fought in full close up with little if any dependence on a bunch of CGI created soldiers. One particular battle that takes place on a frozen river bed with cracking ice is in itself almost worth the price of admission. However, the battle scenes also seemed to be somewhat sanitized in order to help garner the precious PG-13 rating. We seldom actually see any sword strikes because magically the victim always seems to have the wrong side posed for the cameras. Most of the blood that pops up is some splattered spots we see on the faces of the Knights afterwards. It gave the film more of a 1950's gladiator feels to it, before blood was allowed to spew across the silver screen by the buckets full. In 1955, that was okay, but in 2004 it only makes the scenes feel that much more artificial.As for the acting, the cast does a pretty good job with what they have to work with. Owen is good as King Arthur, although the script makes him appear as somewhat of a dim wit for his blinding loyalty to Rome. Stellan Skarsgard as Cerdic the leader of the Saxons brings some true seething evil to the screen. And despite the oddity of watching someone of her stature battle and fight as well as the Knights, Knightly does quite well as Guinevere.You won't hate yourself if you watch King Arthur. The battle scenes and cinematography are worth a look see at least once. The story is just okay enough to keep you interested, but it's one you'll forget about a few days after watching. What the film really lacks is the fantasy, romance, involving characters and magic that is usually included in any King Arthur story. Instead we just get a film about warriors with a convenient plot line used only to get us from point A to point B. And since the makers of this film feel that fantasy is such a terrible thing and they must destroy the myth, I have no choice but to bestow upon King Arthur my grade of C-. The next thing you know some film maker will try to convince me there is no Santa Claus or Easter Bunny either. What's the world coming to?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a choice... Shrek, I Robot, or pure fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The regurgitation of Victorian romanticism, plus disjointed and unproven archaeological placenames .... proves without doubt, in a film hailed as the most historically accurate version of the myth (is that grammatically or literally possible), that King Arthur was a 5th century Romano/British leader of a band of like minded men. OH NO! There goes British history again, washed away down the gutter of popular buck-earning fantasy. Personally I hold the Arthurian "expert" and "consultant historian" to blame. I would email John Matthews myself, but from his website it is impossible to do so. He is a few thousand years adrift, but then again he is without any previously published references to know this. So here is my choice this weekend, Shrek II... I Robot... or total fantasy.</fullReview>

If a movie doesn't show you more than 1 side of a character, they will get old and stale. All the, supposedly, bold and courageous knights never show any REAL emotions, and the bad guys are just in the movie to sneer, act evil, and eventually get their butts kicked by King Arthur and his knights.One of King Arthurs closest friends dies in the final battle of the film and they try to make it sad and tragic...... I don't even remember which one of his friends dies, you know why???BECAUSE YOU DON"T CARE IF SOMEONE DIES THAT HAS NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT OR REAL ROLE IN THE MOVIE OTHER THAN ACTING HEROIC AND BRAVE.......... The real King Arthur is rolling over in his grave because of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of these types of pieces, however, this movie was not good at all. Outside of one cool fight scene on the ice, I was falling asleep and ended up leaving the theater about 30 minutes early (I've never done that before). I don't have a problem so much with the cast, although I don't think Kiera Knightly did herself any favors with this flick. It's the plot that is just so incomplete and boring. It could have been a lot more entertaining if they had been able to work some medieval comedy or even a better sex scene or something!! If one must see this movie, I would highly recommend waiting until it goes to a dollar movie theater. Not worth full-price!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say that most already have not? Well not a lot.My opinion on the movie is that, like many others have said, it's nothing like the legend. I went into this movie expecting it to at lease follow some of the story line for what I knew.. But nothing really happened. They touch small bases of the story and sure they say 'the true story' but no one knows if it even happened! So no one can really make such a statement. Also if they are trying to make a more 'realistic' one then they could of still used the King Arthur story that he actually dies? There is the love affair between Lancelot and Guinevere? King Arthur's love affair and his son? Really if they had to make 2 or 3 movies to fit it all it, I would be more happy with that than how this one turned out.I went in knowing the story and didn't enjoy it as much, but my cousin went in not knowing much more than there was a King Arthur and a sword.. He enjoyed it a lot more.It's just another war movie, and I really think it would be a good one! If it didn't use it as the King Arthur story.Most King Arthur fans will be disappointed I believe, but none the less.. it's a good movie if you take away the whole 'King Arthur' legend from your mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take one tale about magic, war, love, betrayal. Subtract the magic, love and betrayal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerry Bruckheimer's yearly contribution to the annual `Low on Plot High on Style' Movie Fair that is the Summer Blockbuster Season is `Kind Arthur,' whose tag line is `The Untold true story that inspired the legend.' I guess when a movie claims to be telling the `true story' of a man that historians can't even agree ever existed, I get suspicious. And when this movie that claims to be telling the `true story' features current `it-girl' Keira Knightly wearing a belt for a top (and a cinched up belt at that), I determine that this movie is based on about as much fact as a grocery store tabloid. And I'm talking about those `Woman marries Werewolf and has a Bat Boy' tabloids too. The `true story' claim is really just code for `no magic, no singing, just lots of dirty guys.' Arthur (Clive Owen), a general for the rapidly declining Roman Empire, and a group of knights protect one of the farthest and most vulnerable Roman posts. At the end of their tenure, a snarky Roman Bishop sends Arthur and the handful of remaining Knights on one last suicidal mission to retrieve a Roman family living living in hostile territory on the brink of being invaded by the Saxons (why they're living so far into non-Roman territory is a mystery to all). At the Roman estate, Arthur is determined to saved a few dozen villagers from the Saxons in addition to the Roman Family (he also rescues Guinevere who was in a dungeon being punished for her pagan ways). Arthur, though he had a Briton mother, considers himself a Roman above all and is eager to return to Rome. But, after learning his beloved Rome is on the brink of being sacked and Guinevere uses a little gentle persuasion, Arthur begins to care about the Britons he once fought.Question: What would the story of Arthur be like without the Sword in the Stone or the Lady in the Lake? If Merlin was a rebel Briton leader rather than a wizard and Arthur's mentor? If Lancelot and Guinevere weren't lovers, and if Arthur's illegitimate child Mordred never came to crash the party? Answer: A big, gloomy movie that often feels like little more than a wannabe "Gladiator" and "Braveheart." "King Arthur" is one of those frustrating movies that had the potential to be good, but thanks to some missteps and mistakes only ranks as average. Some of the missteps are small, for example, Guinevere's little war outfit that just makes me giggle, or how her fingers were mangled in the dungeon she was kept in but Arthur resets them and by the next day she's shooting an arrow with deadly accuracy. "I see your hand is better," Lancelot quips. Glad to see someone in the movie itself found it ridiculous too.My biggest grip with the movie is the way they handled Lancelot, well, I should really complain about all the knights since they were all cardboard cutouts at best. I figured since they went to trouble of starting the movie with a clip of Lancelot as a child that he would be a larger factor in the movie. But as an adult (played by Ioan Gruffudd, who I'd cheat on Arthur with any day) his role is relegated to some one-liners and a couple bitch-sessions with Arthur about how to much he doesn't want to do whatever. In what is probably the worst move in the movie, the love triangle between Arthur/Guinevere/Lancelot is completely absent. Lancelot and Guinevere's relationship consists of Lancelot staring at her a lot, and it's hard to tell if he wants her, or if he's angry at her for taking Arthur affection. Now it's not because I was eager to see some Ioan/Keira make-out sessions, it's just Guinevere's betrayal has always been a core part of the Arthur legend, how when things seemed so perfect, Arthur's wife and best friend betray him and ultimately bring down Camelot.With it already falling to 6th place at the box office in it's second week of release, King Arthur will likely go down as the big flop of the Summer of 2004. It's sometimes hard to figure out why some movies flop while other similar movies (Troy and Van Helsing, neither a box office smash but at least reached the $100 million level that King Arthur will never reach) enjoy moderate, and even great, success. "King Arthur's" problem is that the makers were so eager to demystify the legend that they stripped away all of the elements that made it a legend. All that's left are some uninspired battle scenes, a few mundane speeches about being born free, and footage of Keira in that outfit that talk-shows hosts will probably tease her about for the rest of her career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We are the Knights who say NO!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a reason why Arthurian legend and grail mythology has been so enduring. The fantasy of noble knights, a tragic and bitter love triangle, and the search for the mysterious holy grail has captivated readers and audiences for centuries. This iteration of the story of King Arthur tries to distinguish itself from the plethora of material on the subject by offering an alternative history: one in which Arthur is not the mystical demi-god of old, but a servant of the Roman Empire, torn between country and duty.Which is fine of course, in theory. Problem is, in reality, it's complete boring crap. "King Arthur" tries to bring a human face to Arthurian legend, but in doing so, takes away all that entrances us about the Arthurian legend. Of course, with a film of this premise, one would expect a certain amount of artistic license, but did they have to take away the characters themselves? What happened to Lancelot "The Brave" or Galahad "The Chaste" (or for that matter, Sir Robin "The Not-quite-so-brave-as-sir-lancelot") An attempt has been made to show the real men behind the myth- this is a problem when the men are all two dimensional caricatures and the movie begins to attract the kind of farce we're accustomed to seeing in an episode of "Big Brother". Perhaps the movie realises this, for despite its pseudo-historical intentions, the director resorts to mindless myths to replace the ones that are discarded. Why, pray tell, are all the English natives howling, painted-faced, primitive banshees? In the end, "King Arthur" is quite a comic event. It takes itself far too seriously, is based on a flimsy premise, and above all fails as entertainment. Unfortunately for "King Arthur", the definitive movie in the genre is still the Monty Python event. I suggest the makers of this movie take a line from their Python brethren and "go away, or I shall taunt you a second time".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Who?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CAUTION: SPOILERS!Having seen and been disappointed with virtually every film ever made about the Arthurian legend, I went to "King Arthur" with few expectations, but the "hope springs eternal" attitude. While I found it a vast improvement on the cartoonish "Merlin" and the ho-hum "Excalibur," "King Arthur" falls squarely into the category of "good material, shame about the movie."While I am not a scholarly expert, I do know a little something about Arthur, both the historical figure and the legend. One thing this film DID get right was the time period. The historical Arthur did indeed live in the 5th century. However, he is generally acknowledged to have come to adulthood well after the Romans left Britain, and it is virtually certain that he was NOT half-Roman, as this movie suggests. No big deal? Maybe, except that this movie's plot hangs on Arthur's supposed inner conflict between his Roman and his British self. Take that away, and the whole story crumbles.Just for the record, the historical Arthur is pretty generally acknowledged to have been the son of King Uther and Queen Ygraine, both of Britain, both undeniably royal, which makes the movie's flashback to Arthur's apparently humble childhood quite inaccurate.But enough about the historical stuff. Most people who see the film won't have any idea of the "real" story, so the inaccuracies won't spoil it for them.So many potentially good characters here, only one decently developed: Arthur himself. Yes, he was the focus of the movie, but that doesn't mean that the other characters should only have been along for the ride. So much could and should have been done with Lancelot, Guinevere, and Merlin, for heaven's sake. Merlin is one of history and legend's most fascinating characters, and he only shows up as an also-ran in this movie. No one has ever done justice to this character in a movie, and it's a shame, because developing his relationship with Arthur in a realistic way would add fantastic depth to any telling of this tale.Noble knights, yes, "King Arthur" has them. Location and scenery, ok. The bad guys getting theirs and the good guys winning, yep. But as another user has commented, plug in some other names and you'd have just as good (or mediocre) a movie. Nothing spectacular at all. I enjoyed it on a superficial level, and I'll probably rent it eventually, just to figure out who it was (besides Lancelot) that died in the end. That's another character problem...the other knights' personalities are so underdeveloped and they look so much alike that it's very hard to tell them apart.All in all, I'm glad I saw it, but it's not the movie I'm waiting for. Not until somebody turns Mary Stewart's magnificent Arthurian trilogy into a series of movies (much like LOTR) do I think we'll see the ideal Arthur movie(s).Peter Jackson, can we talk?Five out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"King Arthur" is quite simply a bad movie. However, I'm not going to tell you not to see it. In fact, by all means do. But bring a lot of good humored friends who enjoy laughing at all the dumb parts of a movie, because "King Arthur" has a lot of them. From the opening scene with young Lancelot riding away from his village while his family and friends shout "Row!" with fists in the air, to a certain inexplicable and anti-climactic arrow shot late in the movie -- which left me and my friends laughing uproariously -- this film is chock full of unintentionally funny moments. Let there be no mistake, this movie provides a great time, but only if the above-mentioned prerequisites are met.One of my friends told me the day after seeing it that he was incredibly glad that he had. He said that there was no doubt that it was an awful movie, but he had seldom enjoyed himself as much as he had while watching it.So if you are of a cynical disposition, and much inclined to the mockery of stupid yet pretentious films, I heartily recommend that you call up a group of like-minded friends and watch "King Arthur" tonight. However, if this does not describe you or your friends, or if you don't have $8 to waste, avoid this movie like a Bubonic Plague-ridden rat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>old tale, revamped, made boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note: Depending on how you interpret them, this review could contain remarks deemed as SPOILERS! Do not read on if you want everything left to the imagination.I have always been a fan of the legend of King Arthur and his sword Excalibur. So when the news that this would be a revamped version of the tale came out, I felt obliged to see it and was truly interested in the whole idea of Guinevere being a warrior, etc. That being said, I have never been so bored in my life.The movie takes an hour to get started. It's almost like Lord of the Rings, with back story and explanation of how things have come to be as they are, only less interesting than LOTR. Clive Owen did not inspire me at all. While he did make a rather rugged-looking Arthur (a blessing amidst pretty boy princes Eric Bana (Hector) and Orlando Bloom (Paris) in Troy), it seemed wasted by his monotonous tone. Russel Crowe, as much as I can't stand him, did a much better job with Maximus in Gladiator. King Arthur, by the way, is really Maximus in disguise. The two stories are so annoyingly similar: Slaves (knights) being made to fight for reasons they do not believe in. Slaves(knights) wanting to be free and needing one more fight to obtain said freedom. Slaves (knights) all dying off in spectacular fanfare, and only a handful of them obtaining their freedom.Arthur's redeeming point are the battle scenes. There is a battle on a lake of ice with a display of archery so precise that it makes one want to learn. The best battle scenes were the Lake of Ice and the final battle. The most aggravating aspect? The spastic accents! Why on Earth did Stellan sound like a Texan getting ready to go on a hunt? Flip-flop accents distract the audience from the movie itself, because all I could keep thinking was "He sure does sound like Bush."To sum up, I should have waited for this movie on DVD. After some time it began to drag and Owen's attempts at powerful facial expressions (Legolas, anybody?) grew tiresome, and my friends and I began voicing out our own "script" as the film progressed. If you are truly curious to see how they have revamped your favorite story, then by all means go see it. If you are only curious because you could give less of a damn about Arthur and his Knights, then wait for the DVD. It's sure to come about soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie very much in spite of the casting errors. The leader of the Saxon's and his son were more believably from Tennessee then they were from the UK or Scotland. At any moment I expected this guy to start singing Charlie Daniels songs. I liked the characters of the knights very much and felt all played the parts well. As for Kiera Knightly, I think an actress with more stage depth would have been a better choice. I can't believe that Hollywood still feels the need to dress up their star damsel in tiny clothing to give the movie a supposed lift. I doubt very much that this was the clothing of choice in that time period had this been a factual story. This has nothing to do with her ability to fight alongside men, but please lets be real. If you like period pieces, this is very well done with the war scenes unstaged looking. I like the idea that more time was spent on the conflict of the times than by the romance of it. Over all I would rate this a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As entertainment just passable-as history total rubbish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Attn: Contains spoilersThe chief problem with this movie is that it takes itself very seriously. The opening scroll-down boldly announces that historical research has now established the truth behind the legend of Arthur. With that said, we, the audience, are then supposed to believe that what is presented in the movie is historical fact. It is suggested that the `real' Arthur was in fact one Lucius Artorius Castus, a Roman cavalry commander in charge of a group of Sarmatian horsemen stationed at Hadrian's Wall. Well, there is some historical evidence that such a man existed. But that particular Artorius Castus lived in the second century CE.The movie, however, takes place in 452 CE, about three hundred years later. Our film's Artorius Castus is half Roman-half British, and his knights of the round table, yes, there is a round table in the movie, are Sarmatian cavalrymen. Let's see. The Sarmatians came from the region north of the Black Sea, and they are known to have been closely related to the Persians. So, they almost certainly would not have resembled the movie's Sarmatians, and they certainly would not have had names like Lancelot, Gawain, and Galahad. These are pure Thomas Malory. I guess giving them Sarmatian names would have been too `historical'. We don't need no stinking history to confuse things!And while we're mentioning history, all the books that I've ever read say that the Roman legions departed Britain around 408 CE, forty-four years before our story takes place. Oh well. And a Roman villa north of Hadrian's Wall? I don't think so. No Roman would have been that insane. And then there's Keira Knightly prancing around on the ice in a Peplos-type gown that has no more consistency than a modern nightgown. Hmm! Wouldn't she have been a bit cold? Didn't appear so though. No doubt she'll be playing Queen Boudica soon.I did find the Saxon army convincing, even if they didn't use crossbows. But in Dark Age battles, it generally wasn't death to every last man. The battle stopped when one of the war-leaders was slain, and his head and hands hoisted on poles for all to see. And for those who know their `history', those nasty, brutish Saxons of course did succeed in repulsing the British, driving them out of what is today England, and becoming in the process the `English', the name just a variant on one of the other Germanic tribes that was invading Britain at the time, the Angles.It's been pointed out numerous times that Hollywood epics aren't meant to be historical. OK, then why imply historical accuracy at the beginning? Why don't such movies just be forthright and honest? Either strive reasonably for historical accuracy or else just say that the story's meant to entertain. Unfortunately, this King Arthur lamentably fails in both departments.4 out of 10 (as I said, I liked the depiction of the Saxons)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK as a movie, but hardly 'historical'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't as bad a movie as many critics and viewers who write critiques have made it out to be, but isn't anything like a blockbuster that hasn't been matched or bettered before. Nice summer movie to watch when the heat wave breaks and you have a long rainy day. I have several complaints, but I'll start with the virtues:It was well filmed, with good settings (although there is nothing like those Alpine mountains in Britain, except maybe in the Scottish Highlands during mid-winter). The battle scenes were fine, except to the extent they were toned down to get the PG rating (wait for the DVD) -- especially a really good one that takes place on the surface of a frozen lake. The depiction of Hadrian's Wall and its ancillary fortresses and villages -- with taverns and hooker joints -- was archaeologically and historically accurate, even if the purported site of the Battle of Badon is imaginary (could be presumed to be modeled on Housesteads combined with Vindolanda). And yes, the Romans did have draftees in the legions from other parts of the Empire in posts like the Great Wall, and they were inducted for 15 to 20 years before being granted civilian status and pensions. That Arthur's traditional knights were Sarmations, we'd call them Ukrainians now, has to be taken with a grain of salt. In these senses, the movie is a good approximation of the latter days of the Roman Empire in Britain, but it certainly doesn't break any new 'archeological or historical ground'. I have no imaginative problems, as some people with that kind of interest do, with the technology of the battle scenes -- the Romans had catapults and naphtha bombs (Greek fire), even if they were unlikely to have been used in the sort of battle shown here against a marauding horde of barbarians, and manned by another horde of barbarians, those so-called Picts who become Arthur's allies.Doubtful elements: As I said, the Ukrainian Knights -- and in fact I was fooled into thinking the kid drafted from the steppes to join the Roman cavalry was supposed to be Arthur, but turns out to be Lancelot, and well, that just won't do. First of all Lancelot was French, an interpolation from the Middle Ages. Galahad was also a Norman French invention. The more traditional Arthurian characters, going back to the original Welsh legends, as close as we'll ever get to historical 'reality', were Gawain and Bors -- who were certainly not Ukrainians! Tristan or Tristram has his own mythology, involving the Irish princess Iseult, as we know from Wagner's opera and other sources, so why is he killed off before he can accomplish this? (Besides, it is Gawain who supposedly had a connection with hawks, not Tristan, and is also said to have killed giants.) It is likely that the historical Arthur was a Roman officer, perhaps related to the historical Ambrosius Aurelianus, who commanded a 'rapid reaction force', and in any case was definitely British -- that all fits. What the screenplay doesn't explain at all, probably because of very poor editing, is that bit about the sword in the stone and the burning of the young Arthur's house by raiders led by, presumably, the British (Welsh) Merlin, who by the way was not a PICT. Here I was, thinking he was the kid from the steppes, then all of a sudden we get this thrown in, and was that really supposed to have been his father who broke the ice on the lake to drown the Saxons, at the cost of his own life? Say, what? Where did this come from out of the blue? Cerdic and Cynric, the Saxon leaders, were definitely historical characters, but they were the founders of WESSEX in the south of England and had nothing to do with the Saxon invasion north of the wall when the Northumbrian kingdom was established.Totally wrong and misleading elements: Even the historical sources mention several great battles of the Britons against the Saxons and Scots, which took place over several years, led by a great war leader. Many of them took place in Lowland Scotland and the Border country, but the famous battle of Mount Badon is generally considered to have taken place south west of London. Hadrian's Wall had been abandoned several years before. There was no one great decisive routing of the invaders before Badon. The so-called Pelagian heresy took place before these times and is one of those silly arguments whereby Christians killed other Christians over trivial matters -- the Victorians made Pelagius into a hero because he was British, but as far as I can figure out, his 'heresy' had nothing to do with Freedom and All Men Are Created Equal. Arthur is more likely to have been a Mithraist, like other legionaries, even if nominally Christian.As for the script, all I can say is that it is muddled beyond easy comprehension. That could have as much to do with the way the film was finally edited as with any original deficiency, even granted that it is not a strong script to begin with. The acting is generally very well done -- again allowing for the fact that the roles and lines were chopped up for whatever reasons. One very laughable bit concerns the lovely Keira (Guinevere), who is rescued from a dungeon where everybody else has starved or been tortured to death, has Arthur treat her maimed hands, then a day or so later is an Olympic class archer. 'I see your fingers are better now,' says Arthur.</fullReview>

I think the idea of demystifying the King Arthur legend was a good start, but, focusing on a single event that probably didn't happen and wasn't that integral to the mythos of King Arthur, Merlin, his knights, and the Roman Empire was down right stupid. Take out those names and what you have left is a bad attempt to suck off the success of Gladiator. There was a lot of potential in this one, but it felt like the film makers were trying to draw out the movie and fill in time, well beyond what could be considered artistic license. I left feeling like the story never really started and hope someone else besides the team that crapped this out, makes a sequel that deals with the rule of King Arthur, because it a real shame to ruin this myth with this stinker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's always nice when your parents take you to the movies because then you don't have to pay. So this is one movie that I'm glad I didn't have to pay for. For starters, let me say that the previews are misleading. Merlin is not a wizard and he actually does very little at all in this movie. I thought he was gonna be this awesome wizard, but noooo. Jerry, you got me this time. In case you didn't know this, Jerry Bruckheimer and I are on a first name basis because I've seen so many of his movies and that money has pretty much gotten his kids through college. Anyway, King Arthur is pretty realistic for a movie with a lot of battles and although it's about as easy to tell who's gonna die as it was in the old Star Trek TV series (the guys wearing the different colored shirts), it was still entertaining. I would not recommend this movie to someone who's a big fan of Gladiator because it is definitely not on that level. This movie gets 2 stars from me with an extra 1/2 star granted to it for Keira Knightley looking darn good. Go watch her in "Love, Actually" or "Pirates of the Caribbean." I enjoyed those movies more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are spoilers here for those who have not yet seen the film.While I liked many things in King Arthur especially the dark-eyed Ioan Gruffudd and his soothing voice, I did not appreciate the glaring historical nonsense touted to be historical accuracy. Please, folks, I'm talking about the interesting mix of weapons and armor. I'll forgive the slightly "Asian" look of much of it since the warriors were supposed to have come from the Russian steppes. I'll forgive the chainmail and Renfest looks. I'll accept "knights" using missile weapons, but the weapon of knightly destruction carried by the Saxons was over the top. Oh, and were those stirrups on those fancy "Roman saddles"? The idea of a Romanized Briton was a fine idea for Arthur. The Sarmatian knights were possible and an interesting new take on who the famous knights might have been. Merlin and the Woads reminded me of the Roman accounts of "Blue People" in Britain. But then we fall off the edge of reality and begin to ask questions. Didn't the Saxons invade in the lowlands around Kent? How close is Baeden Hill to Hadrian's Wall? And, did anyone think to compare the actors' speech and accents. Father and son Saxons did not sound like they lived in the same household. At least in Lord of the Rings, all the Hobbits sounded like they grew up in the same Shire.</fullReview>

If they wanted to have a different story rather than the one we've known, mission accomplished. However, who knew that s&amp;m existed back in the day? And Merlin the Magician never used nay magic?

		<shortDescription>Woad rage in the woods wows no one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had such potential. Oh, the expectation, the sublime anticipation....Alas, it's all for naught.Screenwriter David Franzoni, who seems to specialize in writing historical epics, should be given some credit for taking a different approach to the traditional Arthurian legend with which we are all familiar. It's a valiant attempt to demystify the legend. I suppose it's his and producer Jerry Bruckheimer's way of making the Arthurian legend more palatable to the teenage-boy demographic. Hence the scantily-clad young Guinevere in battle.But while Franzoni excises the knights' quest and love triangle from the legend, he adds, instead, a dark, grimy, foggy, but surprisingly bloodless, story that's humorless, ponderous and lumbering. And tosses in a feminist kick, to boot. The feminism is fine, but it adds nothing to the story.Franzoni only hints at an attraction between Lancelot and Guinevere. She might realize he likes her, but she's too busy being a warrior to worry about love. And she only has eyes for Arthur, seducing him in a who-knows-what-tomorrow-brings moment. The dialogue borders on laughable, at times, though in fairness to Franzoni, it doesn't reach the ridiculousness of "Troy." Franzoni seems to allude to the war in Iraq, complete with a mini Abu-Ghraib scene, but I'm not entirely sure if that was intentional or purely coincidental.In Lerner and Loewe's musical, "Camelot," Arthur, about to wed, wishes "he were in Scotland, fishing tonight." After having sat through Antoine Fuqua's "King Arthur," I know exactly how he felt.Instead of being a terrible movie, "King Arthur" is just not very good, enjoyable or entertaining. And it should have been, given the story and the cast involved. The acting is awfully stilted. Clive Owen, who's a fine actor (watch his performance in the terrific 1998 film, "Croupier"), spends much of the film being morose and brooding. His one facial expression is to glare. When he isn't being morose, he's giving St. Crispin's Dayesque speeches to rally his forces and villagers, except he's not nearly as rousing as Harry.With the exception of Bors (Ray Winstone), the other knights are indistinguishable from one another. Keira Knightley does well as a kick-ass Guinevere, but she seems too pretty and tidy to be believable as a Woad who lives in the woods. And she somehow seems to find the time to change costumes to fit the mood, including a lovely flowing gown for a love scene and turning up for the climactic battle in a top made solely of thin leather straps.Stephen Dillane's wasted as an unrecognizable Merlin, who's not a sorcerer so much as an unwashed, unkempt leader of a ragtag team of Woad warriors who seem to come from "Braveheart" by way of Kiwi Maoris. On the other hand, Stellan Skarsg?rd belts out a few delightful growls as Cerdic, a rampaging Saxon who suddenly pops up in the story and takes it over.Toward the end, Franzoni's story veers unexpectedly into Kurosawa territory. The plot turns into a clone of "The Seven Samurai" (1954), while Arthur's knights ride in seemingly from the set of "Kagemusha" (1980).There's one novel battle scene across a frozen lake. Eight warriors staring across the ice at a band of marauding Saxons, who, incidentally, don't believe in the element of surprise because their drumbeats can be heard from miles away. But after a promising start - arrows swish gloriously across the sky, the ice creaks and cracks as feet pound the surface - this enticing fight peters into a special effects extravaganza that would seem more at home in this year's disaster flick, "The Day After Tomorrow" than an Arthurian epic. The climactic battle provides nothing even vaguely exciting. Fuqua doesn't know how to stage it and under his tepid direction the scene's mostly Extra A vs. Extra B, Knight A vs. Saxon A, Woad A vs. Saxon B, with the action often cutting to closer encounters between the key figures just to remind us who they are.After more than two hours, "King Arthur" remains full of sound and fury signifying nothing but a colossal waste of time and money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Hollywood, but there were some good aspects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This tale of King Arthur focused more on the political and warfare of the Arthur legend and much less on the mystical elements surrounded by the legend. (We do meet Merlin as a Celt who lives in the forest, but there isn't any magic or religion here; miraculously, this less-civilised group of people do succeed in tricking the Romans in battle.) Another important aspect of the film is the love interest between Arther and Gueneviere. Everything combined, the production is very Hollywood-like, and it reminded me of 'Troy' in its epic historical battle sense and the hopes of freedom plus the romantic plot. I cannot complain about the acting and the photography. This is the one area where the film succeeded. However, the dialogue was a little too flowing, and it's not really a memorable film. It's a dry film, and save for Kiera Knightly, I think it would have failed miserably. If you want to watch a good story about Arthur, try 'Excalibur'. In my opinion, there has yet to be a really good film about King Arthur.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Bart Simpson would say: "It's craptacular."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"King Arthur" the 2004 film is not really about the knights of old who held our attention as children but instead about a bunch of Samartian men who are contract bound to the Roman empire to fight in a certain number of battles before getting their freedom. Just when they think they're free, they get stuck with one last mission - find a guy and his son of political Roman importance and bring them back to safety. Along the way Arthur (Clive Owen), Lancelot (Ioan Gruffud) and the boys get side-tracked by a silly Celtic waif named Guinevere (a badly miscast Keira Knightley) and her silly Celtic chief Merlin, ringleader of the Woads - turns out there's a bunch of Saxons invading, led by the massive blonde Cedric (a raspy voiced Stellan Skarsgard) and they need Arthur and the lads to give them a hand in fighting them off while the rest of the Roman army pulls out of old Briton and protecting the locals. What ensues is a very historically inaccurate misadventure with lots of half-assed speeches about freedom/equality and fight scenes that look like they were stolen from better films like "Braveheart" or "Lord of the Rings".While preferable to being poked in the eye with a sharp object and, to be fair, not as bad as I originally thought it looked, this is still a turkey. I'm not saying that the stories of King Arthur couldn't have been inspired by a real man - or the actions of various men - but this film's boasting of how it is the "true story that inspired the legend" (as Keira Knightley dully told us in a trailer voice over) and it's attempt to make you believe in it's story and characters is just plain pitiful. Perhaps if it had simply been marketed as "Historically Inaccurate Adventure Movie #101" and not as a movie about King Arthur it might have a stood a chance of being entertaining, but alas, this was not the route taken.I'm going to agree with another critic though about one positive thing though - the film's vain attempt to examine the relationship Arthur had with his knights, often overlooked in favor of the love triangle formed by Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot. Clive Owen does what he can with the role of Arthur, as does Ioan Gruffud as Lancelot and the other men portraying Galahad, Gawain, Tristan, Dagonet and Bors (Ray Winstone hamming it up). It's funny that while the film is called "King Arthur" they put Guinevere, Keira Knightley on the middle of the poster, a clear sign of trying to market the movie based on the goodwill Keira established with audiences from "Pirates of the Caribbean". Keira's performance is pretty bad, just another case of cattering to political correctness by having an underfed, scantily clad waif with pearly white teeth and a pitch perfect English accent beat up a bunch of guys twice her size while she wears almost nothing outside of a chest thong and blue paint. I'm sure women could defend themselves when threatened but I could not believe Keira could be beating up these guys; despite those extra 20 lbs she allegedly put on, she still looks too thin and too frail to be a convincing warrior princess. Not only does she lack the physicality for the role, she lacks the intensity and passion as well. I could easily imagine her getting her ass kicked by Lucy "Xena" Lawless or Miranda Otto, the Australian actress who portrayed Eowyn in "Lord of the Rings".Stellan slums it badly as the bored - and boring - villain. So generic and cumbersome he is.Stick with John Boorman's "Excalibur".Beautiful Irish scenery though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Birdie man RULES!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Arthur is an okay film. Ioan-thingy is okay, Keira 'The New Lesley Ash' Knightley is annoying, Clive 'Could I put any more conflict into this character?' Owen is boring, Hugh Dancy is quite fit but suffers from facial fuzz overload and Ray Winston is gruffly funny. There are a few more other people, including a guy who slightly resembles Sean Connery, a [possibly Scandinavian] dude with dreads, a bald bloke and some idiot who's also bald, but has a stupid plaited beard. So what is this film about? In two words: Birdie Man, or rather Tristan. With his funny (if slightly girly) hair and macho beard, he looks like Tony Robinson's younger and cooler cousin. Not very attractive, but film-stealing nonetheless. He can shoot like an elf from Lord Of The Rings, wields a sword like Uma Thurman in Kill Bill and can throw knives like Robin Hood shoots - he aims for the middle. These thing are very 'Like, WOW!' but Tristan really gets the audiences affection. He's in touch with nature through his birdie friend and *PLOT SPOILER* sadly gets deaded at the end of the film by the plaity beard man. At this point the audience is going 'NOOOOOOOOOO! Not Birdie Man' partially as they don't have a clue who he is thanks to the film's lack of explanation as to who the knights are. The audience doesn't have a clue as to what any of their names are. I hope that in the director's cut of King Arthur they show an extended bit of where the bird flies overhead as Tristan is dying and, in a never before seen bit, poops on plaity beard man's head. That would be amusing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't tend to believe claims of the big Hollywood films, and its just as well I took King Arthur's claims of being the "true" story with a large pinch of salt. Usually, I love old warrior epics about honour and faith, and that's what i saw this as, rather than a butchering of the legend. It was the fight scenes that made the film good, not the storyline.One thing wrong with this film is the complete mis-casting of Keira Knightly as Guinevere. She was too posh, public-school educated to pass herself off as a warrior. Her talking parts were fine, but when she was running into battle screaming, i just had to laugh, she looked ridiculous, and that just took all the weight off the battle scene.So my advice is, if you want to see this film, don't take it too seriously, or you will be disappointed.</fullReview>

This film would be great from Mystery Science Theater 3000 even though it isn't sci-fi. My favorite lines were, (() denotes my own words in place of the poorly scripted words) "We fought united for one cause (to defeat the french!)" and "All men are equal (and I will be your king)".

		<fullReview>Oh my god! This movie version of the King Arthur legend had SO much potential, but then Jerry Bruckheimer, Antoine Fuqua, David Franzoni and Conrad Buff got their hands on it. What a disappointing piece of crap!::POTENTIAL SPOILERS::First, would someone please tell Mr. Bruckheimer that big explosions and glorified violence do NOT make a movie good? Please? I know that it was a violent period in history, but Mr. B seems to get off on this stuff, to the detriment of the story itself. It's a pattern.Second, the script was weak. For example, Guinevere's cheesy one-liner about not knowing what tomorrow will bring before the useless love scene with Artorius. Please!Third, the editing was terrible. Images jumped all over the place, it was sloppy and simple, and it was obvious that director and editor didn't trust their great actors to actually do their job and act. I would have killed to have more than 10 seconds of the camera on anyone's face during a potentially emotional moment. Instead, the movie NEVER gets emotional. I NEVER emotionally connected with any character, and this is in a story that is FULL of emotion.Fourth, the symbolism was so heavy handed I thought anvils were going to drop onto my head in the movie theatre. I GET it, already. The public are not THAT stupid. (At least, I hope they're not.)Fifth, there were GAPING holes in the plot. Case in point, the broken amulet that manages to stay in the exact same place on Artorius' floor from the time that Bishop Germanius throws it there until Artorius returns from the rescue operation north of Hadrian's Wall. buh!Sixth, the movie had a split personality. Mr. Fuqua, if you're going for an historically accurate re-telling, then do it. Don't mix and match the elements you want from the medieval romantic epic version and your supposedly historical version. You can't have Guinevere as a great warrior of the Britons and THEN have Lancelot come to her 'rescue' in the final battle sequence. No no no no no no. And don't make her fingernails impeccably manicured. Lord love a duck!I could continue on and on about the faults of this movie, but it would turn into a novel. Just don't waste your money on this movie. Do not rent it. Tell your friends to stay away from it. As an aficionado of the King Arthur legend, this film was painful. As an intelligent person, this film was painful. As a person who has even the smallest amount of appreciation for the art of film-making, this film was painful.Boooooooooo!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

The head Saxon dude was stoned, hardly scary at all. What was his name?9. Lancelot narrates the start and end of the movie even though he's dead. Puh-lease. 10. Arthur and Lancelot are meant to be best mates, but only ever quarreled. COME ON!11. Bad script... although I may have already mentioned that.List of positives starts here. 1. Ioan Griffud. I give this movie 2/10. Not even Ioan Griffud could save it, as he was very wooden also. The movie's only slightly enjoyable if you expect NOTHING from it. So if you have no expectations of this movie whatsoever, be my guest, otherwise, don't pay to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bruckheimer, Bruckheimer, Bruckheimer...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been looking forward to this film for quite sometime, despite the fact that it was a Jerry Bruckheimer (and Disney) production. With Antoine Fuqua at the helm and such outstanding talents as Clive Owen, Stellan Skarsgard, and Ioan Gruddfield, as well as budding ingenue Keira Knightley, I figured it couldn't go wrong. I was only half right.The performances are strong in this film, a tribute to the actor's talents as well as Fuqua's direction. Owen's King Arthur is profoundly disillusioned and disaffected after a lifetime of warfare, but his commitment to the utopian ideal continues to drive him. Gruddfield comes off as a bit too bitter at times, and seems to be yelling the entire film, but his seething hatred and rebellion against the natural order of the world comes through in his performance. I liked Knightley's warrior-princess Guinevere, and she helps the film as Arthur's muse. Skarsgard is hardly recognizable in every way as the Saxon ruler, which pretty much says it all about his work. Another actor who I am unfamiliar with, Mads Mikkelsen, turns in a quiet and subtle performance which is just as good as his top-billed co-stars.The problem with this film is the script, which is heavy on the exposition and a bit short on the drama and the action. Only through the strength of the performances do these characters become human. This gives the film some credibility, along with Fuqua's deft direction which manages to focus on the images rather than the words. Though the exposition is quite heavy, we never get a true picture of what drives Arthur to fight for "Camelot." There are bits about wanting to go home, only to find that home isn't home anymore, but his leap from indentured mercenary to champion of Briton needs a bit more development than it gets. This transition is the soul of the film, and it is lost.A decent movie. Good acting. Good direction. Flawed script. See it once, enjoy it for what it is, and don't look back. Try not to be disappointed by your own expectations.</fullReview>

Because these Roman battles were horrendous but instead of going for the realistic battle bloodshed they went with a censorship happy bit of red paint on a sword!

		<shortDescription>Griveous cinematic sin, but sometimes entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Antoine Fuqua takes on a Herculean task in translating the legendary tales of King Arthur onto the big screen. To facilitate the adaptation, he takes the help of the King of all things overblown and Hollywood, Jerry Bruckheimer. The film is meant as a more realistic and down-to-earth portrayal of Arthur and his men, documenting their one last quest for Rome with as much historical accuracy as possible and sans fantasy-coating. So I'm thinking, if Fuqua wants realism, then why the hell hire Jerry Bruckheimer? But no matter, because Bruckheimer proves to be useful later on.The cast, on the other hand, do not prove to be useful at any point in the film. Clive Owen does his best dry paint impression as Arthur, his voice sounding eerily like "a bored photocopier with one eye on the clocks for the pubs opening" (credits of Mr. cliveowensucks) and his face "looking like someone's who's waiting for the bus on a wet day in Rotherhyde" (credits of TrevorAlcea). His performance is totally unable to project so much as an ounce of charisma or presence on-screen. This is an absolutely fatal failure for someone who is the titular character and is supposed to carry the film, and it is through this inability to act that Owen drags all of King Arthur down in the mud with him.I'd like to say Clive Owen is the only bad thing about King Arthur, but then I'd be lying. Keira Knightley is also atrocious as Guinevere because this character is interwoven with the most clichéd tough-chick attitude imaginable and it ends up feeling almost anachronistic. The writing of the film certainly do not facilitate things either, featuring cringeworthy one-liners between battle scenes and placeholder dialogue in serious moments. There are numerous off-putting attempts to establish a mood that is either reek of typical Bruckheimer overkill, or of blatant 'character depth' moments in which the director desperately feels the need to explore and add more depth to the main characters. He does this mostly by having Owen brood. Just terrible.King Arthur has one redeeming thing, and that is the awesome battle on ice that takes place between Athur and his knights and about two hundred Saxons. It's borderline ridiculous, but gloriously entertaining. This sequence is so superbly handled with perfect CGI and suspense that it temporarily redeems the whole film. Overall, this is still mildly entertaining - but only for the action.4.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Controversially I think that this is absolutely brilliant. I think that it is arguably one of the best takes on the legend ever. The acting is second to none and the battle scenes are some of the best ever, how could anyone not enjoy watching a battle fought on ice. Despite the shaky accuracies places I still believe that it works on the grounds that Clive Owen gives his Arthur a very comely presence and maturity which is sometimes not initially shown in a lot of takes on the legend. It is also refreshing to see a feisty Guinevere in the form of Keira Knightley who gives the character her all and not to mention Ray Winstone's Bors who steals every scene that he is in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Arthur Can Claim Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt that King Arthur is a very much known character in our culture today. His story has spawned movies, a vast array of literature, and he has become an icon for the dark ages. Thus, it is no surprise that his story has been taken again to the cutting room floor and posted for summer viewing; however, this time with a different twist.The filmakers, through advertising and a brief paragraph that precedes the movie, are pushing their movie as the true story of King Arthur (or at least as true from what we know today). Whether this claim is true or not, the legendary King Arthur has been seen in better days.This is not because the premise of the movie is bad. The attempt to make the film have a real and authentic feel as opposed to a fantasy feel was done decently well. We have the commoners fighting for their land, the noble knights, and the savage Saxons. However, what is missing is a little more plot depth and a more engaging development of the premise.The movie finds Arthur's knights about to depart to their homes until a final task comes for them, to save a family from the Saxons. Fromt there the movie rocks back and forth between the marching knights and the marching Saxons, with a little conversation.As far as the characters go, they appear rather two-dimensional and dense. Only one of the knights seemed to have a real personality, and it was not King Arthur. Keira Knightley, although not great, did help give a variety being the only female in the movie with more than two lines. Although none of the acting is bad, I would have liked to see more personality behind the characters.In all, KING ARTHUR is not a total loss. There are some fast-paced battle scenes, and it seems the filmakers put out a good effort to make something out of this film. With just a little more personality, and a quicker pace KING ARTHUR could have been great; however, as it stands I give it a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great historical film but some significant flaws make the movie a disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was a valiant effort to portray the history of King Arthur accurately and with much significant historic detail. The battle sequences were appropriately bloodthirsty, as was the setting showing how many of Arthur's knights were 'tribute children' given to the Roman Empire by conquered peoples. Unfortunately, the film was badly edited, so that even with the best actors, you could almost see the point at which the director said 'action.' Also, there must have been a lot of extra footage because relationships between characters were badly developed, choppy and scenes often made no sense, making you feel that a lot of dialog had been edited out to make the movie come in at under 100 minutes. Unfortunate, because it added to the sense of confusion. What was good about the movie were the mix of characters, all of whom were fascinating, drawn as they would have been from a wide mix of cultures. The film did do a great job of showing the conflict between regional knights and the great Roman Empire, which was primarily preoccupied with holding itself together during its final days. There were also many great comic moments that were true to life, such as the camaraderie between the knights, some bawdy humor, details about camp life, and the great performance by the Roman bishop who is saved in the initial battle sequence. Two deplorable elements to the movie: The costumes were bizarre. Clive Owen always looked pregnant in his bulky leather gear, and his Roman headpiece was almost as tall as he was. Also, a lot of effort was made to give Keira Knightley really diaphanous, if not to say see-through gowns at a time when she probably wore felt and animal pelts, and Ioan Gruffudd's doublet looked like it was made by Bottega Veneta. It was also bulky, too well-made, and really bizarre. The costume designer should have been shot, or dismembered, or burned at the stake. Also, I've never seen Clive Owen give such a bad performance. He is a wonderful actor who was truly mis-used. You can see that there must have been some really redeeming features of this movie to make up for these flaws, and that's true. The acting was superb in most cases, the battle scenes very realistic, the historic depiction of the Roman Empire fleeing for its life, and the ruggedness of Arthur's 'court life' were all fascinating. I would say that an amazing group of international actors proved their mettle in surmounting some really terrible flaws.Much better than Braveheart, that's for sure. But why not just call the Woads the Picts. Didn't understand this, the only non-historic fictionalization of regional tribes' names.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The saddest part is how many people think it is at all realistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wouldn't have minded if it stuck to any of the theories behind Arthur. I wouldn't have minded if it were even a movie about Arturus. I could not handle how they mixed so many time periods and ideas. Actually I eventually was forced to leave the room because I couldn't stop pointing out everything that was historically wrong. Now, I read on-line comments from people who thought it was at all accurate. Another great example of Hollywood lowering the IQ of the American public. There is plenty of commentary about how poorly historical it is, so I need not go on with that. Still, given the context, I wonder why they insisted on calling her Guenivere when she introduced herself? Why didn't they make up some kind of baptism to explain the French name? If you're going to make S*** up, make it up and be done with it. On the other hand, I also don't understand things like, why Lancelot becomes so different than the one of legend. I know some people liked to see Arthur "refreshed", but this wasn't refreshing. If your trying to put it in some type of context, why not try to show how the legend could have evolved? Or, perhaps, give up the parts that might have been later additions (because film makers knew they wouldn't get the box office without a Guenivere, and weren't very creative about it, that's why) I particularly disliked the opening scene where the filmmakers claim that historians agree on this stuff. Yeah right. I wish the filmmaker actually sat through the Discovery channel show on Arturus. I figure they saw a newspaper article on him and called it good. While I am at it, I wonder why it is, that Hollywood armorers always have to make everybody up in different period and style armor and weaponry and why everybody but the central Europeans looks like a cave man? Didn't the Saxons get on with the Scots about fighting Britons?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Knights brag of penis size, adultery, and other vulgarities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The review below does not contain the actual dialogue because of the censorship involved in submitting a review.Unlike previous King Arthur movies this version attempts to uncover the historical Arthur. The most widely known stories about King Arthur were written over seven hundred years after the death of the historical Arthur. Many legends had sprung up regarding King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. The stories were written to depict the ideals of the times. Europe had been in the so-called Dark Ages and now at the dawn of the Renascence writers used the existing legends as a base for creating tales that illustrated the newly embraced concept of chivalry. Previous movies were based on these chivalrous tales instead of historical research.In this movie King Arthur is a Roman. Although there are various theories and the actual history will never be known conclusively, recent research suggests that King Arthur was a Roman nobleman in a position of power in the Roman province of Britannia, now modern England. When the Roman Empire was crumbling in the fifth century AD, Arthur was forced to defend Britannia from Saxon invasions.This movie also traces the origin of the knights. The Roman army used mercenaries from around the empire. The Sarmatian mercenaries of the movie might have been the actual knights that were employed by Arthur. Other research suggests that they might have been from Scythia which bordered Sarmatia.The movie "King Arthur", written by D.H. Franzoni, is based on the historical Arthur and this is a refreshing approach. However where the movie completely fails is in the depiction of the culture and society of the times. The characters are mercilessly vulgarized for no apparent reason. It adds nothing to the story or to the dimension of the characters.An example of this demeaning vulgarization is Sir Bors discussing his huge organ size. He claims that he "can't urinate straight. I could never urinate straight. Too much of myself to handle down there." His fellow knights describe his organ as "A baby's arm holding an apple".Later Sir Bors talks about his illegitimate children and that he only named one of his them because naming the rest "was too much trouble, so we gave the rest of them numbers".Sir Lancelot brags that he will commit adultery with Sir Gawain's wife and that he is also the father of one of the illegitimate children of Sir Bors.D.H. Franzoni states, in an earlier Amazon.com review, that "A great deal of research went into the preparation of this script, as much if not more than I spent on Gladiator". I doubt that the sources of this vulgarization of the characters are historical documents.Later ages selected Sir Bors as one of the three knights that earned the right to find the Grail Castle based on his purity of heart. Although this is mythology, I can not see the point in now depicting Sir Bors as an organ egomaniac. The movie could have been an excellent historical drama without the vulgar portrayal of the characters involved. This review is a warning to viewers who find such vulgarities, when used for no apparent reason, repulsive and without merit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OH MY GOD - this was such a horrible film. Even though I had heard not so very good things about it when it first came out I still planned on seeing it. Things got in the way and only tonight was I able to make some time to grab the DVD from my local video rental shop. I really regret that decision. I don't even know why I watched the film the whole way through. We all knew what was going to happen. The film, even though it is nothing like the established legend of King Arthur, is utterly predictable. The acting made me want to tear my hair out and during the fight scenes I found myself looking at the rain falling outside my window. I had to try to remember I was supposed to have adrenaline rushing through my veins. Oh yeah, and Keira? During your little love scene with Clive, you went just a little bit overboard with those facial expressions. I could go on and on, but I'll spare your eyes the strain. Please, don't rent this movie. Curiosity killed the cat, and this idiotic movie killed my desire to turn the television on again for a long, long time. What a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually OK, historically accurate?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While visually appealing, I'm curious where the writers got their information on this version of Arthur. It had some interest and the story line was engaging, but not what I expected for the time period. I didn't think that the Celts (Woads) spoke the Saxon tongue nor understood much of it. I wasn't aware that the knights who served Arthur were supposed to be from Rus (Russia or a nearby area?) How the heck did they speak to one another? I mean, did they all know Latin? Italian? There were too many holes in the plot for me to really take in the story as something believable. And all the empowered women...hm, I don't think much of that occurred back then. Maybe the Celts had women warriors, but the modern bodies were a bit unreal. Still, the horses and countryside were gorgeous and worth the celluloid spent on them. I think the movie captured the attitude of the Roman empire. My main concern is that younger viewers will watch this and think it is an "accurate" account of the Arthurian legend, backed by "historical evidence" just because it is different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Post 9/11 King Arthur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every age has its myths. In the medieval period, King Arthur and his knights were Christians in service of God and the Church and on the quest of the Holy Grail. Lancelot later portrayed the chivalric knight who worshiped his lady in courtly love. Mallory gave us a King Arthur who served, not the Church, but the country and his knights served him. Victorian/Edwardian writers gave us the perfect English gentlemen who served king and country (Queen Victoria and the Empire). Marion Zimmer Bradley gave us the Arthurian legends with a feminist view in THE MISTS OF AVALON. In the 2004 film KING ARTHUR by Antione Fuqua and David Franzoni we are given the vision of a post 9/11 King Arthur. Here Arthur and his knights are portrayed as ordinary blokes with the warrior ethos. One might say this is the masculinist vision. They are soldiers. That's their job and they do it. Let's go back to the question the Grail asks; "Who do you serve?" At first the commander Arturius Castus (Clive Owen), a Roman-Brit, serves the Roman Empire, which has become the Holy Roman Empire and the Roman Catholic Church. After performing a SAVING PRIVATE RYAN type mission to get Alecto to safety and upon learning that the teachings of Pelagius have been deemed heretical, he no longer can serve the ideas of these repressive organizations. It is important that we know that he is a Pelagian Christian, because the ideas of Pelagius crop up again a thousand years after this era as the Protestant reformation. Although Arthur is a Christian, he is tolerant of the pagan ideas of men, who are foreign (Samatian) and non-Christian. He even goes out of his way to save the pagan native Britons from the religious fanaticism of the Christians. The knights don't have much respect for the native Britons, whom they condescendingly call "woads". Arthur, however, persuades them to fight for the Britons against the invading Saxons. Arthur has a new cause to serve, giving the Britons freedom and liberty. These are not concepts with which Romans, Saxons, Britons or Samatians would be familiar. These ideas are born in age of Enlightenment, which later gave rise to the American Revolution. The Saxons are portrayed as ancient and not-too-bright Klingons. Even though the Saxons come from the frozen Northlands, they somehow are not intelligent enough to fight in ice and snow. Of course, King Arthur and his men with the help of the Britons win. Merlin and the Britons and their culture are given short shrift in this movie. They are basically portrayed as noble savages who must be saved. Women too are very scarce. There is Bors' mate, who has 11 children by him and is tough enough to handle the gruff Bors; and then there is Guinevere (Keira Knightley). Guinevere is a warrior like the knights and is hard enough to fight alongside the men. No frilly, sissy girls here. In the area of sex, she is the aggressor and chooses to bed the boring Arthur in the mandatory sex scene, which lacks any romance or sensuality. The sexual tension between Guinevere and the far more interesting Lancelot (Ioan Gruffud) is hinted at but never comes to fruition. Even though this film was promoted as the historical Arthur from whom the legend arises, it is clear that this Arthur is no more historically accurate than the Arthurs of the previous eras. From the costumes to the military methods to the mores and customs, there are abundant examples of anachronisms. For those familiar and interested in history, this film offers nothing. For those who love the mythopoeic beauty of the earlier Arthurian legends, this film offers nothing. So what does this murky, bleak film offer? The Viking warriors were promised Valhalla upon their death in battle. The Greek hero had the Elysian Fields. The Christian warriors have Heaven. The Muslim warrior is promised Paradise. This film suggests that if one follows the example of the "historical" Arthur and his men and fight and die, not for one's own freedom, but for the freedom and liberty of others, one will be remembered in legend and myths for all time. Ironically those who will find this movie the most satisfying are also the ones that don't remember the oxymoronic ordinary heroes of history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Arthur - A Royal Mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of King Arthur is one of the most popular mythologies, and there are hundreds of re-tellings of the noble tale, and it's courageous, beautiful and sometimes magical protagonists. 'King Arthur' is probably not one of the best...The story is supposedly a 'demystified take' on the tale of King Arthur, and even so, it still doesn't really take off. 'King Arthur' follows a band of knights who were recruited, by Rome, against their will, on one of their final missions which would end with their freedom. The motley crew is lead by Arthur (Clive Owen) who they've pledged their allegiance to. However, during the celebrations to mark the end of their reluctant labours, they are informed that Rome has betrayed them and that they must fulfil one last mission. Angered, Arthur persuades his men to acquiesce, and they set out to find the son of a Roman official, who may be endangered. On their journeys they are waylaid by woads (savaged wood folk), battle with barbaric Saxons, and meet a beautiful archer, Guinevere (Keira Knightley). After all their trials and tribulations, the Knights of Arthur end the film with an epic (as un-epic as you can get) battle.'King Arthur' does have a few good scenes and some good characters, but it looses any of its positive points in a mixture of bland scenes, dull speeches and uninteresting action sequences.The film springs a battle between Arthur's knights and a group of woads upon the audience quite early in the film, and I was ready to be thrilled by a brilliant little battle sequence, one which never came. I don't really mind when films like 'King Arthur' don't have a brilliant script or characters, as it isn't primarily focused on drama, but it has to at least have good action scenes! The fighting was dull, and slow...it probably actually isn't that bad, but whenever contrasted with films like Lord of the Rings and Troy, its action scenes just don't compare. For me this was the most major disappointment in the film. The final battle wasn't that big, it wasn't thrilling or exciting and by this stage I just wanted it to end. I don't like saying it, but Hollywood has conditioned us to see big, breathtaking battle scenes and 'King Arthur' didn't deliver them. In saying this, there was a battle sequence in 'King Arthur' which occurred on a frozen lake which was actually pretty exhilarating. The direction was good, and the whole flow of the action was well done; if only the final battle had been more like this one! The script was horrible, and the writing was so insipid and trite. It seemed so much easier to tune out rather than listen in, it seemed like I was back in school listening to a lecture in Physics. The acting was mediocre; the best the actors could do with what they were given to act with. Clive Owen was vapid and dull as Arthur, albeit he looked pretty sexy; however I think he may have been told to deliver his lines in this manner (because after seeing him in Closer...he IS a good actor). Keira Knightley pulled off Guinevere pretty well, and Ioan Gruffudd was dark and brooding as Lancelot. All the characters were tiring, except for Bors (Ray Winstone), who is crude and delectably funny, but also a gentle father, and the stoic Tristan (Mads Mikkelsen). Stellan Skarsgaard played the villain (Cerdic) well but in my opinion was underused, but not as drastically as Merlin (Stephan Dillane), who only had a couple of scenes, albeit he seemed interesting. There is little character development overall anyway.One thing that annoyed me about this film was that the writer just threw in ideas that just came out of NOWHERE, and had no relevance or impact. For instance, one of Arthur's Knights finds a young boy who develops some kind of confidence in the man. When this knight dies, the young boy is heartbroken, and then he disappears. Who was he? Where did he go? What was the whole point of his characters existence...? I don't know. There is also a traitor in the film. Why is he a traitor? It is never explained. The romance between Guinevere and Arthur...if you are going to do something, do it right or not at all! There was no chemistry between Owen and Knightley and the whole romance side story was awful. A lot of this film is clumsy and boring. The musical score was just alright.Overall, King Arthur is just NOT a good film. It has no real likable characters (aside from Bors/Tristan), and any characters that showed promise weren't explored enough, its lead characters aren't interesting and it is weighed down with lengthy, boring dialogue and less than satisfactory performances. The film could've been redeemed with exciting battle scenes, but they were anything but exciting. I blame this mostly on poor direction. The source material offered so much, but sadly, it was processed into so little...My Grade: D+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you look for an action movie, this one is not that bad. But if you are interested in the character of Arthur, this movie is really bad. Historical reference are completely wrong and reference to the legend far away of all medieval writing. All people interested in celtic civilization could say that Arthur would have had a druid by its side to be able to become king (Merlin). Moreover, Lancelot was a French knight that have the channel to bring support in the fight against the saxon. We can also said that no romans were on the other side of Hadrians Wall (that has been built to stop the Highlanders, not the saxons that arrive by the west-eastern England) I have been disappointed about this movie. I would however recommend it if you like medieval action movie</fullReview>

From the moment the movie begins it muddles what story-line if any will be followed. Without giving anything away, should you have the misfortune of suffering through this movie, pay special attention to the foreshadowing by the keepsake given to Lancelot, this is key to the movies plot.

		<fullReview>I didn't bother to go see this in the cinema, and am now glad. That is for two reasons. One: I later found that the cinema version was cut (which I hate!) and I later was "lucky" enough to rent the Director's Cut. The second reason: this film was utter tripe. Directed by Antoine Fuqua (who did the brutal yet great Training Day) this action film should and could have been so much more. But maybe my expectations of Middle-ages film are too high after seeing splendid efforts like "Braveheart" or "Ecalibur" or maybe this film was just plain poor. I think the second option is more likely. Make no mistake, Excalibur and Braveheart are great films, but King Arthur could have been just as good. So why am I babbling on? Why is this film so poor? Why is this strictly not worth your money? Many reasons; for one, the acting is wooden and dull, with the script just as drab and poor. Also, this film was just plain boring. Make no mistake, I have bought and loved some slow films without much action, but I expected a full on classic here. What did I get? Lancelot and Arthur babbling on annoyingly about the future of "Rome". Despite some good, fast paced fight scenes and some realistically gritty eye-closing moments, King Arthur, by many, could be considered as a decent attempt at a historical action epic, but compared to classics such as Braveheat, well...this falls well far of pulling the sword from the stone.Final Rating: */ out of ***** (1 and a half out of 5)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reasons why King Arthur is poor and utterly bad movie:Personally I don't think this movie works in any way, only on the big screen. On DVD it's very obvious that although King Arthur is well-financed - no money has been used to by a proper script. A very common phenomenon in blown-up Hollywood cinema. Actually nothing except the battle sequences entertains. The acting consists of nothing but badly deliverers lines and sword-swinging; in fact the entire duologue is lame with no memorable lines to quote. Clive Owen portrays a sad, weak and "fruity" Arthur. Only talented actor hired for this gig is danish Mads Mikkelsen as Tristian, the one character with a little depth and edge. Also, how can Lancelot be narrating - when he drops dead in the end?King Arthur looks to me as nothing but yet another empty American blockbuster, which soul purpose is making green. Another good story/legend stepped on by a couple of fat, suit-wearing money-men, who decided to mix Braveheart and Gladiator into one movie. Oh, but only reason to watch this piece of crap is sassy Kiera Knightly! Don't support bad cinema by purchasing this sour movie!3 stars* out of 10 - 2 for Kiera and 1 for Mads</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie. I've always been a fan of fantasy, historical fantasy, and Dark Ages/medieval history. Unfortunately, this movie failed on all counts.(warning: possible spoilers)First, as to it being anywhere near the "historical" Arthurian legend: it's not. It looks like the scriptwriter took what could have been a perfectly serviceable "good guys vs. barbarians" movie and grafted on names from the Arthurian legends. The name 'Lancelot' is French. 'Gawain' is Welsh. 'Bors' is Celtic. Making the so-called 'knights' a group of indentures from Eastern Europe was simply silly, given that they retained the Celtic, Welsh, and French names from the mythos. The interminable speeches on the subject of individual freedom were completely anachronistic for even the 14th century Arthur, much less the 5th century Arthur the movie depicted--freedom, individual or not, was a concept invented in the Enlightenment and would have been completely alien to the time period of this movie. For that matter, Arthur calling his warriors "knights" was anachronistic; the concept of knighthood wouldn't be invented for almost a millennium after the time period of this movie.There are so many other things wrong: much of the armor was ahistorical fantasy-type armor; the Saxon warriors were comically evil stereotypes--the Saxon leader, in particular, appeared to be a cross between Thulsa Doom from 'Conan The Barbarian' and The Humungous from 'The Road Warrior'. I could go on, but what's the point?And it's pronounced "Gow-an", "not "Guh-wayne". The pronunciation used in the movie is a complete Americanization and is symptomatic of the failure of the producers to do even basic historical research.It did, however, get some things close to correct. The Saxons did invade Britain. The Romans did pull back because Rome was in decline. The Picts (called "Woads" in the movie) were fairly accurately portrayed; my only gripe was that woad--the blue coloring they dyed themselves with for battle--would not have washed off so quickly and completely, and Picts were known to be very heavily tattooed in addition to the woad. Many pagans were very intolerant of Christianity--not because of the reasons modern christians might give, but because early christians, like many of today's christians, were intolerant and threatening of those who did not convert to their beliefs (most of Europe was converted at swordpoint, and those who did not convert were tortured and killed).I wanted to like this movie; I really did. However, it wanted to be "Braveheart"; it wound up being "King Arthur as written by Ayn Rand and Robert E. Howard". 4 out of 10, mostly for the cinematography and for Keira Knightly, who played a Pictish warrior woman almost perfectly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some vague basis in fact. *spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Theories of the origins of arthur abound. Apart from the most obvious and well known, there is also the belief that Arthur was derived from a British chief Cunobelin who reigned for 40 years and possessed a legendary sword. However, what is the basis in this film? There actually is some evidence that here was a romano-British chief named Artorius, however this is scanty. Gildas a celtic monk writing in the 6th century records a great British victory against the saxons in the Wessex area in about 500 AD. Nennius a 9th century chronicler associates this victory with the name of arthur , whohe gives as a victorious general, not a king.Having seen the directors cut on DVD and knowing of the director's battle with the studios to get this cut released. I found the film to be competently acted,though Clive Owen failed to rise sufficiently to the task of a cavalry commander elevated to high status and whose principles have been completely turned upside down.Certainly, the action sequences were gritty and impressive, especially the skirmish on the ice. Though the mass battles with people flailing around ineffectually in the background can detract from what is happening in the foreground. Though Ms. Knightley in leather and wode is enough to stir the blood.Further, though Britain is known for its strange weather patterns, the switch from deep winter (regardless of the fact that it was going though mountains) though to spring or summer, was somewhat disconcerting and the cast of supporting accents seemed to be more suited toCornwall and the west country.Overall the directors cut is a competent film, not startling, but watchable.the major criticism would be the ending which all seemed so Disney-like in its "dont worry they are not dead but live on with hooves" motif. Maybe they should have used the alternative ending given in the DVD.</fullReview>

It is; LEGEND, brought about firstly by Geoffrey of Monmouth from hand-me-down Celtic folk-lore and elaborated upon centuries later in a book by Sir Thomas Mallory. There is not even a mention in the Saxon Chronicles of this so-called famous warrior although such a person may well have existed.Mallory's tale had a purpose, a message, but this movie had nothing to offer but a boring storyline and wooden acting with a dash of Hollywood schmultz - YUK. Totally inaccurate historically. Some scenes were poorly photographed - obviously done by a hand-held camera, my young grandson could have done it better. The battle on thick ice was imaginative but in England? Do me a favour! No army would risk crossing a frozen lake when they could go round the edge - now if it were in Russia, that would be different.I am afraid there is nothing to salvage in this movie - such a waste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anachronisms of every sort in a dull movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretty girl; BMW driver commander; nary a bright colour to be seen but I almost expect someone to show up with a Colt .45! Not only the weaponry (quite unforgivable and silly) but the intellectual howlers are too numerous to mention. Anyone with more than a high school ... no make that elementary school education in history would find picking apart this depressing, cynical, post-modernist pompous pretentious bit of cinematic chicanery and twaddle about as easy as picking pimples - and about as much fun. I have commented before on historical silliness (the hand guns in "Bronco" for example) but fifty year old television Westerns are not multi-million dollar (or pound!) extravaganzas with advertising agencies touting historical accuracy. Was the one battle supposed to be Agincourt crossed with the Ice Capades? Long bows vs crossbows? "Daft" is the word that springs to mind. This movie is about as accurate as Boorman's "Excalibar" and that was an avowed fantasy. I am sure Clive will make a fine James Bond (as we now know he did not get the chance; maybe the producers of the James Bond franchise saw "King Arthur", another reason to dislike this hateful movie); perhaps in those films we will find more accuracy and less nonsense - and more fun. But the girl is pretty. Amazing makeup for 1500 years ago in Britain. Loved the lipstick.13 August 2008. Addendum. In Canada the Senate was designed to be the House of "sober second thought"; such is this addendum. Despite my previous comments, I purchased "King Arthur" (very cheaply!) and have watched it again. I have also retracted my vote on the movie. While my previous comments (save the word "dull") still stand, I enjoyed the movie much more and was even moved by parts because of one simple ploy: I decided that this must take place on a sci-fi DC Comics Earth-B. Seen in this light, "King Arthur" may even be a good movie. Shorn of it's 18th and 19th century philosophical bents and of its polemic nature (not our Earth remember Earth-B) I enjoyed it and may even watch it again. The Director's Cut which I saw this time may be in part responsible for my revised attitude. But I cannot rate it with stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this film is long and drawn out although the fight sequences where adequate there was to much time between each battle. I wouldn't have minded that other than the fact the story in between was non existent. i found myself dozing off watching it. Clive Owen was rubbish as Arthur and ray Winston should take his croaky accent and stick to roles he does best that of a cockney gangster. it promised so much but for me it flopped dramatically. In summary this film is long drawn out and boring. It deserved to be binned along with other rubbish such as vanilla sky and mulholland drive. My advice is stay away from this dros unless you suffer from insomnia as this film will cure it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If your expecting the story of King Arthur and the magic that goes with it you will be disappointed.If your looking for the man behind the myth, you will be disappointed.I kept wondering "when is the movie really going to start."Battle scene after battle scene. War after war.It was difficult to even care about these characters. It was difficult to tell some of them apart. Arthur and Lancelot were too similar in appearance. I couldn't understand a lot of what was being said.Guinevere was lovely, yet one moment she's almost dying, wrapped up in warm clothes, the next she's out in the freezing cold in a sheer dress, with her bow and arrow.In the final battle scene, while all the men are warmly dressed in full armor, she's half naked and painted up.If you're going to set an incident in winter, then you need to dress the girl. Otherwise set the scene in summer. If your going to put the girl in the middle of battle, she needs to wear as much armor as the men.A sad excuse to show off a woman's body. Why didn't anyone say "why is she in battle half naked, she'll get killed". Amazingly she doesn't.There was no sparks between Arthur, Guinevere, or Lancelot. No romance. Nothing at all.Battle scened after battle scene without reason or caring about who wins equals a boring movie.Best to go back to the myths. They make more sense.</fullReview>

Not to mention the Roman noble family living in a villa placed outside the Empire's most outer defences, in a barbarian land!) I thought that Troy was bad, but this is even worse!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this movie hoping to see a film about the king arthur-saga, or at least a decent actionflick, but was doubly disappointed. even if you accept the premise of the film, namely that arthur was a roman and fought against the saxons, the plot is still horribly unconnected to anything, be it the original saga, actual history or anything even remotely sane. after i realized the plot was not worth caring for, i at least expected some nice battlescenes. but those weren also not worth watching - the saxons are barely moving, let alone fighting, the knights prefer to shoot their enemies at a safe distance with amazing accuracy and the woads seem to be perfectly happy with their role as cannon-fodder. even the dialogs bore you to tears - the main conversation themes seem to be bors' inability to piss straight and the alleged unity of the oh-so-freedom-loving britons/bretons/picts, which in reality didn't exist at that time at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never knew winters were so warm in Britain about 2000 years ago! The sexy Guinevere dressed in a gown that would probably be more appropriate for an Oscar ceremony than to shoot arrows in a forest among the snowy trees made me roll my eyes in disbelief. And so did so many scenes from this "epic tale", the so called true story of King Arthur and his knights. I did find amusing some of his knights, though, namely Bors, whom I think is the prototype of the typical English soccer fan. Ioan Gruffud tried to be more handsome than believable as Lancelot and with this he reminded me of Orlando Bloom. What I loved in this film was King Arthur himself, the gorgeous Clive Owen. Hopefully I'll be seeing more and more of him, even if that means I have to swallow more Jerry Bruckheimer productions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone who has an interest in both the Arthur legend and ancient History I thought that I should be able to get something out of this but no. I really don't know where to begin but if you take one piece of advice from me you WILL NOT PAY A PENNY for the painful experience that watching this film is. Catch it when it's on terrestrial, borrow it from a friend (if you can find one mad enough to have bought it), hell even steal it if you're that desperate to watch it.So you're probably thinking I'm some stuffy historian who doesn't watch films very often. Wrong, I work in T.V., and make films as a hobby. I love film and Arthur, and yet I walked out of the cinema livid... bloody livid!How can somebody create such a mess. First of all, Clive Owen is the most uncharismatic Arthur in (or out) of Christendom. He bums around with "the lads" (aka The Knights - since when did Roman's or even half-Romans refer to themselves as knights? - of the Round Table) joining in with the fart gags and then when things start getting serious expects us to believe he's in charge by stealing lines from Braveheart.It's all a severe mis-judgment... on everyone's part. Keira Knightley: great to look at but at no point does she even attempt to portray a wild Woad warrior. Ray Winston is simply playing to type and the Saxon chieftain hams it up to epic proportions (the only time I'll use the term 'epic' in reference to this film believe me) while speaking with what appears to be a Texan accent.One sequence promises to up the ante from wrist slitting territory to simply tedious, but even this lets everyone down. The ice sequence comes across as pointless Bruckheimer fare and it is even badly executed (I swear I could see the mechanisms working the fragments of ice).And speaking of executions, which maniac decided to omit blood from a film which attempts to portray itself as "the true story"? Time after time after time, people die to crap sword sound effects and bloodless blades... I found myself struck dumb at seeing a clean blade after one particularly gruesome death - this is like amateur week at the Sunday hall theatre! And as for that 'true story' claim, this is as fanciful as any rendering of the legend, it has simply been stripped of all of its meaning, and will be forgotten by the time Bruckheimer next checks his bank account.If it was good enough for Chretien De Trois, Mallory, Tennyson and T.S. White, it means it does not need fixing. Boorman's version of the myth isn't perfect but it retains some of the grandeur and mystical atmosphere and is still the best rendering of the legend. King Arthur on the other hand should be buried deep in a box and lost somewhere in the darkest vaults of the pentagon - I suggest next to the ark of the covenant.Shocking - My advice, kill yourself now in case you accidentally walk into a room while it's on...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Justify your existence, King Arthur.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In the year 409," according to the Venerable Bede, Dark Ages chronicler of England, "the Romans ceased to rule in Britain."This remedial history lesson is an unfortunate but necessary corrective to the idea that Jerry Bruckheimer's and Antoine Fuqua's *King Arthur* justifies its existence by claiming to be the first "historically accurate" version of the Arthurian myths. While there may indeed have been a few remaining mercenaries/soldiers in Roman gear roaming the island in 409, there would have been NONE remaining in the 460's in which this movie is set. Any defense against the Saxon and Pictish hordes would have been exerted by local British kinglet's -- who were perhaps EDUCATED in Roman laws and ways from their fathers and grandfathers, but could hardly be considered Roman themselves, as Britain was no longer part of the deteriorating Empire.The researchers and writers of *King Arthur* insist otherwise, and are at pains to show the island still under the Roman yoke. The main plot line involves Arthur and his ragtag knights attempting to rescue an important Roman family from the north side of Hadrian's Wall, an area which is teeming with tattooed and blue-painted Pictish insurgents and newly-landed Saxon invaders intent on plunder. Trouble is, there wouldn't have been any Roman of importance living there in the mid-Fifth Century.There certainly wouldn't have been any great Roman soldiers there. The researchers of the film have concocted a dozy of a fable based on ONE MENTION, in some contemporary chronicle or other, of a Roman captain named "Artorius". But a single mention is no proof that this captain was responsible for holding the line against the Saxons. If we must be "realistic", why not use as a source "On the Destruction of Britain", written in 546 A.D. by St. Gildas the Welsh monk? Gildas mentions a siege led by Arthur at Mt. Badon near Bath -- a story retold by later chroniclers.Geoffrey of Monmouth in the 12th Century adds many fanciful details, but does have Arthur die in battle in 542 A.D., which ties in with Gildas' time line. In other words, if we're going to base the movie on historical research, the preponderance of evidence should induce us to move the story forward by about 100 years, and make Arthur a native chief. Needless to say, there is no evidence whatsoever that either Arthur or his knights were Sarmatian (that is, Russian) conscripts. The writers seem to think that the fighting superiority of the Round Table knights is due to their childhood training in horsemanship on the Russian steppes. They also seem to think that there were no horses in the British Isles (as if the Romans themselves, in their centuries of rule there, had never bothered to bring any over), thereby ensuring that Arthur's untouchable cavalry has a relatively easy time of keeping the peace.In other words, Bruckheimer and Fuqua and their writers are simply making stuff up, and there is no good reason why *King Arthur* should ever have been made. One feels the most sorry for Clive Owen, a good actor who is forced to say some pretty stupid things, mostly about "freedom" and whatnot. (Why is it that Hollywood continues to believe that the Romans were big on Freedom? Cf. *Gladiator*, for the same unhistorical nonsense.) One laughs the most at Keira Knightley, an undernourished teenager in the unlikely role of Guinevere, who, in this film, is a wild native eventually tamed by Arthur. Watching her in the climactic battle, wearing an S&amp;M number with thin leather straps covering her unmentionables, as well as wearing blue face-paint and tattoos, generates incredulous belly-laughs. One winces the most at director Fuqua's cribbing of cinema classics like Eisenstein's *Alexander Nevsky* and Kurosawa's *Seven Samurai*. In the former case, we get a Battle on the Ice a la *Nevsky*, only this time done with computer graphics instead of large blocks of plastic; in the latter case, we get the luring-into-the-trap tactics used by the farmers in *Samurai*, only this time the native Britons (and Picts, inexplicably joined with them) pick off the Saxon divisions one-by-one with 40-foot-tall catapults showering burning pitch on everything so that hardly anything is visible through the black smoke. It's all a bunch of nonsense: boring, derivative, laughable, a waste of $120 million. And we may have finally had our fill of large computer-generated armies, augmented with "battle reenacts", clashing into one another as the camera sits above it all on a crane.Historically inaccurate AND inaccurate to the romantic myths that the Middle Ages writers created around the Round Table, *King Arthur* fails to justify its existence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The reasons why The film is Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand Franzoni - the guy has written Gladiator and now comes up with something that lacks everything that made the first one so catchy. The problem is not only with the approach that leaves magic behind as 'there was to be naturalistic'. It has no magic but it's also not naturalistic. The battles in fact are extremely boring because they are so unrealistic. Blood only appears on the swords' blades and it looks like the actors were only preparing to the actual shot not like the 4th century great battle. Bruckheimer wanted to have everything ( not a fairy tale only dark story but also large teen audience ) and the result is it failed in box office. But the real problem is that even if the movie was R it wouldn't change much except for the fact I wouldn't yawn during the battle scenes. The movie lacks the plot (it's funny that it has much in common with Tears of The Sun - they also take the innocent group of people to safe) It can be described simply - good characters want to be free but have to complete one last mission, the bad ones are just behind them, they finally meet and while some die in the frozen lake the majority dies in the final battle at the end. The heroes, apart from some heavy, idealistic, 'heroic' lines they occasionally deliver, lack clear motivation, there is NO character development this kind of movies desperately need, the characters simply are there to fight. The story concerning Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot leads to nowhere, there is no decent antagonist to the main character,the film is full of naive, bombastic speeches (with the most horrible one saved for the end)Everything seems out of place here and it's clear that nobody had a real idea what to do with the movie.The characters are to fight in battles in historical epic context - that's the whole idea.Even the music by Hans Zimmer as heard in the movie seems out of place, too heroic, uninspired and repetitive. - 2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death of a legend.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the commercial for this movie I wanted to see it so badly since I love the Arthurian legend. I was however disappointed when I saw the movie. It was the first time I felt completely lost in a movie about King Arthur. If research was involved it was only basic. Artorius, did exist his full name being Lucius Artorius and he did have a band of pagan knights and the story might be true, but this broguth the first sing of poor research, the movie does not have historic accuracy. In the begign we are told that the year is that in which most Arthurian stories are told, late fifth century going on to the sixth. The problem here is that Rome is no longer in Britain by this time and Lucius Artorius and his knight were in Britain around the begging of the second century while Rome was still there.Lancelot and the round table, two crucial story points in modern times were actually fabrication of french romance writers, Lancelot being the characterisation of the perfect knight. So if the movie is aiming for actual facts, Lancelot should be the first to go. If the person reading does not know or study or love or has any ties with the legend,the movie is good.But for those who do know it and love it will probably have the same questions as I did: Were is Morgan le fay, Arthurs half-sister and mother of his child? Were is Mordred, Arthurs bastatrd son and eventually killer? Were are Igraine and King Uther, Arthurs parents and Morgan's Mother? Were is Merlin, the wise teacher whom Arthur loved? It is Morgan who has a problem with Merlin because he helped betray her mother! Were is the legendary Excalibur, given to Arthur by the lady of the lake or pulled from the stone as the rightfull king of Birtain? It wasant even on stone, it was on earth. To make this short, were is the beloved legend, passed form generation to generation traveling threw time and countries, were is the Arthur we know and love? For lovers or scholars of the Arthurian legend, the movie is a sad experience. It lacks what all other versions have, the legend, the story, King Arthur himself. Also, there is no real King Arthur that we know of, just some guys who MIGHT be the inspiration for Arthur. If they had announced it as a story of a roman leader who helped defend Britain and had slided in as a small hint that he is one of the figure BELIVED to be King Arthur, it might have been better, since people wodent go to the theater expecting another telling of the beloved legend. It is said to never judge a book by its movie, the same goes for the legend. With lack of central characters, settings and plots, this movie should even change it's title, since that is the only tie to the legend, and some random names thrown into the mix in characters that werent their own, since Lancelot seemed more like Arthur at some points and Gwenevire has bits of Morgan's character in her. This movie is the Bizzaro of Arthurian legend. I just hope we get a good Arthur movie to fix this one and set the record straight.</fullReview>

I felt very emotionally detached from all the action on the screen. It's as if the film's makers left the drama on the cutting room floor and opted instead for some big, gritty battle scenes that were poorly set up and went on forever. People died whom I barely knew so I didn't care. There was ABSOLUTELY NO CHEMISTRY between Clive Owen and Keira Knightley. Their sex scene was really unerotic and it felt tacked on like someone suddenly remembered the movie has to have a sex scene. Seriously, skip this film and rent John Boorman's Excalibur.</fullReview>

So many glaring historical inaccuracies just make the film makers look stupid. Especially considering they claim it's correct due to new archaeological evidence, what evidence, I would like to see it and judge for myself. 'Braveheart' was far superior and at least come close to the truth of what might have happened. 'King Arthur' tout's itself as the truth, well if that's the truth all history books and archaeology over the years have been wrong and someone should tell the historians they are lying, before they give the wrong impression to school kids.I would say this movie would be average if it did not claim to be the truth and had different names for the characters.

This movie was so horrible I nearly made myself sick laughing. It was poorly written to the point that I waited through the whole movie for a plot to emerge, only to see Arthur giving a Braveheart-esque speech about freedom while riding around in front of *5* guys just before the upcoming battle. And I think the director drugged all the actors so that they couldn't deliver the lines with anything remotely resembling life. Keira Knightly goes though as many costume changes as she and Natalie Portman did together as Queen Amidala and decoy. Arthur was one-dimensional, and all the other characters (except Bors, who's almost slightly interesting) wish they could have been even that well-developed. And forget about cool battle scenes. Saxon battle tactics: advance, mill around, get killed, repeat.Use this movie for your next MST3K party.</fullReview>

On a scale of 1 (throttling the theatre manager by the throat for a refund) to 10 (actually hoping for a sequel and considering sneaking back in for a second viewing), this film rates a 2, because I'm trying to be more calm, and have been warned by the local police about our nation's seriousness about its battery statutes.Still, a truly awful film.

His widest audience was in fact Roman nobility because his erroneous doctrine of salvation by personal force of will became an excuse for maintaining the Roman class system. Germanus of Auxerre, who is depicted as a villain in this movie, was, in fact, petitioned by the Britons to come to clean out the Pelagians. According to some sources, the Priest who accompanied Germanus would eventually be known as St. Patrick of Ireland. So the depiction of the assistant Priest by the movie-makers is especially off the mark.For historical accuracy of the known persons and philosophy of the period AND just being a badly made film, this merits an F.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching KING ARTHUR is an endurance test I recommend only to those not bothered by lugubrious pacing , mannered acting and a visual palette consisting almost exclusively of dark greens, blues and grays. Obviously filmed in Ireland amid endless days of fog and rain, director Antoine Fuqua's version of the Arthurian Legend is CAMELOT for the moron trade. The movie begins with the promise of delivering a gritty , historically accurate version of Britain's "Dark Ages" bur quickly descends into a quagmire of endless battle scenes that do little to illuminate the story but will undoubtedly please avid action buffs. Anyone looking for a satisfying film epic about Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table might want to check out John Boorman's 1981 Excalibur. That film also has its share of blood and guts but the telling of the tale is swiftly told and brilliantly photographed. Even Joshua Logan's CAMELOT (1967), as over-produced as it is, offers a traditional telling of the Arthurian legend that has its moments, most of them distinguished by Richard Harris, Vanessa Redgrave and a beautiful Lerner and Loewe music score. The new film seems to use Mel Gibson's BRAVEHEART as its inspiration. Gibson's opus had its detractors but at least it held the audience's attention for most of its three hour running time. KING ARTHUR, despite all its scenes of warriors shouting "Freedom!" and vast armies of men shooting arrows and wielding heavy swords, is a sluggish action film devoid of humanity. Clive Owen as Arthur and Keira Knightley as Guenevere have the required acting chops and are convincing in their roles but they are both undermined by a colorless script and pedestrian direction. Hans Zimmer's unrelenting music score, a tiresome , mournful dirge, just adds to the movie's oppressive atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is absolutely nothing remarkable or spectacular about this film. I've literally seen made for cable TV movies with more depth. This has to be one of the most "blah" movies ever released in the summer months.It wasn't even an entertaining movie while it lasted, and it sure isn't one of those movies that you'll remember down the road. The acting was OK, for the most part. Arthur lacked the charisma I always imagined him having. Guinevere did nothing but fire a few arrows and the portrayal of her was quite disappointing. Although I'm a fan of Keira Knightley, her character had no depth to her character nor personality, mere show in the movie, and love between Arthur and her never was brought out (the love scene between her and Arthur was a joke), nor the relationship between Lancelot and she other than a few glances. Religion was a big issue in the movie that quickly became annoying...the character was either and ardent skeptic, or a hardcore fanatic, no in-between. The visuals were well done, and the soundtrack was decent.Historians and true fans of the Arthurian legends will leave disappointed but so will the average movie fan?dull, flat and uninteresting.</fullReview>

However, the film is supposed to be a more truthful account historically of Arthur. What is at odds with this goal is the pure politically correct feminist hoo-ha that is written in, like Guinevere's role as a warrior and her telling Lancelot "don't worry, I won't let them rape you" as the 10 or so of them face hundreds of Saxons. Are they trying to simply rewrite history as they would have it, or have us believe it, or do they think we are so stupid we won't notice the blatant feminist twist to the movie?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't like this movie at all. As "factual" as it may be, over the legend, (although the whole story IS the legend anyway,) it made no sense!!! Lancelot is supposed to run off with Gwenyvere after King Arthur actually becomes King. How is he supposed to do that, if he DIES in battle before King Arthur even makes if out of his debt to Rome? It makes, no, sense.I really think that directors shouldn't be allowed to make movies that are based on something - a novel, a moment in history, etc. unless they actually study said novel or history, etc. It's impossible to like a movie when you know how the rest of it is supposed to come out, but the director completely sways it and distorts it. The action was okay - the acting was pretty good. I just couldn't watch it because of the complete distortion of the Legend of King Arthur.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull &amp; Tedious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Arthur was the most average movie I have seen in quite some time. It was average to the point of tedium. There is really only one battle scene in the entire film. Most of the time, the viewer is `treated' to a dark pondering film. This set up was dull and so very uninteresting. When Arthur and his knights set out on their last mission, the film's director chooses to spend over five minutes of screen time of them opening a giant door and them riding through the rain. I remember my eyes glazing over and being forced to look around in the theatre. It was the equivalent of filming someone tying their shoes very slowly. YAWN. Keira Knightly fans will be disappointed. She only appears at the halfway point and has a total of about 20 minutes of screen time. When she does appear, she's usually dungy and dirty. This dull cast gets lost in this period piece. One question, what kind of strategy did Arthur employee during the final battle? He had catapults and plenty of archers but choose to abandon the walls and their advantage. He simply opened the gates and invited the larger army in to do battle? Huh? Smoke screens aside, not very smart?just like this entire film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why you should save your money on this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to go see "King Arthur" in theaters today, and I must say after all my anticipation I was very disappointed. It started off looking like a cheap-no plot-version of "Braveheart", then moving on to a "Lord of the Rings" type battle scene. The acting was awful, and the score, once again, sounded like it was trying to be these two movies. After the repetition of many swear words, (which, hello, did they use these words in the middle ages?) and many sexual references, I decided to leave the theater and refund my money. I was extremely disappointed in this film , and hoped that others wouldn't waste their time on it. I predict it will soon drop out of theaters.</fullReview>

Go read the Warlord trilogy by Bernard Cornwell, and leave Jerry "gunna blow stuff up!" Bruckheimer out of it. His production company makes good explosion movies, but no way can they get "the true story" of ANY legend right.The surprise at the end was cute.

And the fight sequences may have been impressive, but since the camera just jerked around the whole time one would never know!

		<shortDescription>Tripe. Not the worst Arthur movie by far, but tripe nonetheless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerry Bruckheimer and co. take about 400 years of history, cram it all together, mix in some fictional characters from twelfth-century French romantic poetry, and call it the "true story" behind Arthur. Rubbish. It's as if you had George Washington team up with Napoleon to fight the Nazis as they invade America, with the assistance of Natty Bumppo, Captain Jack Aubrey, Tom Sawyer, and Huck Finn. Historical inaccuracy aside (though honestly, the history behind this story would have made an EXCELLENT film without any alterations) the film is still resolutely awful--Arthur might as well have been played by a mannequin, and his knights (with the exception of Bors and Dagonet) are nearly interchangeable. Guinevere is saddled with some of the worst dialogue in cinema history (and I own a complete collection of Christopher Lambert's films, so I know what I'm talking about) and the plot has more holes than a cheese grater. The real King Arthur, whoever he was, is spinning in his grave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is rare that I think about leaving a movie within the first 20 minutes. As a previous reviewer had posted, Keira Knightley does not appear until an hour into the movie. When she does, the movie definitely picks up. The first hour is so violent and quite boring, but the last hour &amp; ten minutes were much better.It is obvious the movie was thrown together and should have been more carefully edited; it does not flow well at all (Arthur &amp; Guinevere's relationship, for instance). The music (composed by Hans Zimmer) sounds all too familiar from what we heard last summer with Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.If you are hoping to see a movie with the same excitement as Pirates, you will be sorely disappointed with this film. Way too violent for the little ones, and one of the knight's behavior is extremely offensive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was anticipating a movie far greater than the one I saw. I usually enjoy any movie that takes place in a long ago era, but this one did not really make much of an impact. If you're expecting the usual King Arthur story, then you've come to the wrong movie. This movie was entirely a different twist to the classic tale. Though you could see some connection, the overall movie seemed like a totally different story-line with just some characters of the same names.The main disappointment to me was the plot. The plot never really drew me in. The whole story was on the Knights of the round table going on their "final battle." Though the battles were pretty realistic and a lil interesting...they never really got around to a main plot...just a bunch of little ones. I was also surprised that Keira Knightely was not really a big character in the movie. She didn't come in for a while and instead of being some beautiful temptress, she was some warrior...and to me she wasn't exactly convincing. I could believe she was an archer, but fighting big, burly men (with her slim hardly there figure)? I'm sorry but that was pretty far fetched...The acting was all right, the war scenes were pretty decent, but overall the movie was not a huge success in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It only takes about 15 minutes to decide whether you will hate this movie or simply not care at all about it. Although purporting to be a deconstruction of the Arthurian legend, it feels put together by someone who had never picked up a history book or even read the legend. The current-day remains of Hadrian's Wall show that it was originally 15 feet tall with loose stones; in the film, it's 30 feet of fine marble craftsmanship. One character is referred to as the bishop of Rome; he, in turn, refers to his boss the pope. But the bishop of Rome IS the pope. (Let's not get into how oddly powerful the church is; considering Hadrian's Wall was abandoned by 383 AD, this film must take place no later than that. Since Christianity was not declared the official religion of Rome until 380, that was a fast rise to power.) Don't think too hard about how a snow storm can come out of nowhere so fast that a lake freezes over in just a day, but it's not cold enough for people's breath to condense when they speak. (But apparently not so cold that a few minutes later, everyone is in lush, verdant fields in the middle of spring.) This is terrible filmmaking -- boring, repetitive, lacking any good gore scenes with exposition that is hard to follow and confusing geography and convoluted action scenes. Easily the worst film of the summer -- and that includes Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. (c)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, I have to pin my colours to the mast and say that I was glad this film was made. British actors in a big-budget movie about one of Britain's greatest legends? What's not to like? Unfortunately, the movie was scripted by the same guy who wrote "Jumpin' Jack Flash", a tedious damp squib of a spy thriller from the 80's. David Franzoni may have also co-created "Gladiator" in the time between, but he returns to his hack roots with "King Arthur".Someone at the studio must have been trying to tie up an action figure franchise or a cartoon series during pre-production, as all the "knights" have unique fighting skills and their own individual weapons. I would love to know where some of these weapons came from, particularly the odd knuckleduster knives that Bors wields so effectively. I've never seen anything like them before. Historically accurate? Well...The problem with the legend of King Arthur is just that. It's not historically documented. It's a legend. Trying to shoehorn historical fact into the Arthurian legend doesn't work, especially if you're trying to establish the character. John Boorman's "Excalibur" chucks historical accuracy out of the window, but HIS film is faithful to the legend and works despite all of its medieval and Victorian anachronismsFranzoni invents a complete new background for Arthur and manages to uproot the whole story in the process. The legend is based in magic, with Merlin the wizard as one of the prime movers, but Franzoni's script turns the magical Merlin into some sort of gnomic chieftain. Focusing on Guinevere as a connection to the Old Ways is ill-advised, as Keira Knightley seems to need a lot of careful direction to elicit a good performance. In "King Arthur" she is allowed to act her age and brood and sulk too much. As Clive Owen is allowed to do the same thing, the idea of Arthur and Guin falling in love is ridiculous. Their relationship is like that of a couple of teenage Emo Goth kids - it will only last until one of them discovers that people make happy music as well as sad music.Poor Clive Owen. I think that he's a very good actor and I've enjoyed seeing him play leading roles in films like "Close My Eyes" and "The Croupier". Unfortunately, he's lost in "King Arthur" and his trademark thoughtful delivery comes across as someone thinking very hard about what he has to say next. His Arthur is an uncharismatic and wooden as a result. This movie probably cost him the Bond gig, as he was on the shortlist to replace Pierce Brosnan as 007."King Arthur" will go down as one of those "Could have been" movies. With a director more skilled in drawing good performances from his actors, a script with more than a toe dipped into the magic pool of the original legend and more careful casting, who knows what could have happened? Perhaps those pre-production musings about action figures and a cartoon series might have made the studio a lot of money...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all know the majority of blockbuster remakes of history (and remakes of movies that have already been done many times) are never accurate - but the 2004 version of King Arthur is not even close. That aside the storyline is very lacking, starting off it begins with some decent pace and then it jumps many years ahead without any explanation of the years past, like the writers took a nap on the job. Acting is mediocre, even the impressive, British-born Clive Owen is lacking here. Keira Knightley is ho-hum as well. For the exception during the final battle she's borderline psychopathic. All and all the fight scenes are so-so and for the most part overdone in the attempt to regain the attention an already bored audience. Not worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundbreaking and spellbound battles with King Arthur and his knights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The picture is approximately developed during 300 Anno Domini and is a demystified story about the legend of King Arthur (Clive Owen) and his knights of the rounded table ; thus , there appear : Lancelot (Ioan Gruffud) , Galahad (Hugh Dancy), Tristan (Mikkelsen) , Gaiwan ; besides , appearing : Merlin (Stephen Dillane) and Guinevere (Kiera Knightley) . In this epoch the legend hadn't been historically established , in fact the historic events are narrated among the fall of Roman empire and the Middle Age or Dark Ages . The Romans included into military to the Sarmatians for their warrior spirit and arms slickness . A General Roman assigns to Arthur and his knights of the Round Table their last mission before obtaining the freedom after fifteen years serving for the Roman Empire , now almost collapsed ; as they have to fight the Woads (in the film are supposed to be Picts , it comes from the blue plant that the Picts may have used to paint themselves prior to battle) . A Roman family and specially his son who has a peculiar condition must be saved of the invading Xasons (led by Stellan Skarsgard and Til Schweiger) who have passed the Adriano wall and menace to conquer all England .This pic packs noisy action , thrills , spectacular outdoors and overwhelming battles full of blood and guts . Although all of the crowd scenes and extras used fake swords, for all of the one-on-one encounters in the film (such as between Arthur (Clive Owen) and Cerdic (Stellan Skarsg?rd) or Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd) and Cynric (Til Schweiger), real swords were used. Over 400 extras were used as Saxon warriors. Most of them had never had fight training at all. Most of the major battle scenes were filmed using 18 cameras simultaneously. Apart from the mounted cameras, camera operators also dressed as extras and shot from within the action. Cameras were also mounted on shields, swords and horses.In spite of there aren't real documents about the feats of legendary character Arthur , allegedly in VI century , he was King of the Bretons ; on XII century were created books written by noted authors as Chretien de Troyes and Thomas Malory that dealt with the Breton series including their valiant Knights and looking for the Holy Grail (happenings aren't explained in this film) . The film is shot with breathtaking battles as the epic confrontation on the ice floe or the impressive final struggle where the blood and violence is abundant . Cinematography is nice but a little dark as well as murky with exception of the battles that are outstandingly photographed . Sensitive and touching music by Hans Zimmer but in certain likeness to his ¨Gladiator¨ score . The motion picture was well directed by Antoine Fuqua . The movie was produced by the great producer Jerry Bruckheimer . The film will appeal to people enamored with chivalric ideals and historical movies fans . Rating : Above average . Well Worth Watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard the basic plot of this movie before it came out in the theaters, I said, "Flop." Now, I'm not ALWAYS right about things like this, but I'm glad to be right in this case. The reason why I thought it would be a flop was because they took out the mythology (which has kept this story alive for so many centuries) in a vain attempt to be historically accurate, which anyone with any historical knowledge of Britain or the Roman Empire, for that matter, will know it is not the case. Hollywood will probably never learn, but they need to stop trying (repeat, TRYING) to be historically accurate and stick with the legends and myths.But when I actually saw the movie (I watched it in my English Lit class), I resisted the urge to whimper. Since when did the Saxons, a Germanic tribe, attack from the NORTH of Britain, above Hadrian's Wall. And since when did Romans live above Hadrian's Wall? And since when did the Church starve people to death to save their souls? That just didn't make sense to me, and those priests were INSANE.The whole movie is a "Christians bad, Pagans good" love fest. They make Druids seem sooo civilized, while the Celts in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves offer a more accurate display of them. Arthur's knights, the GOOD guys, mock a man while he is trying to pray to the Christian god. Christian priests are portrayed as nearly psychotic. I'll admit that some of the Church practices were off, but they weren't THAT off. I hate to break it to Hollywood people, but that sort of content in a movie is not going to make a lot of money in America. Look at the demographics. There's too many conservatives who go to church.Historical inaccuracies (and there are others I have not mentioned) aside, one part of the movie that made me shake my head was Guinevere, right after having her fingers broken by what I assume was a thumb screw, using a bow and arrow. If they broke her fingers with "instruments", the bones in her finger would have been crushed and shattered, and she wouldn't be firing a bow and arrow anytime soon.There was one shining moment in this movie. The shot of Arthur in the smoke standing in the gate of Hadrian's Wall. However, it occurred to me two seconds later that in real life he would probably be asphyxiated by all that smoke.This movie was exceedingly disappointing. If you like the Arthur legend, watch "Excalibur". Watch "Knights of the Round Table". Watch "Sword in the Stone". Watch "Monty Python and the Holy Grail". Watch ANYTHING but "King Arthur"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ZZ Topp vs. Blokes in Cans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon a time there lived a mighty king who pulled a shiny weapon out of a rock and set up the novel idea of tables being round. He had a beautiful queen who was rather uncomfortably friendly with said king's best friend and a handy magician friend who had a rather bad run in the love life department. Everyone rode around saving fair damsels, chasing after phantom drinking utensils and dueling for honor and the like. So that's how the story goes, or at least the story we're familiar. If that was the story you were expecting, you're in for a rather rude awakening in Fuqua's King Arthur. These ain't your mother's knights in shining armor. *possible minor spoilers*Clive Owen is Arthurius, a Roman general in charge of the outposts of Britan with a band of soldiers with him all itching for their walking papers. There's Lancelot, who specializes in ladykilling and killing in general with his double swords when he's not bickering with Arthur. There's Tristan, disheveled and slightly homicidal; Gawain, who really just wants to get himself a wife and settle down, or at least I think he does from the approximate 2.5 lines he has. There's Bors, who has more children than he knows what to do with, or knows what to name for that matter, and Dagonet, having even fewer lines than Gawain. Finally there's Galahad, ticked off and thoroughly soused for the better part of the movie even though he looks all of about 13 even with the scruffy beard. Arthur is unfortunately strong armed into going on one last mission to return a Roman family to safety in the impending evacuation of Britan. Even more unfortunately for Arthur, that project isn't as easy as it sounds since the country is being overrun by ZZ Topp impersonators...oh, sorry, I mean Saxons. It finally comes down to a couple of knock down, drag out battles with Keira Knightly completely unnecessarily traipsing around in less and less clothing as she goes. Don't get me wrong, I really liked this movie. Owen was more than up to the task of making Arthur stoic and careworn, caring for his men but also trying to work through his shattered former ideals. Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot is another standout in what screen time he has, as he effectively argues his point that Arthur just might have gone soft in the head to think he can take on the Saxons, with or without Guinevere, Warrior Princess. He's passionate, tempermental and pretty darn fine in black leather. Hugh Dancy as Galahad is another welcomingly handsome knight in a movie that seems to want to go overboard in the dirt and hair department. Kiera Knightly herself is a bit of a problem as she doesn't have much screen time and what screen time she has is spent either looking in great need of a Krispy Kreme or running around in a leather get up that defies the laws of modesty. There is no touching on the traditional Lancelot/Guinevere/Arthur love triangle aside from a smouldering glance or two. The surprise is Ray Winstone as the hilarious Bors who has a bevy of children and a rather off color sense of humor. He made a movie that could have been very dark, delightfully humorous at places. The said Saxons themselves are rather less than intimidating as they shamble around looking like misplaced bikers in fur. Apparently the more fur you have, the badder you are, with their leader sounding like he just wandering in from the O.K. Corral and is ready to challenge Arthur to a quick draw at high noon. Fuqua tries to make his vision of Arthur gritty and true to life, but he is foiled in this attempt by having the movie cut down to a PG rating. It feels like a gritty movie without much grit. The dialogue is rather forgettable, though the actors play it for all it's worth. Arthur is worth a watch though, if just for several very good, rather Gladiator-esque fight scenes and some rather above par acting from several lesser known British actors. Don't go for the history, but just take it as a movie.It just goes without saying that armor never goes out of style and Smurf blue is a great accent piece for leather.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arthurian Legend Revisited as Seven Knights in Snow Wars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"King Arthur" seems like a prequel to Hollywood's usual telling of the legend, as it goes back to the origins of the myth, pre-medieval chivalric culture (and I even watched the promotional documentary on the History Channel to be prepped). As written by David Franzoni, who used similar themes in "Gladiator," this Arthur is loyal to some ideal about Rome -- that's strikingly similar to that other commander's. Which is confusing because THIS Rome is now the Holy Roman Empire. Arthur's disillusionment when he finds out that Rome has fallen far short of his ideals raises the movie out of just being an action flick - but not by much. Much as Clive Owen has grabbed my attention since I first saw him on Brit TV, he's not exactly an inspiring leader here. He's more Hamlet-like, the cerebral one among the Knights of the Round Table, with a particular philosopher he's loyal to, as Maximus was to an earlier one. While there's a lot of borrowing from "Seven Samurai," the knights also recall a certain Fellowship of diverse hair styles; it can't be a coincidence that a Danish actor is styled to look a lot like Aragorn, another is an Australian hunk, while Ray Winstone takes over his scenes with Cockney bluster. But then the accents make zero consistent sense, from the first moment we meet Lancelot as a young boy stepping out of the family yert on the steppes of Eastern Sarmatia with perfect enunciation of the King's English. Stellan Skarsg?rd has great fun as a sullen Saxon villain (providing a new meaning of WASP - White Anglo Saxon Pagan?), much like Brian Cox's actor-slumming in "Troy." This Guinevere is in cahoots with Merlin to bring Merlin's prophesy true that Arthur will lead her tribe to victory-- helped by knowing his secret mixed Roman/Briton origins -- and she'll do anything to get him to do so, much further than Princess Leia went to keep Han Solo loyal to her rebels. Though her eyes are on Lancelot, her head's on manipulating Arthur. Heck, she even has to show him what to do in bed to inspire him in battle, while Lancelot keeps bragging to the other knights about his sexual conquests. But her leather thong battle bikini was straight out of a guilty pleasure TV show that Sci Fi Channel repeats sometimes - "Roar" that also takes place when some Roman Empire or other is faltering in Britain and the tribes need uniting against them. The battle scenes are just plain fun! We've seen showers of flaming arrows before, but the battle on ice even beats out the snow fights in one of the "Star Wars." Which was probably why the matinee audience I saw it with was mostly guys. Too many knights are killed off to make for a good sequel, but then I wasn't even sure what geography exactly Arthur is king of at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very underrated gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Arthur:Antoine Fuqua's King Arthur is an underrated gem, and one of my favourite post 90's medieval epics. It opened to lukewarm reviews,our reception and was ultimately written off. Too bad. It's a rousing, detailed, character driven adrenaline rush, and on top of being visually stunning, it has a brain in its head as well, as its characters actually have something to say as they chop each other's heads off. Clive Owen makes an honourable Artorius, leading knights of the round table that are far grittier than any legends we heard as kids. Him and his crew are actually Sarmatian warriors, taken in their early years to give years of service to the rampaging Roman Empire, as tribute for their lands. Theirs is a tough life, fighting one hair raising battle after another for a cause that was never their own. Each actor plays their knight with a sense dignity, humour and humanity, and it amazes me in a film as fast paced as this that they took the care to write like, six or seven different supporting characters so diverse, detailed and different. Ray Winstone is an a optional wrecking ball as the rowdy Bors, Mads Mikkelsen plays quiet, deadly and loyal as Tristram, Hugh Dancy is outraged and passionate as Galahad, Joel Egerton sly and good natured as Gawain, Ray Stevenson a gentle giant as, and Ioan Gruffudd makes a brooding, jaded, yet hopeful Lancelot. The film pits them in a close quarters battle with the Saxons, led by the terrifying Cerdic (Stellen Skarsgard is just 'piss your pants scary' in one of his best roles). Keira Knightely also joins the party as a kick ass, archery loving version of Guinevere, full of sass and wounded patriotism. The film rides the high of Hans Zimmer's utterly invigorating score, which is some of his very best work. From scene to scene it has a wonderfully flowing, beauty laden aesthetic, from an ice siege in a narrow pass, to a misty forest ambush, to the all out thundering roar of the final battle. It uses the picturesque, damp, wild UK locations to achieve some really amazing shots. One note: it's important to see the Director's cut, which is longer and presented in all its bloody, romantic, uncensored glory. Disney, who had shares in the rights at the time, had to be a buzzkill and insist they tone it down for its theatrical run, which is bullshit, to put it mildly. That could be a reason it didn't do too well in theatres initially. Irregardless, it's a blood stirring, gorgeous film of epic proportions and an excellent addition to the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're going to make a movie of this type you should try to make it historically accurate, have a good story, have good quality credible acting, and/or have some other artistic or aesthetic merit. This didn't really have any of that.Maybe the worst thing was the constant abuse of historical accuracy even though it was sort of spun as being a realistic portrayal of the legend. Actually, now that I think about it, the fairly mindless story and one-dimension characters were almost as bad.Not the worst movie I've ever seen but certainly pretty bad! I would far prefer the traditional Arthur legends with the magic and all that sort of stuff - at least they are more believable!</fullReview>

If the screenwriters are going for historical, then I wish at least they would attempt to get *some* facts straight, and not just add things (such as crossbows several centuries too early) because they think it looks good. And how in the world Keira Knightly didn't get hypothermia is anyones guess - people in that time wore several layers of animal skins. And since when did Scotland resemble Switzerland? I did eventually manage to enjoy the film, mostly thanks to the skills of the actors involved for making you care about their characters, but I still feel like lining the scriptwriters against a wall and aiming one of their imaginary crossbows at them.</fullReview>

The fight scenes were well enough directed (though not as good as those from Gladiator) and the rest of the knights each embraced their own characters well but I just couldn't enjoy all that because every line spoken by Owen destroyed any suspension of belief. It was as if he was a fourteen year old reading from a book to the class in an English lesson.Do yourself a favour. Watch Gladiator or Troy or if you really want something Arthurian watch Excalibur.

		<shortDescription>untrue story, Hollywood needs to refrain from these claims.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All my life as I can remember history books being my friends. However history has always been mere translation of what has happened in the Past. I find it totally insulting that Hollywood can time and time again use phrases like based on a true story, the untold true story and so on. This is not history. While the movie does have elements of the Aurthur tale which may ring true, their are many translations on the story which predates the 14th century monks tale. In my research on the Arthurian tale their is only one very loose connection to him being Roman. In fact the style and translation of many of the features are of Celtic origin. There is a Welsh Aurthur, a Scottish Aurthur, even an Irish Arthur and of course the romantic 14th century tail claimed by the English to be their own. whatever the truth may be it is insulting to have a movie claim it to be a true story. Show us the evidence, Show us your research. I would have enjoyed this story more if it did not claim itself to be true. So I take 7 points off for false claims. What can you expect from the producers of Pearl Harbour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Arthur - Director's Cut - Antoine Obviously got Royally Shafted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like King Arthur (Director's Cut) _except_ as noted below.To Bloody Hell with folks who argue about the trivial details on history versus the myth... this is a truly enjoyable film! Poor director Antoine Fuqua got the Royal Hollywood Shaft. His blood-and-guts take got "Pee-Geed" something awful. Keep trying Antoine, maybe you'll hit it out of the park someday, I hope without commercial interests screwing you over... Anyway, enough grit, grease, blood and gore got in his cut to make it a believable depiction of the harsh days of post-Roman Britons battling the invading Saxons.I got this DVD many months ago, in a rather strange way. Ordinarily, I'd probably still not have it... Unless, as I did, I chose to buy it to "test" my new DVD player.My first view of Clive Owen was in this film as "King" Arthur. His appearances in "Sin City" and "The Bourne Identity," among many others, reinforce my impression of his very fine acting ability.My first view of Ray Winstone, too... I just love his portrayal of "Bors". Fine comic relief, and yet he is a super-fierce fighter, too. Bors is great! Keira Kinightley puts in a surprisingly good job as "Chief Woad-ess" Guinevere, a fighter first (and lover when she gets the chance)... As a matter of fact, ALL those supporting actors and actresses were just so fine!Oh, and by the way, the music is very, very fine; it makes the film that much more enjoyable. HOWEVER I just watched "Gladiator," a movie also scored by Hans Zimmer. And Guess What? Some of the melodies and their accompanying chord structures were lifted right out of Gladiator, the earlier of the two, and dropped right into "King Arthur"! I don't know who's responsible for this, but I suspect producers and Zimmer worked it out together. For Shame! This is absolutely reprehensible! This STINKS! One of the dirtiest let's-just-save-work-on-creativity tricks I can think of! So I am derating this movie severely and, if I ever write comments on Gladiator, Ill do the same to it!The "Ice Battle" scene never ceases to be enjoyable and amazing... Wow, what a great cinematic delight!And yet, with all this praise, the plot and scenes tend to dip into Hollywoodish hyberbole and over-dramatized schlock on more than one occasion.To wit: The only scene which REALLY gets my heart a-twitter with genuine admiration is probably totally unnoticed by most viewers. That's when Arthur and the six knights (and the faithful secretary Horton) start out from their little fort on Hadrian's Wall to venture north on the mission to save the hapless Roman family living "up there" in Woad Territory. When the soldiers knock the chocks out of those big bars on the inside of that gate, and the dust puffs up, and big draft horses strain to open them up... Pure glory, really. Photographic / cinematic quality supreme! It lasts all of maybe two minutes, total...Immediately followed by a much longer, truly idiotic scene where Arthur and the merry crew are trapped in the dripping woods by the Devil Ghost Woads... It makes no sense whatsoever. Over Here, This Way... Follow Me! What a laugh! Another To Wit: The "ending," where Arthur marries Guinevere, and then pretentiously pronounces that Britons will henceforth be forever united, is really quite head-shakingly ridiculous. Poor Antoine claims it's OK, but we all know he really preferred to have a much more "realistic" ending, one which did not pander to 12-year-old brain cells. Flaming arrows in the air? Jeeeeeeesch! And yet, Antoine has enough spirit remaining to point out the beautiful chestnut horse just "after" the ending, where the horse "bows" and his eye glints in the sunlight. That is really, really nice...So the film is _quite_ variable in quality, quite a roller-coaster ride from the truly sublime to the laughingly ridiculous... And yet I always enjoy watching it.4 out of 10, mainly because of that dirty trick with the score...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Arthur starts out from a worthy and interesting premise: An historical interpretation of the Arthurian legend, based on a Romano-British commander at the time of the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century AD. I was enthusiastic. I loved Bernard Cornwell's Warlord Chonicles, and was looking forward to a similarly innovative and realistic imagining of the mythical characters.But in that I was disappointed. Although King Arthur sets out to explain the etiology of the myth in historical terms, it never quite manages to reconcile the historical and the mythical accounts, and instead ends up being a messy amalgamation of both. The many ridiculous historical inaccuracies and anachronisms- not only of facts and geography, but also philosophical and theological concepts- have already been discussed at length, so I won't go into them. What disappointed me most was the confused and meandering plot, which seemed to lack any kind of cohesion or focus, and the lack of any real exploration of the characters.What starts off as the knights' personal quest for release from their conscription in the Roman army (their 'last assignment for Rome' itself little more than a transparent plot device) becomes some idealistic (and ludicrously suicidal) crusade to free Britain from the invading Saxons in one last battle. The reason for this complete reversal of objective is seemingly their love and loyalty for their commander (who is so completely without authority, gravitas or charisma he couldn't inspire loyalty in German Shepherd) and the irresistible allure of his noble ideology; that all men were born free. From the start the character's motivations are overly contrived and self-consciously ideological to the point of cheesiness- as is the dialogue.The problem is that the story labours under such high-minded concepts that it is never given a chance to rise above the conceptual. Its treatment is heavy-handed, and put together so awkwardly that you can see the joints. As much as the director tries to put some gloss on it with high production values, the basic construction is too shoddy to support the weight of the production. Consequently, everything is left feeling a bit flimsy (like the chipboard Hadrian's wall). There were entertaining moments, mostly provided by the action sequences and interaction between the knights, but those moments when you could suspend your disbelief and immerse yourself in the story were all too brief, as another atrociously delivered line was always just round the corner to jolt you out of the illusion. Only two performances rose above either the cringesome or the forgettable: Ray Winstone as Bors, whose bellowing provided a lovely juxtaposition with the smouldering glances of Ioan Gruffud as Lancelot, whose subtle and intelligent performance makes one wonder why he wasn't given more to do.This film could have been a spectacular historical epic on a par with Braveheart and Gladiator (two historically inaccurate but hugely entertaining films) yet it is let down by a poor script and woefully inadequate performances. Hollywood should get it right next time, and film Bernard Cornwell's Arthur trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone that has read ANY Arthurian folklore, novels, poems, or ANYTHING this movie is a huge disappointment. True, the movie may have been closer to historically accurate; but, as always, the book is much better than the movie. Turning King Arthur's story into "Braveheart", (although Braveheart was a great movie, don't get me wrong), was a mistake. The story of this Legendary King could've been done much better; and seeing Merlin as a Barbarian made me throw- up a little. Furthermore, the movie lacks character development. Just because he's "Arthur", and those are his "knights of the round table", we're supposed to care about them is a bad philosophy (especially when they butcher the story and make it boring). The characters are thrown into these situations without us getting to know or care about any of them. Thus, when the main characters died in the movie I didn't care. This is such a lame and futile attempt at telling the story of King Arthur. Look at Lord of the Rings, however, they didn't sacrifice time for quality, they stayed true to the story (and it's an excellent story). This movie was disappointing. Nuff' said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the premise of the latest retelling of the Arthurian legend, is partially based on archaeological speculations on the origins of a historical King Arthur, it is decidedly the Cliffs Notes version of a very complex historical record. As for basic storytelling skills, it falls painfully short. The visuals are exciting, but end up being too few and far between to compensate for a general hack job of the charm of the many Arthur stories compiled from the Middle Ages onwards. There were several historical figures that may have been amalgamated into the Arthur we know from Geoffery of Monmouth and Thomas Mallory's writings, beginning in post-Roman England. The script lightly samples from both the romantic legends and the history on which it's supposed to be based, and vomits out this film at the end of it. It's not supposed to be a historical re-enactment, but precisely does what it was designed to do, and be a butts-in-seats popcorn muncher movie. It doesn't even have to be good, as long as it makes money - which seems to be the current Hollywood mantra. Though despite valiant efforts in acting from the cast in trying to make the trite dialog palatable, the story is dull, there's little to no chemistry in the love triangle, and poor Stellan Skarsgard is buried under an avalanche of blond hair. Maybe Hollywood will do better next time, because this film was altogether a painful waste of talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The people who made "King Arthur" strive to live down the legend.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anybody who knows anything about the history of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table in the cinema knows that English director John Boorman staged the best version of the Arthurian myth in 1981 in his classic sword &amp; sorcery saga "Excalibur." Before "Excalibur" set the gold standard, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer produced as their first widescreen film "Knights of the Round Table" (1953) in blazing Technicolor with Robert Taylor and Ava Gardner. The 1967 musical "Camelot" featured Richard Harris as Arthur and Vanessa Redgrave as Guinevere and the serviceable 1995 Sean Connery/Richard Gere swashbuckler "First Knight" both deserve honorable mention. Any of these four, however, would eclipse the latest rehash of the Arthur legend. Not only do "Training Day" director Antoine Fuqua, "Gladiator" scripter David Franzoni and "Pearl Harbor" producer Jerry Bruckheimer strip the luster off the legend in their new movie "King Arthur" (** out of ****), but also they forego full-blown fantasy for half-baked fact. Based on 'recent archaeological findings,' Fuqua, Franzoni and Bruckheimer have revised the fable, so they can tell 'the untold true story that inspired the legend' in their tedious, long-winded, grimy, 130-minute mishmash of British mythology. Romance takes a back seat to the shoddily choreographed action sequences, and to preserve a PG-13 rating the filmmakers could only show blood on the combatant's swords. This time around Merlin appears as a wise elder with zero magical powers, while Guinevere emerges as a feisty battle maiden dressed up as a dominatrix packing a sword or a bow in either hand. Despite its mostly-Brit cast led by actor Clive Owen in a sterling performance as Arthur and "Black Hawk Down" lenser Slawomir Idziak's atmospheric cinematography, "King Arthur" does everything wrong in its misguided effort to create a new, different, and more realistic Arthur."King Arthur" concerns itself with the roots of the Round Table. In this handsomely produced but hackneyed hokum, we learn that the mythical Arthur owes everything to a real person who lived back in the Dark Ages during the Fifth Century. This Arthur (Clive Owen of "Beyond Borders") is a Roman officer in command of an elite cavalry unit consisting of guys from Sarmatia (somewhere near the modern Republic of Georgia in Europe) who made a pact with Marcus Aurelius to serve in his army for fifteen years. Imagine a gritty, down-to-earth "Magnificent Seven" as knights on horseback, and you'll have an idea what to expect. As the story unfolds, our heroes await their walking papers as Arthur discusses terms with Roman Bishop Germanius (Ivan Marescotti of "Hannibal"). The Bishop cooks up a last-minute suicide mission for Arthur and his knights that requires them to cross Hadrian's Wall and liberate a Roman family living on a farm in the middle of enemy country. The savage Saxon hordes, like the Apaches in a western, are descending from every quarter, and the Romans are pulling out, so the Bishop needs somebody expendable. After Arthur and his knights reach the farm, they discover the slimy Roman has natives holed up in a dungeon where he tortures them in the name of the Vatican. A wizened shaman named Merlin advises these rebellious Woads, and Guinevere (Keira Knightley of "Pirates of the Caribbean") is one of them, locked up and tormented until Arthur sets her free. Now, our heroes must escort this motley crew through treacherous territory with the murderous Saxons breathing down their necks every inch of the way.The chief problem with "King Arthur" lies in David Franzoni's dreadful screenplay. The rescue mission on which Arthur and the knights embark resembles an uninspired 1950's era cavalry western. Interestingly, the rescue recalls Fuqua's lackluster last opus "Tears of the Sun" with Bruce Willis. In "King Arthur," Franzoni and Fuqua make the fatal mistake of taking themselves far, far too seriously. Not even actor Ray Winstone's churlish character Bors can redeem "King Arthur." As a chivalrous Round Table Knight, Bors is a poorly dressed shaven-headed lout with several illegitimate children who threatens to marry their mother. Fuqua and company play Bors largely for laughs. Using crude contemporary slang, Bors becomes the first on-screen knight to carp about the need to urinate. Hans Zimmer's dirge-like orchestral music hangs tragically over the ponderous action. Fuqua should stick to helming urban thrillers like "The Replacement Killers" and "Training Day," because he cannot orchestrate epic battle sequences. The larger-than-life battle between our heroes and the villainous Saxons on an iced-over lake lacks dramatic intensity, though the underwater shots bolster the suspense. Watching Keira Knightley triumph over opponents twice her size in combat stretches credibility to the breaking point. Meanwhile, the underwritten characters of Gawain, Tristan and Galahad spend most of their time on the periphery of the action, while the heavy-handed historical exposition bogs down the action. Stellan Skarsgard doesn't make much of an impression as the villain through his bearded face and whispered dialogue. Franzoni pulls a surprise that cannot be revealed without spoiling the plot. Believe me, when it happens, you will feel cheated. As for the love triangle involving Guinevere, Arthur, and Lancelot, "King Arthur" leaves it out! In their quest for a more historically accurate interpretation of the Arthurian legend, the people who made "King Arthur" strive to live down the legend.

		<shortDescription>One of the worst films ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely awful. The worst acting I have ever witnessed. Ever. In the world. Clive Owen and Keira knightly were so wooden it almost defies belief. Winstone was ridiculous and Druffud ponced around like some half baked super model in comedy armour. All smouldering looks and cheeky grins. The effects were OK but a tad on the "budget" side, with walls and castles built out of MDF and plastic or clumsily computer rendered. The costumes were great to look at (as was the film, generally), but fairly inaccurate, especially towards the end with half the good guys dressed as samurais and Mongols and horses tarted up in daft leather armour, designed to look something like a cross between the traditional dark-ages styling we normally associate with king Arthur's tales, and the probably more accurate last days of the roman empire. The script was risible and, as a result, quite entertaining - so bad it was funny - stylistically inconsistent and lazy. Like my writing. The soundtrack was the usual clichéd twaddle one expects from Hans Zimmer, all Clannad/ Enya-style ethereal voices with a Gothic feel nicked straight from the Dead Can Dance/Lisa Gerrard(who collaborated with him on 'Gladiator') school, but lacking in the beauty and subtly of Gerrards best work. The storyline had the potential to be quite interesting, drawn largely from modern theories relating to the Arthurian legend, wisely steering away from the sword and sorcery drivel put forward by Geoffrey of Monmouth and the like. But needless to say it never really went beyond 'Arthur was a Roman and his mates were all pagans'. All in all: Rubbish. Oh. Apart, that is, from the fact that Ms Knightley is so stunningly beautiful it almost hurts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ack, what happened here?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As many other reviewers have pointed out, this movie attempts to forgo the fantasy aspect to portray a more realistic Arthurian legend. If you believe Lancelot was a Spaniard that wore a black leather basket-weave blouse, that King Arthur was a boring and uncharismatic Roman lackey, and that Merlin was a mud encrusted Celtic hillbilly, then this movie won't bother you one bit. If you were hoping to see any of the relevant quests of the Knights of the Round or even the knights themselves (besides the aforementioned very "Artist formerly known as Prince"-like Lancelot) you will be sorely disappointed. Whoever wrote this story obviously had little knowledge or love of Arthurian legend and after watching this movie I longed for the days when director Antoine Fuqua was merely a music video director (as he should have stayed). Whoever did the casting for this movie must have come into work drugged, drunk, and tired because everyone, save for Keira Knightly was horribly miscast. While Clive Owen has a place in Hollywood, it's certainly not as a leading man, and he proves it with the dullest, most lackluster performance of King Arthur ever portrayed on the big screen. I've seen high school drama flunkies that could do a more convincing Arthur. I wouldn't have followed this man to a Kwik-E-Mart, much less into battle. He was really much better off playing a driver in BMW-sponsored short films where his dialogue was limited to mostly one-liners. The acting was laughable and the movie in itself was utterly forgettable. I had gone into this movie with an open mind - realizing that such a legend could only be butchered by Hollywood - but so little did I realize how badly one could butcher it. I'm not going to complain about how far off this movie is from Excalibur (which is by far a superior movie BTW) because I realize they were trying to make it as believable as possible. I'm complaining because it failed to rouse even the slightest bit of interest out of me. I was bored to tears and when the movie was finally over I could only breathe a sigh of relief, forgetting momentarily the anger I initially felt of being ripped off by paying to go watch it. The ridiculous costumes and even more ridiculous dialogue paved the way for the most ridiculous rendition of the Arthur legends possibly ever made. Fuqua seemed to steal scenes from everything from The Last of the Mohicans to Gladiator, while never even approaching a sense of excitement or even entertainment. Surely someone must have spoken up during filming about the horrid costume Lancelot was wearing. He looked like Prince during his Purple Rain era - hardly the knight in shining armor I've been accustomed to envision. In fact, these "knights" were barely armored at all. Who would go into battle with a blouse on? Anyway, if you're really, REALLY bored, a 13 year old girl, and absolutely must have your sword-swinging, period drama fix - then give this movie a shot. Otherwise - steer clear. No - run away. Run far, far away. I'm confused - and you will be too if you try to watch this. Two thumbs down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst epic of 2004</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually love big epics in the mold of Braveheart and Gladiator, and I have always loved the myths about king Arthur and his famous knights of the Round Table. I just couldn't wait to see King Arthur the movie, even if the casting of Ioan Gruffudd and Keira Knightley didn't exactly top my list over suitable actors - and wow! Was I disappointed!!! Troy was boring, but at least glossy, Alexander was messy and campy, but at least (unintentionally) funny, but King Arthur??? By far the worst epic of last year!!! I don't even know where to begin...Clive Owen's dull, wooden Arthur, clearly unable to command the undying loyalty of any man, woman or child in the kingdom of Britain - the bony Knightley in warpaint and a laughable BIKINI from the days of yore - the mighty knights reduced to seven men, doing their best to kick some spark of life into the whole damn thing, but really just out of sync comic relief (Ray Winstone, Mads Mikkelsen - the Dane actually being the only man on show with a bit of charisma). Add to this woeful cast some downright boring dialogue and a storyline that makes no sense what so ever, and yes, you have one giant stinker of a movie! I want to know who decided to turn the magical legend of king Arthur into this tired, dull hokum! By all means, re-thinking the legend can be quite refreshing, and doing away with the magic and the supernatural to focus on the man behind the myth could have been very interesting. But it still requires a story, and there is none! For all its talk of grittiness, and showing the real world and not the romances, it's just all too neat, too limp, too anachronistic, with king Arthur harping on about the freedom of the British people, and battle scenes with the look of tidy studio choreography. Nothing worked - I still can't tell if the poor actors couldn't act, or if they were just completely let down by a totally inept script!!! If you want epics, watch Braveheart and Gladiator. Even Ben Hur and Spartacus are better epics, and they're not exactly what I would call untouched by time and better techniques and bigger budgets! But at least they can boast of characters you actually care about...a bit. Anyway, most movies, regardless of genre, are better than King Arthur!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total disaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie King Arthur has completely failed in all cinematic ways. Starting with the script and lines by Franzoni, holding all the clichés and ripoffs one can ever imagine. Not a single line were delivered in a realistic way and felt stupid and unbelievable. Because of this the acting was embarrassing, maybe not the actors fault since they partly have been performing well earlier.Two movies have more than inspired the team Bruckheimer and Fuqua; Gladiator and Lord of the Ring. The scriptwriter Franzoni has in particular tried to copy lines and scenes. This makes the movie an attempt, a very bad and desperate one, to make a adventure/saga that's already been told a thousand times before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Worst Films in History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What happens when a bunch of Hollywood producers sit around a table, sniff too much of the white stuff, throw money at each other and make fun of Britain?'King Arthur' is what.Essentially, this film attempts to tell the story of King Arthur to an MTV audience of people with attention spans of 3 minutes 30 seconds, bring in the producer of Flashdance and the director of a few Arrested Development music videos, with very little British influence at all.So where does this film fail? The acting, the casting, the script, the production, the cinematography, the history, everything about this film is flawed. Great, it'll give more people the incentive to like Britain (just like Top Gun caused people to run to the USAF recruitment offices), but I think, as a Briton, I'd like it to be more accurate and less Americanised and less raped by MTV.We all know the story so I won't reiterate it, but my advice to anybody viewing this is to check out the history for yourself - Arthur's search for the Grail, the Isle of Avalon, the Tor of Glastonbury, his defeat of the Saxons, his Knights of the Round Table, etc. This film is about as accurate describing the tale of King Arthur as the accuracy of the tale of George Bush's search for Weapons of Mass Destruction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ho Hum, Pearl Harbor all over again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years ago, I took a friend to see a Fred Dryer movie about Marines in the Middle East. It sucked and he always said that he would have his revenge."King Arthur" was it. My friend managed to pay me back but good, AND he did it on my birthday, a double whammy.And the hits keep coming:Performances that were faxed in, or were examples of scenery-chewing on a monumental scale, with little real characterisation or relationships created, just enough to know that those guys over there are bad guys, and the ones on the horses spouting US foreign policy are good guys.A script that ignores any attempt at real research (reminiscent of that execrable TV show "Roar"), and provides dialogue that wouldn't be out of place in "Xena" or " Hercules".Continual soap-box rants about "freedom", interesting considering the Roman world was dependent for its survival on slavery of many varieties.A thin plot, paper thin, transparent, with more holes than "Pearl Harbor".There really isn't any point in going into details, there simply isn't enough room provided for me to do so. Believe me, the devil is definitely in the details.Suffice it to say that there were too few moments of real satisfaction, and far too many that were like fingernails down a blackboard.If you want a movie that will keep you interested for as long as it takes for you to make a cup of coffee, and then turn off the DVD and watch reruns on free-to-air TV, then this is the movie for you.If, however, you want an heroic story of a dark and turbulent period of history that shaped our world, then read, yes READ, "Eagle in the Snow" by Wallace Breem. It gives an honest view of people and events that quite frankly are insulted by this travesty of a motion picture.By the way, Lucius Artorius Castus did exist, as a commander of Sarmatian cavalry in Britain and Gaul around 180 AD, evidenced by a funeral monument. Unfortunately the film is set somewhere between 410 and 500 AD, around 250 years later, at a time when the Sarmatians and the Roman military machine were no longer in Britain and Hadrian's Wall was no longer used. They couldn't even get that right.Simply atrocious.</fullReview>

His father was Meurig. His Grandfather was Tewdrig who died fighting the Saxons near Tintern, South Wales in AD 630All the above correct information can be freely found on the internet.It's about time that the World knew that King Arthur was indeed a Welshman who was King of Glamorgan &amp; Gwent.Another thing, the 'Celts' never settled in Britain, they stayed in Southern France and merely traded with the true Britons, ie Wales and Cornwall.He did however campaign in Scotland, England and even Brittany.If you want the truth, seek out the books by Wilson &amp; Blackett</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers here-inI went into this movie with high expectations. As a history buff and a lover of Arthurian Legends, I was anxious to see this movie. I loved the idea of peeling away all the myth, getting at the core of the story. Even more so, I loved the idea of seeing Arturius Rex in action. Unfortunately, within mere moments, I realized this movie had little chance of improvement.Starting off the film with a young Lancelot going off to war, this film was very slow. But slow is not always bad. Writer David Franzoni (Amistad, Gladiator) and Director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Bait) make an interesting coupling, but it just does not work. The change of Guinevere from a dainty Queen to a Warrior was a welcomed one. The problem with this film is that it throws in names simply for recognition purposes only. Had the film-makers truly been interested in keeping the film, Merlin, most likely, would not have been mentioned as he is a fairly recent addition to the saga (as are Lancelot, Guinevere, and several others). The knights mentioned (Gawain, Galahad, et al) are glazed over. One of the main failings with the film are not its dialogue, cinematography, or even its lack of character development. Instead, it fails on the historical level. To quote Polydore Vergil, court historian for King Henry VIII, If Arthur had fought against the Romans, he would have had to be at least 200 years old when he took on the sixth-century Saxons. With Rome leaving the British Isles in A.D. 406, and this film being set in the seventh century, Arthur looks mighty well preserved. The problem, however, is that this film is combining TWO different Arthurs. The first fought against the Romans, the second fought the Saxons. If this film is going claim "The untold true story that inspired the legend" as they do on the Previews and the Poster, I should think that they would have done more research.For someone who is not a history buff, but is a lover of Arthurian Legends, this is still not the movie for you. Ending with the Battle of Mount Baedan (Badon Hill), it is Lancelot who suffers the untimely death, instead of Arthur at Camblam (Camlann). The appearance of the Sword in the Stone seems thrown into the hodge-podge of the story simply for recognition purposes, and with no explanation as to why it is there.Now, I admit I am viewing this film from a biased stand-point, so I may not be the one to best judge the film, but I have always felt if you are going to make an adaptation of a book, play, or other source material, then you should stick to the story that is given. Certain changes I can understand, but to totally go off-track from the story is precisely what was done with many other book-to-film adaptations. If you want a better adaptation of King Arthur, check out Excalibre, Camelot, or even Disney's The Sword in the Stone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid and disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the worse movies i have ever seen. It's not funny or interesting and the plot is full of inconsistencies and unrealistic details. It tried to be serious by adding morality to the theme but in the end just became downright silly. For instance, why did the well trained all conquering Romans need to leave if the Saxons can be defeated by just a band of Celts and a handful of horsemen. If i'm not mistaken the trebuchets were pulled by hand (no counterweight), hmm wonder how far the projectile would go. Furthermore these sophisticated siege weapons must be made out of plastic or something to slide across the earth with such ease. Without any preparations at all Arthur and his men fought along side the Celts with such perfect coordination, precision and discipline that even the Roman legions would be proud of. Enough said already for i have wasted enough time on this worthless piece of trash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a start, I'm not a great stickler for historical accuracy, so I can't tell you if this was accurate or not, nor do I really care. If a film is entertaining, then that's enough for me.King Arthur, on the other hand, might have had a promising take on the Arthur legend, but it is totally sabotaged by some of the actors' non-abilities. What you have here is an almost right across the board example of mis-casting.The plot: Arthur and his buddies are part of the Roman army, defending Hadrian's wall from the Woads, who are led by Merlin. However, in order to earn their freedom (as the Romans are leaving) Arthur and his buddies must rescue a Roman family from invading Saxons. You know the drill: self-sacrifice, learning of 'Freedom', etc etc. Could have been good, except for...1) Ray Winstone. Great as a cockney gangster. Throw some armour on him, and he's still a cockney gangster. Dress him up as an ostrich, and he's still a cockney gangster. Get him to narrate a documentary about mandrills, and it's a cockney gangster doing the narration. He's not even supposed to British here.2) Stella SkansIcan'tbebotheredlookinguphisname - His voice sounds like treacle being filtered through a brillo pad, and he acts as if someone slipped 5 valium into his coffee. Rubbish.3) Keira Knightley - Always the worst thing about any film, Keira here manages to portray a paganistic warrior type as a lady who's just completed Swiss finishing school. Plus she keeps doing that thing with her chin. And it's very hard to believe someone that weighs half an ounce can even lift a sword.4) Clive Owen, usually not bad, looks as if he's realised how bad the film would be about three seconds after signing up.Honestly, it's very difficult to get around the mis-casting and enjoy the story. I'll just stick to Excalibur, thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anachronisms abound as Hollywood once again tears apart the Arthur myth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose they meant well. And their attempts to place the legendary hero Arthur in a more realistic era are to be applauded. But in truth, there are all sorts of problems with this disappointing failure.On the upside, it looks good. It's well dressed, well shot, and where the lesser characters are concerned, well acted. But unfortunately that's where the plaudits end and the brickbats begin.As Arthur, Clive Owen is about as wooden as it's possible for an actor to be and remain in place as the star of the film. He's far too clean cut, and doesn't pack anything like sufficient passion to be convincing as a Dark Ages war-chief. He should have been replaced in the role by Ioan Gruffud, who is wasted as Lancelot, Lancelot himself being wasted ? his part in the famous tale is here reduced to that of a cynical lieutenant. Guinevere is portrayed by Keira Knightley as a Celtic warrior princess ? not a bad idea, but as always in the hands of Knightley, and particularly ludicrously on this occasion, she sounds as though she's just emerged from ladies finishing school. Perhaps the biggest disappointment of all is the absence of Merlin, the most enigmatic personality in the whole story. Okay he's here, but he does and says so little that he might as well not be.We also have several bizarre switches from winter to summer. One minute we're on a frozen lake, the next we're on a verdant meadow with all the trees in full leaf. It's baffling and rather silly, and completely detracts from the otherwise effectively harsh climate that the film seeks to create. Even the battles don't work particularly well. They've been applauded by many, but to me they suffer from what I call "the 'Troy' disease" in that they are painfully over-choreographed. It's more like watching a ballet rehearsal than an actual fight.There are all sorts of historical issues too, and yet again you wonder why, when they had such a good original story to work from, the movie makers had to change so much. Everybody knows nowadays that Arthur, if he existed, was not a medieval king presiding over a chivalrous court. He was most likely an ex-Roman officer, who assembled tribal leaders to fend off the Saxon incursions (the Saxons incidentally did not invade Britain via Scotland, as is shown in the film ? they came in through the south-east, and their conquest was not a holocaust, but a gradual colonisation). In this instance however, Arthur is presented as a Roman officer serving at the head of a troop of Samartian horsemen (very anachronistically referred to as 'knights'); an odd and pointless diversion from the myth, in which, far more excitingly, his supporters are natives who must learn to defend their homeland after the protection of the legions has been withdrawn. Sadder still, none of the really dramatic events of Arthur's reign ? his creation of the Round Table to unite a nation, his heroic death not at the hands of invaders but in a treachery-filled civil war ? are even touched upon. All we're really dealing with here is a rescue mission just north of Hadrian's Wall, which goes badly wrong. Hardly the stuff great romances are made of.Another missed historical opportunity, and in this case a particularly bad one ? with the money that was spent here, a seriously good Arthurian epic could have resulted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupidest movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so bad that words can't fully describe just how bad it truly is, but I'll try. Clive Owen is Arthur, a Roman-Briton who leads a group of knights along Hadrian's Wall to protect the Roman part of Britain from the "Woads" who are Britons opposed to Roman rule.The plot as it is, shows Arthur's journey from a Roman-supporting individual to a man who realizes that the British people deserve freedom and that Britain needs to be free from the Romans. Along the way he rescues a Roman family who live north of Hadrian's Wall, fights a Saxon army which has invaded Britain, and meets and marries Guinevere (Keira Knightley). The performances were okay, Clive Owen got annoying due to the number of flat-out stupid speeches his character made. Kudos to Stellan Skarsg?rd as Cerdic, the Saxon chieftain. He did a good job with a rote character.Overall, the dialog was laughable, the plot made little sense, and a lot of stuff was just wrong:1) Movie purports to be "realistic" but features a voice-over by a guy who dies during the movie. If he died, how is he narrating it?2) Arthur's "knights" are Sarmatian horsemen from Russia (or somewhere in East Europe) who have been forced into serving in the Roman army, yet they are named Lancelot, Galahad and Gawain.. you know... traditional Russian names.3) The "knights" have to serve the Romans for 15 years before they are free to go. When the movie starts, it shows the "knights" arriving in Britain when they are all 10-13 years old. When the movie shifts to present time, half the "knights" are clearly around 40 years old. Why not just say they had to serve 25 years so the whole thing wouldn't look so idiotic?4) The "knights" are basically Roman slaves, yet they order Romans around and clearly enjoy a lot of authority and autonomy.5) Related to #4, the "knights" are always yammering about being "free" but they're not under any kind of discipline or rules. They question and argue with Arthur, one guy has hooked up with a woman and has 11 kids (this is a running joke through the movie), they pull swords on Roman soldiers, they menace a Roman Bishop... so how exactly are they not free when it looks like they can do whatever they want?6) In this "realistic" movie, the Roman Empire is ruled by the Pope. No mention of the Emperor or the Senate, just the Pope.7) The seasons change according to the needs of the script. It's hardcore winter with snow and ice covered lakes and mountains when Arthur and the gang are going through East Britain, but when they travel a few miles South it's a nice lush, green summer.8) The movie makes it very clear that the Romans and the "Woads" who live North have been at war for a long time and that going North of Hadrian's Wall is dangerous. Yet an important Roman family with ties to the Pope lives by themselves in a villa way up North. Conveniently, Arthur needs to rescue them because the Saxon army is approaching.9) The Saxon's may as well have been called Orcs because that's how they rolled, they were just there to look evil and get chopped up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There was the bad and the ugly but where was the good?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's so much wrong with this film it's difficult to know where to start! And I've so much to do (like clean the toilet, walk the dog, pay those not so urgent bills I just got today!!!) that I need to keep this succinct.The script is awful - it's full of bad clichés, inane garblings and dreadfully scripted, delivered and edited scenes. Ray Winstone CAN deliver a hateful line but far too often was made to look and sound like some odd figure in a regional panto! The Saxon leader was plain comical - I can imagine he was intended to be brutal and menacing ... and for one or two fleeting moments he KINDA did ... but to a greater degree he was a whispering hairball of a baboon. He simply wasn't vicious enough - his was a marauding army flattening all before them, yet all he did was brood and look around for a worthy opponent.The casting is equally weak - Kiera Knightly may be elfish enough to convince us she's some form of mystical spirit even a fighter of sorts ... but a full grown warrior of a tribe that lives on the very margins of 'civilisation'?! Come on! And her accent! I didn't realise Oxbridge predates the Romans in Britain!! The directing also left a lot to be desired - only a handful of stand-out scenes: the face off on the frozen lake, the opening gambits of the main battle scene between the knights and the main Saxon army at the Roman garrison/ Hadrians wall. Apart from that I'm being kind by saying it was uninspired.Overall the tone of the movie is horribly morose - the whole story being taken too seriously by Fuqua.As an interpretation of the legend of Arthur this offered so much potential (fascinating historical context, contemporary relevancy, an interpretation of freedom, justice and nationhood) and it simply failed to deliver on all of them ... perhaps because it didn't know how to deliver on any of them.Arthur represents more than just raised arms and fists with swords and some loud battle cry and equally more than just some overwrought, over-dramatic and badly scripted lines and reference to nationhood and identity. This film epitomises one that starts out as a good idea but somewhere along the line is turned into a bad film. Which is a real shame because now that we've had this turkey we're unlikely to see another interpretation for some years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointingly bad thanks to Fuqua (Director)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not an author historian so I will not attempt to disprove anything. However simply reading the comments here made me realize at how incredibly far off they were. While I liked the attempt at a more realistic view including the Roman occupation of Briton and how it might tie into the legend, changing dates and events is completely unacceptable. You cannot just go back in history and rewrite what happened with factual events outside of the Authorian legend. ( I'm not going to repeat them here but please read Kayma_2's comments on the history) Instead you need to tightly knit it into what you already know happened.OK lets forget history for a minute. Now you are left with a butchering of the legend regardless. They start by having almost all of the knights killed off and you are left with only seven. Fine that almost works but not quite. Only a few are even remotely developed and most of these, especially the coolest (Tristan) are killed off! I should have known better, this is Antoine Fuqua, master of killing any hope of a good movie. He managed to make Navy Seals suck in Tears of the Sun.Casting was so so, Tristan, Cerdic and Bors were excellent but Arthur and Lancelot were not the best choices. Arthur needed to be older and wiser. Lancelot needed to be bigger and more English looking. Actually Owens would have been better as Lancelot. Cynric was poorly cast too, Schweiger just did not fit the role.The movie had some decent concepts and was shot fairly well. The frozen lake battle was probably the best but thanks to my man Fuqua he made sure to kill off one of the knights here. The redeeming qualities are few and far between.Political Correct Crap: Hot Chick Fighting - No I don't buy some weak ass female or any female during that period taking out tons or even one large Saxon soldier. The Hot Chick Fighting is so painful to watch. Why are bad things like this in so many movies today? Female archers are the only thing remotely plausible. Anyone thinking women actually fought successfully in hand to hand combat back then is delusional or stupid. During those scenes I had to turn away. Bad, Bad, Bad. Females aren't tough, they don't kick ass and they certainly don't wade through Saxon Soldiers, check please.Freedom! - The constant Braveheart speech ripoffs got tiring fast. This movie reminded me of some kid who saw Braveheart and wanted to make his own bad version of it. Was that you Fuqua?Strategy? - Arthur is supposed to be some "God of war" yet he makes incredibly stupid decisions, like letting the whole Saxon Army through the wall by opening the gates? Who does stupid decisions like this and lives? Oh thats right, King Arthur. Forget giving yourself the defensible position it is much better to let them reform on the other side of wall as if it didn't exist, then you attack them! But this gives you a chance to make even more bad decisions, like firing one volley of arrows and then charging them, instead of firing arrows consistently until they were in sword range. What are they trying to say King Arthur really was bad at strategy? No, they wanted to have a "Braveheart" charge only with Hot leather bound Chick leading it. Right about here I needed an aspirin.Anyway it keeps sucking as Master Swordsman Tristan sucks it up and dies, Fuqua you idiot you made me give it a 1!!!!, then Lancelot sucks some arrow. Ah whatever. Fuqua you suck, please stop making movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The difference between the legends and the movie time-wise is about a century or so. The legends have Arthur emerging long after the Romans had left Briton at the beginning of the 5th century. Arthur's time is often thought to be in the late 5th Century to the early 6th Century.In the film Arthur is not a king but a half-Roman, half-British Roman Cavalry Commander of a group of Sarmartian auxiliaries serving along the Hadrian Wall. The Sarmartian knights in the film oddly all have medieval French names like Lancelot, Galahad and Tristan. I wasn't aware Sarmartians spoke French or gave their children French names.Now in the movie's defense, it wasn't a "First Knight" (1995) debacle. The actors are generally good and there's not much in the way of modern slang that creeps in. The problem is the movie is a mish-mash of Arthurian legends put into a typical Bruckheimer film.After a hammy melodramatic beginning of a kid riding off to join the Roman army, our story begins when the knights of Arthur have been fighting for 15 years and doing some amazing things that you have to take the movie's word for that they were amazing. The knights are fiercely loyal to Arthur because he has been a great leader which again you have to take the movie's word for it since we don't see any of this.Instead of having the story detail Arthur's accomplishments, the film focuses on just a few days. You have the elite force of Arthur's knights one day from retirement (stop me if you've heard this before) but they are asked to go on one more assignment -- the toughest they've ever had -- to rescue an important family north of Hadrian's Wall.This family apparently has never been wiped out by the Woads -- the native guerrilla force that Arthur and his men have been fighting all these years. Now the Saxons are coming so they have to get there before the Saxons and rescue them.Overall I'd give the film four stars out of 10. As I said, the actors are good. Some of the historical tidbits are good. The lame formula of the "last dangerous mission before retirement" storyline and the cheesy melodramatic moments that don't fly because there isn't enough character development are what keep the film from being enjoyable.It's a shame really. With the actors, sets, and costume and props it could have been a better film if not for the silly story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just rented King Arthur which came out last summer to a modest box-office response. Not only did it truly stink, but it managed to make a complete muddled mess of everything. It's supposed to be a "demythologized" true history account of the Real King Arthur. So, all the legendary material is removed, and what do you have left- a bunch of guys who look like roadies for the Allman Brothers Band slashing each other to pieces with swords and cross- bows, with some barely discernible sub-text about Honor and Duty blah blah... Merlin is just an old guy warlord with a bunch of thugs, who you really can't tell from the the other old guy warlord with a bunch of Saxon thugs. King Arthur and his guys all have the requisite long stringy hair, but they are all much better looking. And Guinevere- who's idea was this? She's one of the warrior guys running around and slashing and stabbing people. Is this supposed to be feminism? Anyway, she's dashing and spinning around the battlefield in this uber-skimpy outfit while all the other guys are clunking around in heavy armor. The major suspense of the film- I mean, you know Arthur and all the handsome studmuffins are going to win- is whether her breasts are actually going to pop out of her microscopic bra-thing (they don't, darn it, although it gets really close. I guess we've all learned our lesson from last year's Superbowl/Janet Jackson debacle).Don't even bother with this turkey, even if someone wants to give it to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's see. The legend of King Arthur is one of my favorite stories of all time. Now, I know this was supposed to be a more "historical" portrayal and have little to do with the legend. So they threw in a couple historical accuracies - Hadrian's Wall, the clash between Rome and the Picts (although they call them Woads for some reason) and called it a good movie? Unfortunately, there was very little story. I'm still trying to figure out exactly where they intended the climax to be. The characters where paper thin - there was no development. I really didn't care who died throughout the movie. Kill them all, I say. The dialogue was strained, relying upon clichés. It was delivered rather poorly by a bunch of wooden actors. Now, I only saw the Director's Cut, because that's what my idiot brother bought. But the pace in that version was rather off. Scenes were too long, action was too drawn out. The fight scenes ended up being hokey and dull. The camera swung around so much, grabbing so many different angles in an attempt to make the fight look interesting. All it did was make me sea sick. Granted, it's not LOTR but Fuqua could've taken a few notes out of Braveheart. It was a rather disappointing film and by the end I wanted to stab myself in the eye with the needles I was using to knit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like the previews be content, they are better than the movie. Seven Samurai on one hand Braveheart on the other but they never shake hands. Poorly conceived and executed. I didn't want any bucolic mystic dreamland. I wanted a good film with a good story and didn't get one. There is no character development. The historical premise and context is repeatedly and fatally flawed. The continuity is non-existent. The girl is gorgeous but we don't see enough of her (as a character.) The focus is soft (not well pulled)throughout. Lighting is contrasty and inappropriate for the scenic concept. Beautiful pseudo Japanese costuming if it was only relevant to the time and place. The battle scenes try to emulate Braveheart but miss. I am somewhat of an Arthurian "scholar" and was offended by the premise of the knights origin. The "mission" was historically inaccurate (a Roman Villa north of Hadrian's Wall?!?!? The locale for the story is hundreds of miles from the legends. The Saxons are decisively whipped and the island(southern and northern)is united without mention of the dozens of tribes and the political savvy that would be required for this, besides, it still hasn't happened. Merlin has virtually been written out of the story and has been redefined as a warlord who can't even keep the tip on his spear. Lancelot and Guenivere have no relationship until he is killed in the final battle when she gets tender in the middle of a battle in which she is heavily involved. Dreck - awful - offal. I wouldn't rent the video if I was bored. I will remember this directors name just so I don't pay to see his projects. The producers should be ashamed of themselves considering their track records.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a BIT of Historical Accuracy, Please!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a film purporting to be the real story of King Arthur, this offering is rife with historical inaccuracy. The Romans are shown abandoning Britain at the same time as Arthur's coming to power, and his climactic battle against Saxon invaders (presumably, the Battle of Mount Badon). In reality, the last Roman legionary left Britain sometime between 406 and 409 A.D., while the Battle of Mount Badon has been dated between 495 and 520 A.D.Arthur is portrayed as a Christian, but as an adherent of Pelagius, a lay monk who came to prominence as a writer, then as a heretic, in the early 5th Century Rome. Because Pelagius was known by the nickname "Brito" or "Britannicus" he is believed to have come from Britain. The film depicts the heresy of Pelagius as a belief that all men are equal. In reality, his teachings had nothing to do with the equality of man, centering, rather, on original sin and grace. Also, the film hints that Pelagius was killed for his beliefs, when, in reality, he was tried by more than one church council and released, never executed. He left Rome and is believed to have traveled east, as did most of his followers. Thus, historians can find no evidence that he ever returned to Britain and discount the possibility that Arthur was influenced by him.Lastly, the film paints (no pun intended for these decorated warriors) the natives of Britain as uniformly pagan, another inaccuracy. In fact, Christianity was brought to Britain by Roman traders in the first Century A.D. and accepted by many. By the sixth century it was definitely in its ascendancy, dominating most towns and spreading out into the countryside.Considered exclusively on its cinematic merits, the film offers a strong performance by Clive Owen in the title role. One might wish, however, that the producers had spent a little extra money to hire a dialect coach to rid Mr. Owen of his working class accent. While it worked splendidly in his role as a prisoner/gardener in the neglected "Greenfingers," it lacks the distinction and authority required of a legendary king. Keira Knightley was undeniably attractive as a warrior Briton, who, despite a lack of armor of any kind, emerges improbably unscathed from the film's battles. (Parental caveat: their love scene is too intense for children.) And it is a service to rescue Arthur from the late-Medieval setting into which popular imagination tends to place him and correctly return him to the immediate post-Roman era. Other bright spots are an interesting battle staged on ice, and the ever-moving music of Hans Zimmer. Otherwise, the film shortchanges the viewer on character development, inexplicably reducing the pivotal Merlin to a dirty-faced near-prop with a peculiar accent, and script clarity. (One scene about immuring -- Whom? Monks? Pagans? Ascetics? -- is not only bizarre but virtually incomprehensible.) In all, it seems a rehashing of better films, including "Arthur" director Antoine Fuqua's 2003 "Tears of the Sun," "Gladiator," and, of course, the wonderful "Braveheart."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Ado About Nothing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wince whenever I see a film described as "the Real Story", especially when recounting events that occurred fifteen hundred years ago, and claiming to be the 'truth' about Arthur and his knights. While there are certainly theories that 'Arthur' was, as the film implies, a Roman military commander, equally legitimate claims can be made that he was a Welsh or Briton chieftain, a Celtic warlord, or, most likely, an amalgamation of several powerful early warrior/generals, combined by French troubadours of the 11th - 13th centuries into a single 'King of England' to promote the concept of Chivalry. As Guinevere, Lancelot, and a majority of the famed knights and deeds of Arturian folklore date from this later period, the only 'fact' that can be proved is that Britain, after the Romans departed, was a bloody battleground between the Britons and the swarming Saxons, as well as from other tribes from the north and across the English Channel.With this 'battlefield' concept, "King Arthur" still might have worked...except that Guinevere (a Celtic girl with a habit of fighting nearly naked), Merlin (a Celt chieftain with engineering talents equal to the Romans), and Lancelot, Tristan, Gawain, Galahad, and the other knights (Eastern European 'indentured soldiers' of Rome) all are 'named' characters in the film...and with the possible exception of Merlin, none had even been introduced before the 11th century! Dropping the 'Name' and 'Is it True, or is it Bruckheimer?' complaints, there are some good points to the film; Ireland, substituting for England, has a raw beauty in keeping with the time period; Stellan Skarsg?rd (with an American accent!) plays the Saxon 'king' with a bloodthirsty yet stoic quality that certainly captures your attention; the battle scenes (in the Director's Cut) are brutal and believable; and the conflict on the ice (with a resolution familiar to anyone who has seen the Russian classic, "Aleksandr Nevsky") has a tension often lacking through much of the rest of the film.As for the leads...Clive Owen makes a strong, sincere Arthur (although, by the sixth century, even the Romans were wearing beards; being beardless was seen, mostly, in clerics); Ioan Gruffudd, as Lancelot, does his best with a role that begins promisingly, then drops off to a series of complaints and knowing 'looks'; Keira Knightley (Guinevere), at 18, shows great enthusiasm in action sequences, and great promise in her scenes with Owen. Ray Winstone, as the surly but likable Sir Bors, easily steals the film, providing most of the spirit, on screen.I know that many will find my criticism of "King Arthur" far too picky, but if you love a medieval battlefield epic, "Braveheart" is still the movie to see...and if you love the King Arthur of lore, buy "Excalibur", and cherish the legends! Sadly, "King Arthur" is a pale imitation of both!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With these simple constructions, its easy to see where they decided the hook would be. I imagine the pitch was that this would be "Braveheart" meets "Gladiator" but with a fighten' gal. I'm sure they took a model and put here in blue tattoos and unlikely leather seminude battlegear and took photos to say: here, see?And perhaps there was some discussion about the two physical devices, the ice and the wall. The financiers would have called in the religious consultants to determine whether the script would offend the religious right, the script depicting the church as evil. But that's safe, the report would have come back.The writer will have described great masses of flowing arrows and these would have been storyboarded and budgeted way early in the game. They would have selected a safe director, someone with no discernible style and no artistic ambitions. So I will comment on it only as it was intended. The effects depend on exploiting the nature of space ? the ice and wall I mentioned, but also the smoke and maneuvers in the final battle. There is no exploitation of space, not even to the extent of "Lord of the Rings," which we should probably call the WETA standard.The battles are less manic than any I have seen even though "Seven Samurai" is clearly a model for several elements of this.The girl here is Kiera Knightly, whose appeal I never understood. Here she is a sort of Joan of Arc character, and I found myself actually wishing for Milla Jovavich! The whole thing ? the human parts anyway ? revolve around her and she doesn't have the chops. She is the mother of an entire nation, her battles, her loves and she always looks like she is merely playing soccer.Its an interesting notion, rewriting a legend. But you have to be a good writer, no?Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

This means two hours of clichés, battle, dialog stolen from "Gladiator"("The Rome you speak of is dead!"), pointless subplots and stereotypes. Aye. Stereotypes. The leader with a moral dilemma, the wise old man, the ruthless bad guy, the "funny" sidekicks, the strong warrior-woman and all the others. The worst part is that you get queasy and sick.

		<shortDescription>Fresh Take on an Old Trope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many types of filmgoers. There are those choosing the cinema as a safe bet for a date, to film buffs who just enjoy everything about the movie experience. My least favorite people are the avant garde psudo-sophisticates who drain the life out of everything like some vampire of joy. They don't like certain films because it makes them feel superior to say so. These are the same viewers who feel the need to prove just how smart they are by posting flaming reviews. Asshats often feel obliged to set fire to the actors, plot, music, or in the case of King Arthur historical inaccuracies. Then these self-appointed grand marshals of film post their bile on line. If you look at their reviews their hate extends to movies you probably liked. I suppose indie films are more to their liking because only someone who trashes mainstream movies can run with this crowd.It would be difficult to tell the actual story of Arthur because that individual, if such a person existed, is lost in antiquity. This film just has a different take on a legendary character. There are references to actual historical figures, but is it necessary to have the dates just right to move the story along? Probably not, unless you are a Middle Age historian. If Merlin had appeared in a Land Rover there would be room for complaint. I don't recall anyone complaining about Tarantino's history butchering Inglorious Bastards.Merlin turns out to be a leader of people more closely resembling Picts than Britons but the key take away is that he is not the mythical wizard many people expect. This Merlin is more like a mystical druid. At first I was not crazy about this character but I appreciated the fresh take of dispensing with magic altogether.Guinevere and Lancelot have a different chemistry than the myth. The Knights of the Round Table definitely have a band of brothers vibe going on because Arthur is just one of the boys. I thought it was a nice touch that the true Romans had Italian accents and the invading Saxons had German and Swedish accents.Clive Owen's performance was called wooden but he used the same style of acting in Sin City. I liked him in both roles. Owen strikes a noble figure as King Arthur. As a leader, it is obvious why he commands the loyalty of his fellow knights.This is Antoine Fuqua's first venture into a historically driven epic. Fuqua did an amazing job. I am only sorry that more people did not appreciate his treatment of subject matter or the characters. The film overall was worth the admission. The visuals are excellent. The locations are eye catching and the frenzied battles are well choreographed. It is a movie worth watching more than once. If it's the job of film and actors to entertain, then this movie delivers. Those who say it was the worst movie they ever saw better be careful in the rain, they may drown with their noses turned up so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated historical war film - see the director's cut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although much-reviled on release, KING ARTHR gains a new lease of life when you view the Director's Cut of it. From a kiddie-friendly family film, it has been transformed into a gory, gritty adventure in which the blood sprays across the scene in frequent bursts and people are beheaded left right and centre. Dispensing with the mystical medieval aspects of the story, in this version the film takes place in a wild and untamed England, inhabited by the Woads and the Romans, who have decided to leave. The enemy are the Saxons, led by true Saxon Stellan Skarsgaard.KING ARTHUR is an old-fashioned story which questions religion, free will and man's calling in life. As a film, it looks very good, with excellent choreography in the battle scenes and fine camera-work all round. The Irish locations are wonderfully picturesque and the wildness of the elements is put across very plainly, as our heroes battles snow, ice and freezing rain. The plot, as many have mentioned, bears a little resemblance to THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, but that's the case with plenty of movies anyway. Production values are high as is the testosterone evident, with a shouty Ray Winstone on good form and Clive Owen as a rugged, working class Arthur. Sadly, Owen's acting is a little stilted, and he is outdone at virtually every turn by the excellent Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot. A cast of British regulars pad out the leads and the attractive Keira Knightley ably supplies the love interest.Action fans will be here for the battle sequences, which are impressive and carry on in the recent tradition of TROY, THE LAST SAMURAI, THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy and others. The battles are bloody and frenetic, true life-or-death down-and-dirty fighting, with clever tactics. The best moment of the film has to be the battle on an iced-over lake, which progresses pretty much the way you would expect, and is very much the better for it. The climactic battle is worth waiting for and seems undeniably epic. KING ARTHUR doesn't equal the status of rivals like BRAVEHEART, but it does prove to be a generally good film that is definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie with an awful script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due to the average IMDb rating and Metascore, I sit down with low expectations to watch Antoine Fuqua's 2004 movie, King Arthur. If you can do, watch the director's cut, because it is much better than the theatrical cut, such as in Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven. There are a lot of advantages and maybe just one, but a huge mistake of this movie. The cast is excellent. Although I personally don't like Clive Owen, but he was really good in this film, such as the supporting actors, like Keira Knightley, Ioan Groffud, Joel Edgerton, Ray Stevenson and the Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen. The music is amazing. Hans Zimmer is definitely the best composer of nowadays. The visual effects are also great. Antoine Fuqua has a quite unique directing style, but it's really matches with the story and visual style of this film. The only huge mistake of King Arthur is it's story. There are huge plot holes, which makes the characters and the battles unentertaining and useless. If the story would be just acceptable, than this film would be nearly as good as great historical movies of the 21st century, such as Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven or Wolfgang Petersen's Troy. The Director's Cut is definitely worth a watch, but sit down with low expectations, and don't except a Christopher Nolan movie-type story.7/10</fullReview>

Sure, once you kill every one to dissent, you have every body agree ! Besides this, the movie shows terrible flaws : to start with the movie with the knights and not Arthur is stupidly forgetting just the core of the movie (remember its title ?), Keira has a warrior is a sad sight and the poor Skarsgard still pollutes my movie with his lack of anything that made him here a really pitiful villain!

		<fullReview>The Sarmatians from eastern Europe were known for their calvary and conquered by the Romans. In 452 A.D., Lancelot is taken as a boy to be a knight manning Hadrian's Wall for the required 15 years. Fifteen years later, Arthur (Clive Owen) and his remaining knights expect to be released. Rome is retreating from Britain and the ruthless Saxons are invading. The Woads led by Merlin attack the newly arrived Bishop Germanus. Arthur comes to the rescue. Germanus forces them to complete a final suicidal mission. Young Alecto, godson of the Pope, and his family are in danger of being captured by the Saxons. Arthur and his knights find Guinevere (Keira Knightley) and others being imprisoned and mistreated by Christians. Arthur leads the entire group including Alecto back to the Wall.I like the idea of a bloody, muddy, brutal reimagining of the origins of King Arthur. It's great not to have the glossy glow of Camelot. I have no idea of its historical validity but I'm not sure it matters that much. King Arthur is a legend in the first place. I like almost everything at the beginning. The acting power of the group is outstanding. I love the idea of one final mission for Arthur and his men. Then the story gets muddled up. Alecto is not actually a prisoner of the Saxons. The suicidal mission isn't quite so suicidal although Arthur makes it as hard as possible. The ice lake battle is pretty cool. The rest is a combo-pack of morality, religion, and even more battles. It's messy and doesn't fit well. The story should be a simpler final mission action thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An admirable and novel approach with the obvious blockbuster trappings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People should be more open-minded and daring about taking classic tales and putting them in different time periods. Everyone accepts the adaptation of Heart of Darkness into Apocalypse Now as a classic and brilliant cinematic decision, so why is the Antoine Fuqua's interpretation of King Arthur set in Ancient Rome so heinous to some people? The film strips bare all the children's magic that people know Arthur for and make it a bleak yet simple vision of Arthur and his nights. The important elements - the round table, the relationship with Guinevere, the sword Excalibur (without the magic) - are kept and adapt well to this version of events.Clive Owen makes for an interesting Arthur. His performance tends to live and die by the screenplay - during the cringeworthy moments (of which there are a few), he does poorly, but for the most part seems fully in control of this Roman Christian officer with his strong religious faith and stoic leadership. The most interesting thing about the knights played by Mads Mikkelsen, Joel Edgerton, Hugh Dancy, Ray Winstone, Ray Stevenson and Ioan Gruffudd is that they interact like a bunch of boys who've grown up in a boarding house together. This is completely consistent with the version of events Fuqua is trying to tell, and provides many of the film's best moments. Ioan Gruffudd portrays Lancelot as a cocky womaniser, and Ray Winstone steals the whole movie as the brutish, foul-mouthed, Gimli-esque Sir Bors. Every single scene with Winstone is better than a scene in which he is absent. As the antagonist, Stellan Skarsgard portrays Cerdic as a man who is weary of killing and pillaging but does it out of obligation, which he does very well but it doesn't fit at all with the movie.At large times, it is very clear that this is a Jerry Bruckheimer studio movie. Keira Knightley glows with makeup after being rescued from a dungeon and wears minimal clothing wherever she can. A happy ending is tacked on the end of the film, regarding the coronation of Arthur and his marriage to Guinevere (with whom he has sex for 30 seconds and they pass that off as romance). There are two major battle sequences, full of shaky cam, smoke effects and fire. However, the third battle sequence in the middle of the film, on a frozen lake, is one of my favourite battle scenes in movies. It is full of tension and excitement. One thing that did suffer from the big budget approach was the story of Pelagius and how his relationship with Arthur affects Arthur's worldview. I only barely picked up on it this time, and I've seen this movie a few times before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WHy?????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a movie that I've seen several times in TV before eventually getting the director's cut on blu-ray.The final cut was the one I particularly like, as I'm not a person who likes very much blood, and this movie, in the final cut, has almost none, and battles were still entertaining without much gore.The Director's cut instead is not only expanded with maybe nit needed scenes, but also with disturbing gore that I don't really like. It's my taste, maybe others will like it. Kust it lost to me that capacity to show battles without showing gore and still having them entertaining.This was the reason I'm not giving this an 8 or 7. This movie, though, is my favourite king arthur depiction. Still far from what historical truth that could be something well written in the novel by Valerio Massimo Manfredi "the last legion", from which has been very loosely and terribly adapted the movie of the same name, but I yet liked this movie, in its Final cut edition. I can't say I liked so far the director's cut. Actor's performances are great, costumes and details too, it really felt like how it could have gone, though not much historical evidence is shown.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good movie! A better explanation of the King Arthur legend I think. A more realistic side of the story. It's where you think someone like Merlin would use real magic this movie shows you a more realistic side by using the nature itself as protection and weapon.Also it explains why Arthur didn't return to Rome. The knights I also loved. Not wearing the same uniform, living on the edge, the respect for Arthur and the fighting style.Hans Zimmer's vocals in this movie are awesome, just like in the dark knight trilogy it just gives you a adrenaline rush.What I also liked is that they didn't focused on the love story of Arthur and Guinevere and gives a more understanding reason why they got married.The way Stellan Skarsg?rd played the role of the leader of the Saxons was also fantastic. The right actors were chosen for this movie.The narration at the end was also a great idea, very inspiring.I don't think I will get tired of looking at this movie all over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all time favorite movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, to me, has everything that makes a movie great. It keeps you entertained in different ways. Action, drama, comedy, adventure, and romance. The cast is really well done, Clive Owen is an amazing actor and really owns the role of Arthur. He is heroic, yet always cares for his men and the people around him. Stellan Skarsg?rd also did an amazing job with his performance as Cerdic.The cast is a lot of what really makes this movie, everyone does their part extremely well. You actually care about the characters, which seems to be rarer nowadays. The Knights, villains, love interest, and everybody make this movie a lot of what it is. The Knights in particular are amusing how they interact. They manage to stay in character the whole movie, another rare feat in a lot of modern movies.The video is amazing on this movie, with some breathtaking scenes and just great choices in scenery. The sound is equally enjoyable, the Blu-ray version played through my Denon X4000 sounds phenomenal. One of my favorite scenes, on the frozen lake, you can hear subtle and not too subtle sounds. The dialog is always clear and never drowned out by the action.This movie is not without fault, and some of it can be determined on whether or not you expected a "historically accurate" version of this movie. Considering King Arthur is largely a legend, is it really historically accurate? Besides, that has been done before. This is a lot like Robin Hood with Kevin Costner, it is a vision based on the legend and a very well done one. Besides, King Arthur has been done before, so a different take of the tale is welcome. So what, the Woads use barbed wire shot by arrows, which was not invented until way after the movie's time period. And the actual legend is a lot more fanciful than this movie will be. Sacrifice, great loss, camaraderie, love, friendship, epic battles, heroism, struggle, and many other things...this movie handles is all very well. A lot of the movie is very cleverly done, which makes some amazing scenes like the "battle of the frozen lake" scene I spoke of. I highly suggest this movie to anyone but those who worry about historical accuracy. If you look for that, you should not worry about King Arthur anyhow!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After Black Hawk Down, I forgave Jerry Bruckheimer for his film Pearl Harbor's perversion and trivialization of its history.This film is historically stimulating, created from the recent hypothesis that King Arthur's knights were Sarmation mercenaries in the service of Rome.The music is excellent. The dialogue is tense, to the point, and memorable as can be seen from all the quotes people have written here.The action scenes are fantastic, and it was a miracle someone wasn't seriously injured.Stellan Skarsgard's Saxon king is as unforgettable as Clive Owen's Arthur or any of his knights. "Finally, a man *worth* killing!" ... indeed.Ivano Marescotti's Bishop Germanicus has to be one of the most repugnantly Machiavellian characters ever played on stage or screen -- more great acting.Ioan Gruffud's performance as Lancelot is most entertaining, and his eloquent voice provides perfect narration.Possibly the most mischievously entertaining and spunky performance is that by Keira Knightley as the Pict princess and warrioress Guinevere.There are anachronisms like the use of the medieval trebuchet engine of war, but they are forgivable.I love to play the last scene: not for it, but for the Celtic-themed postlude.Lou Coatney, Macomb Illinois, http://LCoat.tripod.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was expecting to see a film about King Arthur, perhaps that's why I was so disappointed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The whole point of this film seems to have been to destroy the legend of King Arthur.Everyone knows about King Arthur, the sword in the stone that no one but he could pull out, Merlin the magician, the lady of the lake etc etc...This film does not contain one ounce of magic! Merlin is no longer a great sorcerer but an unimpressive bearded chap who lives in a wood. The lady of the lake has been written out completely. The whole sword in the stone thing was retold- except there is NO magic in this Hollywood version.If the tale of King Arthur is a legend that has shaped our culture and is part of our heritage then this movie is nothing less than an purposeful attempt to destroy human culture and replace it with... well... Hollywood narrow minded one-dimensional garbage.And on top of that! its a bad film! The battle scenes are pretty good it must be said. (although the tactics employed sometimes don't make much sense) The dialogue and acting are on occasion cringeworthy.Last but not least, if you really do want to put King Arthur in a definite historical context (as the film claims to do)get it right!!! The film is full of historical mistakes... it is at complete odds with what we know of Anglo-Roman and Anglo-Saxon history.In short, the DVD cover looks good, but don't be fooled. This is cultural vandalism at its worst. and not a very good movie.</fullReview>

It had fantastic settings, fairly good actors, but the story is very flat. Even if the writer read the current findings of the Arthur legend, he used it to pack some nice costumes around some fighting. Every fighter is either a sacrifice or a half-god, never tired, still fighting when dead. This might be fantastic for an martial-arts fan, but I prefer films which give a vision of a story, not a story to show pictures.The very good costumes and setting saves some points, but I still have the feeling I wasted my time.I am afraid, the last legion will be even worse, at least the book was not quite good.</fullReview>

It seems the main goal of this movie is to showcase the battle scenes. The script isn't very good and the dialog is wooden and stilted. Very little of the Arthur Legend here, this movie is King Arthur in name only (a gimmick to increase interest). Considering how much money went into the production of this film, I would expect something better than this mindless fodder. If you have wasted two hours of your life on this piece of rubbish then you can feel me here, If you haven't seen King Clive and his Sarmation Knights (played by actors who did it for the paycheck and didn't put much heart into it) then i suggest you avoid it and watch Excalibur instead, unless you like brain dead hack + slash sword and sorcery epics.</fullReview>

Same with shooting a random volley of arrows into a smoky battlefield where your knights were just seconds before. The stupid speech Arthur gave his knights before they rode off together into battle: my god. These are not hordes to be inspired, these are friends of yours who just decided, entirely on their own, to sacrifice their chance at freedom because of your noble notions.

Together they are locked in a fierce battle with Alice in Chains. During the process Arthur meets and rescues one of the circus chicks, Guinevere. Arthur breaks her fingers, then she falls in love with him. Or pretends she does at least, so he'll fight the good fight, which is of course the side that the circus is on. She really seems to have her eyes on a hippie-knight, Smokespot. Guinevere is played by Keira Knightley, who we learn is still super hot, even when she is painted blue. Anyhow, Arthur and Guinevere live happily ever after making passionate blue love while they're not killing grunge bands. Watch out, Pearl Jam.

		<shortDescription>Genuinely dreadful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is genuinely dreadful. By all means stop reading at this point and choose not to watch this debacle - but I'll tell you why I found it to be so bad anyway.First of all, this film bills itself to be a historical retelling. It isn't. It isn't a faithful retelling of the Arthurian legend either. It's a lazy Hollywood re-write that takes liberties with what might be considered historically possible or even plausible.There is such a disregard for consistency and detail in this film that you really want to throw things at the TV.The film sets itself at around 300 A.D.Geographically it sets itself in what we now call Britain.These markers float to suit the film maker without warning.OK. Draw breath.Many other reviewers - countless in fact - have pointed out the frustrations of depicting Britain between Stonehenge, Hadrian's Wall, and a massive frozen lake that an arm could stand on (where is that?).The geographical impossibility, and the convenient transportation of the film to an impromptu ice-age is the least of it's worries.All of the film's key characters are awful too.I'm just going to look at the Kiera Knightley character - Guinevere. Guinevere is transformed into a sexy alluring seductive Boudica warrior. She is found originally walled up and starved in a pagan/Christian tomb. Despite her starvation, and apparently broken fingers - she is fighting with the vigor of a Spartan warrior within two days of her rescue. She comes complete with three costumes - the first a serf like woven Anglo-Saxon event with designer scruffiness and glossy lips. The second is a sheer, off the shoulder, fantasy/Roman/princess affair (with glossy lips). The final wardrobe is a stone age body paint/war paint bikini (despite the passing ice age - and the fact that she is fighting men dressed in furs) - with glossy lips. Her weapon? She is nothing less than an expert with the Mongolian composite recurved bow. Quite spectacular considering they didn't become available until the 13th Century - and even then on the other side of the earth.Pause on this if you will. The battle of Agincourt was fought in 1415 - the greatest victory of the English longbow. At that time the longbow was the prevailing weapon of the English military and had become a national sport to encourage national proficiency. By this time the Mongol empire had disintegrated - and even though the Mongol bow had been demonstrated as being so much more powerful and versatile - the composite recurved bow still had to not been integrated into military tactics of Western Europe.So Guinevere's proficiency with this weapon is not only historically impossible, geographically impossible, it is entirely incongruous with it's setting - why not give her a Spitfire or a sniper's rifle? As if to confirm this, the closing battle - the culmination of the film - sees the knights of King Arthur arrive wearing - and wait for it now - Samurai armour. Not just any Samurai armour mind you - the kind that evolved in the 19th Century - and (wait for it) - it's blue.Don't watch this film. The acting is generally irritating but the plot and portrayal of a tenuous story (which might as well be about anyone in fiction) is intolerable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with many of the comments already posted, this is a shocking representation of widely loved legend. There are so many stupid things about this movie, Ray Winstone playing a Iranian is ridiculously stupid, not to mention he does his standard move, shout really loud but add no emotion. Clive Owen ( good in inside man)is very poor as Arthur, although this could be due to the terrible script "oh merciful god I have need for your mercy now" who the hell thought up that line. I think the thing that annoyed me most about this film was the very incoherent storyline to which they threw in some Arthurian legends, such as when Arthur pulled the sword from the Stone. Not to mention the character who is supposedly Merlin, what a waste of time, I understand when making a "historically accurate" film ( I laughed just typing that) it's hard to incorporate a wizard, however it would have been better just to leave him out rather than portraying him as well nothing, as far as I can see he serves no purpose. Even the more interesting parts of the film are stupid such as the battle on the ice, firstly I fail to see where in Britain that took place, and secondly as the fight begins the Saxon archers are out of range, they continue to slowly move towards Arthur and co until finally they get close enough for Arthur to command his men to "prepare for combat" yet in all this time not one Saxon archer attempted to shoot again , they could have moved forward 10 paces then had a whole army of archers shooting at 7 men, such a terrible movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sword in the Stone, Camelot, The Magic Sword, First Knight, I've seen quite a few versions of the legendary story, and then there's this one from director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day). Apparently this version is meant to be more realistic and accurate than the versions made before, but from what I gathered, I prefer the other versions much more. Here we see King Arthur (Clive Owen), born in Rome, along with the Knights of the Round Table, including Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), Tristan (Casino Royale's Mads Mikkelsen), Galahad (Hugh Dancy) and Bors (Ray Winstone), fighting in the Dark Ages war, against people like Cerdic (Pirates of the Caribbean's Stellan Skarsg?rd). Of course along the way, Arthur meets the woman who will become his wife in the end, Guinevere (Keira Knightley). Big changes in this version are that Merlin (Stephen Dillane) is not really a wizard and is a villain, and Lancelot dies in battle having no affair with Guinevere, oh, and there's no magic or fantasy element. The battle sequences might be alright, but the casting, apart from Winstone, Mikkelsen and Skarsg?rd isn't great, and the story is pretty weak, I'd say try it at least once. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Arthur (2004) D/C</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arthur, you fight for a world that will never exist.King Arthur is directed by Antoine Fuqua and written by David Franzoni. It stars Clive Owen, Keira Knightley, Ioan Gruffudd, Mads Mikkelsen, Ray Winstone, Joel Edgerton, Stephen Dillane, Hugh Dancy, Ken Stott, Stellan Skarsg?rd and Til Schweiger. Music is scored by Hans Zimmer and cinematography by Slawomir Idziak.The Roman Empire is departing Britannia, and local commander Artorius Castus (Owen), is given one final mission to rescue an important Roman family from the invading Saxon hordes. Calling on the support of his trusty Knights, Arthur leads his men on a mission that will define them all.Save your prayers boy, your god doesn't live here.The flaws of director Antoine Fuqua's Arthurian epic have been well documented, as has the tinkering of producer Jerry Bruckheimer, the latter of which took his lusty scissors to the original cut of the film and created a rather choppy experience for a film already on rocky waters. Yet in spite of the uneven narrative, the unsound historical spin on the Arthurian legend, and the gross miscasting of Clive Owen in the lead, the film still went on to make roughly $80 million in profit from the worldwide box office. The director's cut of the film, whilst not altering the strength of the movie in the way that the D/C of Kingdom of Heaven does, has a more comprehensive flow to it, more blood and boldness and yes, it's more fun.The Knights are demons. That is the gate of hell!The film is undeniably epic in scope and production, the lush photography of expansive lands, the set design and costuming (including the wonderfully attired horses in the final battle at Badon Hill), Zimmer's gladiatorial score and the ensemble of actors gathered. Action quota is high and energised, well choreographed and in the case of the battle of Badon Hill, extended into a good portion of the running time to really crown the story. How nice to see sensible military tactics used, it may not be genius to note Arthur telling his small band of troops to "aim for the wings of their ranks, make them cluster" (this during a brilliant fight against the Saxons on a frozen lake), but there's a common sense logic here that is often missing in similar big budgeted historical epics.Artorius! Rus!Most agreeable is the story itself. It focuses on the decline of the Roman Empire, the withdrawal from Britain, the impact of berserker religion at this time, the Saxons and the Woads (Picts/Celts). In the middle of all this world changing anger is Arthur's inner turmoil, his battle with faith as he leads his loyal knights out of the promised freedom into yet more bloody chaos. The arrival on the scene of Guinevere (Knightley), here as a Woad warrior, in the second half of the picture clouds things still further, the possible love triangle between herself, Arthur and Lancelot is only hinted at, and the story is more intriguing because of it. In fact Fuqua proves most adept at characterisations, even if sadly he can't get the best performances from some of the big players.We will go home across the mountains.With Owen looking the part but too bland in delivery to make this Arthur convince, it needs the other big players to step up to not let the lead performance hurt the piece too much. Yet the best performances are coming from the supporting players like Edgerton, Mikkelsen, Stevenson and Dancy, but like Gruffudd (the one who truly looks and sounds the part), they are all underused. Skarsg?rd is ace, making Saxon leader Cerdic a fearless, emotionless and formidable foe, and Schweiger as his son Cynric also leaves a telling mark, but these too are also underused. Further viewings of the directors cut do show Knightley's performance in a better light, Guinevere dominates the narrative in the second half and Knightley is full of guts and lively in her action scenes, but the voice just irritates and someone in production should have picked up on that. Winstone gives a fun turn, certainly it's not in keeping with the surroundings, mind, as you half expect him to don his West Ham United scarf and start shouting ICF! But it is fun and becomes tolerable the longer the film runs.It's a flawed epic for sure, but one that still remains a great piece of historical filmic fun. Often rousing and blood stirring, even emotionally satisfying too. That is if you can forgive it for its failings? 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tired of all the Romanticism? King Arthur is a good dose of reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been and always will be a die-hard fan of the King Arthur stories. My family is from that area of that area of the world, so there is some deep-seated calling to it.However, I tire greatly over the focus of the Arthur-Guenivere-Lancelot plot being the entire focus or one of the main focuses of the movie. I especially enjoyed that those character relations were subtle undertones. In that way for Aurthur-lovers you can see, "Ohh... I know what's going on there!" My favorite part, as with the Mists of Avalon, was how they meshed the Christian faith of Rome with the pagan beliefs of the knights and the people in the country. This is a remarkable depiction of how it would have been like for Christian Rome to be attempting to convert the pagan--and the relations there were remarkable, I thought.The translation of the aloof romantic story we all know to a more down-to-earth version was amazing. In every other version we see, it's all about what's going on within the personal lives of the characters, but one of the reasons Arthur and his knights are still in our minds is because they did great things for the world, and I thought it a crime to not focus on that.Clive Owen and Kiera Knightly were a weird pair, I admit. One is flawlessly gorgeous and the other you have to sit and think for a second before you realize he is a hottie too. There were times when I knew what was going on, but didn't really understand the character's motivations behind it, but when you hit the final scene and realize what's been done here, you feel a smile break out on your face.At this point, if a studio is going to do something about King Arthur, it's not really about being historically or politically correct--it's about doing something that hasn't been done before, and I think that they hit the nail on the head.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie, and it shocked me after seeing other renditions of the tale behind the legend. The cool thing about this movie is that it is believable. It uses real events in history(that have been found to tell you this story).I'm sure we all like to think that Merlin was a wonderful magician that helps Arthur become the King that he was destined to be. But a lot of the things in previous renditions of the same tale that were magical are unfounded and unrealistic.If you like movies like Gladiator, The Last Samurai, you may like this movie. If you think that this movie is going to be like King Arthur, or Excalibur, you might not like this movie.The actors and actresses play their respected roles very well. And they are very believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, they tried</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in July 2004, King Arthur manages to shake the very foundations of historical knowledge?in only 126 minutes. Claiming to be "the untold true story" behind the King Arthur legend, the movie spins a tale entirely unknown to the Arthurian world. Arthur (Clive Owen) and his knights are soldiers bound in service to the Roman Empire. After fifteen long years of fighting in Roman-held Britain, the knights are to receive their discharge papers only after one final, dangerous mission to rescue an important Roman family from a mounting Saxon invasion. Among those aided by the knights is a young woman? Guinevere (Kiera Knightly), the daughter of Merlin. Though the mission is ultimately successful, the knights choose to remain in Britain after the Roman withdrawal, defending the land and its people from the Saxons. The movie closes with the commemoration of Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd) and Tristan (Mads Mikkelsen), followed by Arthur's wedding to Guinevere and his popular appointment as king of the newly independent Britain. This take on events may strike audiences as unfamiliar? largely because it is. Much of what happens in the movie has little to no historical or literary support, resulting in a jumbled retelling that contains only the most base-level elements of traditional Arthurian narrative. The names of most of the knights may be familiar?the movie features Gawain, Galahad, Bors, Tristan, and of course Lancelot?but their characters and quests have been drastically altered to fit the ideas of Roman soldiers longing for freedom rather than medieval knights fighting for chivalry and honour. Perhaps the most dramatic difference between this film and other Arthurian adaptations is the presentation of Guinevere, not as a lady or queen, but as a mysterious, feisty warrior whose main claims to fame are charging into battle mostly shirtless, giving highly philosophical advice?"You and I are not the polite people that live in poems. We are blessed and cursed by our times" and "What tomorrow brings, we cannot know"?and create a mostly irrelevant love triangle between herself, Lancelot, and Arthur, which is eventually resolved in Lancelot's rather predictable death. In this retelling, Guinevere is one of the Woads, a native people of Britain who resisted Roman Rule. According to the film, they are led by Merlin, a mystical man characterised more as a man of nature than a sorcerer. The devices of Merlin and his followers are of deception and trickery rather than magic, as seen in a clever (if somewhat unrealistic) trap to cut off Arthur and his Knights, and later in the use of war machines and flaming arrows. Historical inaccuracies abound. The opening scene in which a young Lancelot leaves his family to begin his Roman service is dated 452 AD. According the movie chronology, Rome would then have withdrawn from Britain in 467 AD. This is 57 years too late, as Rome completely withdrew from Britain in 410 AD1. The repeated use of the word "knight" to refer to Arthur and his men is also chronologically inaccurate, as the word "knight" did not come into common usage until about 1100 AD2, 600 years after the film is supposed to have taken place. As movie which claims to be an "untold history", it is critically undermined by such blatant failures on the part of the script writers to do even the most basic research. A viewer uninterested in the historical aspect of the movie might enjoy the story slightly more, but even non-scholars would likely notice the almost complete failure of the film to follow traditional Arthurian tales. Lancelot and Galahad, for example, appear as brothers in arms rather than father and son as in most tellings. Rather than fighting against Rome, as in Geoffrey of Monmouth's History of the Kings of Britain and Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte Darthur, Arthur and his knights are fighting for Rome, at least until Rome abandons Britain to the Saxons. While a child Arthur does pull his father's sword from a stone, it is in an attempt to save his mother and not to prove himself worthy of being king. Arthur is portrayed as the first king of Britain, rather than a successor in a line of great kings which in traditional narrative included his father, Uther Pendragon. Other famous characters, such as Percival, Morgan le Fay, and Mordred are also markedly absent. The unique take on the Arthurian legend may appeal to some viewers; after all, one can only watch so many renditions of the Grail Quest before becoming bored. They should, however, be wary of its lack of literary precedent. The movie itself is high-action, full of battle scenes as the fate of Britain is decided on a smoky field. There is certainly enough blood to merit the movie's R rating. The actual setup of the movie is fairly well done; the acting is convincing, the landscapes are realistic enough, and the score, written by Hans Zimmer and Maire Brennan, well accompanies the sequences of action. The plot is easy to follow but incredibly predictable: betrayal, danger, several close encounters, and an ultimate victory, all wrapped in with a wedding to make the audience feel better about the thousands of people whose violent deaths they just witnessed. A love affair?every movie needs at least one?and an introspective quest for the true meanings of justice, duty, and belonging are thrown in just to make things interesting. The final battle scene is particularly unimaginative: desperately outnumbered, it is the courage and skill of the fighters that eventually bring them to a narrow victory only after Lancelot, the main character's best friend, has been tragically killed. All in all, the movie is passable as an independent work but an unbearable travesty of Arthurian tradition. Were one to change the names of the characters, the movie could stand on its own as a popular independent work. The next time director Antoine Fuqua decides to render King Arthur's timeless tale, one can only hope he will do his reading first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not exactly the King Arthur I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an interesting re-reading of the King Arthur story. Clive Owen is Arthur (or, rather, Artorius), leader of a group of soldiers representing the remnants of the Roman army in England. They have a rather unusual backstory, being Sarmatian horsemen indentured to the Romans for a number of years. Arthur's group is on the point of freedom when they are sent on, effectively, a wild goose chase during which they find their future direction.I can tell you this about those times (learned from this movie): it was very dirty, it was very cold, and it was very violent and bloody.Actually, it was also quite entertaining - there is a decent story, a lot of action, and good performances from some excellent British - and other - talent (regrettably, this is one of Clive Owens' more wooden outings, but even he is better than he can sometimes be).I enjoyed this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>choppy fight scenes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really like the movie over all but the fight scenes are choppy and crappy. You can tell especially with Clive's scenes that the fights are like they were choreographed, as if he is counting out each step at movement and not caring about how fluid its supposed to look or be.On a separate note, the sex scene between Clive and Keira seem as if the only reason its there for the dramatic aspects. Nothing else in the movie seems to tie in with this part of their relationship. Once again not really impressed, but its honestly not a horrible movie... but it isn't number one either.Another thing that seems to drive me up the wall is the costumes, which aren't entirely horrible or inaccurate but they don't fight right. In the final scenes most of the men's helmets don't fight right. As for Clive's, it seems to flop around on his head, and for a few other men it seems to press into their skin and if it was actual armor that these men would wear day in and day out it would have rubbed blisters into their skin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most important thing about this King Arthur is to forget Mallory's. Then enjoy. But Why was Jack Chalkers very believable story, 6 books long, on Arthur descending from Romans and being raised part with an uncle, Marius, and part with the Celts not just named given credit and used.The main Tale (Mallory's) always stated Lancelot came from another kingdom, and many of the other knights, just not where. Chalkers interpretation of the times, nearer 500AD, is doable. This, even with great actors, a ton of money and time and training, great battles and cinematography, wasn't. That Villa would not have been North of the wall. Only Pict's were. And just how did they transport their crops to Rome but not the kid? Idealist Arthur? Yes. Using Greek/Roman fighting formations, yes. I mean how do we know?When the Romans left Britain, they left all the people south of the wall on their own, and many were their own descendants. They had to regroup and join the Celt tribes that would except them for defense from the Anglo/Saxons, and Irish and Viking raiders. And not all came to raid. Anglo/Saxons settled in the North, that's fact. But while all this was going on they had little communication with a very real world whirling around the main European continent. They stuck with the "Knights" armor being boiled leather, as history doesn't accept that metal armor was worn yet, I did see mail. But I am not sure they left out stirrups. All in all I liked it. They should have named it something else. The round table and the wall were too perfect. They had been shorthanded for allot of years. They didn't even get regular news from Rome. Rename the characters, rename the movie, and watch the DVD with the trivia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought it was decent...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This King Arthur is flawed, that I agree with, but I don't think it is a bad movie as such. Okay it is historically inaccurate and the traditional elements of the Arthurian legend are missing such as wizardry, love triangle or even Camelot, but they weren't the problems for me of this film.What didn't impress me much about King Arthur were a few things, especially the pace. The length was fine, but there are some scenes where it feels very pedestrian. The obligatory love scene also fell flat for me, well-shot, well-scored, but it interrupted the flow of the movie, and when it came to the dialogue and acting, this was one instance of the film being at its least effective. The script is rather hackneyed in places, and that is including the rousing speeches, and Keira Knightley despite looking gorgeous isn't really believable as Guinevere.Flaws aside, the film does look fantastic, the scenery, sets and costumes are wonderful and I loved the camera work, while the battle scenes are well-staged and more than convincing, the film is well-directed by Antoine Fuqua and Hans Zimmer's score has a real majesty about it. Knightley aside, the acting is good without being outstanding. Ioan Gruffudd is just okay as Lancelot, though I liked how his character was written and Gruffudd himself looks dashing. Clive Owen is a suitably subdued King Arthur, Stephen Dillaine is also pretty good and while all the knights look the part it is Ray Winstone who steals the film.Overall, decent if unspectacular film. 6/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arthur, Sir Gawain, etc, are some of the greatest tales in the history of English literature. This was an insult to it. It had nothing to do with those tales. It shouldn't have given them their holy names or pretended to be related to it at all. To recap, it's an insult to literature and should be burned.Had this story been named "Harold" and the supporting characters had found some other names, it might have been OK. However, it's been deceptively named.If the legend of Arthur has no meaning to the viewer, it might be worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The true untold story that inspired the legend" it said on the cartridge. Apparently, people in during the Roman era, spoke very much like what we do today. But, to begin a review with the the bad side is always a bad idea. Let's rather focus on the good. Mads Mikkelsen. Holy heck. Don't come here and told me you didn't like Tristan, the guy with the Mongol hat, light and quick sword, and the eagle. He is bad-ass, no doubt about it. I mean, he has an eagle. It doesn't get much cooler than that. Plus, he's got an amount of great one-liners and other comedian moments. Brilliant. As well, the rest of the cast fit each other perfectly. Ray Winstone is great, Ioan Grufford look like the devil in an uniform, and you cannot dislike Clive Owen as King Arthur. The rest of the knights I only know by their characters name. Dagonet is awesome, and you trust him at once. Galahad had to little screen time, Gawain as well. Anyway, the directing is great, loads of different camera angles, and good use, not miss-use, of the special effects. Antoine Fuqua does a good job. Great choice by Jerry Bruckheimer. The guy knows how to make entertaining movies. So great production value, good acting, great actors and steady directing. So why only 6/10? Partly because the acting from the bad guys is crappy (Except for Stellan Skarsg?rd, that man is brilliant)But mainly because the dialog is at times unbearable. I refuse to believe that "Royal arse- kisser" was a term used by knights during the roman era. Don't get me wrong, it was hilarious, but ... doesn't quite fit the 'realistic' theme this movie is going for. And Guinvere, oh my god, nearly all her dialog feels awkward. Knightly isn't the best of actors, and she is certainly not helped by the script. Lancelot also has his share of ridiculous lines, but Gruffords performance makes up for it. Still, not the worst of ways to spend your evening, but hardly fit to show in history class.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a generous reviewer, I always give a movie 10 stars up front and start deducting one star each time I get up to do something without pausing my DVD player. So I write this review with a personal odyssey, Memento style...I woke up halfway through the movie when I finally heard Keira Knightley's voice. But hey, where did the "USA Original Movie" label go? It should be on the bottom right corner of the screen. Oh wait, I actually rented this movie - it's not cable. But why would I rent something that looked like it was made for cable? I needed clues.I looked around and found the DVD case. Oh right, now I remember, it had Keira Knightley on the box cover - decked out warrior princess wearing a band of leather for bras - that was why I picked it up from the video store.Focus, Alex, focus. Lancelot is played by Prince. King Arthur is the squad leader of a daring rescue mission to save Private Ryan from the Aryan Nation. He also insists on giving freedom to sixth-century peasants.Keira Knightley decides to pay Arthur a visit during the middle of the night, and I tattooed "1h:30m:23s, King Arthur" on my arm (here's to you, my fellow Keira Knightley fans). Prince the Artist then delivers the most devastating c-block in human history - he knocks on their door and shouts "the Saxons are coming!", making Clive Owen suffer an atrocious case of b-balls (though not as bad as James McAvoy in Atonement).I have a strange feeling that I will be guilty of actually making people want to see this movie (guys, just tell your significant other at the video store that Ebert gave it thumbs up (he probably also has 1h:30m:23s tattooed on his arm)). And if you do rent it, please tell me if I've remembered the movie correctly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When watching this film, a few things entered my mind. First, the film isn't as historical as I wanted it to be. Artorious lived in the 2nd century, not the 5th. And he retired in Eastern Europe, not the British isles. Still, this film gets at something: the Arthur legend is a combination of a couple of characters.The film is rather well told. Arthur leads his Sarmatian knights in Britain to protect Roman interests there. There, he encounters a different Merlin leading a group of natives. Then the Saxons invade, and Arthur helps save the day without Roman intervention.This is far from the truth in Britain and it doesn't reveal the whole political situation. Still, it is a interesting movie and gives a fresh face to Arthur. The romantic legends are good, but the underlining stories are probably even better. "A-"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best King Arthur Movie I Have Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version of King Arthur is closet to what really happened to Arthur that I have seen. Lancelot really didn't fall in love with Gienevere because they only were have said to have met each other once. Lancelot really didn't die but Tristan, Dagonet, and Gawain did. Arthur actually died before Lancelot did and Gienevere is said to of killed herself. Their bodies were laid together and when they were found the people tried to recreate the tomb and lost the bodies. Merlin wasn't really a wizard either just what today you would call a history teacher. Bors and Galahad were relatives of Lancelot but not real knights of the round table, Even the round table is a fable. Lancelot was given a round table for his town after Arthur's death because of his loss. The knights like Lancelot weren't Sarmatians either. The last bit of false information was that it was not the Roman Empire that King Arthur served for it was the Holy Roman Empire that was a strict Christian Civilization</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fan videos can make something so bad, so much better (Spoilers for this and PotC: At Worlds End)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first, if anyone watched this film thinking that it would be a bit of an insight into how the legend of King Arthur was created is frankly an idiot. It's a big budget Hollywood film the tag line line that it's Arthur before the myth is just a new way to bring in audiences.But anyway I finally finished watching this film last night and sorry to say that as the film went on it did not improve. This maybe my own fault as I did watch fan videos first so knew what was going to happen to Lancelot, if I had the surprise factor I'm pretty sure I would have screamed "Nooooooooo!!!!" As I did when I saw PotC: AWE, which was not worth 3 hours of anyones life and then they killed Norrington. But anyway King Arthur, and it was the directors cut that I watched by the way.But just to get this bit out of the way, before I go into the film itself. This film now has one of my all time favourite lines.Lancelot to Guinevere : I don't believe in heaven, I've been living in this hell. But if you represent what heaven is, then take me there.Smooth, don't you agree? And said in a lovely deep voice.But now onto the film. These are the things that I liked about this film.The mood and atmosphere of the film.Lancelot - Ioan Gruffudd played him so well with that charm but a bit of the dark side and the hint of his interest in Guinevere, and that she was the battle he choose to die for.Lancelot and Guinevere: The hint of something there, and while I'm not one of these people who thinks Keria Knightly is a fantastic actress, in this role with that underlining current of her and Lancelot she did a good job of it. I also think it helped that Keria Knightly and Ioan Gruffudd had great chemistry, in fact in my opinion they seemed to have so much more and better chemistry than Keria and Clive Owen did.The rest of the knights. I think that scene near the beginning when they're talking about what they will do when they return home and the scene of them sitting out side drinking before they learn of the other mission was a very good starting point of there friendship and relationships. Also Ray Winestone, legend. I mean in the big fight scene the guy gets a spear in the back, but he just keeps on going. Well I guess you can't kill off the guy who has 11 brats, that would be too sad.I also liked the bit with the knight that didn't say much and the little kid. A very nice story that managed to be told in a film that seemed to have no real direction, or in fact story. And this leads on to what I didn't like.Basically that is the rest of the film.To me Clive Owen seemed wooden through out. The supposedly close relationship that Arthur and Lancelot had didn't come through.The film didn't seem to have a plot it was just, come up with something so we can have a massive fight scene at the end. Which for a person who doesn't enjoy a lot of gore and didn't fully watch the battle scene in Gladiator, didn't seem to mind them cutting of heads and such.It is meant to be winter but there were leaves on the trees and when they come back to the wall it looks like a sunny day, when in the previous scene they were on an frozen lake. I know it's Scotland but come on.Also they allow the Saxons to come through the gate to there side of the wall, which brings up another point. Unless the electric garage door was invented in the 5th Century, who is opening and closing the gate? I think that is pretty much all I have to say on it, but from now on I will be watching King Arthur in Lancelot related fan videos only.</fullReview>

The story claims to b historical, and probably is the most correct in that way (Artuhr is Roman and lived about that time, as it is believed), but that's all, then the movie remains as a typical war-adventure movie, which, though enjoyable, is not anything spectacular. The action scenes are correct, good costumes (and, as happens in Gladiator, filled with anachronisms) and decent acting, it is just a summer entertainment, enjoyable, and nothing more. At least it is not as "The last legion" whose error are enormous (impressively) and it is totally unbelievable (they change totally the story, changing parents and families all-together), King Arthur it is a movie to watch to relaxed and without being too strict.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting mish-mash of historical events, people and some sheer artistic licence, beautiful production values</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film looks great, it's obvious that if they needed something built they just built it, if they needed some CGI they just did it. The budget for this film was immense, and probably could have been put to use on a better film. But anyway.King Arthur is set during the declining years of the Roman Empire, around 450 AD. However if you are after a historically accurate representation of that time in Britains and/or Rome's history, you'd be better off grabbing a history book and curling up in front of the fire with that instead. This film and it's hero, Arturius, seem to be based on a conglomeration of numerous historical figures and events. Watching King Arthur, I could not help but compare Arthur to stories I have read of great generals and leaders like Julius Caesar, Scipio Africanus, Alexander, and a hodge-podge of qualities lifted straight from English Kings and folklore. He seemed to be a mix of all these people, and thus he seemed a slightly aloof and unbelievable character. He had some memorable lines, and some "strong, silent type" moments which were pretty cool, but beyond that I thought the character of the dude with the eagle (can't remmber his name) was far cooler. Yet he suffered one of the worst fates at the hands of the "bad guy" (don't get me started on him - he was a mish-mash of Genghis Khan, Attila the Hun, Hannibal and any other "bad guy" you can think of throughout history). This film casts an awful light on Saxons anyway, not a very accurate representation. It was indeed the early Roman Empire's philosophy to "never leave alive a man, woman or child who can carry a sword" NOT the Saxons'.Anyway, The film has some okay battle scenes, but is also unintentionally funny in a couple of places. Mainly to do with the choice of Keira Knightly to play Guinevere. Keira Knightly a warrior-woman? I don't think so! She's about as intimidating as a Jane Austen novel. And the love scene...very, very Hollywood. I mean, c'mon...WHEN, during all the fighting and travelling they do before it, did she have time to shave her legs? Haha. And even in the scenes in a dark forest, she always seem to have a bright light permanently installed just out of shot above her head, casting this ethereal glow over her. Then we cut back to Arthur and he's in almost total darkness. Please. I'm pretty good at suspending disbelief, but that was taking it a bit far! Aside from that, the film really DRAGS in the middle...to the point where I think you can safely nod off for a while and not be confused at all when u wake up and re-join the story. I dunno, giving it a 5 because I'm half-half, I don't even know if I'll be bothered ever watching it again, but it has it's good points. If you're just after a "Roman Empire" movie though, I'd much more hastily recommend Spartacus, The Fall of the Roman Empire, Ben Hur, or even Gladiator before I'd recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My two bits on King Arthur.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie, though I have qualms with some of the minor technical bits and thematic pieces.When I saw the promo on television for this film I interpreted the advert to convey the message of a corporate test-screened fiasco, replete with lots of pointless action, sex, a hip-hop soundtrack with metal rift overtones to appeal to all demographics.And so I passed on "King Arthur" when it hit the theatres, as I had with most films. I wanted a film that addressed the Dark Ages in Britain, but not one aimed at teenagers, and riding the heels of other "blockbuster" fiascoes.But I was intrigued by what kind of "fiasco" I had missed, and so rented a copy at Blockbuster. My expectations were extremely low, but I wanted to reassure myself that it was the right decision to pass up a bad film in the theatre by paying a bargain video rental price.That's not what I got.I got something that seemed to be exceptionally well shot, though I viewed the opening sequences with via my own prejudiced lens. But as the film rolled I discovered some very solid film making, with excellent art direction coupled with moody and eloquent cinematography, and first rate emoting from a fine cast.Wow! I understand the historical quibbles many an audience member will have with the story. And I, most of all, appreciate the disagreements, and after a fashion probably agree with a lot of the criticisms of the liberties taken with the history, yet, as a "fictional" piece taken as a presentation of what might have been history, I truly loved the film.There were a couple of borderline B-movie moments, but they're few and separated enough that they don't stand out unless scrutinized closely. If there were one real critique I could make it would be in the exposition of the story early on in Act I. Without revealing what happens I think a more grounded basis for Arthur's beliefs needed to be shown, maybe even showing a scene or two in Rome itself to explain Arthur's character.I think that's what it comes down to. Arthur's convictions are deep and profound, and with a magnificent stage set by Fuqua, the only thing missing are examples of why Arthur believes what he believes. We're shown some small portions of his reasons for his convictions, but not until later on. It's truly a minor oversight, but I think people latch onto this instinctively.Beyond that it's a first rate film. And I for one am eternally grateful that Fuqua removed (or toned down) the love-triangle from Mallory's text. Fuqua was right in his commentary, such an affair, particularly in those times, makes absolutely no sense among the people these characters represent. They're hardened men, with pride and loyalty, not petty lusts.In short "King Arthur" has one minor exposition shortcoming, and does juggle the historical facts, but approach it with an open mind, and you will be entertained. It truly is a well made film. One of my favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, a have to own thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only is this movie one of the greatest ever filmed, it is also one of my favorites. The thought of men fighting for a country and cause that isn't even theirs inspires me. I do not know any people now that would do that and it seems to me that these men should be honored beyond just in history books. A whole round table, once full, is down to six knights and their leader, Arthur. To me, that is the sad. All those men died because some Roman, a man that wouldn't take care of his own problems, ordered them to risk their lives in battles that they had nothing to do with. Arthur and his knights were amazing. The knights fought for Arthur because they loved and trusted him. There is no higher power than freedom and those who believe otherwise need a brain check. It's not about money or power in the end, or for some in the beginning, it's for the right that all humans, as humans, should have, freedom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor script ruins movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has a terrible script. Every epic cliché line written in Braveheart, LOTR and Gladiator was thrown into this movie and mishmashed to suit the director's purpose. From the upraising of swords and all the hooting and chest thumping that goes on, it becomes a terrible spectacle. Uninspired to say the least. For example, one scene has Arthur emerging from the city gates to meet Cerdic, the Saxon chief. Fog and smoke roil around him, making him look like a rock star from the 80's walking on stage. Just plain cheesy.Clive Owen, great in roles like Derailed and Sin City just doesn't seem right for this part. Although he has movie star looks, he does not have the screen presence to carry off an effective Arthur. Keira Knightly is not as bad in this movie as everyone says, but her lines are poorly written. She has an intriguing character though and a different twist on Guinevere. Ioan Gruffudd is wooden as the passionate Lancelot. Even the great Ray Winstone, marvelous in all those British gangster films, overacts his part. His over the top role as the crazy warrior becomes annoying very quickly.What good can be said about this film? Low key actors like Mads Mikkelson as Tristan and Stellan Skarsgard as Cerdic are simply great. Maybe their roles, because they didn't have to deliver many lines from the terrible script, made them shine. Regardless, they are fun to watch on the screen. Stellan as the old Saxon chief with that murderous axe and sweeping beard truly looks the part of an ancient warrior.The sets are simply phenomenal. From the burning villages to the mortared cities, they were inspired as much as the script wasn't. Details for armor, weapons, horses are flawless.The battle scenes? Spectacular! Swordplay, hails of arrows and flinging fireballs were a treat to watch. It's too bad there wasn't more of them. All the knights of Arthur have different fighting styles, with Tristan's saber to Lancelot's two sword fighting skill to Arthur's traditional longsword. Great stuff. The final battle scene was rousing to say the least. With flying bodies, splattered blood, classic one on one matches and the chaos of life and death m?lée, it was amazingly portrayed on the screen.The final word? If you want to watch a movie that has eye candy but little emotional content, an uninspired script and ho hum acting then by all means, rent this flick. It's really too bad that this movie hadn't really poured some work into these areas, because it could have been on par with the other epic classics.</fullReview>

I however, am spoiled by Excalibur and The Lord of the Rings. I like my knights in armor, dripping with noble arrogance and a love of God and country. Give me the fantasy, magic and great heroics. These knights were more like a band of rogue soldiers forced to do whats right. Too many of you read too much into a story that is supposed to be an escape. When has Hollywood ever been "totally historically accurate"? Sit back and enjoy the battles and intrigue. Of course there was the occasional interjection Hollywoods view of how society should be and of course--its usually slap at the church and religion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I should've listened to the critics!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That is what is going to have gone through your mind when you are finished watching his film- if you get through it at all.The whole thing was a great disappointment. It was neither historically accurate nor entertaining. One of the greatest flaws to me is how it starts off.We immediately see, that the Sarmathian people are in some sort of pact with the Romans that forces them to give up their young men to fight at any time they are needed. Lancelot is one of these young men, and we watch him leave.So then it skips several years ahead, and we expect to see more Lancelot. Do we? No, it immediately skips to King Arthur. So why didn't they just show Arthur in the beginning instead of Lancelot? Who knows. My guest is probably because Lancelot was such an annoying hothead anyway they decided to save us all the pain.Speaking of annoying characters, let's talk about Guinevere.She has to be the most irritating warrior female types in any movie I have ever seen. Not only does she come out of nowhere. Her romantic fixation with Arthur makes absolutely no sense at all- also coming out of nowhere. I could try to be generous and say that my anger with her was caused by the fact that she was so far away from the Guinevere we are used to seeing that my mind could not handle it....On second thought, let's not do that. Let's just go on about some more annoying characters.Like, the Anglo-Saxon leader, for example. The only reason they actually show for him being evil, is, well, that he's Anglo-Saxon. He has absolutely no depth, personality, or emotion. I mean, if he's going to be the savage, pillaging type couldn't he at least give us a nice war cry every once and a while? Or, looting cry, or whatever? Some reason to hate him? Oh yes, I remember- we already have one. He's Anglo-Saxon! Finally, let's talk about Merlin.Now, he's not as much annoying as he's just strange. In this version of the tale he's the spiritual leader of a Celtic (I'm not sure, that's just a guess) tribe of some sort. A tribe, which, Guinevere belonged to, surprisingly, since she definitely wasn't with them when Arthur found her. Anyway, Merlin's role in this story is just such a stark contrast to his other ones that it's difficult to really grasp.I guess at this point I would usually commence speaking about some of the other parts of the movie, but, there really isn't much more to talk about. Most of the battles are pretty poorly done and the plot wasn't all that interesting. Perhaps if it were all true, I could be kinder to this movie, but, since it isn't, I can't."Demystified" sounds more like "crappified" with this one. The only thing that saves the film at all is really just King Arthur himself, or maybe, Clive Owen as King Arthur. It's tough to see beyond the general poor quality of the film and decide which.I'd say sit out on this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So what if the movie is not "historically accurate"? It's entertainment at its best. The existence of Arthur has yet to be proved, as it the existence of Jesus... Although I agree the crossbows are out of place, the rest is almost perfectly put. This movie is another take on a classic tale and that's why I loved it. I also liked that there were no big movie stars (read egos) in it and that it was not too violent. The reason why I only give it 9 stars is Keira. I know you guys must have enjoyed the sight but, once again, the damsel in distress is beautiful. I'm still waiting for an actress to look ordinary and yet be a hero. Lastly, for those of you who know of the British series "Robin Hood" (Robin of Sherwood), in which Ray Winstone (Bors) was Scarlet, you surely noticed that Lancelot is carrying his swords the same as Nasir. I would even say that he dresses the same! Is it mere coincidence or a suggestion by Winstone?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Jerry Bruckheimer production is ambitious and at times ambles along. It seems in between mortal combat sequences the doldrums set in. Albeit KING ARTHUR is very worth your while. Historical facts may have been laid to the wayside as Arthur(Clive Owen)and his Knights of the Round Table fight in hopes of winning their freedom around 450 A.D. as beloved Rome falls. Arthur is torn between his alliance to Rome and his loyalty to the land of his birth, when England is plagued by lawlessness. My favorite scene is when the Knights go against a larger Saxon force on a frozen lake.The cast includes: Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot, Hugh Dancy as Galahad, Mads Mikkelsen as Tristan, Joel Edgerton as Gawain and the lovely Keira Knightley as Guinevere. Kudos to director Antione Fuqua. The greater part of this two hour plus movie was filmed in Ireland.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best King Arthur ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I totally agree with the many who have already pointed out that this was a great movie. This new take on Arthur and his knights is in fact the best I have ever seen. The written introduction containing the 'historic' background made me stumble and wonder if I got it all wrong. I have to admit that my knowlegde of Britain's history is not great and every native my forgive me when I say that - in the end - the mix-up of times and places didn't matter enough to me to take away the wonderful mood the movie left me in. The movie and the comments I have read so far, however, make me want to read more about the true history. Thank you all for that!From my point of (movie-goer) view the story is wonderfully told and the music and camera work are phenomenal. I was amazed by the scenery, the horses, the smog and fog on the meadows and in the forests...the snow made me feel the cold and the breaking ice just took my breath.The interaction between the knights was stunning. 'One for all and all for one', even though this was the saying in another great tale.Sure, Guinevere seems awfully strong for someone who had just been freed from an underground prison, almot starved to death....I guuess it was the pure will to kill the enemy...I loved the scene when, towards the end, Arthur came riding out of the roman fort through the smog...I wish I had seen this movie in the theater. Now I know what I missed when I didn't. Too bad the critics killed this movie. I know now that I will trust my instinct when I like a trailer to a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An artful movie featuring King Arthur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking around, I've seen people dissing about "King Arthur", saying it's a lousy flop and yadda yadda yadda. I say, consider all factors before speaking for or against it. This movie does have its ups and downs. The first time I watched it, I was dumbfounded and didn't know what was going on there. But now, I see it differently. The reason why people don't like this movie is because it's not what they expected. No Merlin and the pointy hat, no affair between Lancelot &amp; Guenevere, no sword in the stone, no Morgaine Lefaye, no Lady of the Lake etc. And sure, the movie makers didn't really keep to the historical facts, but you must realize that this is a movie, not a documentary. They did twist the facts... a lot... but they did make their point as well: that Arthur was Artorius, a hero from Rome, not an illegitimate son of a great man who couldn't keep his pants on. Although the choreography is not all impressive, it isn't too bad either and in some parts, it was done pretty well indeed. What I noted most was presentation of the characters, especially the knights. In the movie, Arthur and his knights were spoken of as formidable, legendary heroes and even close to gods. And the movie not only tells this, but shows it by presenting them with good effects. Example, how Arthur's silhouette emerged from the smoke through the slowly opening gates to meet the Saxon king, and how the knights are spotted behind the smoke upon the hill with their banners waving in the wind. And how the they and their horses moved as one. I especially liked how the movie makers played with the dust and smoke, wind and snow, how they paid attention to detail. Though I'll agree the story didn't quite have much to do with King Arthur and was mostly featuring him that surrounding him, I find that the cinematography, camera movement and effects etc all outweigh the poor, simple storyline, which I am greatly doubting as completely original. When I watched this movie, I couldn't help but wonder if I was watching a movie based on a book I read: The Last Legion. The description of the landscape in the book and the scenes almost EXACTLY match the ones in the movie. Example, the lake before Hadrian's Wall, the final battle at Badon Hill, the confrontation on the frozen lake and the way victory was won. The movie highly resembled all that was in the book. (The Last Legion will be coming out soon, starring Colin Firth.) That's why I'm not for the story, but like I said before, taking the rest into consideration, this is one entertaining ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not my Arthur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I learned from this movie: Arthur, "demystified" was not the Ur-defender of Britain, he was a prescient Champion of Freedom. Alrighty, that was moderately annoying. Full disclosure: I have a stake in Arthur. Not a big sake. But I was raised in England, and there is a part of me below my rational brain that believes Arthur will return. That Arthur did return, in the person of Elizabeth I and the storms that drove back the Spanish Armada. That Arthur did return, in the person of Winston Churchill and the RAF driving back the Nazis. That he will return to protect London from the rising waters. I get all misty eyed. But this guy? Not that Arthur. Not one of the avatars of that Arthur. Okay, based on one of the seven plus figures from history or myth that I have read might lurk in the Arthur matrix; a Roman soldier who stayed behind to protect his mother's people from hoards of . . . well, I'm not sure. From the movie, it appeared to be proto-Nazis. Racially pure "Saxons," intent on maintaining their ethic purity as they invaded new lands. Right. This Arthur was a champion of contemporary American values; freedom, religious and ethnic diversity, gender equality, blah blah blah. I mean, I am too. And so is Captain Kirk and John Crichton, and I love Captain Kirk and John Crichton. But thrusting those values back on Arthur . . . disconcerting. And not necessary for any reason I could tell. What unites all of the Arthurs was the bedrock fact that They Defended Britain. That's who Arthur is. He is the Defender of Britain, and he's every hero who prevented the night from falling for the space of his generation. Even my atheist flesh is all tingly at the thought. This Arthur? Not so much. For no good reason I could see. That said, this movie was gorgeous. The scenes, the fights, the actors . . . sumptuous. Full of the pretty. Even the torture scene. Again with the disconcerting. Was this a good movie? I didn't think so.</fullReview>

They had a chance to make King Arthur interesting, but no, they decide to go for an ALL ACTION film, the reaction- not good. pure trash.it was as if it was trying to be lord of the rings, or troy. It was an excuse to make money by naming the film king Arthur.disappointing. do not bother with this film. the people that made it were not interested in plot, just action. king Arthur is a perfect example of why cinema ticket sales are going down.Not good.

The Saxons did not invade north of Hadrian's Wall. The Romans didn't settle north of it either. Hadrian's Wall runs across the country well south of Scotland, so where were these mountains they were travelling through? It looked more like the Alps than the Southern Uplands - rolling hills in southern Scotland. What on earth was that little stone circle on the coast? Was that supposed to be Tintagel?

The look is great and the battle scenes well done. But despite that, I still can't bring myself to ever waste my time on this rubbish again.This movie had potential. It could have been great if it was crafted with a more realistic portrayal of people from that time. These simple-minded movies where the main characters and their causes are "good" and all else "evil" bore me.

What does it matter whether it is historically accurate to say that Mherline (just another spelling of, "Merlin") was a Magick User of great global significance, or not?! Why tamper with the story so severely that it completely changes the very essence of that myth/legend? Because it was NOT done with a loving care to the legend, this movie utterly fails to capture the imagination and lift the viewer out of the daily routine. I found myself going over the grocery list in my head during this movie!Some have touted this work to be "historically accurate." Feh! There is not enough history to support ANY version of the King Arthur legend. We know he existed, but beyond that, there is not enough substantiating evidence to go one way or the other. MY King Arthur was surrounded in Pagan beliefs and Traditions. I don't care for THEIR King Arthur, who was written and portrayed to have been a low-life robber-knight rather than a King of great legend and heart. It rates a 3.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

I found it refreshing to get away from the stories of legend and see Arthur in an historical aspect. The Historical Arthur may very well have been Ambrosius who was of Roman Stock. He also too the name of the first Arthur of the second century and that being Lucius Artorius Castus. My favorite scene is the one in the forest between Merlin and Arthur as Merlin has come to try to make peace after so many years. Guinevere is based on a first century warrior Budicca who fought with the Celts against the Romans. He is called by his ancestral name by Merlin, which is Arthur Castus. This gives an idea of what Britain was probably really like in the fifth century,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting filmic interpretation to a known story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Character &amp; Plot Analysis ==========================When I saw the film for the first time I was instantly struck by the way the aura of Arthur and Lancellot was built. It was interesting to see a film where rather than just having this knight called Arthur, having a lead up to how he became the known Arthur.There are a few points though that I feel could and indeed should have been done better:1. In the very initial stages of the film we are introduced to Lancellot as a young boy - how he was taken away from his normal life and sent to the Roman outpost. We get a glimpse into his past and a bit more of an understanding of his pain. We next see him 15 years later - but where is the introduction to the main protagonist - Arthur. This back look is given later on in the film but again it is too little, this is the main protagonist we are talking about here.2. I love the fact that the film has a deep, dark feel to it, Arthur and the knights are fighting for a cause that is alien to them. The knights fight for freedom and Arthur fights also for freedom but in turn to go to Rome which is the very cause of his lack of freedom. The belief in a dream these knights are experiencing is almost reminding of reality, where we all have a dream and a goal to reach but often loose sight of reality for the dream. 3. The obligatory romance. It is almost a requirement of films today to have a romantic element in them. Arthur the knight in shining armor coming to save the damsel in distress. She turns out to be a great warrior and they fall in love - OK that is the normal thing but there was a subtle twist in the film. Lancellot evidently had a soft spot for her and she for him, throughout the film we have him stealing glances at her and her at him - in the battle at the end he rushes to rescue her. Again a filmic allegory to the distant hero. An almost silent submission by Lancellot to Arthur. Perhaps this is the weakness of Lancellot. 4. The film is set in the dark ages and this was indeed a time where wizards and magic was common. Merlin depicted as a dark wizard but there is almost a hint of humor in him. He has a aura of wisdom and fighting spirit but at the same time is a soft person when realizing that love is brewing. Filmic Analysis ===============Overall I felt that the film was shot quite well. The tonality of the set was speaking dark ages with a deep over hue in the coloration and shots. In the battle scents the editing spoke of chaos and gore with short quick shots moving from angle to angle.The tonality overall I felt to be quite crude and almost morbid, I felt that this was done intentionally to give a sense of feeling into the roughness of the moment. In the scene where the knights are at a bar having a drink before gong out on mission, during the melancholic song of home the camera play of tonality gave a sense of future problems and impeding doom. Overview ========I feel that as a film the story line was good and the filming was great. Filmic representation to the beginnings of the Rule Of Arthur. Overall the romance is subtle but enough and the plot is well balanced through the whole film. The acting is natural and gentle with a keen eye for detail on costumes. The tonality is great. A good film overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The night of the knights.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were so many versions of King Arthur and his knights adventures !Richard Thorpe,John Boorman,Robert Bresson,Walt Disney to name but a few.Boorman's attempt is for me the most successful,but Ava Gardner will remain my Guinevere! This movie is itself undistinguished,with a strong tendency to increase the violence quota....the knights of the round table meet Tarantino...The scenes on a frozen lake make inevitably the viewer think of Eisenstein's "Alexandre Nevski".Although the movie seems to feature an "intellectual " side (roughly Christians versus Pagans),the battles get the lion's share (at least 75% of the film)That makes the screenplay repetitive and dull.Stay with Boorman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needed better actors...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't have too much expectation as I watched the film on TV. Another Jerry Bruckheimer production... commercialised and easy entertainment. They could have hired better actors though, because Clive Owen is totally bland as Arthur and so is Keira Knightley's performance as Guinevere. Her character was given quite interesting treatment though, depicted as a brave warrior rather than a damsel in distress. Ioan Gruffud tried his best as Knight Lancelot, who is perhaps one of the few good points for this movie. I have no idea why he was shown killed by the Saxons in the end, because according to the legends he shared a adulterous relationship with Guinevere after she and Arthur had married. Whatever, I don't expect the filmmakers had any kind of obligations to follow history or old legends while making Hollywood films. They have shown us quite believable battle scenes and beautiful locations and I am satisfied with that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard that they were going to make a movie about King Arhtur I was really excited. At first I thought that Merlin was going to look like a wizard who did weird magic, but I really like the way that he is portrayed. The only knight that knew about besides King Arthur, was Lancelot, and I love how there were other knights in the movie. Ioan Gruffudd who plays Lancelot is so cute, and he definitely gave an Oscar winning performance. This movie is definitely worth seeing. When I first saw it I loved it, but I was thinking that it wasn't the legend that my dad had always told me when I was little. I have always been a big fan of the story of King Arthur and his brave knights. I went on line to check it our. I found out that the story the director used was the most accurate story that they could find. That to me is so amazing. The fight scenes in the movie are great, and all the knights are played really well. Tristan is a knight that is very quiet and loyal to Arthur and is a good addition to the knights of the round table, and according to legend he is was a real knight with Arthur. This movie is definitely a must see and will put you on the edge of your seat and you won't be able to tear yourself away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot So Full of Holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't give this movie a 1 rating because it had some interesting scenes, but the plot was so full of holes I wanted to scream.*Please note there are nothing but spoilers below* 1) After Arthur finds Gwenevere (this is really where the plot begins to fall apart) in a torture chamber, she arranges a meeting with Arthur and Merlin on their trek back to Roman territory. How the hell did she get in touch with Merlin? If Merlin knew where she was (as she seemed some type of officer in Merlin's army), why didn't he save her butt? 2) Arthur was a respected knight, and as far as he knew Gwenevere was a peasant, worthy of his protection, but nothing more. When they got back to Roman territory, she's walking around with Arthur as if she's his right hand man. None of the other peasants are even allowed inside the Roman wall, but this isn't explained.3) Gwenevere can kick ass with a bow or sword, as she proves in battle over and over. There were less than a dozen soldiers (and they were not very well trained soldiers at that) where she was found in the torture chamber. How did this amazing woman get caught by so few soldiers. In the last battle alone she must have killed 20 hardened Saxon warriors.4) During the scene on the frozen lake, everyone (bad and good) are dressed in furs and/or full armor covering there every exposed flesh. Not Gwenevere, who is as scantily clad as a Victoria Secret model, yet doesn't show the slightest shiver in the freezing weather.5) Merlin trapped Arthur but didn't kill him because he thought they might serve a purpose. How wise he is, but then why trap him? I'll tell you why, because the script STUNK! If you want a few good battle scenes, this movie is great fun. If you think during a movie, stay far away from this poorly written Hollywood trash of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but with problems...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie King Arthur for the first time a few days ago, and really enjoyed it as I was watching it. It is an entertaining movie, and if you don't think too deeply its fun to watch as you get caught up in the action. . Afterwards, however, when I was thinking about it, I found lots of problems with it...The positives : Ioan Gruffudd. Wow. Arguably the most impressive actor in the movie.The knights. I love the way they aren't as squeaky clean as you may expect. The camaraderie between them is fantastic, and their loyalty to one another and to Arthur absolutely believable. The banter between them is at times hilarious, and makes me think of a modern football team's interaction.The way they altered the typical Artrhur legend. Although historical acccurists are fuming, I think the handled it well.The scenery. Beautiful.The music. Fits the action perfectly.The negatives : Clive Owen. Dear me, I think someone needs to go back to drama school. His acting is so wooden, they may as well have cast a tree in the role.Guinevere. Weak and fragile, barely able to lift her head, to beautiful young woman wielding a bow and arrow, to some violent, scarcely clothed warrior covered in blue paint. All in a few days. With no history of who she is. Eh? I really like Keira Knightley as an actress, but she irritated me in this movie.The relationship between Guinevere and Arthur, and the triangle with Lancelot. The relationship seemed so sudden, and was too ambiguous - it seemed to come out the blue, and the movie seems unsure of why its there. There were a couple of hints of Lancelot's feelings, but I don't think that subplot was explored enough.The script. It was OK, but in places the dialogue seemed awkward and obtrusive. Somethings weren't explained efficiently and left me feeling lost.The fact that its hard to care about the outcome. In LOTR, when there are few fighters against Sauron's forces, I ended up really caring about what happened. It was very dramatic. In King Arthur, it was a bit like "Oh. 8 against several hundred. Oh well..." Overall, I think the movie is definitely worth watching, if only for the humour provided by the knights, and Gruffudd's impressive turn as Lancelot. Allow yourself to get caught up in the action, and don't focus on the details, and you should enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reason i give this film a 6/10 is that as a stand alone film (acting locations etc) but the fact that it was called King Arthur i take as a insult all there is that has anything to do with King Arthur is the names.According to celtic history he was alive AFTER the romans had left Britain so he could not have been a roman officer.There were still romans/romano-British at the time so there would have still been roman influence in the way people lived as there were many good things that the romans brought.The equipment was not from that time period (crossbows for example) and some of the things they showed were just laughable,the 800 yard shot into a tree to kill someone(who could see a man hidden in heavy cover at 800 yards to begin with).If you want something that follows the legends of arthur then get excaliber which in my mind is a far better made film anyway and i hope that people who watch this take it for what it is,the world according to Hollywood and not a representation of a legend of about 1500 years ago.Maybe the next film will have Abe Lincoln as a drunken homosexual but i guess they do not mind changing the history of other countries or (as in u572???) change history so that America win s every wars and does everything of note in the world(the UK captured the first Enigma device not the Americans).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not often the screenwriter chews the scenery... - Spoiler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came to this movie wanting to like it -- first, on the general principle that you can't go too far wrong with any film that involves healthy doses of righteous Saxon-whacking, axe-cleavings, and all the other straightforward miscellaneous carnage of early-medieval warfare; and second, out of interest that someone was finally taking a look at the origins of the Arthur myth, complete with the Battle of Badon Hill. (Although I'm not sure the identification of Arthur with the Sarmatian Ambrosius is all that well-supported.) And I liked Ioan Gruffudd from A&amp;E's "Horatio Hornblower".But gadfrey -- could the dialogue possibly have been more overwrought? Like (spoiler alert) Arthur lamenting to the skies over the body of a fallen knight -- reminded me of Rainer Wolfcastle yelling "Mennnndozzzaaaa!" on "The Simpsons." And cool it with the blue filters already -- can't filmmakers find an original way of conveying cold gloom than the same one they used in The Ring, Lord of the Rings, The Bourne Identity, etc.? (It didn't help that in the scene at Marius' estate, fake snow flurries were swirling around poplar trees that hadn't even changed color yet, let alone dropped their leaves.)</fullReview>

And the woman warrior, OK she is hot, she is a great archer, but also a great swordwoman, she can kill also thousands of Saxon warriors, without even losing the lipstick on her lips? oh my god... too much fantasy. And the Saxons... why are they so bad and stupid? I've lived in Saxony and people there are quiet normal, some of them are really smart actually, and I think they had some worthy warriors in the past, at least they were never really conquered by the Romans or other empires... but in this film they seem to be disabled or idiot people or something like that, I don't know if this is very respectful to history or other cultures (by the way I am not Saxon)... if you want to see good fights between Saxons and Romans better see Gladiator... and if you want to see a good film about King Arthur, then wait for something better, something more serious to come...</fullReview>

I wish that they had included a little more of the love interest between Keira and Clive. The director's cut is a much better version than the theatrical release.

		<fullReview>Just saw the 'director's cut' DVD. Which is much bloodier than the movie version (I'd seen part of that on cable one night), and also restores some much-needed plot development.There are the obvious historical issues (Rome never conquered the Sarmatians, Saxons weren't in Britain when Romans were there, and didn't come from the North, etc., etc.), which are irritating in a film purporting to be based on recent unearthing of facts about the real Arthur. Forgiving those, the movie has spotty casting (a surprising number of skinny knights, for example), and an uneven script with a weak plot (who is Guinevere? 'woad' royalty? We're never told. Her sudden recovery from an injury is so blatant that it's even remarked on by another character. Then again, the mission of the knights is to save someone who lives in an area that is supposedly too dangerous for the Romans to occupy). The ending battle scene is hackneyed, and has occasional sightings of actors obviously not engaged in battle, but medieval war is hard to get right on screen. The alternate ending would probably have been a better choice, though it's preachy.It's a revisionist fairy tale about a legend, and it has its moments. It just seems like it might have had more of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bit of a Waste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say? Well, for starters, I no longer think Kingdom of Heaven is that badly done. Let's start with how this film gets rolling. In the "plot convenience theatre" department: Arthur and all his knights need to be sent out on a mission to rescue this VIT (very important teenager), a mission so important that getting him back is the last thing the Roman army will do before departing. So, this kid is hanging out at some isolated plantation on the wrong side of Hadrian's wall??? Ladies and gentlemen, our human McGuffin is in place. And, in the same scene, what is it with the way Christians are being portrayed in these films? Is it some attempt to balance the fact that, fifty years ago, Christians were always portrayed as superior to Pagans, so now it is some kind of payback? In Kingdom of Heaven, a lot of the Christians were portrayed as venal, violent, and dim. How could King Arthur do worse? Venal, violent, cowardly, dim, and to top it off, pointlessly sadistic! How sadistic? Well, they do this dorky "torture Pagan children just because" routine. How pointless? Well, they have Keira Knightley in a dungeon, and all they can think of doing is breaking her fingers. How pathetic- and uncreative. This is Keira Knightley...Which brings to our film's antagonists: the Saxons. Let's play "You are the Saxon commander!" Despite apparently getting lost on the sea crossing and landing several hundred miles north of all the other Saxons, you have just come across a hastily abandoned Roman plantation. The plantation's carts and draft horses are gone, and the serfs have fled, but a fully furnished large luxury villa, outbuildings, tilled fields, and livestock remain. Do you say to yourself:A. FREAKING GREAT! THIS is why we invaded England: free pre-built fiefdoms! They even left the tableware, excellent. Now for the hard decision: keep it for myself, or give it to one of my successful captains instead of having to pay him? OR, B. WE HATE BUILDINGS! Burn! Burn the blasted thing to the ground. Kill everything that moves! We're Saxons- that's what we do! Sure, it is winter in Britannia, and the livestock we are pointlessly killing might come in handy to feed my army, but us Saxons prefer sleeping outside, on the ground, and eating- well, whatever. That's what makes us superior? Most historical Saxon commanders, in fact, chose option A. But, I guess Bruckheimer and company didn't think that invading land to take over and run things was eeeevil enough. So, the producers brought in the gang from "The Road Warrior," took away their dune buggies, and called them the enemy. Frankly, I suspect that their behavior would leave most historical Saxons going "huh?"One thing a lot of Saxon commanders would have liked, though, was all the groovy crossbows they had. Did someone time travel to eleventh century Genoa and buy them all? If they did, it would seem easier to come back with Lee-Enfield rifles and solve all their problems. Must be one of those time machines that only allow for the transport of non-gunpowder weaponry.The "am I watching a Godzilla film?" moment came after the rescue of teen McGuffin from the Saxon marauders and right before a battle on a frozen lake. Clive Owen gives an "inspirational" speech. The whole scene was re-dubbed from what Owen was originally saying, however, and the synchronization is horrible. Clive's lips start moving a full half second before we get any words. When I see that, I expect to hear Godzilla sounds or Hong Kong Martial-arts film sound effects immediately following. Hard to believe this film was done in English. Since Owen's speech was pretty cheesy, I shudder to imagine what Owen was saying originally, to be dubbed over with that cheese.The "battle on the ice" itself- it is just like Alexander Nevsky, except for the fact that it isn't good. Just a badly shot muddle of people on the ice more reminiscent of the "Monty Python Women's League" battle re-enactments than Eisenstein.After the Nevsky homage, we are treated a the most awkward, painful so-called "love scene" featuring Clive and Keira. There was a time in film when they would have just faded out when it was obvious what would happen. That would have been such an improvement. With these sort of scenes, do it right or don't do it at all! Poor lighting, camera angles straight out of "Battlefield Earth" and the old Batman TV show, enough camera movement to give some viewers motion sickness- even a porn film director could have done better.Of course, any film like this needs a final, climactic battle. Okay, so you have the best fortification in Britannia in the form of Hadrian's wall, and you let them through, supposedly as part of a trap. It appears that for this plan to work, the Saxons had to charge past the fortress and into battle, instead of thinking that maybe they would want to keep the fortification and let the natives attack them while they had the nice building; it is a good thing these road-warrior Saxons hate buildings and fortifications. And where did all the petroleum for these fire-traps come from? Lancelot was impressive, though. Why use a crossbow, if you can throw your sword forty feet and have it stick? And then, of course, the final wedding scene with the flaming arrows being shot into the sea (winner, 2004's most retarded Freudian image in film). But anyway, we have this great image of the wedding of Christian and Pagan, on the rocks. It just has a certain "love boat" kitschy quality to it which ruins any alleged message."Kingdom of Heaven" looked like a mish-mash when I first saw it. But, compared to this, it is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the major problems with this film is there isn't anything interesting in the scenery. It is so dark and they used a blue or green coloring for a lot of shots, which just makes it look like it rained all the time.The plot is a little different than the usual King Arthur/Lancelot story. It involves the Saxons, which are the villains, as the main enemy Arthur fights. And Merlin is not in Arthur's court. He speaks a foreign language and calls both the Saxons and Arthur enemies. Arthur comes across Guinevere on his journey and she happens to be good with a bow and arrow.None of the battles are memorable or even cool. They were just dark and dull and characters did things without any real reason, so you didn't care how it turns out.FINAL VERDICT: Boring and dreary, not a good version of King Arthur and his knights.

		<fullReview>The best plan when viewing this film is to toss aside any hopes of a traditional Arthur/Guinevere/Lancelot storyline and, in fact, to cast aside any notion that anything previously associated with the Arthurian legend will be represented at all. It also helps to avoid expecting any semblance of actual history to seep into the movie. So where does that place it? Right in there with any other inaccurate historical spectacle that is more interested in the clanking of swords and the amount of curls dangling from the heroes' faces, than in truly bringing to light the events and details of the period. In other words, it is a mildly entertaining battle story with a cast of solid actors, but has no regard for its roots or its reasonability. (This is despite a crawl at the start of the film which purports to set the record straight about the real King Arthur....right.....) Owen plays the man who would be king. Here he is a soldier, indentured to Rome, who must complete one final task before he and his men can claim their freedom. Owen, Gruffudd (as right-hand man Lancelot) and the other knights must venture north to territories held by the savage Saxons in order to rescue a young boy and his family who are important to the future of Rome. Once they arrive (at the improbably located home of this family), they find a gaggle of serfs and a pair of nearly dead religious prisoners and they bring them back with them as well. They then find themselves being hotly pursued by the Saxons, led by beastly Skarsgard and his upstart son Schweiger. Finally, a huge battle for the future of the territory takes place with Owen, Gruffudd and Knightly (as Guinevere) leading the way. Owen is a handsome and solid Arthur. Gruffudd is never allowed to be the shining and beautiful knight that Lancelot is often portrayed as. He is more often a grungy and surly sidekick. Those used to seeing Guinevere braiding her hair or doing needlepoint while wearing a velvet gown will get quite a shock at the sight of Knightly. She does wear a dress in a few scenes, but primarily is a war-painted, woodsy archer who kicks as much butt as any man! The famed knights of the round table are played by an able and amiable clatch of international actors who eventually emerge as individuals though it takes some time to sort their dirty faces and scraggly hairdos out. They all do well, but Winstone and Stevenson are the most impressive. Dillane turns up as a highly atypical Merlin, leader of the Woads (a murky tribe of scantily clad archers.) Skarsgard affects a hilariously American-sounding accent that wouldn't be out of place in a truck stop, but he is a physically imposing villain. Schweiger is effective as his edgy son. As an action-adventure film, it delivers in several areas, notably during a skirmish on top of a frozen lake. The whole enterprise might have been best served as an original story without dragging the fabled names of Arthurian legend into it. All that did was upset most purists and since any and all mysticism, along with several key characters (and the central crux of the story - the love triangle!) have been omitted entirely, it seems pointless. The film seems to borrow heavily from other, better films like "Last of the Mohicans", "Braveheart" and "Gladiator" with only a small amount of its own merit shining through. "Excaliber" remains the most satisfying take on the material.</fullReview>

Some of the dialogue was sophomoric and really not needed-but it wasn't terrible. The cinematography was nicely shot and effectively captured the feel of the film However, its timeline is somewhat off. By 407 AD, the last legion of Rome in Britain, Legio II Augusta, is withdrawn, and the province abandoned. In the movie, it starts out at 452 AD, which is quite off by a small, yet significant 45 years. This is only a small flaw in the movie.

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable Saturday-evening movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am just a sucker for well-choreographed action sequences, played out by cool-looking armored dudes fighting bad guys. I enjoyed "LadyHawke" back in 1985, and I have always liked movies such as the Hong Kong cinema shoot-'em-ups and so on. So, King Arthur has the elements that I look for in a fun film.The most enjoyable aspect was seeing the obvious dilemmas faced by Arthur himself. Clive Owen is excellent. Whether Arthur really existed, well...who cares? Seeing this guy, who is clearly Mediterrainian, and at least therefore giving some credence to the idea of a Roman Arturius, is pretty cool.There are so many "goofs" and anachronisms that it is almost funny in itself. My favorite -- "those guys have armor-piercing arrows!!!" (That sounded like Bruce Willis or Sly Stallone saying "hey -- those guys have armor-piercing bullets!!!")And what was up with that Saxon-leader guy -- who clearly spoke with an American- style accent -- like he was born and raised in Newark?! He even looked kinda like a trucker...probably IS a trucker...although his acting was fine. He certainly gave the impression of a real, real bad guy doing REAL bad things.I guess that if you can suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours, you'll have fun with this flick. I remember seeing a version of Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet," in which the anachronisms were quite simply exaggerated on purpose (palace guards wearing camouflage and flashlights, for instance). And remember that Shakespeare himself was well-known for writing all kinds of odd anachronistic stuff in his plays, and they are taught in schools all over the world. So...So, what I'm saying is that bobby pins in Guinivere's hair isn't so bad. In the opening scene to Shakespeare's Julius Caesar (yet another Roman-era play) one character tips his HAT to another, and points to a "chimney.":)Thanks.- Sammy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay - the score is pretty good. The acting struggles to become wooden, and the plot is an incomprehensible mish-mash. Even forgetting that the basic assumptions are garbage (the dates of Roman occupation and withdrawal are off, the 'Sarmation' knights legend is dim, and the activities of the Saxons and the 'wodes' don't correspond to any known history of Britain), the military maneuvers are indescribable. No military commander deliberately gives up the best defensive position of his time, for any reason.The historical (in)accuracy is no big deal - we are dealing with a myth; you can make up anything you like, as long as it is entertaining. The garbled plot and questionable tactics ensured that it was not. For example in the confrontation on the ice; if you have a longer attack range than the enemy you keep him outside his effective range - you don't wait for him to advance, nor do you allow him to do so. As noted above, you don't give up a defensive position by inviting the enemy past it, and so on. The 'flyover' shots of Hadrian's Wall and accompanying fortifications are extremely poorly-done CGI; it looks like circa 1995 CAD work on freeware or cheapware programs like "My House Designer." I am delighted that I didn't sit through this dreck in a theatre; at least the DVD rental was cheap. Forget the spoiler warning - if you haven't seen it, the whole film is a spoiler.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Pyle's King Arthur, but worth watching!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Be forewarned, King Arthur fans, this is not Pyle's King Arthur. It's not Disney's Sword in the Stone, and it certainly isn't Merlin. But, it is a good movie in its own right. Lots of battle and bloodshed. A good storyline and good actors to boot.The one thing I did not enjoy was the fact that the character of Merlin was down-played into King Arthur's rival instead of his wizardly counselor. The other thing was, although I do want women to get on the battlefield and kick-butt, I felt the character of Guinivere was too dramatized and somewhat over-rated. If you're wondering what I mean, let me point out that her picture is in the middle and not Arthur's. Anyways.It's overall a good movie. Rent it and see if you think it's worth owning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this latest incarnation of the King Arthur story, Director Antoine Fuqua gets points for trying to establish the Arthur story in a more credible time, with more accurate armour and warriors actually getting tired on the battle-field.He loses major points for including just about every action epic cliché possible, including the "horse-leaping-over-fire" bit and the "leader-giving-inspirational- speech-while-riding-his-excited-horse-in-front-of-the-troops" bit. Also, Keira Knightley looks out of place in this film. Her acting is wooden and lifeless (and she can't she close her mouth for some reason), and appears to be in this movie only so that she can be scantily-clad. I had hoped that I would be able to enjoy this movie despite Knightley's presence, but it was not to be.Overall, this portrayal of the Arthur story is only slightly better than "First Knight", and miles from "Excalibur".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very different twist on an age old theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are looking to revisit the age old story of King Arthur stop right now. If you liked Robin Hood Prince of thieves then you'll like this as it is a complete rehash of the story with Arthur fighting for the Romans. The action is good and the story holds together well. I did find that the characters were a little wooden but this could have merely been the sixth century feel coming to the fore. One real shining light in the film was Ray Winston who carried his character with a cockney whit that no one would have expected, he was what Friar Tuck was to Prince of Thieves, you just wouldn't have wanted to steal Winstons ale under any circumstances. So if you want an epic to sit through and enjoy then this is well worth it, but try to forget the Arthur you know as the story will pull you in many directions in its attempt to explain all the characters and how they fit into the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a decent epic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw King Arthur a few months ago. I was expecting something like Troy or even worse Alexander.( I never saw either because my one friend said they both stunk.) After I watched it, I thought " pretty cool". Clive Owen did a decent job at the role of Arthur. Keira Knightley also did well. The action sequences were well done. The extended version just has some added battle scenes, and a (not-really) extended love scene between Arthur and Guinevere. There was really no point in extending it. The violence is a little stronger and more intense, and there were a few bloody moments. Nothing over the top, though. It wasen't really graphic either. I thought Gladiator was more graphic and bloodier than this. A good and decent epic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Arthur - Weak Plot (?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I watched King Arthur I thought the plot was rather weak and barely there. It seemed just a lot of war without a purpose. But when I bought the Direcotr's Cut DVD and watched it over and over, I began to see the plot which was staring plainly in my face. They want to be released, they want their freedom.I'm a huge fanatic of King Arthur (the mythological or Real historic figure) and I can see why King Arthur was made towards the end of his life.The only thing I don't understand it, according to historians, Guinevere had an affair with Lancelot, but this happened after the marriage of King Arthur and Guinevere. But in the movie, they don't and Lancelot dies before Arthur gets married. Why was it made in this way? Did they want to keep it as more of a war and fight for freedom movie rather than a romantic? Anyway I totally love King Arthur (the movie) and thought everyone involved in its creation did a wonderful job. Good on you! I wish more historical movies were made...they're fantastic.Luv always Josie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to go see it in theaters last summer, expecting an average medieval warfare movie, with epic battles. I was wrong. King Arthur is an amazing epic with a story, unlike some other ones I know, and I could actually feel sad when Dagonet died to save the others, or when Tristian and Lancelot died at Cerdric's hands.The one thing I really didn't like was how you could really tell that the battle scenes were cut to give the movie a PG-13 rating. I bought the Unrated Extended Edition and I like that version a lot better than the theatrical version. If you want to see this movie, rent the Unrated Edition, instead of the Theatrical version and you will get a much better movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missing the Point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the reviews about the movie King Arthur seem to be missing the point that it is a Movie and not a Documentary about King Arthur. I bought the DVD because I found the movie to be entertaining and interesting and I have enjoyed watching it again. If someone spends their time watching a movie looking for any little problem or in trying to convince to themselves that what they are watching is supposed to be real and not in fact a movie with actors and props then they must have a hard time enjoying any movie. Most of the negative reviews on this movie do just that and also shows to me that person is quite exaggerated and extreme in an attempt to be sarcastic about their view on the movie.I didn't watch the movie as a means to somehow clarify History in Britannia of 400 AD and convince myself that it is Historical Prudence. There are perhaps Historical exaggerations or inaccuracies dealing with the film. But just as I loved the movie Excalibur the Myth of Arthur in that is also not Historically factual to that Time period as well so do we just throw that context out as well? If anything it is entertaining and interesting to play with the legend as all that the story of King Arthur is just that, A Legend.The movie king Arthur certainly had a plot and I wonder of those who don't get the plot of why they choose not to see or understand it. It would be like saying Braveheart or Gladiator didn't have a Plot. The plot is what Arthur discovers as to the meaning of sacrifice and why men who become free will serve in loyalty to the one who allows them to be free. People, Do you really miss this quite obvious and yet important key to the whole Movie? Why is that so devoid of consideration in reviewing of this movie to leave out? The characters are not stale and each has it's own characteristics and attributes. So many dislike Merlin, yet I thought the Guerilla Tactical and Wise Druid was an interesting twist and a probable character of that time. Many dislike Guinevere being more savage yet during that time period her character is more accurate than a lady of the court. I also loved the character Tristan and found him to be much like a Ranger.My advice is to just enjoy the movie and appreciate it for what it is. I am glad to see movies of this sort being put out there and hope to see more movies in the genre made. I'm certainly not going to watch movies watching for every little mistake the director makes while missing the experience of the film. I think that is the difference for the polarity of the reviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie until the end. The character Tristan, played by Mads Mikkelson, was my favorite thing about the movie. I enjoyed most of the other characters as well. But (Spoiler) the second that Tristan approached Cerdric (the main bad guy). I was like, there is NO way they are gonna let Tristan win this one. Even though, throughout the movie he proved to be the most martially proficient knight, and easily the most skilled swordsman, Hollywood can't let the bad guy get beaten by a secondary character. I was not happy to see that scene play out. I did not like the Lancelot or Galahad characters either, although the actors did a fine job. I am a fan of Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, and definitely did not miss the several borrowed scenes and plot points. I didn't mind them either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why this Film Flopped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is my own personal feeling about why this film flopped at the box office. Disney has a major problem, and that problem is greed. Now if you watch the "family friendly" PG-13 version of the film you left with an empty feeling. With films like Braveheart, and Excaliber we have come to expect a lot more from our Midevil War films. Sometimes a film calls for violence, sometimes they don't. While Pirates of the Caribean does not need decapitating heads or arrows trough the chest, A film like King ARther does. Disney Made a great film then before putting it in theaters they said "Hey we can make more money if we take out most of the blood and gore, and add a lot of pointless dialoge then people will take their kids and we will be even more rich than we already are!" Can anyone say The Alamo, enough said.If you are wanting to see this film, get the unrated directors cut, it really is worth seeing, Clive Owen is great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*A few spoilers ahead, be warned* Fair enough, not a whole lot is actually known about the real King Arthur, or the period in which he lived, but wearing leather bikinis in the middle of a British winter?!?!? Come on guys... And what's with the facial make-up? A bit over the top, to say the least.Acting was pathetic, though mostly due to the poor dialogue. The comic-relief bits were actually not-too-bad at all, but the battle scenes balance it up by being unrealistic, especially the one which should've 'made' the film, when the few Knights Of The Round Table, face up to however many hundreds of soldiers in a frozen valley... To begin with, for a river to freeze THAT badly, you need at least a -10C temperature (if not colder), and it NEVER, ANYWHERE, in Britain gets THAT cold (from experience - I've been here for long enough, and travelled that country up and down - winter time included). Furthermore, that valley, as we're told is the ONLY pathway through the mountains - what mountains?!?!? This is a flat land, and the few mountains that there are here, are nothing more than big hills (apart from the Scottish Highlands perhaps - but that's not anywhere near where the story takes place). It made more sense in Robin Hood, when they get from Dover to Hadrian's Wall in one day's travelling! All in all, doesn't come across as authentic, no attachment developed to the characters and completely over-the-top.The only reason it got five stars from me (and not one), is due to the fact, that for a change, its not in the 'Best 250' list...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Can This Be Called King Arthur?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sick to death of hearing that dimystifying a legend through film can only be a good thing. That may have worked decently for TROY (which still didn't really wow the box office) mainly because it was still true to the story in a sense.This film is a complete and utter mess, even if it wasn't called King Arthur. It was so distant from the actual story that I'm still scratching my head as to why it was called King Arthur. First off, Arthur is portrayed to be a servant of Rome, the son of a Roman and a Brit. The knights of the "round table" were all serving Arthur and Rome. This was the biggest inaccuracy to the story that really bothered me. You could've had Uther Pendragon and Igrane of Cornwall as his parents and still made the movie more realistic. Just leave out the magical aspects of the legend, that's all they had to do.I felt no attachment to any of the characters and really could've cared less when Lancelot was slain. The acting was stiff and Clive Owen didn't exactly give an inspiring performance.Granted, they could've made a demystified version, but still been faithful to the story. Even First Knight was more interesting. Save your money and rent Excalibur or Merlin. Good thing I borrowed this movie. I would've been mad at myself if I would've actually shed out cash for this tripe. Note to Mr. Bruckheimer; just because you're a Hollywood powerhouse, all the money in the world doesn't give you the right to butcher a legend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of action, little story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was actually surprised--I'd expected the movie to be much worse than it was. The effects and action scenes were, of course, "thrilling," "breathtaking," "ground-breaking" (supply your own PR adjective). Perhaps more surprising was the acting, which was tolerable, even convincing. The characters weren't complete card-board cutouts, and hinted at a bit of depth. And the film was atmospheric without being comical.The film totally and utterly lacked a plot, unfortunately. Ultimately it was little more than a series of vaguely-connected battles, love scenes and angst-filled monologues, slavishly plodding to the only possible conclusion: the conversion of Artus into Arthur, King of the Britains, and the gathering of his followers 'round the Round Table. The producers promised a rewriting of the Arthurian legend; instead we get little more than a time-shift, this telling taking place a millennium before the classic setting, and characters that are slightly more interesting than the archetypes of the original tales.Moreover, excepting the primary characters, character motivation was totally absent. Why were the Saxons invading? What motivated the Saxon leader--was he simply cruel? Was it merely blood-lust? The search for a worthy adversary? And was his son a closet pacifist, or a wanna-be king? Evil, or misunderstood? Were the Romans decadent, misguided, or multifaceted? Ultimately all peripheral characters were merely props for the continuation of the film.I did enjoy the film, however, hence my five-star rating. It was fun to watch, if not particularly moving or enlightening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the plus side the movie has excellent battle scenes , great atmosphere and some very good performances especially from Kieran Knightey who consistently shows herself to be one of the great young actresses out there. However what lets it down are really for the same reasons why Troy let me down and that is the lead character and the historical content. Clive Owen may well look the part but he gives his lines with no real conviction , its a little bit like actors in a Shakespeare play , so many of them say their lies without understanding what they are actually saying.The historical element is more annoying than anything else , probably not noticed if you are not English however I get annoyed how US film producers either completely change history (yes we did contribute in WW2 )or alternatively cast the "baddie" in every movie as a Brit (yes I know we make great "baddies" but does every movie have to do it).I appeciate that King Authur is cast in legend and it was quite refreshing not to have the usual magicians etc, but the real King Authur lived in the 15th century not 1000 years earlier . What really was the point of casting him as a Roman soldier? Were the studio simply trying to cash in on the name? I am just waiting for Robin Hood to be cast as a Roman as well!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Disney Version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the promotional copy, "the TRUE story," I approached this film with some caution. Disney did Pearl Harbor, which I have never forgiven them for (I was a 4-year-old survivor of the attack, and I consider the Disney film an insult to the memories of all involved. May they rot for that one.) Yet I knew that there was evidence of an historical Arthur, so I decided to give it a try.Spoilers follow.The real Arthur had Roman roots, but there's nothing to justify the artificial Samaritan association. That was an invention to keep him and the knights together.Guivivere, though, was a really jarring note: a warrior-princess like Xena. Where did she get all that machismo? Certainly not culturally.Explosives and the like were unnecessary. Like the Moorish telescope in Robin Hood, it's anachronistic, and doesn't contribute to any "true story." Only Disney has the chutzpah to release fantasy as "history." If we throw out all the pretensions of an historical presentation, it's an entertaining film. But not an outstanding one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great cinematics, inspirational music (not original, god forbid), nice choreography, good acting. This is all that is good in this movie. The story is a "reinvented" King Arthur tale, mainly because there are some guys in the script named Arthur, Lancelot and Guineviere. I think they decided to keep Guineviere female at the very end, because they needed a wedding and a Braveheart moment. Everything else is Hollywood fantasy, default template. It resembles "The 13th Warrior" more than any King Arthur movie ever made, except that now there are 7 guys and their quest is ... well, they have no quest. They just fight and die and shout a lot. There is no humour, no serious character development, nor is there a real plot. It's like a porn movie with a background story, ignore it and enjoy the fights!As for the actors, I really like Clive Owen and I think he is one of the major actors in movies today, and I really do understand the need to appear in a high budget film with a huge salary, but if he has any self esteem at all, he will reject any other movie offers where the script consists mostly of "Ugh" "AAAAAARRGGHH!!" and "Your face will be the last thing you see on this Earth". He does make a good show, but alas! The part is shallow and uninteresting. Keira Knightley looks good, fights a lot, she barely speaks. Stellan Skarsg?rd is another actor that I like, but his role is insignificant.Conclusion, watch this movie when you are too tired to sleep (like I did) or when you really need to make space on your harddrive. Deleting it is also a good option.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Celts, poor history, poor legend!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the rare movies I rated really bad, because expectations promised by the title itself to a fan of Celtic culture ended up by bitter disappointment. The whole movie was to me like inconsistency upon inconsistency from A to Z in everything a movie is made of.Legend:The Arthurian legend is one of the most popular in the world history. The authors explicitly decide to tell us their version. But who would think it will have so little in common with the legend! Not a single word about Grail, Camelot, Morgane, Avalon. Merlin is a Pict! A dirty shaggy ragged wise man of a primitive tribe, yes. Guinevere is a Pict too, and quite a good warrior! Arthur Castus... he's a Roman captain, that's all! At least before he decides to stay at his mother's homeland. His "knights" are just... Sarmathian cavalry ? men serving their 15 years military duty to Rome! Nothing more. All we have left is Excalibur taken from father's grave (but looks like it was a deed for a kid he was to simply lift it) and the empty Round table biggest from all movies (I bet it's able to host more than a double dozen!), looking really mistakenly with only 6 companions (all who's left alive after battles for Roman rule in England!). Difficult to castrate the legend more.History:May be the authors decided to discard all mystical elements and take an historical approach? We have a handful of Roman soldiers, Arthur with his cavalrymen and a Bishop in the fortress. Not much faces in the city, no peasants around. The only peasants we see are those serving the Roman nobleman living behind the wall between England and Scotland (!!!) built especially for defence against aggressive tribes. But I doubt local peasants would be so obedient to a stranger, if he would survive at all up there. All we see as truly local population are Picts truthfully described as a primitive tribe... But where is the rest of British population??? Did they wipe them all out "to control the land"? Devastation. Empty Britain save for those poor Picts before Saxes came. Hey, where are the Celts??? Even in 4th century they were already occupying all the South and their descendants are still living in Whales. And they could tell you the names of those knights Gawain and Galahad retained from the legend are 100% Celtic. Not Sarmathian, I can assure you living on latter's historical motherland! Were Celts considered also a mystical part of the legend?! Shame on makers of an historical movie! (if this is one at all).Story:Looks more like a sketch of the story. The story lines are raced through. Some episodes are depicted in slow details and then big parts are simply cut out. There is too much milk and water (soldiers' jokes, tribesmen matters) comparing to content essential for the story. Many episodes finally serve to nothing and some banal ideas are repeated too many times. The driving motive judging by accents is "soldiers wanna go home", at least this warrior part is most emotionally filled. Other relationships and love line look like very long entanglement suddenly passing into abrupt denouement, completely unelaborated. Even the psychological culmination of Arthur's ideological disappointment in Rome and turning to local heritage have much time divergence filled with nothing substantial. So we have no good story either comparative to "First Knight" as much unfaithful to the legend but at least offering a fascinating story in itself.Characters:Basically flat and banal (brave captain, crafty Bishop, etc). There is an obvious lack of individuality, psychological evolution and motivation. Our heroic knights dream about simple domestic joys. Guinevere though tribeswoman looks quite decent until she suddenly jumps into Arthur's bed. Arthur has a specific strain of deep thoughts and high responsibility on his face, too forced IMHO. There is a hint on his special abilities in the beginning but it does not take any shape. He doesn't make the presence of a powerful hero. It is not rigid seriousness which makes beloved leaders, and it is not stupid braveness which makes heroes, and it is not plain honour which makes kings. Nobody to look at all in all.Artwork:Picts' blue faces painted with spiral red lines the same as on their tomahawks are beautiful. The rest of "original" details is not really original. The wonderful firework of flaming arrows we had in "First Knight". The sexy war costume of Guinevere is a leather copy of Lulu's medical stripes in "Fifth Element". Location:I don't know why they had to shoot the movie on location (in Ireland though) with all other relativities (hills and forests must be not hard to find). I guess they took some real castle, but we don't really see much of it, except the long wall. And I have strong impression that the same wall is used for the frontier wall. The gate in it was huge and at first I was pleasantly surprised seeing it opened with 2 horses, but in the end one heavily wounded soldier opens them with only his own weight, so it didn't keep consistent for long either. I guess all of it could be easily replaced with decorations. As well as a very small one but obviously real ring of stones in which the wedding takes place. It is naturally deprived of upper beams which should probably be intact in 4th century, not speaking of the fact that those stone rings were not for weddings like in Christian world and "coronation" looked also quite exotic for modern views. One word ? it's one of poorest speculations on Arthurian legend I've seen. Sadly I was caught on the bait of the title, but happily didn't spend anything on it save from my time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>historical movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a historian, this movie is a sham. If you want to find the true Arthur, look to history books. If you want a fun sword-fight/slash and dice movie, have fun with this one. It is bloody, with just a touch of romance. The "Guinevere" is scantily clad, and while this would not have been historically accurate, again--this movie is all Hollywood. But it is an interesting diversion.Errors: The time is wrong, Rome left Britain in 410 c.e., no self-respecting Roman would be caught living above the wall, if he did, the blue-painted Picts there would have killed him long before. The Woads were a religious group. The list goes on and on...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood Garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you happen to own Braveheart or the Patriot? Well if you do watch those first before you go spending your money on this movie. Both of these movies have a much better plot as well as much better visuals and fighting sequences. King Arthur is based off of new facts that some dismal writer saw on PBS on lonely night. He took these so called facts that are based on what a team of archeologists and historians glued together from the fallen pieces of the past, and glued together his own weak plot. A plot in which only the names are the same, but the age old story has been changed to protect the innocent. Personally I think that the names should have been changed also. As I shudder to write this, the words of one who has seen evil in the face and lived to tell about it, do not see this movie. Do not be tricked into thinking that this is to be passed off as good. Do not tell Hollywood that this is the garbage that you want them to feed us the public. I want a new story that has a real plot and does not steal action sequences from those of the past. As a matter of fact I am going to cleanse my senses by watching some PBS and the Discovery Channel, to see the real story, that the so called real story of King Arthur was based on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i'm so glad i didn't see this at the cinema, i must say i don't think I'm being too critical in saying that this movie weren't that good. The script wasn't that good, the fight scenes weren't that numerous, and although were creative were done an injustice by not being real enough in my view e.g. show some blood spatter or SOMETHING.Wots more, is the movie seemed to be shrouded in this cloudy...something or other, that didn't much help the effect..also Arthur's accent was just annoying to hear....but i'll try 2 keep the criticisms practical....e.g. i don't see the point of the love scene in there, i think they just threw it in there to spice things up abit..can any woman say they would do it with a legendary stranger they knew next to nothing about? Furthermore, the plot itself seems rather confusing to begin with...it started with Lancelot's slavery..yet went off on one and soon afterwards focused on Arthur's history, now is that an out of order comment or did others see that as well? Generally i think the characters were underdeveloped, that the scope was slightly under-nurtured, and the movie just didn't have enough good points to be worth watching. Any other comments i would be happy 2 hear..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Arthur (2004)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'King Arthur' is by the books, formulaic action/epic for the masses. It is very well produced and executed formulaic action/epic for the masses though. Clive Owen is Arthur, a general fighting for Roman occupied Britain. He too is Roman and wish he too is Roman and wishes to return home. His knights have fought by his side for about 15 years and all want their freedom and no more obligations to Rome. Of course this isn't as easy as they think, and they are ordered on one last mission to rescue some Romans before they can have their issues. As Arthur puts it, this is of course their most dangerous mission yet. So dangerous in fact that they will no doubt succeed, against all odds, bickering between each other, and one of the lesser characters will probably have to sacrifice themselves. Then when it looks like it is all over they will probably stay and fight a big battle for friendship and honour etc. It doesn't take a genius to see where this film is going. The script is a usual action film with new characters. Clive Owen is a very effective Arthur, fantastic as usual and very convincing. His toned down (and in my opinion, more realistic) acting doesn't always go with the other actors techniques, especially Kiara (don't be hypnotised by that mouth) Knightley. The SFX are nothing to hang your jaw low about, but they do often go by unnoticed (always a plus). The film is full of wonderful performances, by actors stuck in poor roles. No character is well developed, the heroine jumps into bed with the hero no questions asked. There is a bit of tension with Lancelot, but that is swept under the rug for the majority of the film. It's nice to see the Arthur legend stripped down to a 'factual' and realistic setting, but with no magic or mystery the film is rather dull. The only scene that really stands out is the fantastic, tense breaking of the ice scene. Where Arthur and his knights stand up against a few hundred Saxons on a frozen lake. Stellen Skarsgard is given a normal evil villain to play, who seems interesting with one line "Finally a man worth killing" but again he is just evil and someone to hate and face off against Arthur. I found myself narrating this film before stuff happened, which takes away from the whole film and makes it slightly comical. For example a secondary character should not go up against the main bad guy, especially when the hero has pledged to kill aforementioned evil doer. And should secondary character have a pet bird he sets free, while he is dyeing, if he should look to the sky, he will see said bird. All very predictable, but some fine action sequences, and a nice build up to the end battle. Despite the films assurance that this is reality and not fantasy, it is unmistakeably Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say I really wasn't reeled in by this movie. It begs to be an epic film, but I just didn't feel that quality in it. I didn't care for the characters, and found most of them generally annoying. The dialogue was awful at times, I almost cringed to hear it. The speeches and conversations about loyalty and honour didn't hold any poignancy or nobility, they came across to me as horrendously cheesy. I can't say much for the acting either. In fact, it was downright appalling in places. The film was also full of action-adventure movie clichés, like all the knights turning their back on the leader only to return and back him up later. Not that I hate this sort of thing, but I've seen it too many times before. It was far too predictable. Throw in a rushed love story between Clive Owen and Keira Knightly and you've got yet another historical movie posing as an epic.The film isn't all bad though, and what is lacked in substance it made up for in cool imagery. Some of the scenery and settings in the film where beautiful, and infused the film with a fantastic atmosphere. The film is dotted with a few good scenes here and there, and there are a few cool effects, it's just a pity that there weren't many, and even if there were I doubt it'd help out the obvious problems with the dialogue and acting.Still, with all the problems I had with this movie, it was still watchable at the very least. If you're looking for a deep and involving film with a good script, don't watch this, but if you're bored on a Sunday afternoon then this is enjoyable enough.</fullReview>

Man her clothes was so ridiculous.Also I find so ridiculous to see a lot of "arrows" send in sky and kill thousand of men. And in very long range.Well make a test and you will see that a bow and arrow don't have a long range to kill somebody.And I find so ridiculous too when I see all these Top Model Girls fight like they are SuperWoman. Wake-Up guys !If you want really see a good movie in this "Time" I suggest you the excellent Excalibur (1981.After that you will know for what I find "King Arthur" so bad. Again I really don't understand we can find people who have money to create a bad movie like that.Put this movie on your black list. Or if you suffer of insomnia well buy it.

		<shortDescription>A missed opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhere there is a good film in here, I just haven't been able to find it. A new spin on an old story, gritty detail and great battles I was all up for it, but it failed to entertain. After a while I could not care for the characters (apart from Lancelot they were all boring and stereotyped), what was going on or why.Even in this ancient world there could have been some laughs. Humour gives characters life and depth, it does that in real life and it does so in any story. This film takes itself to serious for its content and frankly doesn't have the talent to pull that off. The director this time, has no Denzel Washington to keep you glued to the screen. He is able in the battle scenes but forgets the reason why we bought a ticket or the DVD.I hoped for another Gladiator, entertaining, tough and captivating. Alas it didn't turn out that way. I'll turn to the old John Boorman movie "Excalibur", less real and more fantasy. Better actors, More Fun. It's sensual. It makes you forget about time. It keeps your attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vapid and empty. Classic Bruckheimer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerry Bruckheimer's KING ARTHUR is a shining example of the standard Bruckheimer formula played out, nothing more, nothing less. While I will admit that he managed to resist setting the majority of the movie during the orange glow of sunrise or sunset for a change, everything else was true to form. The stars were beautiful, the film's heavy emphasis on style helped the to make its notable lack of substance more palatable, the action scenes were interminable and over-the-top, and not one single thing that happened surprised me one bit. Yea Bruckheimer! Watching King Arthur was like watching Braveheart or Gladiator, but fast-forwarding past all those "boring" scenes where people are just talking. There was no character development, none of these characters were interesting, or relatable in the slightest. And consequently when one's life was in peril, I didn't care in the slightest.The best thing you can say about King Arthur, is that it was just loud, explosive, escapist fun. That is also the best thing you can possibly say about The Rock, Pearl Harbor, Armageddon, Con Air, Top Gun, Gone in 60 Seconds, and so on. So this is what I mean when I say it is the standard Bruckheimer formula played out. Do not bother watching King Arthur. Demand more from your movies than "cool" characters and huge explosions. Bruckheimer films make us all dumber.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lost opportunity,...!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like Jerry Bruckheimer's movies, a lot of action, and have not the foggiest about British history, watch this movie and enjoy it. Speaking as a re-en-actor, living-historian and lover of authentic made movies I do very hard in watching this! Let's begin with it. The first scenes where the Romans conquer the Sarmatians are the same 5 minutes later when the Woads ambush the roman column. The Romans still wear the amour of the old empire about 100 A.D. Romans these days wore mail, and no horsehair helmets and rectangular shields. Btw, Bishop Germanus didn't p..ss off with the Romans, he was one who stood firm against Britons invaders, ts! The woads, (who speak Gaelic) are portrayed quite well, this surprises me. Arthurs Knights fight only with their commander, normally those would have a hundred soldiers under their command. There were not only Sarmatians in Rome's service in Britain, also Saxons, Germans, Francs,... Now, the expression RUS comes from the Swedish Vikings who traveled on the Volga to what is known today as Russia and founded Kiev. The word Rus comes from the Finnish wort "Ruotsi" that means Sweden. But this happened in the 7th and 8th century, what's the messing about in this Arthur Tale??? Now, the Saxons did terrorize both sides of the channel before they set foot in England, but first when the Romans had already gone. And they approached from south not north! The Saxons settled in an area between the Rheine and the Weser an area today between the Netherlands and Holstein. Their Chief Cerdic is good portrayed by Stellan Starsgard but Till Schweiger (his son Cynric) looks like a punk with his blond goatee. The shields the wardrobe guys made are fine so are the standards and some of the helmets. But what the f..ck did the director think by putting crossbows in their hands. The crossbow saw it's birth for military use in wester Europe not before the battle of Hastings in 1066! The church tried to ban it in the middle age cos'it was meant to be a villainous and unchivalrously weapon, but this was almost 900 years after the Artus Saga. Oh dear, the weaponry of our knights is so ridiculous, thank god Excalibur was just a sword and not some magic tool. The composite-bows our knights use are of oriental origin and may carry an arrow some distance further than a simple wooden bow the Saxon uses at the battle scene on the ice, but you can't fire 4 or more arrows and kill an equal number with it. This leads us to the arrow that hits the heart of the traitor Britain hidden 1/2 mile away in a tree, just forget the scene. The love scene between Arthur and Guinevere looks more like a prostitute paying off her debts, all along with quite modern sort of dialog. Ioan Gruffod plays his role like bloodthirsty maniac, what about the nice guy we saw in the Hornblower films? Now I leave the worst to the last, the battle. Mount Badon took place between Bath and London, not Hadrian's Wall!!! It ended with a decisive cavalry charge which routed the Saxons, but honestly I think there were more than the 6 Horses you see in the movie. We just seen 7 Brits slaughtering 200 Saxons on the Ice, now we see 6 Brits and 50 Woads annihilating 2000 Saxons. The shield wall (or skaldborg) they form is a very good scene (thanks to the military advisers who taught the extras the Saxon battle techniques). But why the heck don't they wipe out the riders with one volley of bows and crossbows? Archers were normally behind the shields to darken the sky with their arrows. Then, after the cannonade with the "flaming balls" they counter-charge in loose ranks and we see Keira killing the same guy with Axe and chain mail 4 or 5 times always from a different ankle. The moment when Arthur and Cerdic start to cross blades we still see about 30 Woads and 200 Saxons left in the background, 3 minutes later we see still 25 Woads lest and an entire Saxon army ripped to shreds. Say no more. There is a short but depressing ending on the DVD which I like but of course it was cut out for a cheesy, happy end. One last thing, Woads speak Gealige, Romans English, so why don't the (Bad Boys) Saxons speak German? And didn't the Saxons conquer England during the next century? I am Saxon, I know. Do You?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The historical epic seems to be the genre of choice for Hollywood at the moment. What most of these movies have in common in my opinion is the mighty yawn they induce. While i can certainly appreciate the genre i feel most of these movies are lacking something to make them truly enjoyable. The trend started out well with the pompous but entertaining "Gladiator" and has since reached bottom levels with crap like "Alexander". This however falls somewhere in between.The problem when you make an epic movie is, where does the epic feeling come from? Is it massive battle scenes with thousands of extras? Is it the clichéd dialog full of pompous metaphors and philosophy? Is it the costumes? The music? It's a concept that might be hard to grasp, but still it more or less decides whether a movie such as this one will be successful or not.To me "King Arthur" was a mixed experience. The movie and i got off on the wrong foot with the whole "This is the true story"-statement in the beginning. When it comes to legends and parts of history that we more or less only can make educated guesses about, it always irritates me when people state that they have THE truth. The movie itself is nicely done with nice cinematography and a top-notch overblown adventure score by Hans Zimmer (one of my favorite composers).The main weaknesses are in the script and the direction. The movie has a problem with pacing. Long periods of time more or less nothing happens. When action scenes do happen though they are nicely done, but they are quite few and far between. Clive Owen is a talented actor in my opinion, but his Arthur is a bit too pompous and self-righteous for my taste. Stellan Skarsg?rd on the other hand is almost cartoonish as the antagonist. With more skillful direction these caricatures could have been avoided.In the end this is a more or less forgettable movie. It's not dreadful, slow and inane like Alexander. But it lacks the grandiose and epic feeling that made Gladiator such a feast for the senses. The biggest mistake was probably hiring over-rated Antoine Fuqua to direct, with a more skillful director this could have been more enjoyable. Now it's just entertainment for the moment, nothing to remember but entertaining enough. I rate it 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched King Arthur with a certain amount of trepidation in my heart, having previously read the comments posted on various websites and reviews in magazines etc, knowing it had not been a huge hit with the critics. My fears were sadly confirmed. The dialogue was poor, fight scenes somehow stodgy and Clive Owen's acting very wooden.There was more chemistry between Lancelot and Guinevere than Arthur and the aforementioned woman, and though we all know that they're meant to have a secret affair behind Arthur's back, I couldn't help but cheer her on. Obviouusly, I could see being married to Arthur would be like living with a plank of wood. The movie does have it's upside for all those young teenage girls out there, boasting Ioan Grufford and assorted knights who aren't exactly bad looking.And if you watch the directors cut the fighting does flow better. Overall, it was worth going to see, but I wouldn't watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"King" is perhaps the wrong title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Antoine Fuqua's "King Arthur" aims to be the new definitive Arthurian movie of the MTV-generation crowd, which has a large shadow to emerge from behind - 1981's "Excalibur," anyone? - John Boorman's supreme and (to some), the definitive film about King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.The new vision proudly discards the recent mystical and more prominent history of Arthur and his knights and swaps those qualities with a more realistic, gritty tone and look. Only the title is what remains of Sir Thomas Malory's "Le Morte D'Arthur." In this new film, Arthur (Clive Owen) and the knights are under the services of the imperialistic Rome, which is currently in the middle of a costly conflict with the bloodthirsty Saxons.By film's opening, Arthur, Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), and the Knights of the Round Table are nearing the ends of their mandatory military services with the Roman army. Arthur is now seen as someone who is devout in his faith, on shaky grounds with his knights especially Lancelot, and has no place to call home as his most dutiful exploits are in butchering men on the battlefield.Bishop Germanius (Ivano Marescotti) enlists a reluctant Arthur to go on one last mission, which is to evacuate a small village from the invading Saxons, who are some of the most brutal warriors the Knights of the Round Table may ever go up against.As stated before, this film aspires to be a more "realistic" telling of the Legend. The cinematography is beautiful, giving a true sense of dread and perhaps even capturing a more honest vision of Europe during the medieval period. There is no Camelot (yet) and Guinevere (Keira Knightley) is one tough cookie, hardly needing any man to come to her rescue; also, there is no affair between her and Lancelot that helps lead to the destruction of Camelot.The presentation of the Legend in this respect is interesting to the say to the least, but the problem is that it's not living up to the best it could be. As Roger Ebert pointed out, the events in the film bear such a strong resemblance to current events in Iraq that it actually deters from the realism of the story, much rather than add to it.One of the reasons Boorman's film succeeded is because of its faithfulness to Malory's classic tales. Honestly, this doesn't make Fuqua's film bad, but I really would have preferred if the title of the film was "Arthur and the Knights," since they're not exactly a legend yet and Arthur doesn't become king until the film's ending.On the plus side, this film should win over the massive MTV-generation crowds, who will definitely get buzzed off the vicious battle sequences (which is much more satisfying in the definitive director's extended cut) and a fine-looking Ms. Knightley who sadly doesn't bare it all in the film's one love scene.A valiant effort is "King Arthur," but I still look to "Excalibur" to pacify my love of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen both the PG-13 theatrical version and the more brutal R-rated DVD version. The end battle which should be a highlight of the movie, sadly, is not terribly interesting, plausible, or, from a historical standpoint, sound. (I hate badly executed battle scenes) Luckily, the movie has other, more successful set-pieces, the battle on the frozen lake works very well. Personally I found the cast disappointing. Arthur exuded no leadership charisma whatsoever (but he did give off a rock-solid vibe), and Lancelot came across as whiny and contrary. Kiera Knightly was very pretty (and scantily clad in some scenes), but far from convincing. The lesser characters Bors, Dagonet, and Tristan were much more interesting and memorable. And the Saxon warlord was amazing.I liked the approach the film took to explaining legend with historical speculation. This is the first version that used a 6th century setting rather than the inaccurate late medieval setting that is so common. Costumes and sets were convincing.All in all I liked this. I would have liked this better with a different Arthur. Also, I would have liked to learn more about Merlin. But IMHO this is way more interesting than movies like "Troy" (which still makes me wince whenever I think about it).I own the DVD, but I doubt I'll watch it as often as I've watched "Gladiator".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been a very great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw King Arthur in the "directors cut" DVD version. The cover says "The untold true story that inspired the legend". I have to say the true story is still untold, but never mind. Since this is fiction, the main issue most be: How did the film work from a cinematic point of view?Well, there were some excellent moments, and the story was building up in quite an interesting way. The actors also did a great job, almost all of them (not least my fellow Scandinavians Stellan Skarsg?rd and Mads Mikkelsen). It could have been a great film. Two things spoiled the film for me:1. Guinevere's battle-bikiniThis reminded me of cheap television productions for teenagers. Sure, the history contains examples of female warriors, but they were certainly not skinny little girls in fashion leather-straps.2.The final battle scenes and the ending. Starting very promising, it soon went into a very long and boring close-combat-scene. And of course, the filmmakers could'nt resist the cliché of the final one-to-one encounter, between the leading villain and the hero. And that was pretty much it. A very good story was wasted, and turned into a complete flop, it even had the obligatory concluding 'moral' speech, which have never saved any film.Overall the film reminded me of one of these old Spike Jones tunes, they start off in a very sophisticated way, and at some point it all turns into noise, and every tune ends in pretty much the same way.PS! If you are tired of Americans redefining European history, watch "Four Feathers" - an Indian director redefining a part of Britains history. Quite refreshing! Some day we might even see Indian and Asian directors redefining Americas history - beware :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few good elements come together poorly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay. I've read about 30 other reviews here. The camps seem divided over several issues.Historical accuracy: I, personally, don't give a crap about historical accuracy. I don't care whether composite bows were available, or whether stirrups were developed. I don't care if Arthur is 50 years early in this movie. It doesn't matter to me.Following the Myth: Again, don't care.Just so you know, I am simply telling you how entertaining this film was (or in this case, wasn't).It had some very good elements. I would not say acting was among them. It had some very nice looking backdrops, which on occasion, and particularly at night, seemed painfully obvious as soundstages. Not that important. Okay, somewhere between the acting, direction, and dialog, every main character failed (with the possible exception of the main villain, who was not the normal stereotype, IMO). The movie failed to build any sense of dramatic tension. It seemed more like 'Oh, we're x number of minutes into the movie, insert peril here.' The scoring didn't enhance the emotional impact of the movie.*Spoiler in the following paragraph* The film simply failed in making me CARE about any of the characters. Quenivere is threatened toward the end in combat, and Lancelot charges to her aid, and I just keep thinking 'how did she hold this guy off for so long and Lancelot's getting his butt kicked by him...' when I should have just been thinking 'I hope Lancelot doesn't die' or 'It sure is romantic what Lancelot just did. Ain't unrequited love grand!'None of that. Not in the entire movie. I didn't care about anyone.If you like middle ages combat, and don't get upset watching roman trained knights fighting in nearly oriental style martial arts forms with two scimitars... it might be fun to watch. I got to see traction driblet's in a film, which was kind of neat. That was my big thrill here. The fights are not as well done as Braveheart, Troy, Lord of the Rings, etc., but they're not bad. Someone else mentioned lots of severed limbs and blood, which I am curious about, since the movie was particularly lacking in serious amounts of gore, IMO. I checked this movie out of our local library system for free. I don't feel that 2 hours of my life were stolen from me. If you're that bored, watch this movie. Otherwise, don't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>KING ARTHUR are among the many great pre-historic dramas floating. After the great epic of Gladiator in 2000, that re-united the sword and saddle genre again, movies like The Last Samurai, Troy, Alexander and King Arthur (this), has been big cinema attractions. And KING ARTHUR is probably the most interesting in story; despite the story we all know isn't much of a true story, we here get the true story of Arthur and his knights.Jerry Bruckheimer producing the movie off course just spins of the immediately fact that the action sequences will be impressive. Clive Owen stars as the main character and does a pretty good performance, although he never reaches the heights of Crowe's Maximus.Arthur leading a group of knights, fighting and doing quests for the Romean Empire, although Arthur believes in a much more respectful and beautiful Rome than what in reality it is. Fighting for their rights in many years their final mission finishes and their freedom has been won. But with the Romean withdrawing their promise, telling them that there's one more mission awaiting; Arthur and his men suddenly realises that it's all up to them winning their freedom...It's entertaining, and that's a very good bit in such a huge project! The entertainment, the beautiful photography, the good looking acting and fine directing all smacks together as a big cinema bomb, exploding pretty well too. But with a bit lumpy script and with the movie never doing any too original steps it gets very straight-ahead-epic when we reach halfway threw the movie's running time. Cool gems like having a small battle on un-safe ice in the mountain hills, the great look of Arthur's sailing red coat - it's a lot to look at in other words. Keira Knightley doing well although not being even on the same ground as in Pirates, she simply delivers a nice bit into a very man-dominated movie.A lot of religious speaks, dialog working pretty okay and nice editing too, so - without doubt; there's a lot more to enjoy about KING ARTHUR than to irritate about, and only that is a very nice thing to watch after the very disappointing TROY, that simply failed way too many places. But; KING ARTHUR delivers not too much, it delivers a bit too little actually after what it promises. But, me; having very low expectations, I have happily surprised! STARS: 3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot hole beyond belief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I generally liked this movie the poor script and wooden acting plagued it often. Its best aspects were the sets and art direction, background research into the historical and cultural aspects of the place and time, the cinematography, location shooting and action sequences. The music score was also notable.The sets deserve particular acclaim. Rather than use CG techniques for creating Hadrian's Wall the producers opted to actually build a one kilometer structure, the largest set ever built in Ireland, to lend extra realism to many scenes.That was the good, now for the bad. The plot hinges on the rescue of a nobleman's family, especially his young son who is being groomed for high office in the church. This family's estate is supposedly located north of the Wall and is about to be over-run by an invading army of Saxons. The primary reason for the Wall was to protect Romans on the southern side and keep out the hoards of Picts and other barbarian people (now mainly the Scots) that plagued the Empire's tenuous grip on Britain in the 3rd and 4th centuries A.D. Why an important Roman noble family would choose to or be permitted to live north of the wall and expose themselves to the Pict raids (and require possible rescue from time-to-time by legions stationed at the Wall) is beyond belief give the state of affairs as otherwise presented in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While watching King Arthur I was always feeling that there was something more to the movie than there was. The characters were shallow, I had a hard time even trusting Arthur myself, and was just watching it. The plot didn't make much sense at all, it seems that all it was trying to do was build suspense for battles, but never really expanded on the idea. After watching other movies that where about fighting, I found that this movie was too similar to them to be even considered a movie by itself. Some of the violence seemed too fake to be believable, for some reason the action was not as moving as in other movies. I never really learned much about King Arthur, and was curious if this movie would sufficiently tell the tale. After viewing it, though, I was confused why it was so different to the stories I had heard about King Arthur.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this with a friend having low expectations going in. Well, it was worse.The action was almost mediocre, but mostly ridiculous. The drama was just embarrassing. As I've seen Clive Owen and Keira Knightley doing passable or even good work before this, I don't blame them. And as I really liked training day it's hard to blame Fuquas directors abilities either. The fault probably lies with the horrid script which was bad all over, but at it's worst during dialog.In the end the action scenes were nowhere near good enough to make the unimaginative plot or the flat characters worth watching. And when the dialog scenes between Owen and Knightley started, I was looking for the remote to fast forward the movie... in a theater. Nuff said.</fullReview>

A simplistic treatment that is Gladiator meets Braveheart, except nothing rings true. The only saving grace was that I did not pay for this, watching it on someone else's DVD.

The music was beautiful, the action slightly gorier than I like, but also more accurate. Medieval history is my absolute favorite to study, and I like any glimpse into it, whether it's one hundred percent historically accurate or not. I like the way the love story was only barely touched on. It seems as though every movie since Titanic has felt obligated to throw a love story into it (except "Willard" which I also liked). I also adore the way the druids were shown. Three cheers to the medieval sports bra worn by Gwynevere! All in all, did it have a couple cheesy moments? Yes, so do most good movies. Life is cheesy sometimes. It was well acted, well played, and intensely interesting. I give the movie a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coronation of a Legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Antoine Fuqua's "King Arthur" attempts to trace the origins of the legends of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. The story finds the characters in the wake of the Roman Empire. Arthur (Clive Owen) is a Roman/Briton centurion, Guinevere (Keira Knightley) is a Celtic warrior princess, Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd) and the other knights are Sarmatian mercenaries. It's a fascinating look at how the stories might have come to be. Personally, I've always believed that all mythology has some basis in historical fact. Here, the pristine, chivalrous images of old are stripped away to expose the gory origins. Guinevere tells Arthur, "We are not the polite people who live in poems," a quote that fits the concept of this story. Let "King Arthur" be a lesson in the evolution of popular legend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The new take on the story of Arthur and his knights was one interesting aspect of the film. The period of Roman and Saxon conflict is very intriguing. However if you like films with character and story development, do not attempt to watch this one. Stick to the classics like Camelot. The music and scenery were beautiful, but as far as the acting goes (or over-acting rather) the only word that comes to my mind is CORNY. In my opinion, it was much better than the 'First Knight' stab at the Arthurian legend, but it could have been so much better. A noble attempt by Antoine Fuqua, but my advice to him would be to stick to what he's good at. Present day movies like 'Training Day'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Rated version)I consider myself a huge fan of Arthurian legend, but do not pretend to be an expert concerning it. I have read many renditions of the tale and was fascinated, not turned off by this film's take concerning the earlier time frame and Roman connotation. In fact, that intrigued me more than normal. The issue I have with this film are the story and characters, two things that are slightly important. The story is not very intriguing once you get past the initial groundwork. We have a flashback to when Lancelot is a child and then we see a final battle preparation before their freedom....OK. The characters are so shallow that you do not even feel for them when some die. You know nothing about them or what has made them who they are. The fact that Arthur and Guenevere are even attracted to each other is puzzling too, based on their experiences together. Pathetic. I felt no interest in the characters, no connection to them, nor do I feel drawn into the story. It is shallow, pale, and uninteresting, and as I said, I am a big Arthurian fan. I was very disappointed.</fullReview>

I think King Arthur is a great movie and it gives a different light on how the story of King Arthur has been shown in the past movies. I think Clive Owen is an awesome King Arthur. I like how it shows the invasion of the Saxons and also shows how the Romans ruled outside and withing the Roman Empire. This movie also shows how people believe so hard and entirely in the Roman Catholic Church. This movie show how people looked down on others with different religious beliefs;how people (Surfs) were punished for their different views and beliefs, which in our time is not so frowned upon.This movie is great!.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was certainly strange to see characters such as Arthur and Guinevere who have for years have had a set image, all of a sudden changed dramatically. Well perhaps it would be slightly unfair for me to comment considering that I have yet to read up on this supposed alternate version of Arthur. Even so it was a little hard to imagine Clive Owen as Arthur, Stephen Dillane as Merlin and Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot. Plus I did not like the way their actors progressed throughout the film.Despite this film being promoted as a high action fast paced film, this was anything but that. There were a lot of parts that were dragging and was just plain old boring. To top it all was the truly anti-climactic and rather predictable ending to the film. I guess you could have guessed that it would end up the way it did considering there wasn't much of a build-up to the film's climax. Everything about this film was just ordinary. From the cast, to the action scenes to the ending it was just a very big mess</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than Victorian Romanticism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed watching such an alternative portrayal of Arthur, having been fed Victorian Romanticism since as far back as I can remember, as in many ways realised in the Disney adaptation.Interesting that Arthur and his his knights were wholly or partially Sarmatian, from a country today known as the Ukraine. Although Ioan Gruffudd Lancelot was rather more convincing than Tony Curtis's Taras Bulba, another historic Ukrainian. Giving "Arthur's Sarmatian Knights" as they're referred to in the film, varied and different British regional accents was an interesting notion, which worked. The weak point was Clive Owen's Arthur - not strong enough in terms of charisma. Indeed, Gruffudd would have been a better choice for Arthur. Guinevere was superbly portrayed and far more interesting as a Pictish warrior.All in all, a valiant attempt on the quest to seek truth in history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted so much to love this film. I've always enjoyed looking at the roots of myths, and a "back to the source of the myths" Arthur sounded fascinating. The good news is that the film is gorgeous: the settings, the cinematography, and the charismatic cast. I liked the performances (that some here have panned) and the battle scenes were terrific.Unfortunately, there was just so much of the film that I can't get past. I can (and do--no film is ever *completely* historically accurate) suspend my disbelief a great deal; I can look over a fair amount of changes for the sake of what will play well on film. I even get that Arthur is a myth anyway so how can we know the "truth". But having postulated at the beginning of the movie that this is the truth about Arthur they go on to make a movie that isn't even an interesting speculation. They could have made a very good movie that didn't involve the (ridiculously evilly portrayed) Saxons invading at Hadrian's wall (why didn't they just sail south and attack on the other side, cause, you know, the Saxon's came on boats), anachronistic weapons (the fights can be just as cool), half-naked women (hey cool, they made Guinevere a warrior--then they took all her clothes off, cause women never wear armor like the guys do), and a slew of other stupidities (why would a wealthy Roman live up in the wilds miles north of Hadrian's wall, anyway?)This was not a terrible movie, and if you can stand these sorts of inaccuracies and stupidities, you may enjoy this very much for the battles. I can only give it a five, myself.</fullReview>

I DO NOT recommend this movie to anyone who has a remote interest in seeing the legend brought to the screen. Other than the names, some of the places, and the stupid SWORD, the closest Arturius and his knights get to Camelot is that their carpenter had some revolutionary ideas about geometry.Ending on a positive note- King Arthur succeeds on the level it is competing on.

		<shortDescription>Believable but a bit Lifeless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film believable and the events could have actually happened but it was also lifeless. Its a far cry from Magic wizards and knights in highly polished armour living in the princess castle. There were moments in the film that i found Good like the scene on the Iced up Lake and the Final Battle. I'm not big action fan but these were quite atmospheric. This is something that Bruckheimer does quite well, what Bruckheimer also usually does well is character building and in this film he and Fuqua kind of fail. I felt no emotional attachment to any of the knights although I wanted too. Arthur was a bit lifeless although his motives were good and you felt an emotional attachment to them but not him. I liked Bors ( Ray Winstone ) and found his character the most interesting but we found out more about him ( he had a wife and kids e.t.c ) He also had character. There was the knight who was good with the knives who i found interesting near the end but knew little about him and he hardly said much. Guinavere was a cool character but should have been played by someone else, I like Kiera Knightly but she is far too skinny and wimpy to play the role of this version of Guinevere she would have been more suited to the other version of Guinevere. Having said that she did the best job that i think she could have done. On to Lancelot was he actually in the film, well not that you would have noticed much. Again his character was not really introduced or explored, as far as i'm concerned he was just another of the knights. The other thing i found confusing was the overwhelming ambition of the knights to get back home after they're service to Rome was fulfilled. After 20 odd years of living in Britain and even settling there why would they feel the need to go back home to a place that they left when they were boys. It must have been the weather. I think Bruckheimer has gone for a different approach to the film and tried to make things a bit more real and a bit more dark and dingy to make his effort stand out from previous incarnations of the tale. It might have worked a bit better if we could have got to know the characters a bit better. Story - Interesting but not gripping you already know most of the story anyway and slightly un-entertaining. The middle section of the film is a little morose and long winded. Acting - Not Bad could have been better if they had more to go with. I think Clive Owen was told to be as uninteresting as possible. Set and Location - Ye Olde England, was dark and dismal in most parts just like the real thing Overall - 5 I found it slightly interesting and atmospheric but un-entertaining, unemotional and a bit drab.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What kind of individual inspires a legend? The conclusion from "King Arthur" seems to be: one who disguises lack of charisma with smoldering glances. More importantly, what it is about Jerry Bruckheimer-produced movies that dulls any attempt at sharp characterization? While Johnny Depp in "Pirates of the Caribbean" was one rare exception, Clive Owen is rendered virtually anonymous in the title role. Other principal characters fare no better. Here is a movie that gives its characters not much more than perfunctorily distinctive fighting styles to set them apart from one another.The movie-makers also eshew the fantasy aspects of the "sword in the stone" and "Merlin's sorcery" and try to play up historical accuracy; what is left, however, fails to convey the advertised "untold true story" in any compelling manner. As a salute to accuracy, the battles do look gritty enough (with the "unrated" version apparently restoring all its bloody glory) -- and the movie musters up one exciting battle scene on ice -- but the movie rewards no one searching for a point about the man and the myth. All that remains is a movie that neither informs nor entertains, but is not jaw-droppingly bad enough to be memorable. "King Arthur" falls on its own sword: it is easily forgotten and ironically destined to become an arcane historical footnote in an obscure film encyclopedia.Final note: Why make a big deal about making a female character strong, if ultimately she is just going to fall back on needing a man's protection? And what is with the female battle outfit? Do only "naughty bits" need protecting? Keira Knightly looks undeniably sexy, but there is no feminist gain here.</fullReview>

Exactly what made them think "King Arthur" would be any different? But I cannot be entirely negative about this movie. Lancelot and a few of the other knights are some bad dudes that I would not want to mess with. The battle that occurs on the frozen lake is also probably one of my favorite scenes.

This aside it is an enjoyable enough piece of hokum and it definitely beats standing at a bus stop in the rain as a way to while away couple of hours. The biggest shock came with the portrayal of Guinevere as an English public school girl although I did notice that blue face paint suits ms Knightly.

I knew I didn't want to see it when I saw a Making Of with little Keira running around in the snow half naked. I'm just glad I didn't pay for it. First, let us not confuse pretty pictures of pretty men with good film making. And let's not pretend that there was anything at all historical about this movie. The Riders of Rohan were more Saxony than the Saxons in this movie, and why did that one kid in the Roman villa have an Italian accent? No one else did. And throwing a round table in a hall doesn't make this tale Arthurian. But that's picking nits. I am a fan of both Hans Zimmer and Ray Winstone, and they both seemed to realize there was no reason to produce anything new for this film. All that aside, I did enjoy the pretty pictures, and I was amused that Bruckheimer found a way to almost make explosions in 500 A.D., but the big question remains: Was there a plot? Was there a purpose? Ever since William Wallace rode in front of a battle line and shouted freedom, we've had this idea that that's what people fight for. It isn't. People fight for land so they can feed their family. Ideals are a luxury. I could tell that Arthur was conflicted about something, but I was never sure what is was. In the last battle, I made the remark, Someone's got to die. It will be unrealistic if all the "knights" make it through this. And my daughter said You're worrying about realism now? I thought that pretty much summed it up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor interpretation of the historical Arthur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst I have to admit that seeing Kiera Knightly in small amounts of clothing is nothing to sneeze at, the simple fact is that this movie is little more than a typical Bruckheimer eye-candy actioner. There is little here that is fact.It is true that it is closer than the mythical Morte d'Arthur-style of movies we have seen in the past, but it is so full of innaccuracies, while touting itself as the "real" story, that I was very disappointed.Fact: There are various references to the real Arthur, and they actually did get his name right- Arturius Castus.Fact: 462 A.D. is the accepted time of his life.Fact: He was a Roman and did command in Britian around this time.That's about it. The movie really offered little else. I think the problem was with the director. Mr. Fuqua has directed some wonderful movies. Unfortunately, his preachy-style of storytelling ill-fits this genre. Frankly, one could have merged Ridley Scott's "Gladiator" with Mr. Fuqua's "Tears of the Sun" and seen this movie. Arthur was not a commander with a troubled conscience. He was basically a barbarian, and the men who followed him did so because he was more bloodthirsty then they, and he won the battles. The concept that a Pict Guinevere could appeal to his sense of being, and then seduce him is frankly, ludicrous. He would have taken her at his will and at his whim. They were both little more than savages in a savage land living in a savage time, and the thought that the moral sense of righteousness would make Arthur choose the correct path is plain silly.Yet, this is the type of movie that Fuqua excels at. "Tears of the Sun" was the epitome of that style for him. But to take modern-day morals and apply them to people who live 16 centuries ago is at best, banal. Arthur would not place the needs or wants of his knights ahead of the objective. Nor would any commander of the time heed the Roman dictum to go on one last mission. Once the agreement was broken, he would have killed the Bishop and assumed command of all around him. He would not be swayed by the preachings of a young girl: He would have slit her throat and left her in a ditch.And in essence, this is what the real Arturius did. He was never a king, simply a warlord. Actually, Stellan Skarsg?rd's portrayal of Cerdic was more to the actual Arthur than Clive Owen's.The knights were the best thing. They depicted the basic, raw warrior of the time. Ms. Knightley, while lovely, was all wrong for the part. Too small, too beautiful, did they actually think we would believe that she could be a veteran of so many battles without a single blemish when the knights were all a-scarred? Lastly, the "look" of the movie. Hadrian's Wall was not the tall, stately, crennelated monolith as depicted. It still exists today, and was a 4 to 6 foot stone wall. There were no Roman-style buildings: in fact, Arthur's fortifications at best would have had wooden buildings. He was a nomadic warrior: little time for impressive edifices in his life.So, all-in-all a decent popcorn movie, but one that was poorly researched, poorly directed, and another depiction of what Bruckheimer Hollywood believes the real world is like.2 1/2 stars</fullReview>

I loved how each character had a different "talent". I also loved how the story was written to show a different light of how we have always perceived King Arthur. They actually made it into a believable existence, showing how people can embellish stories, yet there still can be a grain of truth to it. They also did a superb job on the role of Lancelot, they have always made you feel like it was OK when Lancelot cheated with Gunivere since they were in love. Yet in this version they show Lancelot to be more gritty and not so nice(sorry Ioan if you ever read this), yet this still made this more believable. Also if you were a Gladiator fan you would love the fight scenes in this movie. I can wait to see more movies from this director and producer pair...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty good take on the King Arthur legend.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit I wanted to watch this DVD to drool over Clive Owen but also found that it was quite an entertaining and well-made film. I have always enjoyed the King Arthur legend and its many incarnations (see the MISTS OF AVALON for yet another excellent retelling) so have not been one to slavishly stick to any one version. I love that this film grounded the characters in reality. Merlin's character made more sense and for a change (Spoiler Alert?) I was glad Arthur got the girl in the end. I also think the performances were very good. Knightly doesn't really have much acting to do so I have no problem with her other than the fact she was so young. There seems to be a trend lately for the leading lady to be the leading teenager matched up with older men on screen -- I mean c'mon boys in Hollywood, there are a lot of actresses between 20 and 30 who could have played this part, why choose the flavor of the month? But I digress. I am baffled by the criticisms of Clive Owen's acting -- I don't know what you wanted from him but this was a rather tortured Arthur, dealing with loyalty to his men vs. loyalty to Rome -- you could hardly expect him to be laughing it up. Owen is a terrific actor and I thought he was quite up to the part of Arthur. I also thought the director did a great job of casting the knights, each one was interesting to watch. Of course Lancelot was pretty good looking as he had to be, but he also was a very good actor. The story moved along quite nicely for me as well. There were a few things I could pick on, most of which were dialog related. I didn't feel it was necessary at the beginning of the last battle scene for Arthur, in full armor, to make that speech to his knights. It's not like there was a battalion or legions of troops to psyche up before the battle. They knew what was going to happen and were ready. A case where no words were necessary, in my humble opinion. The ending everyone's debating... I have no real problems with it, and frankly I would have accepted either ending. Except for the little boy with the sword -- I agree with comments that it was cheesy. Overall I would watch this film again, which is my litmus test for how much I liked the film. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different view of the Arhturian legends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this last night as it was a new release and I didn't get to catch it in the theaters and was a tad unsure of seeing it due to the negative comments about the movie here and in reviews elsewhere. I was pleasantly surprised to find the movie was nothing at all like the negative reviews I've read and enjoyed the movie quite a bit. It's not Excalibur nor does it intend to be, instead this version is more about where the legends come from, the man who becomes king, Arthur.If you've ever wanted to know more about Arthur in a 'historic' sense, this is the movie for you. Very good battle sequences, a gritty feel to the movie that captures the time period fairly well and a solid job by the cast overall. People can nit pick this thing to death but if you want a fantasy movie, see the incredible Lord of the Rings. If you want a more historic feel to this legend, check this movie out. A definitely solid rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi, guys! Is there a way to find out what is the name/singer/recording of the song performed right after the knights receive their last order? They are gathered in the yard and Bors asks one of his wives to sing. She does and the song is partially heard. I find it absolutely charming and it's a pity that it was not included on the soundtrack CD. That would have been the only reason for me to buy it. It goes something like "We will go home, we will go home. We will go home across the mountain" or something like that. Please, any help is appreciated. the same thing happened to me with another movie "Serendipity" There is a Celtic piece played in a commercial or short video that is absolutely fantastic but, it was not included in the soundtrack.

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, at best. I gave it one star, on a scale of zero to four.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most, or at least many, people seem to like the movie because it's fresh, and puts a new twist on an old legend, and is believable. I say, everyone knows and loves King Arthur as he is, there is no need to change it. And when I think of King Arthur, I think of powerful wizards and magic swords. Arthur is surrounded in unbelievable, but endearing, legend. When anyone who knows and loves the legend of King Arthur and his knights - and let's face it, you don't title the movie "King Arthur" if you're not trying to appeal to those people - hears the name, they think of Camelot, and of the round table, and of Excalibur and Merlin. With the legend so well known, expectations are bound to be high. If this movie were original, it may have received a better score. But because it's a classic, this version really fails to deliver. It's really more of a prequel to the legend, anyway, and one which doesn't seem to follow previous tales. King Arthur is not introduced as a magnificent king or leader. He's nothing more than an indentured servant to Rome, just beginning his sentence of fifteen years. This is when we meet Arthur. A poorly done fast forward (blank screen, straight to "Fifteen Years Later") brings us to the present. For the last fifteen years, Arthur and his knights have been charged with defending the Roman-conquered lands in Northern Britain. Arthur and his knights are still servants of the Romans, and he only has six knights. But, it is at this time he and his knights are supposed to be granted their freedom. Before they can have it, though, there is one last mission. Instead of defending his men and making Rome honor is pact, Arthur submissively accepts the mission. Along the way, they pick up Kiera Knightley, but we'll deal with why her performance was disappointing later. Finally, they return home, mission completed, they're free. Only, the Saxons are now attacking. Throughout the course of the movie, Arthur's identity has been in question. He is a Brit-born, but served the Romans, and believes in Rome. He makes a decision at this point to stop believing in Rome, because he finds out the Rome he believed in does not exist. He will stay and defend Britain, and stay a free man. His brave knights join him. They fight, and with the help of Merlin and his army, they win, and Britain, in the matter of half an hour, is a free land! However, Lancelot, the most famous of Arthur's knights, is dead. And, while it's entirely possible I have my legends confused, wasn't Lancelot married to Guinevere (Kiera Knightley)? Because in this version, the final scene is Arthur and Guinevere getting married. This film took a fantastic legend, and managed to change so many widely accepted, and loved, facts and change them, that the original story is lost. King Arthur should be epic, because it's an epic story. This film attempted to be epic by using special effects and having one of the hottest young actresses on its cover, instead of relying on the story, like it should have. Conclusion: King Arthur is a famous and beloved fairy tale. Its lore is widely known, and accepted. So when you want to make a movie about King Arthur, don't try to fix it, it's not broken. I'm a big Kiera Knightley fan. She's young, but has great potential. I've had the pleasure of seeing Clive Owen in this and "Closer." From what I've seen, I love his acting. And he even managed to portray this version of Arthur very well, a feat that is not easy, considering the material he was working with. Clive gets three stars for his role. Kiera was, as previously stated, was disappointing, and might get as much as one and a half stars, no more. King Arthur inspires images of grandeur, of Excalibur, of Merlin and his magic, of castles with round tables, of Arthur's valiant knights and their brave deeds, of a land of fairy tale that we can dream of. There was no need to try to change its perception, and to do so was a mistake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can you screw this up?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one thing that amazed me about this movie is when you have such wonderful material to pull from how do you make such a terrible movie. According to this movie Arthur and the remaining knights of the round table are from a land just north of modern day Turkey and are "knights" for the Roman Empire. Someone should have let the director/writer/everyone involved that the land they reference well... WHAT ON EARTH IS A SUMATRAN? (having flashes of Riddick here) and that the Roman Empire DID NOT HAVE KNIGHTS. The Christianity tilt of the movie was interesting but if you are looking for the story of Arthur and or the story of the knights of the round table PLEASE do not look to this movie. The fight scenes were good but they were the entire movie. The actors who play the knights do not have enough screen time where they are not fighting for you to develop any connection to them and several people I saw this with still were still not sure who was who in the final scenes. Overall if this movie would have been titled "Historically inaccurate Dark Ages movie with no substance and a lot of fight scenes" it would have at least had the advantage of honesty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another Arthur film wasting both my time and money...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since the success of "Gladiator", Hollywood has decided to flood the movie market with many sword and sorcery films. Granted, I applaud this move, as I have been a fan of "Dungeons and Dragons" as long as I can remember, and many times, Hollywood succeeds. With the retelling of "King Arthur" however, Hollywood has failed.This is the story of Arthur before he became King. We follow him as a member of the Roman Empire, to his meetings with both Guinevere and Merlin. The story does show excellent battle sequences, much in the same vein as "Gladiator" and the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, however, the story lacks much. There also seems to be an over emphasis on Christianity in this film. I do not see this as a bad mark, as I am a Christian, however, some of this may seem too much for some audience members in our politically correct modern world. Also, the story that all of us grew up with, has dramatically changed here. Seriously, correct me if I am wrong, but I do not ever remember Arthur being a part of the Roman Empire.Overall, not a very memorable experience. Very slow paced in many areas, even though the battle scenes are incredible. However, movie makers should realize that it is story, not special effects, that make a movie brilliant. I am just glad that I rented this film, and not purchased it as was planned.Anyone that wants to see a film based on King Arthur, I would recommend "Excalibur", which is more based on the legend as we remember it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching the movie tonight and I was disgusted. I understand the point of this movie was to give the whole King Arthur story a more realistic perspective, but they didn't have to butcher the flick. Lancelot was french, and I'm pretty sure Arthur wasn't half roman. At the time of Arthur, the Roman Empire had already fallen or at least was on its way, and its reach had pulled back from England. Also, according to this movie, Guinevere never had the chance to cheat on Arthur with Lancelot. Another thing that angered me and my father off (theres a lot of these) is how the heck did the Saxons (French/Germans basically) get north of the wall and move south? Why not just punch up the Brits behind from the south? The scenes where the Wodes (Northerners) were talking in their language (Gaelic? Latin?) was badly done, no one had accents. Ah, and Guinevere wasn't a warrior, i'm sorry, but no, she wasn't. Besides the historical inaccuracies, the acting was badly done, as with the script. I knew this from the start when Lancelot was being hauled away and his village did that weak little 'battle cry'. That was kinda uncalled for. Way too bloody, half the time it looked like they were just throwing cups of blood in front of the camera. I understand that those were bloody weapons in bloody times, but come on. You cant spray a bucket of blood in the air via decapitation. (That would be with Arthur decapitated the kneeling soldier with his swords crossed, just by pushing forward)Besides all the bad stuff, the action scenes were somewhat fun to watch, but I'd take Braveheart any day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly now, is there not more to the history of Britain than this 'King Arthur' myth ? When it comes to action, well I must admit, that this is a 'capital one' : plenty of 5th century battle, mixed with second century Roman Legionaries, and according to the 'archeological evidence', as mentioned in the opening credits, 9th century Saren horsemen who have made there way clear up to Hadraians wall. (For those of you who haven't yet studied the arcana of the Russian steppes,Sarens, Alans, and Huns were among the ancient nomadic horse people who settled in south central Europe, and south western Russka) Aside from some historical oddities, there are some linguistic oddities, like those (angelo?) villagers who spoke like they just walked off the streets of Liverpool, and Romans who spoke with Italian accents! (What gaul?) I don't mean to discourage any one from seeing this; it's good fun The violence isn't too bad, and (ironicly) there is a complete absence of any Angelo-saxon four letter words.King Arthur has served as mythical entertainment for centuries, and this film capitalizes, once more, on the myth.</fullReview>

When it comes to directing the fight scenes he's OK but in the dialogues his poor cast is left with nothing so they just do what ever they think is good. I've seen the actors in previous movies so I know they can act -but not in this movie! The moment the dialogues begin, it starts to get sentimental. And it should be interesting and exiting! I wondered why -till I saw the interview with Fuqua: a safe and 'happy' ending was created because the audience would like to leave the theater happy and not sad. Wow. What a great director F. is: not only wants to direct films but audiences as well... And so the ending is predictable, boring, uninteresting and played like a soap opera! Please Mr. Fuqua: go to a lovely Caribbean island and grow cucumbers (or something like that) and do not ever make an other movie! You had gold in your hands and you turned it in something cheap.

If you didn't realize this movie concept was about a new theory that was buzzing around, at how the King Arthur legend stemmed from. If you didn't notice it had no magic what so ever, Merlin was just a wise old man. The story was set much later then most Arthur stories (the Roman Empire was already huge), and that lady Guinevere wasn't so dainty. It is more realistic. So to those who thought this was just a Hollywood backwash of a movie, it isn't. This new theory could be true. So technically this movie could be historically sound =D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gladiator Rehashed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Arthur, a well known legend, well loved by many people, apparently was a real Roman/ Britan. In the tail end of the Roman Empire he was an honorable soldier and commander to a bunch of 'knights' on the British Isle. These 'knights' were not really part of the Roman Empire, but were forced to serve for fifteen years as soldiers for it because of a truce made by their ruler.This is all fine and dandy until the Romans, who are besieged on all sides at this point in History, decide to abandon Britain to the Woads and the Saxons, who are invading from the north. Good, history so far is not quite out of joint. Only there's a problem, actually many, the first noticeable glitch in this Legend without the myth backing it up is the noble ideals which Arthur is fighting for sound an awful lot like the ones Maximus espoused in Gladiator. Only in this movie there's really no one there for Arthur to fight against. The Woads care a lot more for having their land back and the Saxon's are really there for the pillaging. What's a man with a plan to do? Pretend the Saxons are the real bad guys and stay on and fight. Because he's such a wonderful commander Arthur manages to keep his seven men with him too and they stay to fight. Great. Unfortunately without the myth to give the idea of this movie a backbone it seems to wallow in battle scenes and little else. Lancelot and Arthur give each other meaningful glances and Guinevere sort of gives Arthur his point, but not the movie. They wanted to make a movie about King Arthur and remove the magical aspect of the myth and instead forge a new one out of interestingly made up history. They missed, and the one thing that I truly regret is the lack of research. This movie could have worked had someone in the production looked into weaponry and name meanings. If Arthurs knights were supposed to come from all the same place, what are they doing with such diverse names from all over Europe. They want to remove the Legend, then change the names to make them more characteristic of the age at least. Lastly, it would have made more sense if there were a story to go with the idea, plot's would have been good too. The next time someone decides to do this to a legend they better figure out why before going ahead and writing it. Looking for a good flick with ideals? Watch Gladiator.</fullReview>

She was a dark ages wife! No shot at the feminists, but for the time and place and the character is was based on, Keira Knightly was just playing to an audience of horny little boys and goofus little girls!! Also, the idea of why he fought for england, didn't make sense, there was no justice or real duty like that of the Arthur legend, he was just antsy in his damn pantsy!

They played on everything to make it cinema friendly, they beat up condemning Christians(which I have no prob with, even as one as fundamentalists make my beliefs look bad dammit!), the man fought for the woman, and there was no true adultery, like there was in damn legend!!!!

		<shortDescription>Troy was much better, this was average at best. The directors cut was better though.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a let down mainly because of my expectations of how they would interpret history, the narrative, and camera work.At the theatres I just didn't find the movie engaging. The pace was a mediocre speed. And the final battle scene was just so darn confusing because because both the Sarmatian Knights and the Saxons looked so similar.While Troy was different to the Illiad the story of the Trojan War had been told long before Homer, different versions have been told over time (before and after Homer) but the basic narrative remains. the legend of King Arthur is like this, with different versions but the same basic plot. Trot stuck to the legend but made some minor alterations (as has always been done). But this was putting the King Arthur legend into historical perspective. And due to my understanding of the legend and history I had expected something different.From the myth, and documentaries I had often assumed that "King Arthur" was a Celtic warlord, Roman educated, and possibly Christian. I also assumed the "King" would be independent, and based in southern Britain as many of the location in the myth are in or based on locations in southern Britain Salisbury, Tintagel, and Camelot (based on a Roman centre Camulos). I had heard that the knights of the round table would have been minor warlords and chieftains, with Arthur as the leader of an alliance. As for the Roman withdrawal it took place around 410 AD, this has it much better. And I had never imagined that the knights of the round table were in fact Central Asian. I would certainly be interested in what archaeological evidence, and historical records the film makers used. Due to my expectation I found the film a let down.However I could sit through and watch this at the cinema, the characters were all right (although Clive Owens tough boy attitude annoyed me a bit) and I've seen much worse movies.The director's cut was better, the extra scenes gave the story a better flow and the final battle scene was more clear (but I guess it helped that I had seen it before).In the end a disappointment but not the worst film. I wouldn't race out to see it again.</fullReview>

Storywise, there isn't much of anything to speak of. I did appreciate Stellan Skarsgard's bold characterization. The actors are appropriately cast for their roles, but do not exceed audience expectations. The action scenes are almost Hollywood-standard these days, and it's refreshing to finally see a film that isn't overt CGI... but that doesn't make it interesting.If you love action and medievial combat, you'll love this film. If you have a decent home theater and a couple hours to blow, you may want to check it out. But if you're looking for an Arthurian saga with more heart and subtext, check out "Excalibur". This film is definitely for the PG-13 crowd, even though the cut is rated R.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Heroic Age is truly over...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a complete absence of epic scale, this film is right about one thing - it is not legendary in any way. Clive Owen gives the most mind-numbingly uncharismatic rendition of King Arthur i've ever seen - his monotone would better suit a bit-part in Eastenders rather than the greatest British hero of all time. This is the fellow who supposedly united the tribes of England into one nation! Even Nigel Terry gave a better performance, but also partly because the script to Excalibur towers over the rubbish the actors come out with in 'King Arthur'. The battles were interesting, and I felt Bors and Lancelot gave the piece a lift, but as for the depiction of one of the most tragic love stories in literature - I found myself reaching for the matchsticks. But the worst thing about this film is summed up by the writer and producer themselves. Bruckheimer says, "King Arthur is the definitive story of the leader and warrior who emerged to lead the Brittons against the Saxons.". Franzoni says "The truth is that King Arthur lived in a much earlier time. There's a moment in history that we can actually pin down." This is the type of 'Faction' that should have some sort of intellectual warning on it - It is utter nonsense. Arthur very probably was born in an earlier time, but that time was most likely around 490 AD. Since the Roman army left Britain in 410 AD, Arthur and his 'Roman' knights would have had to hang around a while before the battle of Badon (518 AD). Also, if there is any truth at all in the idea that Arthur fought against the Saxons at this battle, he would have to have been the king of Powys, and therefore of strong Welsh blood, and most definitely not Roman, adopted or otherwise. My advice: see this film with a group of friends on DVD, so you can talk or forward over the dialogue, and just watch the battles. If you know anything of history, leave those ideas at the door. 4/10 Historically inaccurate, poorly written, directed, and produced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though this movie is far from being historically accurate at least it attempts to give an accurate portrayal of the times rather than going with the myth surrounding king Authur. Particularly in the area of religion I applaud the directors for making King Authur somewhat anti-papal. He was in fact a defender of the Celtic church (a more ancient form of Christianity) against the Vatican. So often myth makes all early Christian heroes to be papists when they were not. (e.g. St Patrick of Ireland, who was undoubtedly a great Irish hero and patriot, but was neither Roman, Catholic or Irish, and fiercely defended the ancient Celtic church in Ireland against the inroads of Catholocism.) It seems that any great hero of the past has automatically been claimed by the Vatican and either made into a myth or a saint in order to cover over the abuses of the church at that time.This movie makes a few mistakes for sure (example: the castle was a crusader style castle rather than early Celtish) and as far as the story line and characters go, who knows if any of that is based on truth, myth is the only source here. At least these guys tried to be more historical than the just the myth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Great Ice Battle Does Not A Movie Make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love big action battle movies set in the past. And I love the whole King Arthur myth. So I should have enjoyed this film. But I didn't. Antoine Fuqua, bless him, is clearly not up to making a movie of this size. There is a lack of scale, import, excitement and personality about the film. Fuqua seems unable to bring big performances out of his actors, and the whole thing starts to unfold more like some cheesy day time soap opera than a big screen epic. The strange premise of blending a medieval sensibility onto a Roman Britain sits uncomfortably. This is another in a long line of theories of who Arthur actually was, and all are welcome to add to the Arthur mythology - but this, despite claims otherwise, is not based on hard research. Do not feel you are getting anywhere near the real Arthur with this story. This is mostly a dull and tedious movie though it does contain one very imaginative battle on the ice. It's a shame the quality of the rest of this film is so poor it will drag that sequence under with it. The ice battle deserves to be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather unusual view of one legend...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not being personally involved in worshiping the cult of Arthur, watching this movie is a brilliant history lesson. Who says this can't be the truth version of what really happened? It is neither a dull romance about the 'old' Arthur that stands Lancelot and Guinevere in their way, like in the First Knight, nor is it a fighting and full-of-blood horror like Braveheart. I can't say what is meant by this movie because I didn't make it- I can only say that to me it is about the conflict of feelings and desires. Arthur is balancing on the edge between Rome and Britain, between the responsibility to his duty and the responsibility to his knights. The film is not judging and more than anywhere else, the characters are here to create a complete image of the medieval times and medieval Britain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>history has now shown that arthur most likely existed, but not which of several men spanning the centuries, could be... some even think he might have been an amalgamation of several.although this movie takes names from the legends, the story for the most part is original. you will find merlin, galahad, gwain, lancelot, and guinevere, but not as some mythical untouchable figures... they are more human than in any other arthurian telling i have seen to date.this story although using the names added by authors such as Sir Thomas Mallory,(1100 -1500's long after the true arthurs were in existence) is based upon an amalgamation of the REAL men who might have made the basis for the legend. After all, when making a movie about what arthur might have been really like and only knowing his name... might as well use the ones that are already known.i was disappointed in seeing the flse characters of the legend like lancelot and guinevere, but since they did not put that romantic tripe in it with her cheating.. i was much happier. i really would have preferred no guinevere at all.despite some strange things.. like a villa north of a wall that clearly hadn't been opened in a long time, a melding of historical events, and the mountains appearing.. i actually loved this movie.the death of lancelot and tristian, for me at least, were sadly fitting. the battles were exciting and brutal, though some of the dialog was lacking.. the acting was excellent.i will be buying this one to place next to my merlin, Excalibur, and first knight dvds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice battles, pity about the script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first movie to come out trying to use the formula that worked so well for Peter Jackson in LOTR. Big battles, mythical warriors, giving life to the unbelievable. The problem is that the script is not good at all. The movie started in an interested manner; I was impressed with the early stages and the attempts to bring life to the character of King Arthur ? a mythical figure that has suffered from over-exposure. However, after the first half hour I realized that we were in for another load of Bruckheimer schmaltz. The movie suffered from painful dialogue and a large dose of bad acting, saved only by the excellent Ioan Gruffudd in the role of Lancelot. Bruckheimer should have learnt from his mistakes in Pearl Harbor, where he tried to reproduce the winning formula of Titanic to disastrous effect. His only redeeming feature is Pirates of the Caribbean, which was saved by Johnny Depp's marvelous performance more than any of the production values. This movie stinks to high heaven, the only reason I have rated it higher than it deserves it that it managed to keep me entertained for 30 minutes. After that, it was just grunt after grunt to complain about the utter dreadfulness that I was seeing. Those laughs deserve some IMDb rating points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At last, a credible tale of the basis behind the Arthur myths!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given the period that the character of Arthur originated from, I have long awaited a movie that deals with one of the men who contributed to the myth. It is probable that the legendary Arthur was an amalgamation of several war-lords and resistance leaders in the immediate post-Roman period who, in their several areas and periodds fought the Saxons. This is, by far, the most convincing movie scenario yet. I admit that some elements of the plot were thin: the presence of a prominent Roman family north of Hadrian's wall does stretch credulity. However, the presence of a prominent Romano-British family friendly to Rome would not! But this subtlety would be totally lost on most movie goers so why split hairs? It was nice to see a movie based in Britain that had not been overwhelmed by American accents. Having had the recent history changed by the movies to indicate that US forces had gained or won EVERYTHING in WW2, it was refreshing to note mainly European (or at least cod-European) accents prevailed.Historically, this movie was as true to fact as could be expected. One or 2 of the weapons used were slightly anachronistic but all the technology did exist at the time so no real problem there. Anyone who wants to nit-pick about armorial details should compare this to any other Arthurian movie - that always contains fantasy or 15th-century armour - and then hold their comments on this aspect. As to the actors, the words 'understated', 'credible', 'intense' and 'human' apply. The performances were highly competent but not outstanding. The whole package made for a compelling drama-come-pseudo-documentary that provoked thought and gratified the need for action.Perhaps the most obscure element was making the indigenous northern tribes alien (by speaking Gaelic) and the Saxons closer to the Romans by their use of English. This demonstrated the power of the Arthurian myth that drew diverse peoples together against a more familiar race that was however a common enemy. This is probably the most salient point for our modern times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to see a film about the legend of king arthur you've come to the wrong movie but if you want to see decent film about the dark ages in Britain here it is. It is a fairly believable yarn although some of the scenes where 6 or 7 knights take on hundreds are abit like something out of Lord of the Rings. It has all the characters from the Legend of King Arthur but in more realistic roles such as Merlin as the head of a band of warriors caught between King Arthur and raiders from the North. Apart from King Arthur, Merlin, Gwenivire and the arch enemy the Knights are hard to distinguish from one another. Might have to have a second watch to work out who was who. Looking forward to watching the Director's Cut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but something is missing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** HERE BE SPOILERS **Arthur (Owen) and his Sarmatian knights have for 15 years been posted in Britannia protecting the Roman border. Now Rome plans to leave Britannia and the Sarmatian knights is about to be released from their duty. However, an invading Saxon army led by Cerdic (Skarsg?rd) threatens a noble Roman family to the north and the knights must rescue them. At the same time, Merlin (Dillane) and his woads keep fighting the Romans for power. The knights mission is dangerous but finally succeeds and the knights' have won their freedom. Arthur, having realized that his place is in Britannia stays in Britannia to defeat the invading Saxons. The Romans are leaving but he is aided by Guinevere (Knightley), a woad girl he rescued on their last mission.Being a sucker for swordplay and the era that the movie takes place in in general, I think this movie was pretty good. Unfortunately not as good as it could have been. Among the knights there are some very interesting characters, but unfortunately there is no time to develop those characters further. The acting is good, and the casting is also good. So is the swordplay and, as you can see, there is pattern here. Everything is good, but not great. The "feeling" for the story and the movie is somewhat absent for me, but I can't put my finger on what is really missing.So, entertaining movie but not on any top ten lists.7/10</fullReview>

There was a problem in our theater, so we didn't have sound for the first five minutes, but even if it had worked, it wouldn't have made it any better. In between the battle sequences, which were sloppy with choppy editing, were extremely boring scenes of talking, talking, and, yes, more talking. I jumped out of my seat and ran out the theater as soon as the credits began. My friends and I all went home knowing we would never get that time and money back. Even my friend, a huge King Arthur fan, was disappointed. Don't buy this movie. Ever. If you must see it, rent it. It's two hours of torture.</fullReview>

Yeah... it's about a legend.... but you'd never recognize a single one of the various versions of the Arthurian tales in it, it simply doesn't seem to follow any of them. You can't even call it a 'modified' version; it's a complete and utter rewrite. This, in itself, isn't so really awful; it's a MOVIE, after all. Heinously bad history, however, is entirely another thing. Historical details that are so easily verified, any student in junior high would spot them. Against WHOM was Hadrian's Wall built? Who ruled in Rome at this period? There's quite a bit more there too... which I suppose you could forgive (even...) if it was a really good story... or a good movie... but it's neither.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fantastic Legend or True History?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I'm neither a historian nor I have a degree on any related subject. I will not discuss what Arthur's real story is. I will rate this movie in two ways. First I will rate this as an individual movie.The movie gives you enough for you not to get bored till the casting appears in the end. Although I've red some opinions that rates this movie as one of the best war movies in the last years. I think those opinions were made either without watching the movie without watching any other movies. The war scenes are good, especially the one on ice but its not realistic and not close being best war scenes. Cast was chosen wisely. Arthur is charismatic yet firm, Guin is wild and passionate, Lancelot resembles Drizzt form R.A. Salvatore books but Merlin is too held back. I've always tought story of Arthur as a legend with fantastic background. Including Excalibur, Merlin as a wise and powerful man, Lancelot as an incredible warrior and Arthur as a Legendary character who tries to unify the kingdom.Secondly I can compare this movie, amongst other Arthurian movies, but just as movie-wise not history-wise. This movie is far better than "First Knight", comparable to "Mists Of Avalon" but in my opinion "Excalibur(1981)" is still the best one.As a result this movie should be watched for once but I don't think it will be a hit or collector's first choice. 6/10</fullReview>

Sometimes I find in the movies who pretend historical background a lot of mistakes. But is movie, not reality. I think Vaticano should say something about some religious references. 500 years ago, maybe the producers should be killed for some declarations of the protagonist. But if you want to see good fights, historical anacronysm, offenses against the Church, a good amount of popcorn, a soda, and a beautiful girl near to you enjoying the show, go, and see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, you may think I am crazy to say this. I saw "Troy" in May and I was highly disappointed by it. It was too long, the acting was wooden (as wooden as the Trojan Horse), and it could have done without Brad Pitt (I know, that sounds even worse!). "Troy" had some great scenery and warrior scenes, but it wasn't nearly as close or as good as "Gladiator." It truly was my Achilles heel. On the other hand, "King Arthur" moved swiftly, had some comedy, quick dialogue, and heck, at least a steamy love scene. One may ask why Kiera Knightly could get away half naked in the middle of winter and battle, but read about battles around that time, and they did just that. It wasn't uncommon for some city-states to fight in battle completely naked.The film "Alexander," staring Colin Farrell and Angelina Jolie will be out Nov. 5th and will probably be a much better film than both "Troy" and "King Arthur," so I am anticipating that. Don't watch Alexander without reading how Alexander won his battles or how he became king when he was only 16. One can not understand why he was called "Alexander the Great" without knowing his history and his madness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some time ago I've read somewhere comments of Keira Knightley where she said something like she's not worthy to be called an actress yet. Unfortunately it was before I saw her latest performance in King Arthur. On the other hand I can at least acknowledge the comment.Still, trying to be fair, it's not her fault entirely that this movie sucks. According to other reviews, I feel lucky not to know the actual legend, because this adaptation is told to be completely stupid mess in terms of historical facts. It wouldn't bother me if it wasn't for other things like boring and predictable plot, boring and awkward dialogues everyone has heard about one thousand gazillion times in other stupid Hollywood junk, or unconvincing performances... The action scenes and stylish set pieces weren't enough to conceal the shallowness of it all.For those of you fond of spoilers I've picked some real pearls:The snipers like we know them now simply can't compete with ancient archers. You hardly ever see an arrow that misses its target. It's easy to win against impossible odds when you have such unerring task force.Really, seeing frail little cute Guinevere charging into battle with a blade even in her off-hand is quite funny too. No disrespect intended but with that battle dance she performs there she would have suffered from dislocated shoulder in no time. Not to mention she is virtually naked against decently armored grunts...Saxons are portrayed like complete and utter imbeciles. Best part is when the whole contingent of them shrivels with fear and herds together on a frozen lake endangered by a handful of archers sniping them from the distance of several hundreds meters.But what sucks even more is whole romance between Arthur and Guinevere. It's simply impossible. My impression from it was that Arthur was bitter and just wanted to get laid and Guinevere decided to make the sacrifice for a worthy cause - that dull it seemed to me. The wedding scene is stupidest scene ever, I thought it was just meant to be on DVD non-serious bonus material and got to actual movie by mistake...Here end the spoilers.Only piece of real substance I've noticed were very rare and brief interactions between Lancelot and Guinevere. Almost everything else was just artificial, like it was some failed rehearsal or something.3/10 because I'm nice</fullReview>

An accurate historical rendering and enjoyable locations (like Irish Cliffs of Moher that I recognized for visiting) are not enough to make a quality movie touching people's heart; I got bored and eventually this 2 hours 10 min. runtime seemed endless to me. With such a captivating tale the film could have been improved if only it had given more care to details and actors relationships. I repeat myself but I assume that a few intense fighting scenes and a short affair between Arthur and Guinevere don't deserve a positive rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The renaissance sculptor Rodin said that a great work of art can still be seen as a great work of art even if it is damaged or incomplete.The background is this, the Western part of the Roman empire collapsed some time between 300 and 500 ad (the Eastern, kept going until 1500AD when the Turks took constantinopol).So the Romans pulled out of Brittany and the order in that area collapsed until, as legend would have it a war lord, name Arthur united the people of Brittany to fight the saxon invasion.The trust has been lost through mythology, politics and the tourist trade (many of the Arthurian tourists sites were invented in the 14th century for the tourist trade of the time).So take this story and compress into 5 days. That is the time covered in the movie. So of course some things are not that credible in this context. But a movie is not history, and facts are not the truth.It uncovers a period that many people don't know much about because all of the roman buildings in the United Kingdom were destroyed so they could use the stone to make churches and sometimes castles.One reviewer doubted the existence of Hadrian's wall. Something that is not that surprising, but reflects typical lake of knowledge of Rome in Brittany.Enjoy the movie as it stands. Enjoy the ideas within it. The ending battle is a little bit weak and some reviewers have complained they didn't understand what was going on. Basically it was a ploy to break apart the Saxon's military discipline to allow the main characters to confront each other on the battlefield for benefits of Hollywood drama. OK, you got that.Flawed in many ways, yes, brilliant, getting close it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's grim up north</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this film looks and feels a lot more 'authentic' than most film treatments of the Arthur myth (jousting knights, anyone?), its claim to be based on facts is very doubtful. We don't know very much about the time in which Arthur lived - or if he lived at all. What we can be fairly sure of, however, is that Guinevere was not a semi-nude Pictish (or 'Woad') warrior princess, Saxons didn't use crossbows and the Roman army didn't organise its troops in bands of five, Sarmatians or not. In other words, this King Arthur, for all its grime and frequent cries of 'Ro-o-o-ome!' is as much a piece of hokum as Camelot. Matters aren't helped by Clive Owens' portrayal of the mythic one as a constipated Cockney barrow-boy or Ioan Gruffudd's oddly peripheral Lancelot. But my main gripe with the film is that it's so boring - the battles (even a scene stolen straight from Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky) are bloody, sure, but completely unengaging, while the plot is thin and the romantic interest quite unbelievable. So there you go - if costume drama yawns are your bag, this is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing - Good thing it only cost me $3.50 to see it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I looked forward to this film with great anticipation, which just heightened my disappointment once I got out to see it - it was a good premise, but it was poorly handled by all involved, from set and costume designers (Guinevere's battle dress was most unflattering to poor Ms. Knightley!) to the writer and (especially) the director - Mr. Fuqua may not have had much of a story to work with, but it is obvious that he better understands a more modern, urban setting (witness "Training Day") than 5th-century Britain. The few bright moments - Dagonet and the little boy, the character Bors and his eleven little bastards, Guinevere putting a arrow into the (comically) evil Roman - are not enough to offset the remainder of the film.Historical accuracy counts, even in a story that is based on speculation about a distant and poorly-documented period, so comments pooh-poohing the historical faux-pas in the film may be discounted. Hadrian's Wall (or its remnants) may be seen today, so show it as it really was - a barrier complex (from the south to north: an earth mound, then a ditch and further mound, then an open area on which a road was built to allow easy access to all parts of the wall all along its length, then the main wall itself, and just to the north of that, a deep ditch) with small forts at close intervals, larger ones more distantly-spaced - not a massive Roman Great Wall; leave out chain mail, crossbow-toting Saxons (in the North, for goodness' sake - where no Saxon ever went!) and Roman villas north of Hadrian's line. The film could be forgiven these blunders if it had been billed as a fantasy, a la Conan, and set in an entirely fictional time and place - but it wasn't, so it can't be.The saddest thing of all is that, as badly as this movie tanked, we may never see a better-handled treatment of the post-Roman, pre-Saxon (as opposed to Age of Chivalry) Arthur concept - Hollywood has a long memory when comes to movies that don't make money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I do admire the producers' efforts to show something akin to a historically accurate story about the Britton hero Actorius, I have to say I did not expect much from this movie before going to see it and yet was uncomfortably surprised by the fact that my expectations were higher than what the movie delivered! Weak plot, ho-hum acting, so-so battle scenes, and the rest just plain boring.The fact that this movie is a rehash of Seven Samurai does not help it much, the bad storytelling of the movie being enough of a turn-off. The battle scenes were nothing I had not seen before in much better movies; the speech given by Actorius to his 5th century knights before the final battle resembled Braveheart's speech before the battle at Stirling Bridge (without the bridge, in either films). Let just say I prefer to see the opening sequence of Gladiator and hit the replay button a couple of times, in order to receive a much more satisfying experience as far as Roman warfare goes.The love scene between Guinevere and Arthur (Actorius) was so forced I thought I was seeing a prostitute on the job.My last problem with the movie: trebuchets? In the 5th Century? And crossbows, for Pete's sake? Why didn't the producers introduce hand and hoop cannons, and just represent the battle at Crécy (100 Year War)?Two out of, oh, a thousand stars.

		<shortDescription>Kind of a let down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any movie about King Arthur and his Knights is bound to be great, right? I mean, the legend of Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table is on of the most exciting tales around, so a movie about them just has to be great. Especially when it claims to be the "true" story behind the legend. Well, you better think again. This movie somehow manages to take one of the most exciting, interesting and well developed stories that exist and turn it into a bore. First of all, it is not the "true" story of Arthur, simply because nobody knows what the true story is. There are a number of historical figures that are assumed to have fueled the legend (the film's Roman Arthur is just one of them)and the most probable scenario is that the legend of King Arthur is based on several historic figures and events (and some of the legend's elements were created much later to spice things up). And the movie is not even historically accurate (weapons and things that were invented centuries later, the Saxons invading the wrong part of Britain etc.).But besides that, is the movie any good? Well, not really. Mediocre acting, inadequate script, some lame dialog, undeveloped characters are some of the films characteristics. The portrayal of Arthur as a goodie-two-shoes Christan made me feel sick. And Xena, the warrior princess - sorry I mean Guinevere - delivers the final blow. But to be fair I have to admit that there were some great fight scenes and, for the most part, very good photography. Had it not been a story about King Arthur I probably would have liked it better. I can't really recommend it to anyone, watch it at your own risk. I give it 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his novel 'The Lyre of Orpheus', the Canadian author Robertson Davies makes the point that, although the Arthurian legends have inspired a number of great works of literature, there has never been a particularly successful dramatic version, either in the theatre or in the cinema. Purcell's opera might be thought to be an exception, but Davies discounts it on the grounds that its plot differs radically from the standard version of the legend.This latest film version also diverges from what we have come to think of as the Arthurian story. Arthur is not a mediaeval monarch but a Roman military commander in fifth century Britain. Arthur's troops, although they bear the names traditionally associated with the Knights of the Round Table (Lancelot, Gawaine, etc.) are not knights as we think of them, but Sarmatian cavalrymen serving with the Roman army. Merlin is not a magician, but the leader of a British uprising against Roman rule. Guinevere is a British warrior-maiden. Excalibur and the Round Table itself make brief appearances, but there is no Quest for the Holy Grail, no adulterous romance between Lancelot and Guinevere, no Mordred and no Morgan La Fay.At the beginning of the film, Arthur and his men have just completed their fifteen years of service with the legions and are due to receive the discharge papers that will allow them to return to their Sarmatian homeland. They are, however, blackmailed by a Roman bishop into undertaking one final mission. They are to rescue a wealthy Roman senator and his family from their villa north of Hadrian's Wall, as the legions are about to leave Britain and the family will be in danger from both rebellious Britons and invading Saxons. (The film does not explain why such an influential Roman family should be living outside the boundaries of the Empire in what they would have regarded as barbarian territory.). The villa is presumably somewhere in present-day Scotland, a relatively small country about the size of Maine. The film-makers, however, seem to have had little idea of the distances involved, as it is summer when the knights set off, winter when they arrive at the villa and summer again when they return to the Wall. Even given that travel in Roman times was much slower than it is today, it is difficult to see why they needed six months for this journey.Arthur starts the film as a Christian and an idealist with a strong belief in the civilising mission of Rome. Gradually, however, he becomes disillusioned by the Romans' cynical duplicity and treatment of the native Britons, and comes to sympathies with the Britons' struggle for freedom. Rather than return to Sarmatia, he and his men throw in their lot with the Britons, who have hitherto been their enemies, and help them fight the Saxons. This is a film that relies heavily on ethnic and religious stereotyping; Arthur and his Sarmatians are civilised and decent, the Romans are sophisticated but cruel and decadent, the Britons are noble savages and the Saxons ignoble ones. Christianity also comes out of the film badly; the Romans are Christians who use their faith to justify keeping the pagan Britons in slavery. Arthur loses his faith when he learns that his friend the philosopher Pelagius has been executed as a heretic by the Church authorities. (The real Pelagius was indeed condemned for heresy by the Church, but there is no evidence that he was put to death. The manner and exact date of his death are unknown, but it is generally agreed that he died about fifty years before the time of the film).Instead of interpreting the traditional legend, the film presents itself as a 'historically accurate' version of the story. This is, unfortunately, an impossible aim. One cannot tell the story of Arthur with any accuracy, because there is no agreement as to the facts of his life. Even his very existence as a historical figure has been called into question. The film-makers have not even bothered to stick to known historical facts about the period. The withdrawal of the Roman legions actually took place in 410 AD; in the film they are shown as still being in Britain more than fifty years after that date. The Romans and Britons are shown as two quite distinct cultures, with the Britons still living as they had in pre-Roman times, when all the evidence is that, after nearly four centuries of Roman rule, many Britons, particularly among the elite, had adopted Roman ways. The Saxons are shown as invading Northern Britain in the region of Hadrian's Wall; in reality they first landed in the South-East and gradually moved north and west. The Romans never conquered Sarmatia, a region roughly corresponding to the modern Ukraine. The warriors of the period are shown making use of such anachronistic devices as the stirrup, the crossbow and, most bizarrely of all, barbed wire, something that was not invented until the nineteenth century. If the film itself were stronger, it would be possible to overlook both its departure from the 'Le Morte d'Arthur' legend and its historical inaccuracies and to see it simply as an exciting Dark Age adventure story, a sort of sword-and-sorcery fantasy without the sorcery. Unfortunately, it does not even work on this level. The story is confusing and difficult to follow, and the acting undistinguished. Clive Own makes an uncharismatic Arthur, and most of the knights do not emerge as individuals. (The one exception is Ray Winstone's comic-relief turn as Sir Bors, a mixture of foul-mouthed vulgarian and devoted father of a huge brood of children). Keira Knightley makes a splendid-looking Guinevere, but she lacks the physique to be convincing as a female warrior. (The film-makers obviously felt she would look sexier as a Boudicca figure than as a Romano-British lady). There are some effective set-pieces, such as the battle on the ice (possibly homage to Eisenstein's 'Alexander Nevsky'), but I found the film as a whole a great disappointment, much weaker than this summer's other epic, 'Troy'. Robertson Davies's dictum still holds good; there is no great cinematic version of the Arthurian legend. Except, of course, 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazingly clumsy. Any writer has the right to alter what is probably the greatest secular legend in the western world, so I don't personally agree with the purists. But the telling of this film is really confusing: (1) why are the Saxons invading NORTH of Hadrian's Wall (their first invasions occurred in East Anglia and Kent)? (2) why do we go from winter at the Roman castle to a full, green-leafed summer at the Wall itself? (3) why is there such confusion between the (non-Celtic) Picts and the native Britons (of which Arthur was presumably part)? (4) why are the Saxons so laughably stupid (e.g., able to be herded together on the ice, wilfully dividing up when going into battle). The Stonehenge-by-the-Sea wedding ceremony, the monks walled up, released, and walled up again, the Saxon soldier struggling out of the battle to warn his comrades ("It's...")....my 11-year old daughters were laughing aloud: this was better than Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Some nice fight scenes, and, of course, Keira Knightley, don't add up to a movie I would watch again, except for the comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If legends exist and are as old as centuries, they should at least be respected.If someone wants to make a movie based on the legend of King Arthur, at least have the good sense of respecting a little bit of the legend and not make a charade like this movie.The only thing i liked in the movie was the photography. The story is weak, senseless and without direction. A beardless Arthur fights the saxons side by side with a ridiculous Guinevere in summer clothing (during a hard cold winter). Every character in the movie lacks personality and so does the story.The leader of the Saxons is a joke, looking constantly "stoned" and his helper is like the jester of the castle, more like a annoyed kid who sobs and gives frozen looks to his master.The knights of the round table..... or should i say.... the knights who gather around a round table... for what? To drink beer? To tell sad stories? What was their role in the history again? A band of slave-knights who fought for Rome..... and gathered in Arthur's house?Where is the glory of Camelot? Where is a king? Where is Excalibur... the powerful Merlin.... the code of chivalry and honour? Where is the Legend?Nowhere in this movie. Instead you get to see a ridiculous Guinevere acting like a poor Legolas, a savage-looking Merlin who just stares and looks but adds nothing to the story, a poor Arthur who is neither a king, neither a leader and neither someone who has a concrete goal and a band of mercenaries who supposedly follow Arthur but are just a sad excuse to fill an empty round-table.If people waste money to do epic-style movies, at least try and waste money in a good movie... or at least a movie that makes some sense.... Arthur is a waste of money and time.... a sad movie who tries to take advantage of a timeless legend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first film I have ever seen where I actually considered walking out of the cinema about half way through. The cast were split between the comically wooden (Owen and Stott) and the comically overacting (Ray Winstone) Gruffud and Knightley did their best but in the face of a poor script and a lack of much in the way of plot it was a losing battle. Historical inaccuracies (long bows and chain mail were about 600 years later!) were annoying and the director seemed only to have a vague idea about Saxons (they are not the same as vikings). What in pete's sake are 'woads'? Did he mean ancient brits? Only the great visual effects and superb frozen lake bit were entertaining (and where exactly were these mountains supposed to be?) By the end the entire cast could have gone to hell in a basket for all I cared.</fullReview>

The first hour is a bit lengthy, there are some annoying, very Hollywoodish love scenes, but you'll also see some quite exciting and original battle scenes, and the overall story and acting is all right.Overall rating 5/10 - nothing special at all, but solid entertainment that doesn't hurt</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this because I was fascinated by the idea that it was a 'real', semi-historic version of England's favourite myth, rather than the usual lady in the lake gubbins. And it seemed, from a layman's point of view, good and pretty realistic until sodding Guinevere showed up. She is supposed to be a savage ancient Brit, but swans around looking like a Roman empress, with perfect teeth, plastically modified lips, and a grating Cheltenham Ladies College accent. What an insult to Britons, most of all Boudicea and all those real female warriors! I'm not blaming the actress, rather the miscasting. I guess the boys might disagree, but hey, the flow of the movie's more important than your desktop wallpaper. I gritted my teeth each time she appeared, it rather ruined it for me. And the 'comic' relief lines of Bors made me wince too. Otherwise, though, enjoyable and I liked how they worked the sword in the stone idea.</fullReview>

The story is of course based on the well known story about King Arthur, The wizard Merlin and the sword in the stone. This movie shows the story in a new kind of way, much like other new blockbuster movies like Troy and in a way The fellowship of the ring trilogy, it is a very bloody epic story with some sad deaths of main characters which I really like! The beginning of the movie was the most interesting part I believe, me being a history junkie!This new kind of brutal, bloody and epic movies has become the thing that every director want to do it seams.

		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting too much from "King Arthur," but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The political tangles are sometimes hard to understand, as are the accents, but the performances are excellent, and the battle scenes are superbly filmed, not showing too much gore, yet effectively suggesting the madness of the battlefield. I greatly appreciated that the love story was kept to a minimum, and the one "scene of sensuality" was tastefully filmed. I think it's interesting that, unlike in so many epics, the love story is not a pointless subplot, but a union symbolic of Arthur's accepting his mixed blood and ending his tradition of war with the Woads. "King Arthur" is what an epic should be: a quest, the measure of a man (and woman; Guinevere is the symbol of feminism in this film), and no clichéd "love-conquers-all" resolution. Thank you to the filmmakers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GOOD BUT NOT GREAT, WELL EXECUTED AND ATMOSPHERIC</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"King Arthur" is a good movie. It's strongest aspect is it's performance. Clive Owen is the perfect arthur for the Dark Ages. The other knights are equally as well presented, each displaying individual traits, but not so much that it's derivative. Personally, I am glad that they disposed of the Lancelot's betrayal aspect of the Arthur tale. I think the reason this film wasn't greatly received was because it wasn't a huge epic like Braveheart, but a smaller, more grounded epic like The 13th Warrior. It blends "magical" insinuations into a realistic presentation. We understand that Excalibur holds some meaning, but it is an emotional and symbolic meaning, not supernatural. The atmosphere was also criticized, however I felt it added to the feel of the film and of their feeling of hopelessness, fighting for "a cause not of their own." However, like some critics mentioned, this film is "good but not great." It lacks the big epic feel of Braveheart or Glory, but I believe it is due to it's attempt to make everything realistic. I love the character qualities. Arthur is a Roman and a Christian, and he must deal with his Sarmatian knights who have conflicting (and in Lancelot's case, almost confronting) ideals. He is also as flawed as he is strong, as conflicted as he is brave and sure. Again, I have to say how well executed this film is. The acting is great, they don't attempt to over-villianify (real word?) the Saxons. They are simply an invading army... just a little more vicious. I think this may have driven some viewers away. In Braveheart, Longshanks is to be despised and hated. We want Wallace to triumph over him. In King Arthur, we root for Arthur because he is Arthur, just and glorified, not because we hate the Saxons. This could also be seen as a flaw...I wasn't a fan of the introduction, or the obvious attempts of this film to be realistic. They mentioned it in the tagline and the trailers, no need to mention it in the movie! This film is also a bit lacking in the developmental qualities of Braveheart and Gladiator. There's also a lot of freedom talk that is suitable, but not as suitable as in Braveheart where they are painfully oppressed.Ultimately this movie is an excellent movie, extremely well executed in my opinion, and exciting for those interested in knights and Arthurian legends.www.festizio.net award-winning</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read a lot of the comments and critics before i yesterday went out to see the movie. See, i am a fan of the stories of history, legends and all that stuff. So i thought, that i have to see the movie to get my own impression of it, but i did not have any expectations on it. For those who would not like to read any spoilers on the movie, i gave it a 4 / 10, the 4 for some nice ideas and a great performance by Keira Knightley. You can interpret the legend as they did, but the storyline is thin, military strategy is almost nonexistent and the main characters like Arthur and Lancelot are not strong enough to save the movie. One can watch it for a nice show, but do not try to think about it!POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADAll right, lets go into details. In a making of the makers let us know, that they have a military adviser. Well, my advice would be to sue him. The best example is the final battle between the Saxons and the Pikts. The main line of the Saxons is out of range for the Onagars (older version of catapults), the Saxons have 2-3 meter long spears - OK. The knights charge the line of the saxons, so what does their chief do? Any sensible leader would have the soldiers with the spears dig in, and let them break the charge of the knights, then finish them of. But what does he do? He lets his warriors charge the knights! Into the range of the Onagars! I broke down laughing seeing this, and this is not the only part of the "brilliant military tactics" in this movie.Other loopholes in the story are things like Guinevere shooting a day after disjointed fingers are relocated, there is no way she could have recovered so fast in Scottish winter, there is no way that the Scottish mountains are snowcovered and lakes are frozen and in the valleys it is summer, and so on and so on....The plot summarizes to the following: Arthur and his knights are free to go home to Samaria, get one last mission from a corrupt rome. During that see this corruption, but the Saxons are coming. Retreat to the Hadrian Wall, ally with the Picts, beat the Saxons. Arthur and Guinevere marry. That is actually all there is of the story... Not much of the legend, and not at all anything of any historic worth. A couple of good ideas, but thats it, and it is sad to say that they had all the chances for a great movie, but blew it.Clive Owen's performance as Arthur is average at best. Keira Knightley is brilliant as Guinevere. Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot tries his best but falls short. Ray Winstone as Bors and Ray Stevenson as Dagonet save some part of the day, but their characters are just not central enough to save the movie. By the way, the same problem is true for Keira Knightley. The movie is about Arthur, Clive Owen is not able to carry the movie, so....SUMMARY If you want to see a good interpretation of the arthurian legend, do not watch this movie. If you want a good historical view on this legend, do not watch this movie. If you just want to eat some popcorn, laugh a lot on inconsistent story lines and can see this movie as a bad fantasy movie, then you might actually go and watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Besides being a huge fan of Mr Owen's (I adore actors who can credibly deliver a broken character) I simply loved this fresh angle on the old legend of Arthur. This film is no variation on the old 'intrigue at Camelot' theme, but a completely new approach. It is much more consistent with what (little) we know about 6th century life than the usual King Arthur films. They used to make me think of the time when the legends were written: the characters acted like 15th century courtiers (sometimes almost Macchiavellian style) and troubadours.In this film the équipe of the Round Table are not superhuman goody-goody guys but men of flesh and blood without any fear of shedding some. And the swords really get red in the fight (i.e. the filmmakers were meticulously authentic). Even the Saxons (the enemy) are not just bloodthirsty baddies but conquerors with a different world picture from Arthur's and therefore a different standard of behaviour.I give this film the highest rating: great cast, superb acting, simply super!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit, my hopes and expectations for this movie had increased with the fact that one of my countrymen, the gifted Mads Mikkelsen(Tristan), had been jumping around with sword and bird to participate in what should have become a tremendous experience. There for, me and my friend were sure that we most certainly would be entertained first class!! So what happened?Well, the first thing that got to my attention was the strange way of filming the first real fight between Arthur's men and the woards(if that's even what they are called.. The blue people anyway). It looks as if the cameraman is throwing the camera around like a hot potato! The clumsy battles I can somehow deal with, but it gets worse...Strike two is the stupid way of characterizing our heroes. At first you think that Lancelot is our point of view and you catch a glimpse of what you think might be some kind of social situation, BUT THEN IT TURNS and suddenly Arthur is our first priority AND THEN IT TURNS and Lancelot is back in the hot seat AND THEN... It's too confusing. They try to give a background for the both of them, but it's like making one picture with who sets of puzzles... You get bits and pieces, but no full picture.The final downer was the feeling afterward. `Was that all?'. To me it felt like someone had peed in an expensive jar and tried to sell it to me as fine perfume. NO THANK YOU! The location and atmosphere was great and the acting wasn't bad, but something was missing. In my opinion the story just couldn't keep up with the magnitude of the movie. What a shame...Finally I would like to point out that Mads Mikkelsen normally is much more exiting to watch when he acts. I thought his character was one of Arthur's best friends, so either Arthur has a really strange way of showing it or the part as Tristan had been shaved down to a minimum to spare time. He is after all the dark-mysterious-silent-don't-f**k-with-me-type of samurai knight, so any indication that something might matter to him, probably aren't his first priority... :)</fullReview>

I know there was some historical problems too, okay I know that in a way the tings about Arthur where also historical but they are also a myth so ill leave that at the side, but anyway if I had gone to see the movie and it had nothing to do with King Arthur meaning they would have other names then I would just have expected a movie with some battles between some good guys and some bad guys, and I would probably have let the historical mishaps slide and just let myself be entertained, even thou I have read ' the decline and fall of the roman empire' and also about Hadrian's wall so I found the errors pretty fast but of cause as someone said this is not a documentary, no its Hollywood and I would suggest to read books if you want the real deal. I have read a lot of books and every time Hollywood has made a movie over one of those books I have always been very disappointed and I don't think that will ever change books ARE better, so I would say see the movie but don't expect much or maybe nothing that way you wont get to disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I can say is that this movie is remarkably drab, dull and downright boring!! I found myself falling asleep for almost 3/4 's of this "epic" production. The characters are uninteresting, the storyline...oh wait...was there a story?? It is almost that bad. Honestly, I waited for some word of mouth on this film and had decided I was not going to go. Then a friend wanted to go so I looked around on the net to see what was being said. The trusty old IMDB fan base gave it a 6. Not overwhelming by a long shot. So I consulted Ebert and Roeper...they usually have a pretty good grasp of what is good and what is not. I was amazed at two thumbs up and listened to their review. So off we went. I think those two were drunk when they watched this film. I could not recommend this film to anybody. I thought Troy was uninspired but then along came this film. There isn't much to separate Troy from King Arthur. Troy looked better, had better actors, but that is not saying much. I didn't like it either. This must be the summer of Epic bombs!I really could care less what happened in this film. It didn't draw me in. The characters are cold and the script uninspired. The battle scenes are adequate but when one has to use the word adequate to describe epic fight scenes, need I say more?? Even the lead villain was a bore! Shouldn't you truly despise the nemesis of a major film? I found myself laughing at the lack of acting talent and the overall wretched performance of the leader of the Saxon horde. Even Keira Knightly is wasted in this film...and she is a relative newcomer.The liberal viewpoint taken on the Legend of King Arthur by the screenwriter and director is different, but I found it strangely lacking. There are too many anachronisms in this film to list, and setting this film in 480 AD simply doesn't work for me. From the lead role on down there isn't a decent performance in this film. The direction is formulaic and uninspired. Uninspired! That describes this film to a tee!If you want a true take on the Arthurian Legend, rent Excalibur. Hell, I would pick Monty Python's Search for the Holy Grail over this dud!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They might as well have set it in 2035 for all the historical accuracy. The idea that this is a more realistic retelling of what most people see as a nice bedtime story is laughable. It's not that people of that time wouldn't have been grittier and less romantically magical than depicted in , say, THE SWORD IN THE STONE, but it's just how anybody who's ever seen a map of Britain would have thought, "hang on a minute!" There's a round table. That's nice. It's in a keep outside Hadrian's wall. That's remarkable. Everyone speaks the same language. The peasants are eloquent and articulate and adept at making profound speeches. Accents? Well... they're kind of random. Two people who grew up in the same village have completely different accents and two who come from different planets have the same one. The costumes are nice to look at and completely stupid. There are lots of people running around painted blue, because BRAVEHEART made money and people want to cash in on it. Who cares that there hadn't been people doing that for... oh, I don't know, as long as Australia has existed as a colony, say, for comparison. Mmm. Everywhere is either weeks away on horseback or just around the corner, depending what the "plot" needed at the time. And the director really wanted to have been in on GLADIATOR. He really, really, wanted this to be as close as possible. Money, I guess. I saw this movie at a surprise preview a few weeks ago and was very disappointed. It's crap. It would have been better if there were more spaceships in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie pulled the legendary sword of NoPlot out of the stone of GodAwfullness and accomplished the impossible. It was almost as bad as The One. Seeing it was one of the worst decisions of my life. Worse than donating my right leg to the Starving Cannibals fund. Worse than lighting my car on fire with my neighbor's hair. But not as bad as seeing The One.Seriously, if a movie is going to use a story as classic and as powerful as King Arthur, it had better at least be worth seeing. This movie did not even come close. While I did appreciate its attempt to present a more historically accurate portrayal, any and all efforts were declared null and void when Guinevere stormed at the invaders wearing a combat bra. If they wanted to make a complete fantasy movie, go ahead and have a combat bra. If they want to have women fight in the movie, go ahead, as women did actually fight back then. But don't put them in such an absurd outfit and call it "a more historically accurate King Arthur".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to this film, i love the legend and hey Lancelot is so hot, i was disappointed by this Hollywood take on it. Great British cast, thankfully no Americans with dodgy British accents but what was i to expect with Hollywood money behind it. Clive Owen, a normally good actor, was given lines that even he could not make believable, particularly when praying to god. Keira Knightley's Guinevere was a little far fetched, though for distracting the male audiences enough so as not to notice the plot holes she worked very well. However i'm sure even they noticed that.....******SPOILER****** SPOILER********SPOILER*****SPOILER*********She had her fingers all disjointed yet managed to to very efficiently shoot with a bow and arrow, also just when did she get together with Merlin to arrange that she get Arthur to follow her into the woods.So there were major gaps in the plot. With the demise of two of the most favorite of the knights,it makes a sequel more difficult...though i'm sure in great Hollywood tradition that may not be impossibleI may have left the movie theatre more satisfied had they not done what they did at the end to those two characters, i suppose it was Hollywood's way of saying 'see how unpredictable we are' but it didn't work, it just made us feel like the two hours had had been wasted and we had invested our emotions for nothing as they got rid of the two most appealing and watchable characters.All in all the locations and action were more gritty and realistic than other Arthur movies, 'First Knight' comes to mind not to mention it wasn't clean or sanitary once again unlike 'First Knight' There was no magical mysticism no mention of lady's residing in lakes nor of Arthur's twisted sister and main enemy Morgana as in 'Excalibur'.I rate this a 5/10, average but nothing special, and that is with sadness because the cast are all very talented</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Am I the only person who thought this movie was so bad it was actually offensive? Putting all the "historically accurate" stuff aside. The script was terrible. Err...hello!! The most "romantic" scene (bar the almost embarrassing scene with Keira and Arthur making whoppee) was him CRACKING HER KNUCKLES as she made ridiculous orgas*m noises!!! And the most "romantic" line? "Your fingers are broken - I need to push them back in".Riiiight. Not only was the script terrible, but the backbone of the movie, Arthur, said every line in the exact same monotonous way, whether it be 'let me push you finger back in' or 'you will die'. Don't even get me started on Keira, because although she is beautiful all I could see were her spots and personally thought she was hideous and the best actor was LANCELOT who said one word and then predictably died, after helpfully telling Arthur how he wanted to be buried.AND THE FIGHTING!!! Looked like a pathetic little very slow dance, very very fake and the sound effects sounded like some sort of strange screaming rap thing, only bested by the really weird camera angles.I have never seen so many people leave a cinema in my life. I would have left as well if i wasn't laughing hysterically. Before you all try to kill me, I have to admit the Ice scene was actually very good, and that Kestral guy, basically all the actors who died were good. Except that bad guy, who had a really random American accent considering he was a SAXON. (sorry if I've offended you terribly - I signed on to IMDb just to rant about this)*Foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A failed attempt at "Gladiator"esque epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My love of this kind of quasi-historical epic (Gladiator, Braveheart...) and the fact that one of my favourite films is John's Boorman's fabulous Excalibur led me to ignore the critics and shell out my hard earned cash to see this film at the cinema. We all make mistakes...I like to give a film a good chance by suspending my disbelief and not passing too critical an eye over it the first time I watch it mainly so that I can enjoy it for what it is and get my money's worth. Unfortunately this was impossible with King Arthur.In summary an almost workable story is let down by an uninspired script which in turn is not given any extra life by generally one-dimensional acting. Even if you came for the action the battle scenes are distinctly below average as are the effects.The film has none of the epic feel and gut-wrenching realism of Gladiator and only a pale shadow of the humour and romance (not to mention self-parody) of Braveheart. Clive Owen as Arthur plays himself well...unfortunately Clive Owen doesn't really cut it in the self-acting mould in the way that, say, Clint Eastwood does. Keira Knightly's Guinevere is creditable but has too few decent lines to lift the film from rock bottom.Most scandalous for me was Ray Winstone's almost "Carry On..."-style performance as Bors, one of Arthur's knights. Perhaps he wasn't being paid enough to make it look like he cared about this film or then again maybe he read the script and had enough self-respect not to dignify it with any serious acting.Most of the rest of Arthur's knights (Lancelot, Tristan, Gawain &amp; Dagonet played respectively by Ioan Gruffudd, Mads Mikkelsen, Joel Edgerton &amp; Ray Stevenson) along with the Saxon warlord and his son (Stellan Skarsg?rd &amp; Til Schweiger) added a little character and interest but again, nothing they could do could rescue the film. And as for Galahad (Hugh Dancy), well he really should go back to doing his paper round or assistant third barrow boy in an episode of East Enders.Finally an appeal: make the people who made this film pay for robbing me of the money I spent to sit through this turgid rubbish - don't go and see it at the cinema, don't rent or buy the DVD and when it comes out on TV hold your nose and sit with your back to the screen in protest!</fullReview>

This movie es Good, but not too good for been a real history, i think that this movie could be done with more pretensions to be an important movie and not with pretensions of been a commercial movie. Again, the actings are good,not excellent, just good, the only wrong thing is that this movie has a lot of inspiration lines and they are not too good, so, please, even that the only thing i can't understand is that you see a lot of fight's and you don't see any blood, c'mon, is not like i'am a bloody person, but Arthur was killing people, not taking the tea with them. So even a few mistakes this movie is pretty good, even for me is like a good entertainment, so, is not a torture, maybe i will seen it another time, just if my mom want's to take me to the theater. This movie is good, maybe to good to be an summer box-office movie, is just that maybe came in the wrong time. For the other hand this movie is not to good for been the real history of king arthur, maybe i will still believe in the Fantasy history, with dragons and magic, that was more fantastic history, and that was a fantastic arthur.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..it's quite entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a telling of Arthur the Roman who became Arthur, King of the Brits.The story's set in GB, during winter. The Romans pull back, but one group of recruited Samaritans, led by Arthur, must go on a last quest before they can be free men: they must save an outpost.The group has an attitude towards the romans, nonetheless they kill their own people. However as they discover the romans at the outpost are really inhumane (towards their own people) they decide to cooperate with their own people again to fight the saxes, who are intruding their lands.The storyline is absolutely chronological and has no climax or sudden plot-turns. The movie starts with Lancelot telling the story of his getting recruited, which then is abandoned. The motives are the quest for the outpost and the defeat of the saxes. Another (less obvious) motive is the pagan knights arguing gods and beliefs, although the pagan group is loyal to it's Christian/roman leader. The most characters are flat, they do not show (emotional) progression in personality, some of the main characters don't even have a clear personality. If one must define the characters one could discover the pagan, the funny killing giant, the leader and the flirter.The theme of the movie is loyalty, arthur wants to die for his followers, the group turns out to be loyal to it's own country, and together they fight the foe.The movie is for a great deal a big fight, however Arthur, a decorated roman commander comes up with no special tactics.Conclusion: Although this warriors' saga has no gore or significant genialities, and there too many things that haven't had much thought on it, it's quite entertaining. Personal rating: 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally, a film about King Arthur and his knights that is as close to the truth as it will ever get. There was nothing mystical about these people. They lived a hard and sometimes cruel life. Just to survive was an accomplishment in that time. I thoroughly enjoyed the battle scenes, especially the bow and arrow and the sword play. The battle scenes are very realistic and the horsemanship is outstanding. The scene of all seven on the hill in their battle dress astride those beautiful horses, also decked out in battle gear, was one I will never forget. I will purchase this movie for my collection when available. Thank you to all cast and crew for a movie well done and for giving me a few hours of peace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About as historically accurate as The Sword In The Stone, but good in parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films based on the Arthurian legend vary from the superb [Excalibur], to the awful [First Knight], to the okay Camelot]. This one promised to be one of the most interesting. An attempt to portray the 'Real King Arthur'without all that fantasy stuff, and supposedly based on 'recent archaeological findings"' It's not unenjoyable, and at times is actually quite good. One thing is certain though- the claims of historical accuracy are complete nonsense.Of course no one should expect any film to be completely factual, and there are differing opinions on Arthur anyway, with this film offering just one view. However, anybody with a basic grasp of history will notice things like the Battle Of Badon Hill taking place a century earlier than it actually did. Unlike in this film, the Saxons did not even threaten Britain until well after all the Romans had left. And it's best not to even ponder idiocies like a Roman nobleman living beyond Hadrian's Wall in isolation yet the area being so dangerous that Arthur and his knights are warned not to go there. Also, how come the Saxons never have ANY archers?Also annoying is that the filmmakers, despite the supposed grit and realism, keep throwing in names and elements familiar from the legend, and then hardly mention them again. Why have Lancelot and Guinevere glance at each other ,and then have nothing come of it? The film would have been better off without them glancing at each other at all. At least the round table looks good.Yet as a simple actioner the film isn't bad. There could have been more fighting, but the battles, especially the lengthy final one, are pretty good despite being obviously edited down to get a lower rating, and there is some stunning photography especially during the scenes set around snow. Yes, the film has a bleak look ,but it's an oddly beautiful kind of bleakness, and it really gives the 'Dark Ages' feel that the filmmakers elsewhere struggled to achieve. Clive Owen is adequate, but sees ill at ease, and is not helped by the fact that we don't really know what motivates his character to do what he does. His knights are hardly characterised at all, except for Ray Winstone, who as usual just grunts and shouts.In fact this is really a film to see and not hear. Some of the dialogue is horrendous ["don't worry, I'll stop them from raping you", says Guinevere to Arthur before one battle with the Saxons] and composer Hans Zimmer once again is under the assumption that a synthesizer played very loud is a good substitute for a full orchestra. When it comes down to it, though, it's the script that is the film's biggest problem. With some decent rewriting and a few changes, this could have really been a fine, if still historically suspect, film. As it is, this is still just about worth seeing ,if only to think of the film that could have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent movie, but they should have kept King Arthur out of it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film King Arthur and the knights of the round table are portrayed as Soldiers fighting for the Roman Empire. They are stationed in Britain and try to protect the Roman outpost from the Woad's living north of Hadrian's Wall. They have to embark on one final mission to get their freedom.The problem with this film is that they have mixed the King Arthur tale with a historic event. In my mind it just doesn't work. The movie would have been much better if they instead of using King Arthur would have found an actual roman commander and made the film about him or something like that. Instead they have taken the names and all the classic King Arthur moments and put them into a historical context in a rather disappointing way.If I don't regard the poor relation between the tale and this film I would give it 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>who killed King Arthur?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**My moneys on Peter Jackson.Now before I start getting flamed by all the rest of the geeky fan boys and girls out there, let me qualify my statement. I love LOTR, but PJ has spoiled me. Every epic battle film now has to be judged against his magnificent work, and inevitably is found wanting. King Arthur never really stood a chance.I'm a big fan of the legends of Arthur, in all their forms - Mallory's medieval fantasies, Bernard Cornwell's bloody Saxon imaginings, Boorman's sexy violence . . . . so I was really looking forward to seeing this film. Then I started seeing the trailers. 'THE TRUE STORY!!!'Granted, the main thread of the story does have some basis in historical fact. The Sarmatian warriors existed, as did Artorius Castus. However, to call this 'the true story' is ludicrous at best, at worst, it is yet another insulting example of big budget American film directors hijacking OUR history for their own ends. I'm sure I don't need to to dwell on the many inaccuracies - using the Castus thread should have excluded Guinevere, Lancelot and Excalibur; why did the Saxons invade via Scotland, etc etc etc.It's all been done to death by people who are better informed than I am. I could have put all that stuff to one side, if only the film had been good enough. But it wasn't.Visually, I liked it. I wish I lived in the Britain it depicted. Those blue skies, rolling green hills, spectacular snow covered mountains . . . . simply stunning. The confusion of the battlefield was well shot and it looked like it had been done the old fashioned way with lots of enthusiastic extras rather than CG characters. The scene on the frozen river was superb, well shot and extremely dramatic. The knights and the Britons looked terrific, if a little homogeneous. And Keira Knightley had some very pretty dresses; if a little impractical - I'm sure that she'd have been a little chilly on that river, not mention the fact that those sleeves would have been tangling in her bowstring something painful.The story as well, was well thought out, if a little predictable. Where the film fell over was the lack of characterisation, appalling acting and pandering to the censors.It was extremely difficult to tell the knights apart. I'm pretty well up on who is who, but I really struggled. Without some prior knowledge of the subject, I would have really been struggling. We had brooding knight with a birdy, brooding knight who wants to go home, honourable knight who wants to go home, ugly knight who talks about having a p*** a lot, ugly knight with a heart of gold . . . . Even the official website can't keep track of them, confusing Galahad and Gawain. The Saxons were even less well defined, and we only met two of them! There was big hairy daddy Saxon and big bald son Saxon. I never heard any names used during the film. All the characters were incredibly 2D and it was difficult to feel much for them. Ioan Gruffyd did his best, but it was obvious that many of his scenes had been butchered to pander to the American test audiences. The much vaunted chemistry between Lancelot and Guinevere was reduced to his catching a glimpse of her shoulder whilst she had a wash. Keira Knightley did her best to be a dramatic warrior queen, but was fighting a losing battle with her lackluster leading man. Clive Owen was unbelievably awful in this film. His Arthur had an impossibly square jaw and SHOUTED A LOT. If I'd have been one of his knights I'd have finished him off myself long before this stage. He had only one scene where he was at all believable - where he threatened the bishop.And finally, the epic battle scenes. Where no one ever sheds any blood. All the elements of a great epic battle where there, but they had been sanitised. Thus vanquished enemies simply sigh and roll over. There is no blood, and no real pain. In order to get around showing this side of the battlefield, we instead get repetition after repetition - Arthur riding towards the camera and 'beheading it', Tristan slo-mos towards Cerdic, Arthur slo-mos towards Cerdic, Guinevere slo-mos towards Cynric etc etc. And the happy ever after ending just made me feel nauseous.To summarise then. King Arthur had all the ingredients of a perfect Summer Blockbuster. But once again, Bruckheimer over eggs the pudding and cooks it at too high a temperature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another interpretation of the Arthurian myth. A little reluctant to see the film because of its claims to be the 'true story' of Arthur, I was pleasantly surprised. As the Arthurian myth appears to have grown over time from several sources any such claim is likely to prove controversial.The portrayal of Arthur's knights was more realistic for not having been over polished. Ray Winstone was particularly welcome as Bors provided some much needed light relief and Mads Mikkelsen as Tristan made me want to discover more about the background of his character. The interaction between the knights was excellent. I think too much was left unsaid about Lancelot in the final cut as the film makes much of him early on. I wouldn't be surprised to see a bit more in an extended edition or in deleted scenes in a DVD release. I'm reluctant to say much more about Lancelot because he is a later addition to the Arthurian myth. As Cerdic (Stellan Skarsg?rd) was convincingly intimidating and thankfully intelligent. Guinevere was a little too polished for me and I was surprised that there was so little explained about Merlin and the 'Woads'. Personally I prefer my Merlins welsh. All in all I would say that the story is good but there were some aspects of the history that jarred. I would have preferred to get to know more about the characters, but it was a much better film than I expected to see. I think it touched lightly on many issues that I would have preferred to see treated in greater depth but I can appreciate why.One moment I particularly appreciated was enhanced by good use of the soundtrack, which I would imagine will prove quite popular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More "Braveheart" than "Gladiator"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years, I've enjoyed many entertaining movies produced by Jerry Bruckheimer from "Top Gun" to "Pirates Of The Caribbean" and once again there is the rousing score (written by Hans Zimmer) and the great action sequences (filmed in Ireland), with a battle scene on a frozen lake particularly exciting, but sadly there are too many weaknesses to make this a success in the vein of "The Rock" or "Black Hawk Down".The chief deficiency - as in far too many movies - is in the script. I could have forgiven the total recasting of the Arthurian legend, down to its repositioning centuries earlier than is normally suggested back to the contraction of the Roman Empire, if there had been a half-decent plot and some less stilted lines, surprising absences given that the writer David Franzoni authored the script for "Gladiator". It may not be the classic story as depicted in John Boorman's "Excalibur", but new research has fundamentally revised the myths.The other main weakness is in the casting. "Gladiator" had Russell Crow and "Troy" had Brad Pitt, true stars with charismatic presence, but Clive Owen as Arthur cannot rise above his essentially television persona and Keira Knightly, lovely and spirited though she, is too young and has too few lines as Guinevere. In fact, the best performances come from Ray Winstone as one of Arthur's rough-hewn knights and Stellan Skarsg?rd as the leader of the brutal Saxons.If you can live with these faults and keep your expectations in check, then this is a reasonably uplifting action movie that attempts to do for early English nationalism what "Braveheart" did for Scotland.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so the legend of King Arthur is one that we've all heard before so knowing that you'd expect to see a great, action packed, smash at the box office film. But instead you get a washed out, unrealistic version of events that could have been portrayed better. What disappointed me the most was that, in the past we've seen movies such as Merlin, Excalibur and Mists of Avalon so we all know the way the story is meant to be told. But in place of this we get a completely twisted version of the tale King Arthur and are prone to reflect on previous movies to decide on a verdict.Don't get me wrong the movie was a good watch if you put aside all other King Arthur type movies and just focus on the screen, not the past. But i was highly disappointed in the tedious roles the characters were given. Overall this movie could have been a lot better. The most dramatic scene was the end battle, it laid everything on the line but was also quite predictable. This movie was more about morals and freedom than about the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roman knights??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not shocked that this was nothing to do with the great Arthurian legend, Camelot, Merlin, dragons and all that bollox as I knew before I went to the flicks; something I suggest you do if you want to see it is read up about it because if you were expecting magic and dragons then you are going to be severely disappointed. Putting all that aside, it is still a good film to watch (Although Clive Owen talks in monotone the entire length of the film). The battle scenes are realistic and not stupid overdone uneducated Hollywood crap. How true this story is I don't know, but I do know that there is no such thing as a Knight who uses a bow. Under no circumstances does a knight use a ranged weapon, and neither do they come from the east. This film gives the idea that a knight is simply a man on a horse with a sword. That is not the case. In fact the whole knight idea wasn't conjured up until the 11th century, the beginning of the feudal system. At the end of the film the 6 knights are lined up on the brow of a hill all wearing bizarre armour. Lancelot looked more like a Mongol than a western knight. The Woads and Saxons look historically correct but it is unlikely that the barbarians of Caledonia (Scotland) would show friendly to outsiders. That is very Hollywood forgetting that, still a great film and the ice battle is class!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Clichéd, unoriginal piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was not to my liking, the dialogue was poor, the plot cliché ridden. You had a fairly good idea of what was about to be said or what would happen next. The bit on the ice was a good use of CGI, but I kept thinking back to Eisenstein and Prince Igor. One costume worn by Keira Knightley was just plain ridiculous, she can do better, as can most of the rest of the cast. An interesting idea but one that that very little was done with. It was a pity that a bunch of decent actors was given such an uninspiring script.My main concern was yet another piece that was unfairly derogatory towards Christianity. Incidentally I looked up this Pelagius fella that Arthur was raving about, he was a heretic with some very dangerous ideas on sin and redemption. This movie passed the time, it had some half decent battle scenes but little else to recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(minor spoiler contained herein)I went to see King Arthur expecting a cool Hollywood yarn with great production values. On that score, I wasn't disappointed. Everything - esp. the knights, and also Guinevere - looked great, the historical era was interesting, the action was impressive and well-choreographed (yep, the scene on the ice is the high-point of the movie).But, storytelling-wise it had many shortcomings. The timing and pacing of the scenes were insufficient to evoke any emotional response from me. And while the characters were generally good and well-acted, their interaction had no real depth. The relationship between Arthur and Guinevere in particular was dull and without substance (though that could have been intentional, if Guinevere was just seducing him in order to get him to lead her people - but that doesn't jibe very well with her fascination for the stories her father had told her of Arthur).There were a couple of places where I *almost* felt something, like when Tristan's hawk flies through the smoky sky as he dies. But generally we don't get into the characters head and emotions *at all*, except to a degree Arthur's feelings about Rome and such. We never get to feel for these people as human beings, and that's where the movie falls short. A real shame, too, because it would have been a really good movie if they'd gotten that part right.6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>entertaining, whether accurate or not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSEverybody always talks about historical accuracy, whilst at the same time, others attempt to add entertainment to the mix. Eventually what evolves is a film which attempts to entertain the audience but do this as truthfully as possible. With the legend of King Arthur, lots of people have their theories. Some claim he was Roman, some claim he was Welsh, some claim he was Roman, some Scots have even started to claim he was Scottish. With this "factual" version of his story however, irrelevant of whether it's accurate or not, Antoine Fuqua has created a fun, action packed movie which keeps the audience entertained.In this version of events, Arthur (or whatever the Roman wording is) is a Roman General who leads a group of Samerians around Britain. Keeping south of Hadrian's Wall and fighting Merlin's occasional little invasion, life is Hell for Arthur and his troops who all just want to return to their homelands. On their final day as conscripts of the Roman army however, this band of knights are sent on one final quest to rescue a Roman family. On this quest, Arthur will find his loyalties tested and he will meet his future Queen.Now "King Arthur" is not a bad film. It starts perhaps too slowly, and the script is absolutely abysmal, but it is an action movie, and that's all it was ever meant to be. With Clive Owen, Ioan Gruffudd, Ray Winstone and Kiera Knightley, the film has an ensamble of decent British actors who can perform adequately. Unfortunately for Owen and Gruffudd, their characters never properly develop and are giving some awful lines to spout. In contrast, Knightley and Winstone are given some beauties which they deliver well. Winstone in particular as the violent father Bors is superb as he walks around drinking, making comments about his lover and fighting.With Antoine Fuqua as director, it is easy to feel negative. With his most famous previous work being "Training Day" (2001), he doesn't at first glance look like the right man to direct this film. He is however brilliant. At times with this film, the shots and organisation of this film is superb. In fact, if anything Fuqua is unlueky. Sacrificing the majority of the legend in favour of what he is told is the true story, he sacrifices a lot of what attracts people to the legend of King Arthur. Merlin is a brilliant leader, but not a magician, Excalibur is simply Arthur's sword, and there is no love affair between Lancelot and Gwenever. By doing this, Fuqua has opened himself up for criticism, but this would be unfair. Another brilliant example is the fight scenes, the final battle in particular takes a while to get going, and the reasoning is that Fuqua has shown that Arthur was a tactical genius, sacrificing simple disorganised chaos (like most films) for a plan of action splitting troops up and fighting the battle tactically. Whilst not perhaps as enjoyable as simply having your heroes running into a crowd of enemies and emerging victorious, this tactical astuteness is more realistic and ultimately more satisfying.There are countless philosophical viewpoints which can be raised from this film, mainly bringing into play the negative view the film appears to take on Christianity and the Roman ideals. Ultimately however, "King Arthur" feels like it has tried hard to balance entertainment with a popularist view of the legend. Whether this new take on the story is accurate or not, that should not matter. This film is entertaining, not straight from the start, but from about twenty minutes in through to the end. It might not be the best historical "Epic" piece ever (that title will always go to "Gladiator" from 2000), but it's still an entertaining film worthy of viewing. A definate seven out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite what I'd hoped...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had hoped that it would be good... I'll sum it up like this: it had good scenes but wasn't all that great overal.There were certain things that I thought extremely well done, for example Arthur's body language, use of the local scenery, the sounds of the drums, the way the themes of honesty and equality wove wonderfully through the film... And of course, the effects of the snow and ice, especially when the ice was breaking up. Yes, I'll admit I'm a horse lover but there was something entracing about the gracefulness of the horses... I think the director did a lot to make certain things visible yet still keep them subtle. Very nicely done, in my opinion.However, and now comes the bad news: some things just weren't done as nicely as they could have been. For example, I knew that the movie was supposed to be a new take on Arthurian legend. However, by taking the road less traveled, the film makers took a larger chance: in my opinion they did not spend enough time on the Romans. For example, who built the great wall? What was the difference between the Saxtons and the Woads? Why did the Woads have purple skin? Why did the bishop have to go to Britian - just to give the release papers? Who was the Roman traitor? As you can see, there were an unfortunate number of plotholes.I enjoyed the film, though had expected more and was rather confused at times. It's worth seeing for the themes, the acting, cinametogeaphy...The general feeling of the film - yet don't expect too much. The movie had excellent scenes but ddn't quite come together as a whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>who killed King Arthur?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**Some might say Clive Owen. Others might say Antoine Fuqua. I say it was Peter Jackson.Now before all the geeky fan guys and girls start flaming me, let me expand. I loooooove PJ. He's a god. But frankly, he's ruined epic action movies for me because none of them ever seem to live up to the precedent he set with LOTR.King Arthur is no exception. Now I was a little torn about this film. On the one hand, I love the King Arthur myths - in all their forms - and a couple of hours of heroic guys in armour with bows sounds great to me. On the other hand, I object to a gung-ho Yank - yes Bruckheimer, that's you - rewriting my history, and telling me that he's going to tell 'the true story'. I'm not going to go into all that stuff right now, it's been done to death already. If they'd gone down the Troy route of being 'inspired by' or 'based on' I'd have been a whole lot happier. But really, what were the Saxons doing invading through Scotland? But of a detour, what?Anyway, what did I like about this film? Well, it looked spectacular. I wish I lived in a Britain that looked like that. The battle scene on the river was incredibly shot - the bright blue sky contrasting with the dazzling whiteness of the snow and the dark leather and furs of the warriors. The costume design was magnificent - the richness of the Roman armour, the dirty peasants, the British warriors, and of course Guinevere's pretty dresses. But why was she wearing one of them on the river to shoot in? As well as being frozen, those trailing sleeves would have been tangling with her bowstring and causing no end of trouble.The supporting knights were well cast, if not given much to do. I spent the first 30 minutes of the film desperately trying to sort one from another. Even the official website confuses Galahad and Gawain. Nice to see Europeans cast in most of the major roles, although I really don't understand why the obviously Scandinavian actor playing Cerdic gave him an accent straight out of the Deep South. What didn't I like? Well Clive Owen deserves a special mention. Having an impossibly square jaw and SHOUTING A LOT does not an actor make. At only one stage could I take him seriously - his dire threat to the bishop - 'neither the Church . . . '. The battle scenes were well shot but so heavily edited that they lost all sense of danger. First Tristan slo-mos towards towards Cerdic, then Guinevere slo-mos towards Cynric ( just as well I checked the credits, otherwise they'd be hairy guy and bald guy). Then Lancelot slo-mos towards Guinevere, and Arthur . . . that got tiresome really quickly.Well, this could go on forever. Lets try and wrap it up. King Arthur should have been excellent, it had all the right ingredients. But once again, Bruckheimer over eggs the pudding and cooks it at waaaay too high a temperature. Terribly disappointing. The website is ace though!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The poor casting of Owen and Knightly is not in itself enough to excuse the mess that this film is. Sure Owen had no presence and made no mark on the screen, sure Knightly just is not substantial enough to play strong warrior princess type, surrounded by supporting cast doing their best with really bad material and complete lack of direction this film should have been great. The photography was stunning, the budget massive, it just wasn't enough to cover up for a lack of original vision. 30 mins in I wanted to leave with the cumbersome dialogue and cliché after cliché shot and music but I was trapped in the middle of my row, and trying to give this a chance. From the bored Saxon King to the clichéd cute children this film just lacked the original vision that the marketing claimed it had, it was boring, weakly acted, poorly cast and finally poorly edited. Lack of originality strangled this movie for me. I am just thankful there isn't a 'Son of Arthur' coming up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ASTOUNDING CIMEMATIC ACHIEVEMENT BUT LACKS EMOTIONAL IMPACT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies like this can be amazing. And King Arthur certainly is. I believe it breaks new ground in many ways. It doesn't sugar coat what was more than likely the truth about the origin of the British Empire as it was to become. Its gritty and dark and rough with just enough humor to make it real and human. However, I can't help but to miss an element that I believe to be essential with such historic dramas, a sense of intimate sentimentality. Call me goofy, but I longed for the emotional union that we enjoyed in Braveheart, as well as the extreme, obvious passion of William Wallace in the same movie. I kept hoping that something would develop in the drama that would really pull me in on a gut level. I never really felt like I was part of the drama, so it was difficult for me for fully associate with the characters. No doubt, this was a one-of-a-kind movie that tries to place us into the action, let us smell the dirt. But I just didn't FEEL it. Even though the fighting scenes were intense, what we didn't get, like we experienced with Braveheart, was the real bloodiness and terror of war. I missed that. I wanted to feel that I might've had a stake in the action, that my forefather was duking it out with the Visigoths and that I was invited to join the fray. The acting was above average, and the set designs were incredible. Just give me Braveheart one more time. A strong 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of your reviewers did not know what to expect going in. That's unfortunate. They should have realized that this was meant to approximate a "possible" historic Arthur, not the Arthur of legend. I have tried to keep abreast of the latest research surrounding the Arthurian romance and I was looking forward to this treatment with anticipation.I was really into this film for an hour. It could have been this way, I reasoned. The music score greatly helps to enforce this feeling. Then I began to realize that Clive Owen was not emotionally charged for the action, nor the love scene. I also had a hard time envisioning Guinevere as a warrior. There is no way she could compete with a towering man twice her weight. Besides, I don't know if women in battle is historically accurate. (Joan d'Arc being a remarkable exception).I really wanted this film to succeed but it obviously hasn't. Nevertheless, it is a step in the right direction (hence my 6 rating) and should prepare future film makers for something meaningful. It should be obvious to ALL that Arthur is not going away; not the historic Arthur nor the Legend. The tale is just too good to lose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS: The legend of Arthur is so replete with wonderful stories and ideas that a film about the real folk who inspired these tales should have been fantastic. But this movie most decidedly was NOT. AS a reader and lover of all things Arthurian, I believe I could have written a better script.And I think I could have done a better job as director because I would have fired the producer. Then the film might not have been gutted.Therefore, perhaps the story would have made some kind of sense; the characters would have been supported by back story and would have not have appeared to be so ridiculous; and audiences would have actually cared who won the battles.Clive Owen is a nice looking man. But he is totally exposed as a twit in this film with very little help from the director or script, therefore his big 'dramatic' scenes were laughable. By the end of the film I was hoping he'd take an arrow in the chest and stop bellowing such inspirational claptrap.The wonderful actor who played Lancelot should sue. This movie should have made him an international star. Instead his body was stuffed into a hole, lit up, and the movie quickly moves on to the wedding.Kiera worked hard to look good and wield a bow with authority, but without a back story, she was some blue chick who seemed to know a lot more than seemed probable and suddenly appeared half naked to do battle. Who knew?I could continue to list flaws, but enough. The bright spots? The score and I learned that there is a Danish actor named Mads Mickellson (sp) who can play a very convincing ninja and is very sexy. Sadly he gets sliced and diced at the end and his body thrown around like a sack of potatoes, but at least his hawk flies free and he lives on as a horse. So that's a consolation of sorts (?).The 'creators' of this film did not 'get' either the story or their likely audience. Totally and completely disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thankfully this Arthur does not come with a wife, 3 kids and a labrador</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit I was sceptical to see that Jerry Bruckheimer was making King Arthur - an excuse to combine the magnitude of Gladiator with the blood-thirsty self-righteousness of Braveheart for the lucrative (Northern) summer season. However where Braveheart takes the truth and turns it into a fairytale, this movie actually lifts the legend of King Arthur from the almost inherent campness of other productions to offer something both thoughtful and entertaining.I've heard and read a lot said about Clive Owen's understated performance as King Arthur and on reflection I have to disagree with the bulk of what has been said. Owen, I believe, has deliberately avoided offering too much to ensure King Arthur remains an enigmatic character - he is a Captain of a Roman unit, he tells people what to do he doesn't explain why or how. Thankfully this Arthur does not come with a wife, 3 kids and a labrador - he is what he is, a warrior who cares for the people.I was also impressed with the battle scenes that got their point across without becoming exploitative. So too was the photography which enhanced the movie without turning it into a postcard for Irish tourism.There were faults - no doubt the medieval scholars will have a ball pointing out the anarchronisms and yes the role of Guinevere is wasted on Keira Keightly. However the movie has stayed true to the heart of the Arthurian legends - that of people who would stand up and protect the weak and innocent, of their loyalty and of their refusal to betray the trust placed in them. As a fan of the legend I'm glad I did actually go and see the film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is based on a more realistic portrayal of "Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere" than other movies and TV stories have told before. The film focuses on the history and politics of the period during which Arthur ruled. The Roman empire is collapsing and battles were waging with the pagans and the Norseman. The film itself isn't too bad but hardly a blockbuster event. It is entertaining and that is mostly because of the charismatic Clive Owen as Arthur and the sometimes show stealing performance by Ray Winstone as the knight Bors. His character development is both believable and heroic. Of course from a guy standpoint Keira Knightly looks as lovely as ever if not radiant at times.

		<shortDescription>It could be the true story -- but it gets it all wrong anyway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to begin....Yes, there is a connection between Arthur and the Sarmatians. But the idea of Sarmatian boys being drafted in their homeland is all wrong. A whole retired regiment of Sarmatian mercenaries was settled in Britain in the 2nd century, and they continued to live there as a distinct cultural enclave for two hundred years that we know of, and probably into the Arthurian era. Their original commander was named Lucius (personal name) Artorius (family name) Castus (sub-family name). A descendant of his /might have been/ the real Arthur. On the other hand, it's also possible that his name became a word for "General" among the British Sarmatians.If the "Woad People" are supposed to be Britons, it's wrong; the Britons were Christian and Romanized by Arthur's time. If they're supposed to be the Picts, it's still wrong; the Picts were just as bad as the Saxons, attacking the Britons from the north while the Saxons attached from the east. (Yes, the east; if you sail from the Netherlands and/or Denmark to Britain, you don't normally arrive in Scotland.)Pelagius, as far as we know, died a natural death, and was not condemned as a heretic in his lifetime. And the movie's notion that Pelagius's theological ideas concerning free will are somehow related to Jeffersonian notions of political freedom is so confused as nearly to constitute a pun.Most of the knights named (Lancelot, Galahad, Dagonet....) are almost certainly creations of French literary works, not found in the early legends. And Dagonet was Arthur's /jester/. Bors is very likely a Sarmatian name, though.Add to this a jumpy plot, clumsy cinematography (the layout of the land at the climactic battle is incomprehensible, and the action is shot from both flanks, a gross cinematic sin), bad continuity (giant gates that need to be turned by Clydesdales in one scene apparently open and close by sheer magic in another scene), scenes that go nowhere.... It's a mess.Now understand, it's not absolutely disgusting. You can watch it, as long as you don't take it too seriously. And it /is/ truer to what probably really happened than any other Arthurian movie I know of. And Keira Knightley is a total hottie. But "King Arthur" is still a mess.</fullReview>

Now if you look at the behind the scenes of this movie, you will be finding yourself saying, why in the hell did they screw it up. you have writers and producers form the Pirates of the Caribbean and Training Day, two great movies. Along with the Director of Training Day and Jerry Bruckhiemer. the cast was wonderful, the acting was pretty good, and this movie had the makings of a VERY good movie, but when you don't have good character development, and you don't have in-depth story lines, and you don't follow some of the underlying story of King Arther, this movie gets knocked down to a Saterday morning movie. a movie you watch when your bored.I enjoyed sitting through this movie, but i didn't like the way that Lancelot Narrorates the story then fades into the background as a character below a supporting character, as well as some of the other characters. Most characters have their debut in the first part of the movie, and throughout the movie they fade into the background, including Bars, Lancelot, Merlin and Guin... another thing i would have liked to see is MORE MERLIN, he's in the movie what five minutes!... and i disagree with guys who say they wanted to hear more of the " Nights of the round table" and the whole excalibur thing. DOES NO ONE READ THE TEXT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE.. they are telling the true story, the excalibur and the " KNights of the round table" are what we made up to complete the legends. lay off the fairytale crap, they were trying to tell what really happened, so no Lancelot wasn't suppose to get Guin, and Merlin wasn't magical.I recommend this movie for a DVD rental, but people need to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How disappointing. I love fantasy and the legend of King Arthur, but recognizing that it's fiction made me open for a 'demystified' take on the story. I was ready for an Arthur with no Lady of the Lake, no magical sword in the stone, no wizardry from Merlin, no gleaming armor, etc. however, what I wasn't expecting was that it would be this dull.The reason truth becomes legend and legend becomes myth is because in the retelling, the detail get embellished and made (more) interesting. Apparently, stripped of myth, the original story was just plain boring. Or at least, this movie's telling of the story was boring."King Arthur" feels like a 3 1/2 hour movie ruthlessly chopped down to 2 hours 5 minutes. So many characters and events are touched upon but nothing is ever developed. Famous names are tossed about - Merlin, Guinevere, Lancelot, Galahad, Gawain, Tristan - but ultimately, since they are so sketchily characterized, their seems to be no reason for the famous names. They could be just any guy with a sword and a horse. In fact, it is the lesser known names that are more developed (such as Bors), but overall, I got the impression that character development scenes were cut in favor of (particularly bloodless) battle scenes.Motivation was lacking all around, from Arthur himself (what exactly was he fighting for anyway?) to the villainous invading Saxon played by Stellan Skarsg?rd (did he even have a name?) to the evil priest guy Arthur &amp; co. are supposed to rescue. People just act in ways that are required of them to further the plot, never because of any internal character-based motivation.Questions abound. Why was Arthur so loyal to Rome? Why were the knights (essentially slaves) so loyal to Arthur? Why were the Saxons invading? Why were the Romans at that outpost torturing people? Why (and when exactly) did Merlin &amp; Arthur join up? What was Arthur ever 'King' of?This movie *needed* to be rated 'R' and at least twice as long in order to tell the story completely and more realistically. It needed more character development and battle scenes that were more than just clashing CGI army and quick cuts of swords.On the plus side, Kiera Knightly as Guinevere kicked some ass and looked good doing it. The fight on the frozen ice was clever and well-filmed. And Ray Winstone as the knight Bors was a standout amongst the generally generic knights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say I am seriously in love with Keira Knightley and that was my reason for seeing this movie at first. But i was surprised. The action sequences were outstanding, the acting was great, the direction was great, and the story (script) was well written.Producer Jerry Bruckheimer has proven that he still has what it takes. I watch: The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, Enemy of the State, Crimson tide, Top Gun, Days of thunder and the CSI shows and say "wow" every time. when King Arthur comes to DVD, i'll be buying it and saying "wow" as much as i have to all the others.Again I'm in love with Keira Knightley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film, the reviews, the legend...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is always interesting to read the reviews of others in assessing a film that touches on traditional mythos in society. There is no shortage of reviewers from the UK who feel as if their legend has been tainted. Notably this film succeeds by attempting to integrate an actual historical investigation into the origins of the Arthur legend. As the basis for the film this works and adds a fresh perspective to the well known story. However, where the film begins to fade is the interjection of all of Arthur's mythological characters and props. Merlin is now the leader of the native tribes, Guinevere a pagan warrior, etc. The scene which has Arthur recollecting about his mother and Excalibur is especially contrived. Its not that these artistic liscenses have destroyed the fabric of the film, it is simply that in attempting to de-mystify the legend all they have done is reformulate the old myth in a different era...rather unoriginal but understandable. The film's major failing is in the direction which attempts to create the sense that this new legend must be supported by Hollywood superhero tactics which are so wholly laughable as to detract from the whole film. One expressly humorous scene shows a Knight with an arrow piercing his chest throw a sword twenty odd feet perfectly into his nemesis before he expires. Schwarzeneger would be proud. The funny thing here is that most of these annoyances could be edited out to save this film's credibility if anyone cared. Finally with all of these shortcomings the film is still actually enjoyable. The knights are all cast well and likable as men driven by their sense of freedom during Roman reign. Gruffudd, Mikkelsen, and Winstone all deserve mention. Here I believe the all-Euro casting succeeds at least in the US where fresher faces add a nuance to new mythos. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a little surprised by the low ratings. The good thing about them though is that I went to the theater with really low expectations :) And not very often I get that pleasantly surprised. I really liked the plot (though it really is different from what one might expect), the cinematography (battle scenes!) was excellent, the characters and the acting were pretty good too (though Clive Owen reminds me of Nicholas Cage which is not necessarily a good thing :).When comparing it to Troy, King Arthur was obviously not meant to be that huge, but I think this is why I actually liked it. The actors are not huge stars (yet?), which I believe did a favor to the film (they did not have to throw in Oscar-directed scenes like the one between Achilles and Priam in Troy - which to me just not always fit). Especially that they did a good job (and Kiera looks really cool in this one :)Final score: 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this is a move in the right direction!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a huge fan of Athurian literature and was so excited to see this film when I first saw it advertised. I have just come from it and was very happy with it! Frankly I was really sick of all the "knight in shining armor" versions as well as all the attempts to plausibly explain the "magical" legends of Arthur. Sure, there is a definite legend of Arthur,that is probably what has gotten most fans on the Arthurian boat! I personally fell in love with Arthurian EVERYTHING, after being introduced to it by the late Richard Harris in Camelot! but many stories and movies later I find myself yearning for a little of the realism that would have been present had Arthur been a real person. This is a step in the right direction! I would have liked to see the characters more developed, but the casting was wonderful. so glad not to see a bunch of popular American faces playing Arthur and his knights! The Guenevere storyline was a "surprise". It reminded me a bit of the Morgana character in "Firelord". This movie was such a huge change from "Excalibur "YUK! or "First Knight" triple YUK! I hope this inspires other artists to stick with the gritty natural version when writing their screenplays and leave the goofy magic stunts and shiny silver armor in the children's storybooks where it belongs.</fullReview>

The characters are all well defined and interesting. These knights were very cool, all were magnificent. I think that the scene on the frozen lake was brilliant. After seeing the film we all discussed our favourite moments and here are a few... Arthur wind swept with his banner on the hill top, Arthur challenging the Saxon leader, Tristin explaining his skill at knife throwing, the knights love for each other...well I could go on but I might as well say that the whole movie is my favourite scene. The creators of this movie understand "Cool" big time. I'll be adding this picture to my DVD collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Arthur Movie EVER!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really loved this film on so many levels. First, I for one am glad that the filmmakers decided to get past most of the romanticized chivalry related crap that has been tacked onto Arthurian legend over the centuries, in order to get to the roots of the story of Arthur (well, mostly). For those who found this confusing, its probably because they are used to the glittery, knightly, courtly stuff they see in most Arthurian related films like First Knight, Excalibur, etc. But scholars who study Arthur in order to find who the real man might have been would say that most of that was added on by later bards and storytellers to bring Arthur to more relevance in their own time. Now, granted, the filmmakers who made this movie do the same thing. King Arthur does try to appeal to modern audiences with wisecracking heroes and Braveheart like action.But at the center of the film is the core story of who Arthur probably was. Most Arthurian scholars now believe that King Arthur was a Roman general, possibly of Britanic heritage, who commanded forces in Roman Britain around the time of the fall of the western Roman Empire in 476 A.D. When the Romans began to pull out of Britain to defend their own home city from Barbarian invasions, the Saxons (a group from another part of Europe) invaded. Arthur and those forces who remained loyal to him joined forces with the Britons to drive off the Saxon invasion. Arthur became King, and a time of peace and prosperity came to Britain. That's the core story.Now, what about the round table and Camelot and Lancelot and Guinevere? Most scholars think most of these characters were added by later storytellers, along with Merlin the wizard and Excalibur and the mists of avalon. Its like telling a fish story. The fish gets bigger and bigger every time you tell the tale.What is so brilliant about this film is that it correctly places Arthur in terms of time and place, but at the same time preserves some of the characters and situations of later Athurian myth in such a way that it makes a nice mesh of historical facts (as far as can be determined) and folklore. This creates a wonderful texture of a time and place in our distant past, and one that is filled with fictional characters that are very interesting and exciting. The fictional characters themselves are created in such a way that they also belong in that time and place. Arthur's knights in the film, for example, are Samanian warriors from another part of Europe conquered by the Romans. They were drafted into the Roman Army for a certain term of service in Rome's provinicial forces, in this case their Britain garrison. This conscription really did occur in the later Roman imperial period. What you are really seeing on the screen in a historical context is the death of the Roman world (and the ancient western world along with it) and the birth of the Middle Ages. Beyond the historical stuff, this is a great action/adventure picture, filled with excellent sword play and medieval archery. Its very reminiscent of Braveheart in this respect. I highly recommend this film to everyone. The reviewers who panned this film are just plain wrong, in my humble opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I wasn't expecting much, after the long string of "same-old, same-old" Arthurian movies, this one was such a step away from the legend that it seemed refreshing. The acting was decent, with Keira Knightly doing an excellent job as a hard-ass Guenevere. Though the story started slowly, there was enough humor in it to keep the viewer interested until the battle scenes that drive this movie really kicked in. Without the central focus being on the Arthur-Guenevere-Lancelot love triangle, I was able to enjoy the knights' interactions more than any previous Arthur movie.Overall, it was a good show, with enough good character acting to keep me interested, and enjoying every minute of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit clumsy, but achieved its goal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To appreciate this movie, you have to understand what it was trying to achieve. Jerry Bruckheimer wanted battles. And more battles. Never mind that the film was just a bunch of battle scenes stitched together with a poor excuse for a plot; it wasn't supposed to be intellectually stimulating or filled with edge-of-your-seat suspense. An action movie is supposed to make your heart pound, make the adrenaline flow, to test the limits of the movie theater's sound system. With its battle scenes, King Arthur achieved its objective.The battles were masterfully executed, and there was just the right balance between battles and the minimal plot required to get from one battle to the next. The love scene between Guinevere and Arthur was kind of useless; it seemed to me as if the editors said, "Where are we gonna put this scene? Ah, hell, right there's as good as any; it doesn't make sense anyway."The acting was merely OK, but that didn't detract very much since they didn't have much of a plot to support anyway. Clive Owen didn't strike me as a heroic leader whose courage and bravery eventually became the stuff of legend. However, everyone else did their best with what they were given. I think the star of the show was Ray Winstone, the big knight Bors with the Cockney accent. The accent of course makes no sense, but whatcha gonna do? Deserving an honorable mention was Ivano Marescotti, portraying Bishop Germanius. He radiated evilness and slime. Keira Knightley...I know she's a good actress from her performance in PotC, but here she wasn't too great. The character wasn't much to work with, though, so that's excusable.I did say it achieved its goal quite well, but it's not clear what that goal is at first. The fact that King Arthur claims to be historically accurate makes you think at first that it might actually be historically accurate. Of course it's not. For that, and for the mediocre acting and the pointless love scene, my rating is 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see the reason for the despair of some of the viewers - true appreciation of the film requires more knowledge of ancient British history than is being served in North American curriculum. To a historian like myself, the film is surprisingly true to the little that is known (or surmised) of Arthur, and invented elements do not conflict with historical facts. Well, with the possible exception of locating the story near Hadrian's Wall - traditionally, Arthur ruled over Wessex, which is some distance away. I found Arthur not too convincing in this film, but otherwise the movie is worth watching. One might learn something about ancient Britons, or at least straighten out some confusion. And it is always educational to see how a myth could have been born.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like this summer's earlier swords 'n' serfs epic Troy, the makers of King Arthur aim to pierce viewers' hearts with historical accuracy and earnestness... and miss. This is about as accurate a depiction of Arthurian legend as Monty Python And The Holy Grail, only a lot less fun.If you're going to do away with mysticism in favour of grit and realism (here, Merlin's just a bored old hippy), you'd better up the action ante. Sadly, the zillionth and zillion-and-first battle scenes of the movie year take place on ridiculously well-manicured battlefields and are strictly PG affairs with less bloodletting than a quiet episode of ER. Pity the acting doesn't meet ER standards, either.Clive Owen would make a great James Bond, but the magnitude of this role escapes him. A few decent lines of dialogue might have helped (this should have been called Blow Hard) or perhaps it's because he has to play the straight-man to Winstone's scene-stealing Bors; either way he looks utterly ill-at-ease. The immaculately-eyebrowed Keira Knightley is game and looks a million dollars but as an actress she's two-bit. (Judging by their final scene together, the Lancelot/Guinevere dynamic has been virtually edited out.) And someone obviously told Stellan Skarsgard to do his best Geoffrey Rush impersonation as the Saxon leader.The scene on the frozen lake provides a high point, but otherwise this will just induce a lot of fidgeting and several unintentional laughs. More Bors, less bores.</fullReview>

Arthur was not a medieval king - if he ever existed (and that's a whole other matter) he lived right about the time the Romans left (ignore the other review - the date is near enough bang on).It certainly knocks the competition (namely First Knight and Excalibur - both terrible films) sideways. Maybe not a contender for film of the year, but well worth checking out.Course for the best take on the story check out the Python's Quest for the Holy Grail - now that really was a different reworking of an old tale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"King Arthur" takes a different approach than most representations of Arthurian legend, but unfortunately the final product does little to distinguish itself from other cinematic stories, which is why it is suffering a dismal box office fate ($38 mil so far), even though it probably deserves somewhat better. The opening title card claims that the movie is set in the Dark Ages, based on the true stories behind the medieval legends. That means we don't see actual kings or typical knights, but rather an armor-clad Magnificent Seven, a posse in the service of the Holy Roman Empire. Led by Arthur (Clive Owen) with all of the commonly known men in tow (Lancelot, Tristan, etc.), the septuplet fights for various causes and freedoms in Britain. Along the way, they encounter a completely different representation of Guinevere (Keira Knightley). Instead of the usual damsel-in-distress, she is now a warrior princess of the Woads, an Indian-like indigenous people of Britain who are fighting to maintain possession of their land. Regardless of actual veracity, the story is wholly believable enough despite a couple glaring question marks. The base problem with King Arthur is similar to, though not as severe as, that which plagued the last screen incarnation of the legend, "First Knight". Like "Lord of the Rings", Arthurian tales (or anything similar) should soar, inspiring awe with action, visuals, and nobility. While King Arthur contains flashes of brilliance (i.e. the brief flashback to Arthur's youth, or round table visuals), the inconsistencies in pace and tone do not allow the viewer to become emotionally involved. Some of that is due to director Antoine Fuqua's inability to direct battle-driven movies. He showed it in "Tears of the Sun", and he repeats his errors here. In neither film does he bother to distinguish much between the various protagonists. Lancelot, Galahad, Gawain, Tristan...these men are legendary, and here they are reduced to being one-trick ponies instead of pillars of greatness and nobility. The battle scenes, which should highlight the movie, are possess little sense of direction or overall momentum, but overly concentrate on individual conflicts (which are decent) within a generic mass fray. Plus the movie was hampered by its clear intentions of avoiding an R rating. The entire movie, whether it be battle scenes, jokes, or love scenes, feels censored, a notch tamer than the circumstances warrant. That tempers the movie into something lesser than the premises promise. That's a shame, because it wastes the splendid cinematography efforts of Slawomir Idziak (Black Hawk Down). Granted, the combination of Britain's rolling hills and classic castles isn't the most difficult thing to photograph, but Idziak does not paint his cinematic canvas with the conventional lush greens and blues of "Braveheart", but instead endows the movie with a gritty, somber hue. While this looks fantastic, it also contributes to another downfall of King Arthur; its generally subdued and gritty nature contrasts with the soaring themes that should be present in this sort of movie. The palette, although well done, aids in holding the movie back from being truly engaging or compelling, which is what separates great action films (like "LOTR") from the pack. Another dichotomy of "King Arthur" lies in the reasonable to good performances that still don't propel the movie past mediocrity. In fact what saves the picture from abject failure is the overall gravitas of the entirely European cast. Owen effectively brings an everyman quality to Arthur, but still doesn't quite capture his inspirational spirit, despite a solid turn. With the exception of a surprising wooden Stellan Skarsgard, everyone else, despite an assortment of accents, looks right and seems completely at home in their roles. Perhaps this is due to the stage backgrounds that most of the cast has. Whatever the reason, their quality performances make the movie more entertaining than it has any right to be. In this case some of the parts (not the sum of the parts) are greater than the whole, resulting in a flick that occasionally leaps to life, but just as often crumbles to rubble. I'm the type for whom sitting through any war-themed film is easy, so I'm not sorry I saw King Arthur, but I also can't recommend it. Go see a matinee. Bottom Line: Five of ten. But if this isn't your genre, you won't even enjoy it that much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw King Arthur today, and there was much rejoicing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I say there was much rejoicing because the shadow of "Holy Grail" will necessarily loom large over any movie about King Arthur and his English Knights (Eeeenglish K-niggits?) and I feel the filmmakers behind this one really were doing everything in their power to avoid any possible scene or bit of dialogue that would invoke snotty Frenchmen, Knights who say "Ni", Shrubbery (though the Saxon invaders would certainly qualify), and watery tarts with swords (this attempt failed, unfortunately, due to the soppy presence of Keira K-niggetly). Half-Roman, half-Celtic Artorious is indeed fortunate in his comrades in arms. In short order, we are introduced to nostril-flaring, smoldering Sir Lancelot, the Quite Frequently Pissed-Off; cheeky Sir Galahad, the Utterly Winsome; vaguely-psycho Sir Tristan, the Unkempt; bullroaring Sir Bors, the Ridiculously Fertile; tight-lipped Sir Dagonet, the Scary-Looking Moppet-Dandler; and finally, nondescript Sir Gawain, the Not-Quite-So-Winsome-As-Sir-Galahad.With a cadre of fighters such as these, Arthur's many successes in the field of battle should come as no surprise. Their foes include the Woad warriors, a proud race of Celts, and the Saxon invaders from the North, but along the way they also have to confront Romans who are oleagenous enough to put several of Italy's most productive olive groves out of business. This is a very important plot point, for those of you who are connoisseurs of plot, because it plants a seed of doubt in Arthur's mind that perhaps a quiet retirement in Rome surrounded by more of same might not be quite what they pictured in the glossy brochures he had been receiving for the past 15 years from the DeLuxe Roman Retirement Villas, Inc.Much plot ensues, and the movie doesn't even begin to have the merest whisper of the faintest hint of actual suckage until Gwinevere shows up and begins to act really poorly. The lack of on screen suckage up to this point is not really the sole accomplishment of the director and screenwriter--no, there are plenty of clunker lines but the British male actor cast is so adept at making lemonade from some of the lemons they are dealt that one doesn't mind a bit. If the Hero who Overcomes Long Odds to Succeed in the End is one of the oldest devices in fiction, then Lancelot has the second-oldest character device--the one of "Best Friend who objects to absolutely every single thing the hero proposes as being the height of idiocy or self-indulgence, but then goes along with all the hero's schemes, anyhow". Good things--Ioan Gruffudd is smokin' hot, and so are a few of the rest. But he has the inestimable advantage of TWO swords and the best armor, not mention that basket-weave leather jerkin that he wears early in the flick. I really enjoyed hearing Lancelot's and Arthur's leather creak when they moved about. This was a great touch. Also, the strategy behind the various battle scenes was interesting to watch unfold. The camera didn't linger overlong on Gwen and Arthur's big sex scene, and it became apparent why not later on, as they would only have had time for a quickie, since they would have had to spend the rest of the k-niggit mapping out a very elaborate battle plan to confront the masses of invading Uruk-hai, I mean SAXONS, who were camped outside Helm's Deep, I mean HADRIAN'S WALL, waiting for daylight. And then there was the cinematography, which had that silvered effect at times that was kind of intrusive in Gladiator, but it worked well here, in a story partially set in the Pleistocene Epoch.Bad things--I found the soundtrack really disappointing-I wanted it to be more Celtic in flavor. But mostly, Keira-sorry, credulous fanboys--she's terribly miscast here and the miraculous costume changes and obvious makeup were snark-inducing. The only 'machine' this Woad looked like she had been tortured with was a curling iron. The thought of her as "spunky, girl-power" Lizzie Bennet makes the blood run cold. She was fine for a rompy flick like Pirates of the Carribbean, but I thought she was NOT plausible as a warrior who ran half-naked into battle when the men were all wearing armor. They should have had her stick to shooting arrows with deadly accuracy from a distance. That was plausible. I also found Merlin a depressingly small presence, and wondered that they even bothered to include him at all.Anyhow, the Saxons do indeed battle Arthur and his Knights on two occasions, making heavy use of their primary battle tactic of getting upwind from their enemy and raising their arms and charging, letting their powerful B.O. render their enemies senseless and unconscious. Some of the Knights eventually fell prey to this diabolical tactic, but Arthur, his sense of smell numbed by the lingering stench of the last exchange of dialogue with Gwinevere which still clung to his crispy curls and creaking leather armor, was able to hang in there and claim his destiny as the eventual King of the Britons, overcoming long odds to succeed in the end.Gwenivere is clearly upset by Lancelot's death (we know this because her mouth hangs open like a fish, and she knits her brow--no, wait, she'd been doing that a lot before--anyhow, we know she is upset because, well--who wouldn't be?), as she had clearly been hoping to work her way through the whole cadre of Arthur's Knights, for comparison purposes. But, in the time-honored fashion of aspiring political wives, she elects to "settle" for electability over bad-boy sex appeal. Which only goes to show you the truth of the old saying--"Behind every Legendary Hero is a dodgy bit of Woad tail booting him back out into the fray whenever he starts talking about retirement."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A generic epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Spoilers ahead**Let me start by saying that I am not very familiar with Arthurian legend. I know that there was a King named Arthur, a sword named Excalibur, a Queen named Guinevere, a round table where the knights sit, and the wizard Merlin. However I don't know too much beyond that. Still, I think that King Arthur could have benefited more from the "magic" of the legends because it doesn't do much to set itself apart from other movie epics.Clive Owen does an adequate job of portraying a dark, brooding Arthur, a former Roman soldier. He cares about his fellow knights, and deplores the fact that he has to take them on a final journey that could have them killed, because Rome had previously promised that they could go free. Bors is great comic relief in this movie, especially when he made comment about one of his children named "number 3". The costume designs were well done. I loved the look of Arthur's Roman armour. And, of course, the battles scenes were of grand, sweeping scale, with hundreds of soldiers duking it out in choreographed fight scenes. So what's my problem with King Arthur? First off Guinevere, played by Keira Knightley, is a fairly one-dimensional character. We learn next to nothing about her other than that she is good with a bow. In this movie Knightley is nothing more than eye candy (albeit very nice eye candy). The character of Merlin is also just another military leader, and not a wizard. And just like Guinevere, we get to know nothing much about Merlin himself.Also, despite the fact that this movie strives for "authenticity", the heroes are given seemingly superhuman abilities. For example, in a battle across a frozen lake when Arthur and his knights confront a Saxon army, the Saxons try and shoot arrows against the knights but are out of range. But of course the knights are never out of range, and kill dozens of Saxons. One knight is also able to crack the entire frozen lake with his axe, with the crack encompassing a large part of the lake, with most of the Saxons standing on it. Is that authentic? Give me a break.The Saxon leader Cerdic is unimpressive as a villain. He does not inspire any real sense of fear or dread. In one scene, he says to kill everyone him and his armies encounter. One would think that he could take prisoners and use them as slave labour, but nope, the movie has make him want to kill everybody, which is frankly a cheap ploy in the movie's plot to make the audience hate him.Lastly, King Arthur borrows much from previous epics. So much so that it's as if they were working of some sort of "How to Make an Epic Movie Cookbook". Let's see, take one part brooding hero, add in a cheap love story, big battle scenes, evil-for-no-purpose villain, and a final scene where the hero MUST kill the villain on the battlefield, and you got yourself movie.Overall, King Arthur is not a bad movie, just an average one. Had I've not seen movies like The Lord of the Rings, Braveheart, Gladiator, The Last Samurai, Ran, etc., I might have been more impressed. But for a movie that strives for historical accuracy as a selling point (which is in itself stupid considering we have no hard evidence Arthur even existed), this movie falls flat.I give King Arthur 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like the title says, its the TRUE origins of King Arthur.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although King Arthur has been the brunt of some criticism, I strongly recommend seeing it! In the beginning of the film the audience is told that historians have found evidence suggest the myth is true, only happening much earlier during the dark ages. The film's realistic approach is a relief from the normal retelling of the story. Clive Owen plays a quiet, noble, and articulately handsome Arthur. Keira Knightly takes the role of Guinevere to a whole new level. She is no longer a feeble woman, but a cunning warrior. King Arthur gives the characters greater depth than the normal versions of the story. The character of Arthur isn't simply the protecter of England anymore, but torn between what really deserves his loyalties. The most impressive part of the film is the romance between Arthur and Guinevere. Long gazes aside, the film retains it's dignity by elegantly making their sexual encounter SENSUAL. It's a defining film where love doesn't turn into pornography just to make sales.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad, but Needn't Have Been About Arthur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's around 500 AD. Arthur and his knights are short-timers in service of the Roman army, keeping the peace in the remote Roman outpost of Britain. Guenivere's essentially a Druid; the bad guys are Saxons, who are taking advantage of the . The movie needn't have been about Arthur, and in fact would've been superior without the efforts at bringing in correspondences. As it stands, one wants to see the Arthur story play out in some fashion, but is constantly disappointed or frustrated. (You're in trouble if you're doing an Arthur piece and the most appealing knight is Sir Bors, of all people.) Better to have done it as a straight historical adventure, and draw in some Arthur comparisons at the end, if one really must. The movie is successful as a straight piece of historical-adventure pulp. It's similar to (but not as good as) THE THIRTEENTH WARRIOR. There are two great action sequences and a lot of fun scenes of warriors standing on hills and waving their swords about dramatically. The action sequences were cut to make a PG-13 film, which was a bad idea, as it chopped up the flow.Clive Owen is miscast in the lead -- it feels like he never really bought or understood his character. Keira Knightley actually is quite appealing as Guinevere, although the character she plays is absolutely ridiculous. The rest of the cast is solid. Worth seeing if you like this kind of thing. A mild recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film not fit for a King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tale of King Arthur and his knights of the round table are one of the most enduring legends in all of history. The basic mythology, in some form or another, is familiar to most individuals, either from reading Le Morte de Arthur or, more likely, The Sword in the Stone, during grade school. As with most other enduring legends, the exploits of King Arthur have been fodder for multiple screen adaptations over time, including an animated entry of The Sword in the Stone to several live-action versions, including, most recently, First Knight. Now, producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Antoine Fuqua have given us King Arthur, a version that strips off most of the mythology and presents the Arthur story as a supposedly historically based telling. The veracity of this claim is questionable, but I can definitely make one determination about this film: it is the worst adaptation of the Arthur legend I have seen.Set in the 5th century, King Arthur opens on the cusp of Arthur and his knights about to be freed from service to the Roman empire. Arthur here is a half British, half Roman commander who leads a band of individuals descended from a group of great Sarmatian knights who fought against the invading Romans in their homeland several generations before and who found themselves and their offspring placed in servitude to the Romans. A Roman bishop has been dispatched to Britain to release the knights, but not before they complete one final mission: rescue a Roman family who have settled North of a great wall that separates North and South Britain before an invading horde of Saxons can reach them. The North is a rather inhospitable place, ruled largely by a people known as the Woads, led by Merlin (Stephen Dillane). Unhappy about the circumstances of their plight but willing to follow Arthur, they set out on this mission with the promise of freedom at the end.King Arthur is a dull and dreary piece of cinema. The film first falls down in the department of character development. These knights have well-known names: Lancelot (Ioan Gruffud), Bors (Ray Winstone), Gawain (Joel Edgerton), among others, yet other than Lancelot and Bors, none of the characters stand out. The rest are all just interchangeable bodies with no personality to speak of. Bors is really the only knight who is reasonably entertaining to watch, an oafish character who serves as comic relief. Clive Owen is serviceable as Arthur, but he hardly gives an especially strong performance. Keira Knightly fills the role of Guenievere, imagined here as a warrior woman of the woods, and while she is also okay in the role, the character at times descends into camp as she screams, kicks and yells while fighting other characters. Merlin is here for name recognition only, he serves little or no purpose in the film. On the villain front, Stellan Skarsgard turns in one of his worst performances to date as the leader of the Saxons, issuing his dialogue in a low, deep whisper and proving to be not the least bit intimidating.Aside for poor character development, King Arthur moves at a glacial pace. The film is too long and too uninteresting to hold the audience interest for as long as it lasts, and it quickly wore out it's welcome with me. Visually, it is also rather unspectacular. The film has the same dark, overcast look of many other historical epics set in the British isles, and even though it may be realistic, it would be nice to see a change of pace now and then. It also has very little in the way of impressive vistas, seeming to have been shot in one set of woods and one field from multiple angles to create the impression that it is different locales. King Arthur has the outward appearance of a film made on the cheap, although studio documentation would suggest otherwise.As with any sword and sandal epic, King Arthur is filled with battle scenes, but the film fails to prove very diverting in this department either. A major battle late in the film seems to drag on forever, and since we couldn't care less about the characters, we must simply look at the swordplay on display, which is frankly not that spectacular, especially when compared to the somewhat more engaging fighting featured earlier this summer in Troy. The only slightly impressive sequence in the film features a fight over a frozen lake that is at least visually interesting.For those with any interest in the Arthur legend, they would do best to pass on this dud and seek out a copy of Le Morte de Arthur or one of the better cinematic renditions of the tale. King Arthur is not worth the time, money or effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WOW.... I didn't expect it to be so dark!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, King Authur, is unlike anything you have ever heard of King Arthur before. I like the new risks that it took in the story line, but I think at times they strayed far away from the traditional, which isn't a bad thing.First of all the cinematography in this movie is excellent. I would not be surprised if the art director was nominated for an Academy award. The acting in this movie was really top notch, especially the casting of King Authur himself.The Lancelot character was someone less exciting. At times he even seem to be a bit whimpish sometimes even gay. I don't know if that was the director's intention, but that is how the poor guy came off. I think this movie would have faired better dropping the "King" out of the title. Because their is no "kingdom" in this movie. Just a bunch of freedom fighter type knights who fight a battle that they should not win.Going into the movie, I didn't know Jerry Bruckheimer was the producer, but mid-way through you could tell. There was lots of gore and unpredictables in the movie. But most importantly one thing that Jerry Bruckheimer does well, is that he gives you characters that you will really care about. When you see the movie you will completely understand. Kierra Knightly did an excellent job in her portrayal of Gwenevere. It's some parts where you will be utterly surpised by her change in character. I don't want to give anything away, but pay close attention to her.This is an excellent movie, definately one I would buy when it comes out on DVD.I give this movie 8 out of 10. Normally I would only give it a 7, but it came out during the Summer Blockbuster season, so I will only judge it against does.

		<shortDescription>Good period piece and plausible beginning of the Arthur myth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike viewer comment of 7/15, I enjoyed the film. Being a history buff perhaps gave me a better appreciation. Arthurian legends had taken root by the 1400's but he certainly was not supposed to have lived then. Let us remember that British royalty is fully traceable back to William the Conquorer in the 11th century and there wasn't an Arthur in the bunch. This tale sets forth a plausible historical figure from the 5th century, a Roman named Autorius (sp?), that could have been the figure from which all the mythical tales of magical deeds sprung forth. There is no magic in this film, just peoples who strive to conquer and peoples who strive not to be conquered as we witness the demise of the Roman Empire in Britain and the invasion of same by the Saxons. Merlin's only magic is seeking Arthur as the leader of his people. The costuming is wonderfully "real" in that it shows a reasonable depiction of that which was Roman evolving into that which could be the ancestor of the medieval knights' clothing. And that which could very well have been the island people's rough garb. The only chink in this armor was the portrayal of Gwenavere as a warrior princess... with a condescending wink to the feminists who like to think that a 110 lb female with no upper body strength could really duke it out, hand to hand, with battle axes against a 6 ft Saxon and live to tell about it ... well, Gweny is a cute little savage inappropriately costumed in a peek-a-boo leather number, but a real spoiler on the realism scale. Gweny's 21st century message aside, the cast and crew deserve credit for an overall story nicely told in a fresh way. It deserves better audiences.</fullReview>

The Knights portrayed great courage and leadership in sacrificing thier lives for England's future freedom. Like most of the knights, Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd) had no initiative to fight the final battle between the Romans. I strongly admire Guinevere's (Keira Knightly) sense of female empowerment in helping Arthur (Clive Owen) fight this war. This event was an inaugural part of British history. It's a MUST SEE for those who are interested in British culture. It was a first victory leading to a new beginning of cultural evolution. I rate this film 5*.</fullReview>

Why do film makers nowadays take a name from history and totally abuse the story? - I put it to a lack of quality imagination that can sell an idea for its self, instead of having to rely on a well established (good) tale to draw interest.Aside from the sometimes ham acting, the fact that people North of Hadrian's wall have West Country accents (?!) and the fact that wasn't it Picts in the North and Saxons in the South ?, this could have been a good fictional action film.

		<fullReview>As the Arthurian legend is just that (a legend) it should provide plenty of scope for constructing an interesting and entertaining story around the characters and themes of the established tales. Does "King Arther" manage to do this? It doesn't come close. From the opening scenes, everything about the movie jarred and seemed wrong - the overly-lush soundtrack, the Mad Max costuming, the creative geography (where is Salmatia anyway?). The accents are many and varied - the Salmatians go from cultured mid-Atlantic to broad East-end London, the leader of the Saxons (despite being played by a Swede) mumbles in American, while all of the Romans due bad impersonations of Neapolitan mafia. The mood is more reminiscent of a traditional Hollywood western than either an historical costume drama or a sword-and-sandal epic. When the wagon train of homesteaders was heading for the relative safety of Fort Apache (aka Hadrian's Wall), pursued by savage redskins/Saxons, I was expecting Arthur to circle the wagons in the traditional manner.Still, the snow looked good...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to seeing "King Arthur". I knew it would be different from the usual treatments of the legend, since it takes place in the fifth century, whereas the Camelot we have come to know and love is rooted in the fifteen century, "when knighthood was in flower". I figured "King Arthur" would be fresh, interesting and exciting. And it was ... almost.The director and screenwriter hedged their bets a little. Although the main character's real name is Lucius Artorius Castus (played by Clive Owen), he is referred to as Arthur. Guinevere and Lancelot are along for the ride, of course. Gawain and Galahad, too. Even the Round Table is thrown in for good measure. The problem is, only Arthur seems to have any real personality, any conflict or angst. Everybody else just gets swept up and along in his drama.And it's not even a personal, intimate drama. Gone is the tense love triangle between Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot. What we get in its place is drama of a far more cerebral kind -- more philosophical than emotional. What motivates Arthur and his "knights"? Longing for a home they have not seen for 15 years ... loyalty to an empire that no longer exists ... and, of all things, belief in the teachings of a heretic (Pelagius). The Rome Arthur fights is not that of the Caesars, but of the Church.I might have been more interested if the film had delved more deeply into the Pelagian heresy, but it only scratches the surface. As a result, I must confess I dozed off several times and missed several (perhaps crucial) scenes. On the whole, I felt I had wasted my time and money.I came hoping for "one brief shining moment". But I came away from "King Arthur" thinking, "Let it be forgot."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After "Gladiator", "Troy" and now "King Arthur", I really think I should join the movie business, at least when it comes to historical/legendary movies.The setting, the end of the Roman Empire of the West and their retreat from Britannia, is fine by me. That's where Arthur is usually located, something 5th, 6th century. This resulting in him being probably a Roman knight (and to resolve all the questions I read in the forum, YES the Romans had knights in their army) may be a logical conclusion.BUT (and that's a huuuuuuuuuge but), even if Arthur is a legend, probably based on some obscure historical figure, please please please STICK TO THE LEGEND.I do know too that there are several variations as for Excalibur. If he doesn't pull it out of the stone or gets it from the Lady of the Lake, he surely didn't pull it out of his father's grave, although I must admit, this still was an interesting variation.*SPOILER* But Lancelot's and Tristan's death ??? Oh please ! First of all, Lancelot and Guinevere should have their affair, which will lead to the downfall of Arthur's reign and second, Tristan is supposed to meet Isolde and die on another battlefield but not against the Saxons with Arthur.I noticed the same "problem" here as for "Troy". If you're turning a legend into a movie, let's keep it a legend instead of trying to get rid of the whole myth. What people love about those stories ARE the gods, the heroes, the wizards...that's why the stories are so famous. But here, there was just too much an effort to make it seem like it really happened. Of course, much of this remains unknown to us, but still...Finally...DON'T get me started on Guinevere's dress.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind of boring and unrealistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are really 2 main problems with the movie; 1 it doesn't live up to the historical accuracy that it claims, and 2 it's kind of boring. Now for the first offence, I think that the historical inaccuracies in this movie are no more egregious then in most films that attempt to depict the past. The problem is that this movie blatantly makes an assertion of validity. In the trailers it says "This is the true story", and then there is that ridiculous little paragraph at the beginning of the movie. Now I majored in history in college and while this period is certainly not my area of expertise, I know that the statement "Historians agree" is an inherent contradiction. Because the movie goes out of it's way to try and tell the audience that this is the truth that is why there are so many people bashing the inaccuracies (and rightly so). Now if the movie made no such claim then I think that all of this talk about were the costumes correct and how Hadrians Wall actually looked would be kind of nitpicky. But as far as I'm concerned this movie got what it asked for. I'll leave the rest of the historical inaccuracy bashing up to my fellow IMDBers (that's what we're called now) save for this little question...How common do you think the name Lancelot was in Sarmatia? Now the saving grace for a movie that is obviously fabricated and has little basis in actual fact is that it's entertaining. And that the sacrifices for accuracy were made to make an exciting picture. However, that's not the case here. There are roughly 3 fight scenes in the movie. The first one is the equivalent of an action scene from a TV show (which is bad), the second is pretty much people just getting shot with arrows and falling in the water (over and over), and the third is an actual battle scene which is kind of lackluster after seeing battles in movies like Braveheart or Gladiator. The rest of the movie follows a fairly uninteresting story in which Arthur has to go up north to rescue some Roman guy and bring him back. There is a love scene which is neither sexy nor makes much sense between the characters. Then there is rampant use of the word "freedom" and a lot of speeches containing that word. I guess all of those speeches were intended to remind people of the much better movie Braveheart. I could go into the inaccuracies of "knights" (which technically didn't exist) going around and expousing fairly modern ideas of equality and freedom to the peasants but that's beside the point. The point really is that "King Arthur" has little to do with the legend other then them stealing the names of some of the characters and putting them on totally different characters and is just a bland actioner. Now this movie isn't as bad as some people say (it's not a '1') but it's not that good either (I gave it like a 4-5). If you want to see a movie about King Arthur rent Excalibur or read Mallory's rendition. It's not historically accurate at all, but the story is much more interesting and entertaining. They should have just made a newer Excalibur instead of this.Zoopansick</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the rich tapestry of Arthurian legend to build on, I was disappointed at just how bad this film actually turned out to be. It's not often I can't watch a whole movie, but in this case 20 minutes was my limit. Perhaps it gets better from there on in, but I was bored from the start.To ignore the myths and legends of Celtic and Roman culture was a mistake from the start. They seem to have gotten the time period right but ignored everything else. No mention is made of bards or the bardic arts, Merlin becomes nothing more than a barbarian, and for reference, the Woads never existed. The barbarian forces that would have been facing Arthur and the Britons would have been a combination of Picti, Scotti, Angli, Saecsen, and the Irish, not some mythical force.Instead, we get a miserable plot that could have been strung together by any idiot (a Roman settlement above Hadrian's Wall? Get real!) and a whole host of other problems (oddly enough, plate armour was hard to come by - indeed, most warriors at that time would have had to settle for chainmail, or even just leather!).Check the history books next time! If anyone's thinking of making a movie along these lines, I recommend Stephen Lawhead's excellent Pendragon Cycle as reference material. It may not be entirely accurate but it weaves history and legend into a stunning tapestry - an act that this movie failed in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent, localized film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was refreshing to watch a more localized telling of part of the legend. I truly enjoyed the take on the characters, the acting, the scenery and the handling of the religions involved. There wasn't much personality to the Saxons, but it did not interfere with the movie. I especially enjoyed the ice incident. It was nice to see a Guinevere able to do more than sit back, look pretty and cause romantic chaos. Arthur especially was superb, but you really got to know the other knights. Relating to how grand, sweeping legends could be based on more localized occurrences, this movie reminded me of the 13th Warrior. Excellent, and most definitely an owner!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>king Arthur in his adventures as a roman centurion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>KING Arthur is a thought provoking action adventure, which deals with his adventures as a military leader in the legions of Rome. Action adventure saves the ticket buyers from boredom in all the right places. In essence that's the one flaw of this film; too much talking. The film gets wordy in several places and that almost damaged the films effect. There are several scenes where they talk of impending battles and destroying the enemy and instead the film moves the plot to another talking sequence without the battle. KING Arthur is a film the whole family can enjoy without the nudity and swear words of other Hollywood fare. I found the production value and the costumes and colors used to be easy on the eyes. There seemed to be a lot of care and hard work by the producers on this film. All the work that went into this film translated into a sharp looking roman era film instead of older films shot on Hollywood back lots which are cheesy in comparison. KING Arthur will set well with people fascinated by Rome and possibly fans of GLADIATOR.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True to facts is not necessarily boring!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this film was a refreshing view at the extremely overdone fairytale of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round table. This is the closest view of Arthur in terms of historical fact than any other - and I must say it is very different to what other movies would have you think! Clive Owen did a spectacular job as the 'real' Arthur, the half Roman/half English leader of a legendary group of Samation knights. (Clive would be a fantastically brooding James Bond in my opinion!) Ioan Gruffudd also did a great job at Lancelot as did the rest of the motley crew. A good amount of humour with fantastic fight scenes made this a very enjoyable film to watch...and interesting for any history buff. Recommended highly!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As historical as ANY King Arthur film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's address the historical aspect of this film. I find it amusing to see so many people comment on how this film is not an accurate depiction of the Arthurian lore. Fact is, the legend of Arthur is about 90% conjecture. The origins of the historical tale are actually quite deep in the Saxon/Roman/Britain struggle for land claims. The earliest writings (that have been discovered thus far) mention "Arthur" as a simple figure of patriotism loyal to his natural land, a man that conveys an eventual distaste for foreign invaders. A man that (centuries later) was a symbol for taking back a home that was once lost to non-indigenous people of the land.. Every thing else is conjecture. So how is this film historically inaccurate? I found it very refreshing and entertaining. The dark mood of the film captured the essence of the dark ages, of which we collectively know little about, other than the fact that it was a time of struggle, survival and battle. So to me, King Arthur can be considered as accurate or as inaccurate as any historian cares to convey in future renditions of such a classic tale.</fullReview>

But still it's the latest in the "epic" and "mass battles" movies since Gladiator, Return of the King, Last Samurai and Troy.King Arthur's story has been done over and over again, and it's one of the first times to my knowledge that they've (tried to) stick to the facts. Well of course it's a bit pushed at times but it was a new and fun version to see.A great Friday, Saturday night flick.

		<shortDescription>Disappointingly dull with poor acting, but lovely art direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will admit that the scenery was lovely. The perfectly falling snow on the mountaintop trees cast a serenity upon a great portion of the film, though none of the characters chose to wore hats or gloves, or for that matter, anything more than a single layer of clothing. The movie wasn't bad. Despite a garden variety of poor directing choices and some ghastly acting, it was actually quite tolerable. I enjoyed it if naught else for it's majesty and glorious triumph of good over evil; but the acting was just too doggone bad! You wanted to love Arthur for his soaring ideals but Clive Owen spoke in monotone 85% of his screen time. Ioan Gruffud, whose name no one can pronounce, was an adequate Lancelot, though nothing to write home about. His annunciation was, dare I say it, over the top! Even Keira Knightly, who usually manages to enrapture audiences due primarily to her beauty, didn't even appear until almost halfway through and was a dirty prisoner for awhile longer. Her acting was only mediocre.The battle sequences are good, but certainly not on the plane of Lord of the Rings, or even, Gladiator. The battle on the ice though, was original and intense. The scenery and costumes were certainly a plus but it would seem that the screen writer needs to review his Arthurian legends for the script bore no resemblance to previous Arthur stories I have read.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best Arthurian tale yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those who've complained about any failure of the new King Arthur movie to live up to legend are not familiar, in any breadth, with the legends and fairy tales.While there were historical inaccuracies in the film, this was the first Arthurian movie I've seen to treat: 1) Arthur's half Roman, half northern-Welsh (not Briton) ancestry; 2) Arthur's familiarity with Roman war machines (Greek fire not being part of the picture because of its closely-guarded formula) and tactics; 3) Arthur's relationship with Hadrian's wall (although he was closer to the Antonine wall to the north -- and yes, Romans gave us the mile, mille passus, i.e. a thousand paces); 4) Gwen's role as a battle queen (although the movie failed to show her even in a subordinate commanding role, merely alluded to); 5) Lancelot's Sarmation origins (whether as legend or as man) and the presence of Sarmation cavalry in Britain; 6) Arthur's primary role in setting back the Saxon invasion (from the southeast, not north); 7) the emerging vileness of the official church, not yet dominant in Britain; and 8) Lancelot's fidelity to Arthur (although his death in the movie was premature, according to legend).The movie was full of verbal, not physical, humor, in the places it belonged, and with enough originality to lend verisimilitude to its context.I'll leave comment on the acting to others. For my part, it did not get in the way.Perhaps the movie simply does not appeal to those with a short attention span. While I would have preferred what would have put them in a coma, I found this movie one of the best I've seen, a fresh -- rare, nowadays -- tale told well.One of these days I'd like to see a followup dealing with Gwen's death, Mordred's treachery, and the mystery of the continental campaign.For now, if you are a genuine fan of Arthurian legends, ethical violence, or respectable female roles, this movie's a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fuqua and Franzoni Flop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good popcorn flick and not much else. The biggest problem with this movie is the inconsistency. The story has some very exciting and good points, while at the same time some gaping plot holes as big as the screen itself. It ends up being very confusing and unbelievable. SPOILER For example, why does virtuous, selfless Arthur, suddenly become a bigot and having loathing for the Woads halfway through the movie, only to make amends 30 seconds later. Oh wait they killed his mother. And somehow it's all Merlin's fault even though that is never really explained.The camera experimentation will send anyone prone to motion sickness scurrying to the bathroom. Early on their is a 10 minute dialogue on horseback where the camera bobs up and down to the bounce of the horse the entire time. What is strange is that this dialogue contributes nothing to the story. This is the inherent problem with Fuqua's directing. Scenes are apparently deleted or included at random that seem to do nothing for the story. We lose 10 minutes to dialogue that explains nothing, yet there are massive plot holes in the story that could have been explained in some fashion.The film is polluted with sloppy editing and slap shod film work that is only salvaged by good acting by Clive Owen and great acting by Stellan Skarsgard. During one scene, it appears as if the makeup artist failed to cover up a massive hickey on Keira Knightley's neck (well before Keira and Clive's character get intimate in the movie). During the fight scenes you can easily see where the actors faking melee. In fact, one scene in particular seems to have drifted in that appears to be two actors practicing out a fight scene in very slow motion. It is shocking to think that this made it past the cutting room floor. The ending of the movie is cheesy enough to make an eight-year old gag. This is representative of why this movie just won't cut it in the end. For every deep, philosophical moment the audience is given, it is followed up by cartoon-like dialogue. This inconsistency can only be leveled with the screenwriter and the director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of action,different,interesting characters, Enjoyable!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A different take on the classic story of King Arthur as more of the source from whence the legends evolved. Lots of fighting and action, some surprises included. Earthy realism is foremost in the film's photographic quality, especially the ice and snow scenes. The characters are real and believable, they are common people brought together in service to a King they trust and honor. I thought the knights were a great bunch and really would've liked to have more of their stories brought out. They were bound to serve Arthur through the demands of the Holy Roman Empire, which was portrayed in it's unflattering greedy glory. Yet, when no longer required fight for the "Kingdom", they returned of their own will forsaking their freedom to help their friend and King in his time of need. Guinevere was splendid as a Celtic/Pict type warrior woman and Kiera did well. It may not be a completely historically accurate film, but I found it very interesting and will go back to see it again(I'll buy the DVD also). It was a worthy escape from summer sequeldom!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Choppy but Worth the Ticket</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you go into "King Arthur" expecting grandiose language and billowy clothing, a la "Camelot," you will be very, VERY disappointed with this movie. If you go into this film expecting a gritty period piece, you may also be disappointed. If you go into this film with no preconceived notions and just let it unfold, you'll enjoy yourself. "King Arthur" is a good enough movie, certainly worth the price of a ticket (especially a matinée), despite a choppy plot and underdeveloped characters.Setting the Arthurian legend against a historical backdrop, "King Arthur" portrays the legendary king as a brilliant, devoutly religious, utterly devoted Roman general. He is the commander of a squad of gifted Sarmatian knights, who are indentured servants of the Empire. As the movie starts, the knights are preparing to receive their walking papers from a Roman Catholic bishop, following fifteen years of required servitude. But before they're allowed to leave their service to the empire, they have to complete one more mission: rescue a boy from the wilds of northern Britain, in the lands north of Hadrian's Wall. Arthur and the knights know the trip is virtually a suicide mission, but if they don't go they will be considered deserters by the Roman legions, and will be hunted down and killed. Making things worse, the blood-thirsty Saxons have begun to invade Brittania - hence Rome's departure from the island country, and the reason for the entire mission.Sounds pretty good, right? It would be, if they'd stuck to this plot. Instead, the filmmakers let themselves get distracted by too many themes (freedom, religion, destiny, heritage, etc), and lose the thread of what would have made this movie one of the year's best. Rather than focusing on the legend and weaving the elements of that legend into a tight plot - namely the rescue of the boy and the eventual climactic battle of Badon Hill - the story meanders from place to place, both thematically and contextually. There's no subtlety in the major themes of the movie: Romans are bad; Roman Catholicism (as it was practiced at the time) is bad; the wild life of the native Britons is good; Saxons are evil. The only subtle touches in the film are the interactions between the characters, which is another failing point of the movie: there is virtually no character development. Each character is introduced with an obvious prominent characteristic - one's a pacifist, one's a womanizer, one's brash, one's steadfast, etc - and from then on, you might as well have tacked a sign to each character's chest that says, "I am the loud one/quiet one/mysterious one/etc." There's no development beyond those initial introductions. The audience is left to depend on their knowledge of the legend to fill in the gaps; if you aren't familiar with these characters in their literary context, you're just left to blink and wonder who the heck they are.But like I said, this movie IS worth the ticket, because there are moments when you can see the unrealized potential behind the flawed final product. For instance, the few (and I do mean FEW) moments shared between Lancelot (Ioan Gruffud) and Guinevere (Keira Knightley). The Lancelot/Guinevere love affair is never openly discussed in the course of the movie, but it is hinted at through looks and body language. If there is any part of the legend that I mourn the loss of, it is this storyline, because the chemistry that sparks between Ioan and Keira in these brief moments is electric. I would have loved to see it fleshed out, and see these two characters - both torn by their loyalty and love for Arthur - struggle with their affection for each other. In the end, that is the central problem with "King Arthur." The legend of Arthur is composed of wonderful, beautiful stories, but in the end, it isn't the STORIES that matter. It's the way the people IN the stories are affected by what happens to them. When people think of the downfall of Camelot, they don't immediately think of the Battle of Camlan - they think of Arthur's betrayal by Lancelot and Guinevere. Gawain's encounter with the Green Knight is a moral lesson about honesty, fidelity and honor. Even the quest for the Holy Grail is in turn dominated by the humanity of the story: only the purest knight can see the Grail. Even Lancelot - greatest of all Arthur's knights, and a good, kind man - cannot view the Cup of Christ, because of his elicit affair with the queen. "King Arthur," on the other hand, focuses too much on plot, and not enough of how the characters function WITHIN that plot. So much so that, come the end, the audience has been led down so many different plot pathways, they can't even count the loose ends. At the same time, you're left mystified by what makes the characters tick. Go see this movie. If you're disappointed, see it again. Count the moments of unrealized potential, then cross your fingers and pray the DVD extras contain a LOT of deleted scenes. I can't wait to see what landed on the cutting room floor. I have to blame the lackluster final product on poor direction, scriptwriting, and/or editing, because with a cast this good, there's no other excuse. But I'll go see it again anyway, because something about it - some nugget of real value under the Fool's gold exterior - is drawing me back. I think it will do the same for you, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most accurate portrayal that will ever make it to screen HST Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an ancient history grad student focused on Roman I was shocked when I saw this movie. I went to it thinking yeah I get to see Keira Knightley and a cool new version of the Arthur legend! Well I wasn't let down about the Keira. She should wear the tattoos in the next Pirates. Good lord hot. Also I liked how the characters weren't as charismatic and utterly likable as in Braveheart and other semi-historical attempts; these guys seemed to have a little more "regular conflicted person" personalities, if that makes any sense. I mean sure it was Hollywooded up but what do you do.About the History: they damn near got it right. Well really close to the actual Roman Arthurius version. There is some evidence for a later Welsh Arthur but that one isn't as fun. The evidence is confused because the Roman version really has two Arthurs, one who lived in the very early 5th century (he was fully Roman, but did indeed take control of the horsemen who were from the area north of Thrace, they had nothing to do after the Romans stopped paying them, and they weren't 'knights' there weren't knights as we know them until the middle of the early medieval period) prolly around the time of the Roman Abandonment (it wasn't a pullout, everyone was just told they were on their own from Rome, so the Legionares went back to try and get back in the Military and make money fighting the Germans Tribes invading into Cisalpine Gaul) in 410 and united the Brits with the Picts against the Saxons and fought the Saxons at a Fort Town by the wall called Cilurnum, I think it is called Chesters now, and another who died leading the win at Badon Hill prolly around 500AD, that is like all that is known of the second one. Maybe the later one is a grandson people more in the know than me think; he wasn't really even named Arthur. Oh a mistake, Baden Hill was in South England maybe 100k west of Londinium, Hadrian's Wall is prolly 400k up the A3. The major battle of the first real Arthur was where the movie's last battle, while the second Arthur did fight at Badon which is where the movie said the Battle took place, which they showed as being at the wall. But I mean whatever. Oh and all other people in the movie are just from the ancient romance and fiction novels. But it was cool to use the names. Sadly I could go on, but now I bored even myself.Shoot I loved this movie. Keira Knightley, a very interesting middle of the movie fight scene, actual attempt at making a historically accurate version while there is some however limited fact. What more could one want?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love of fantasy and the Arthurian legends but I'm also a fan of historical fiction. This movie is the latter not the former. Also of note is that while I almost didn't go see the movie because the trailers made it look like it might be as sappy as "First Knight" (ugh), the love story is NOT the principle theme of this movie ... just enough to keep it semi-romantic without making the plot feel split into pieces.The first review given for this movie is probably going to be the most common reaction, but I would counter with the following:1) The movie is quite plausible. I enjoy that. It allows for very simple suspension of disbelief and yet the actors, photography, sets, props and costumes are all strong enough that they could have gone into the magic of the legend and pulled it off.2) The movie gives a very good rendition of what political changeovers were occurring at that time (ok, so it may have gotten the time off by 50-100 years, but I can live with that as those 100 years didn't see an amazing amount of technological or sociological change).3) I don't like Clive Owen all that well, so I guess I disagree with the first review calling him a major addition. However he did play his part solidly. I was personally MUCH more impressed by the supporting cast.4) Yep, it has nothing to do with the Grail, Castles or things of that like (hopefully that's not a spoiler since I'm not saying specifics on what it -is- about and knowing that may help set people's attitudes about this movie better). I love the stories by Geoffrey of Monmouth and the subsequent tales, but I think until someone is willing to do a Lord of the Rings style multi-part rendition you are probably never going to get anything that goes beyond Excalibur in that genre. The purpose of this movie is to show what kind of man might have been behind the legend, not to show the fantastical legend once again.It is probably -not- a movie for the masses who want to escape to the world of the Arthurian legends. It -is- a movie for people who like to escape to intriguing possible past stories that may or may not have happened but -could- have.If you like at least one of the following then I believe you'll enjoy this solidly acted and beautiful filmed movie:* A. A. Atanasio's Arthur from 'The Dragon and the Unicorn', and you can handle the lack of mysticism (which was a key component to that book and I'm not trying to say otherwise), you will likely very much enjoy this movie. And if you like the movie and like fantasy but haven't read that book, do so.* Seeing Celts painted in blue and finally getting payback in Braveheart (they're called "woads" by the Romans in this movie but they correspond to the Picts of old and when combined with the early Anglo-Saxons provided the Scotts from Braveheart).* The massive battles and amazingly well done props and costumes from Gladiator (same writer for both) or Braveheart. While the battle scenes are gorgeously shot and probably reasonably accurate don't go for a movie about military tactics, as with religion (mentioned later) the tactics are there to fill the needs of the plot. There are plenty of battles but not in sacrifice of storytelling.* To read Military History to see background on the stuff of myths (the only Military History magazine I have is one with an exposition on the possible history behind Arthur).* Seeing what Hadrian's wall might really have been like including the various strongholds placed across it (this is the first movie I can recall showing Hadrian's wall rebuilt).* Seeing a movie where the religious aspects seem to be fairly accurate (this was the early days for Christianity, where many of the Romans had not yet converted in their hearts, those in power sometimes used Christianity in the same abusive ways as the earlier Roman religion and the majority of the subjects of the empire were of various pagan beliefs). There are good Christians and bad Christians in this movie, just as their are plenty of good Pagans and bad Pagans in it. It is -not- a religious movie but it does use religion as a plot device in a few places to good effect.* Watching an English babe (Keira Knightley, also of Pirates of the Caribbean) go from being very pretty to being plain hot in a celtic outfit with lots of blue woad (body paint) and kicking as much butt on the battlefield as anyone else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pure action flick, with no real intrigue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was amused from the beginning by this film's claim to be the "true story" behind the legend, since there is little to no evidence that Arthur was a true historical figure at all; nonetheless, since I enjoy medieval legend (as well as Keira Knightley), I went to see the movie. It's been a long time since I was this bored in the theater. The film's creators wanted to take away the myth and present King Arthur as a real human character, and they present a possible story of his ascension to the throne. There's just one problem when you take away the Lady of the Lake, Morgan Le Fey, Merlin the Magician, and the Holy Grail: you take away everything that makes it an "Arthur" story, and you're left with a bland "haven't-I-seen-this-before?" action flick. At various times throughout the film, I was reminded of "Gladiator," "Braveheart," "Lord of the Rings," and even "Saving Private Ryan," but there was nothing to make this an Arthur story except the characters' names. They could have been any small army in any ancient land.Furthermore (and even worse), I never figured out what the point of this movie was. Arthur and his knights go from one place to another, fight a few times, and eventually Arthur becomes king (which you already knew would happen, so I'm not spoiling anything). But there is no intrigue, nothing to make me care about these characters or what they're fighting for. In fact, they don't even know what they're fighting for, or if they do, they don't communicate it very well to the audience.I would say, don't waste your time with this movie unless you want your mind numbed for a couple hours. It has no coherent plot, no interesting character development, unimpressive battle scenes, and almost no resemblance to any Arthur story ever told. The one good thing I can say about it is that the lead actors are very good in their roles; they just didn't have much of a script to work with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie seems to beg the Joe Bob Biggs treatment. It is at that level of sophistication. Maybe a Mystery Science Theater 3000 showing as well. You should leave any logic at the door to the individual screening room after looking at the coming attractions. Personally I thought that the cardboard coming attraction for Kind Arthur was far more entertaining and eye-catching than most of this movie. It has Ms. Knightley --great name for a movie called King Arthur--and what more does any male straight moviegoer want from a Jerry Bruckheimer extravaganza except a bare bellied beauty and a lot of explosions? Oh, I suppose that the cardboard coming attractions poster does not have enough skin or super large explosions. You could imagine the cardboard coming attraction display on fire and get much of the special effects of the movie. I still cannot figure out how the archers can shoot arrows high in the air and not miss their own men and women fighting within the enemy. Must be some new kind of medieval technology. Or maybe Roman? ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing must be said about 'King Arthur' before I start praising it: the movie sucks. The acting is wasted and rounded up in a politically correct, tight simple script with no dimension and room for any character to breathe. King Arthur would scream of androgynous boredom if it not for the actors who held the whole bloody thing afloat for themselves. That is the only reason why you should this movie.The story of King Arthur gets its own modern spin as the knights have to rescue the Pope's godson from the invading Saxons in their final quest.When a movie begins with its own text speaking of possible factual events, surely it has to be believed! But returning to the actors at hand. Owen and crew give a performance that deserves more credit than having this movie dumped on them. King Arthur is a prime example of good acting in a bad movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mind-bogglingly average</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clive Owen at the helm here (no pun intended).***SPOILERS AHEAD!***'King Arthur' is probably one of the most average movies I've ever seen. It's so startlingly average it defies the laws of average movies. You have a very typical good vs evil standoff, with periods of absolutely stagnation during the middle of the movie, and the very standard fight at the end. Ray Winstone steals the show, and Clive Owen feels very slightly miscast as the main protagonist (I just wish he'd get over it and be James Bond already!). You know who's going to die and who isn't. Ray Winstone can't die because he has 11 (or 12, depending on Lancelot's nighttime habits), and America is all about family, so you can rule him out. Lancelot has to die because he battles the evil head-Saxon before Arthur does (Arthur promises to kill Mr. Evil Head-Saxon), so you know Lancelot's fight is in vain. Kiera Knightly plays Guinivere, although no Guinivere I've ever heard of, and England sprouts some huge mountains I've never seen before (probably because the movie was filmed in Ireland). The best scene of the movie is a scene on ice, with some serious bow-and-arrow action that would make Legolas drool. After an amusing exchange of words, Lancelot and Guinivere fire upon the enemy upon the ice, and it all culminates with some ice-cracking and general excitement.The end however, doesn't really....work. It feels very staggered, and didn't flow as well as it maybe should have. The action is very run of the mill, and you never really find yourself cheering for Arthur and his Knights, but oh well, like I said - it's mind-bogglingly average.One part that did amuse me greatly however, was when Guinivere enters Arthur's tent and they 'make love', for some inexplicable reason. A small child at the showing starting crying and was removed from the room. I know how he felt. It's a solid 6/10 movie, but you've seen it all before, - many times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is great for repairing the damage done by years of awful ancient and medieval movies, from Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves through Braveheart right on down to Troy, filled with jarring historical inaccuracies: bright, chemical costume dyes, military uniforms, and absurdly modern characters are common to all of them. America is the only country in the world that produces this garbage. Enough already! I want my ancient times ancient. Fuqua is to be commended for (obviously) bringing in an excellent archaeological staff. And I imagine archaeologists come a bit cheaper than Kevin Costner, Mel Gibson, or Brad Pitt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Concept, Good Cast, Borrowed Battles, So-so film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was near the top of my list for summer movies to see, and so see it I did, and...well...that will probably be the only time I do. But it wasn't all bad, let's break it downThe Story: The story had a good half and a bad half. I've got to hand it to the writers for putting so much of the Arthur legend into (mostly) believable historical settings and times. Looking at Arthur from a historical perspective allowed them to leave behind the tired legend and examine something more than just jousts, grails and damsels in distress. However, some of that stuff can be exciting, this story wasn't. While it may be pretty historically accurate, it just isn't interesting enough for the audience to care. The importance of "freedom" and saving some kid are lost in the battles themselves as well as the character moments.The Director: It was interesting to see what Fuqua would do with this after seeing the superb Training Day. While he was able to make a coherent semi-epic he wasn't able to (or just didn't) give any style or voice to the film, it was pretty textbook.The cast: I was excited to see Clive Owen in a leading role after his turns as the Driver in the BMW Films and his small part in the Bourne Identity. He doesn't disappoint, but at the same time, he's not going to rocket to the top of the A-List. Hopefully this will boost his career though. Keira Knightly was so-so as Guinevere. Her accent seemed a bit pushed at points although she was pretty believable as a warrior and come on, she's attractive too. The other knights did well in their stock character roles, I have no complaints there. The worst case of miscasting was Stellan Skarsgard as the chief Saxon. He seemed to sleep through the movie and his accent was unplaceable (this goes for the other saxons as well, try and get some uniformity guys). He was not intimidating and seemed rather tired/bored.Finally, a note on borrowing: While watching this, I couldn't help but think I'd seen some of the film before. I know this isn't true, but there were way to many hints of other films for this to seem a truly original picture. The films that came to mind were Gladiator, Troy, The Patriot, Braveheart and the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Then again, giant medieval battles can only be shot so many ways, whatever. There you have it the cast is good except skarsgard. The story is a interesting concept, but not an interesting plot line. I'd like to see a more Training Day-ish picture from Fuqua. Maybe Hollywood should tone down the historical epics. Don't worry about missing this movie, it's probably only worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible execution, a waste of time and talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a great example of why adults don't go to see movies these days, even when the movies are obviously aimed to appeal to them. Throw some nice visual scenery, some special effects, and the story doesn't need to make sense, the crises don't need to be plausible! This seems to be the working theory for studios when they make blockbusters. I really had hopes for this film, and I ended up being reminded why I never go to see crap that looks like it should be good. Clive Owen's character was stoic, and practically non-human. I didn't care what his quest was, or that "freedom" was the reason he fought all of a sudden. No explanation was given as to why this should be a major driving force for him. Kiera Knightley played a seductively-playful, tomboyish Guinevere who fights alongside the guys, but even her intriguing portrayal can't be saved by the hokey situations the director and producers put her in. Entirely unbelievable and, actually, pretty ridiculous. I am a person who watches movies closely, and I still don't understand what this movie was about or why I should care. I don't. I should not have to ask my friend "why is this character doing that?", "did I miss something?" To me, this is purely frustrating, and very bad story-telling. There were also moments where the characters stood in the frame for too-long, saying and doing nothing, when it added nothing to the movie. There were sentimental moments, like when Tristan releases his hawk to "freedom", that occurred in about a millisecond when it could've been built up and added to a theme. But, since there was really no discernible theme, I guess it just didn't matter to the creators. This was a horrible disappointment, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone - not even my 15 year old brother, who thinks today's "horror" movies are pure genius. At least those are supposed to be crap, this one thinks its not crap but it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Arthurian movie but good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, 'King Arthur' is a LOUSY Arthurian film, and all that marketing crap about this being the 'real' King Arthur was just that ? crap. Even if Arthur was based on a real person, and even if that person might have lived in 5th century England, he probably didn't serve the Romans, hail from Sarmatia, or fight the Saxons. And when they speak of 'the myths of the 15th century,' they're way off. Chretian de Troyes, who invented the whole Lancelot/ Guinevere/ Arthur triangle, wrote in 1170, and he bastardized the original Celtic myth from at least a few centuries before that (which had no Lancelot or Guinevere, and was mostly about Arthur and the Gawain family knocking heads. See? I did learn something in college). So the entire premise that this movie has anything to do with Arthur, either 'real' or 'mythic', is total bunk.But if you discard any pre-supposed notions of Arthurian legend and just take this movie for what it is ? an action film set in medieval fantasy land ? it's actually not bad. Clive Owen plays the eponymous hero, the leader of an exceptionally skilled band of knights who serve the Romans, who are about to pull out of Britain. Arthur and his boys ? Lancelot (Ioan Gruffud), Tristan (Mads Mikkelsen), Galahad (Hugh Dancy), Dagonet (Ray Stevenson), and Bors (the enormously likable Ray Winstone, playing much the same role he did twenty years ago as Will Scarlet in Richard Carpenter's amazing Robin of Sherwood) ? are sent off on one final mission for Rome. So it's really less about King Arthur and more about a brotherhood of knights on a hazardous journey and the choices and sacrifices they must make.A lot of the re-interpretations are very interesting. Again, as Arthurian fantasy, it's bunk, but taken on its own, there's a lot of interesting set-up here. Merlin and Guinevere are both given compelling makeovers, and Bors is particularly appealing (part of that is his earthiness, and part of that is just Winstone). Lancelot, whom I've always particularly disliked, is very well rendered here ? again, because he's not really 'Lancelot.'Arthurian purists will probably hate this film ? and not without reason. But there was more than enough intriguing plot set up and character depth that I was more than entertained. The action is kind of fast and hectic, and the battle scenes lack a little punch, but most of the production design is top notch (and reasonably in keeping with the time period) and most of the leads are given enough individuality ? not always a certainty in films like these ? to make them easily identifiable and engaging. The background premise ? that home is what you make it, not some 'place' ? is worked nicely into the plot.While 'Arthur' won't win any awards, it's much better than the critics are letting on. Just let go of everything you know of King Arthur when you see the movie, and you'll enjoy it a hell of a lot more. Frankly, I would like to have seen even more character depth and exposition (particularly with the villains, who are just evil because they are): we're given a fair amount of motivation for the heroes, and enough development to support all the speeches and the action. I feel this film would have been much better received had they named it King Godric, or what have you. I know tying into Arthur was largely a marketing ploy, but the very thing which is supposed to stir interest in the film in the first place ends up being the key element that works against it. As I said, jettison ANY connection to Arthur and this movie plays just fine ? a little overdone in a few spots, maybe, but overall very satisfying.</fullReview>

Don't get me wrong, I still appreciate the movie. And though I don't really know much about King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table (ancient Greece is more my thing), I can tell there are some clear (afore-mentioned) differences between what actually happened and what the movie portrays. An 7.5 on the scale of 1-10. Point being: clever story editing, by all means, see the movie. If you prefer the whole history thing, see Spider-Man 2 instead. It's better than the first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Cast Carries the Film Over Its Rough Spots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a serviceable movie that could have been a great movie. In spite of some editing problems (due in part to Disney's last minute decision to go from R to PG), and some pedestrian direction (seems like Fuqua got lucky with "Training Day"), there are elements to this "King Arthur" that are quite wonderful and make it well worth seeing. First and foremost, is the cast, and I'm talking about the core group of actors that comprise Arthur and his knights. Criticisms of Clive Owen's performance seem way off base to me. He gives a nuanced, passionate performance as an idealist whose every belief and construct around which he's built his life is being ruthlessly challenged. David Franzoni's script gives him some real clunkers, but he acts the character with such earnestness and guilelessness, that he brings it off beautifully. Kudos also go to Ioan Gruffudd, who serves as Owen's ideological and emotional counterpoint in the film. Gruffudd's Lancelot is a seething, bitter lost soul whose loyalty to Arthur only slightly outweighs his loyalty to his own coldly pragmatic interests. He's given a compelling and moving character arc and acts it wonderfully in the relatively limited screen time he's given. The other standout in the group is Ray Winstone, who plays what looks to be a stereotypical bluff blowhard that always turns up in this kind of movie. He's profane, loud, and boorish, but also unexpectedly tender and vulnerable. Winstone takes what could have been a cartoon, and gives him humanity. The other knights receive less individual attention, but all register as distinct personalities. The way these men interact with one another creates an almost palpable sense of camaraderie, and it's this that gives the film it's surprising purity of heart and carry it over the parts that don't work. What didn't work, at least for me, were the parts of the film that concentrated on the Saxons and the Woads. The former were stereotypical brutish idiots, and it was difficult to feel any genuine menace from them. The latter were given no identity as a people, although Steven Dillane, as their leader, gave an intense, mystical kind of performance that might have been more compelling with more screen time. Overall, this is a flawed film that could have been much, much more, but remains worth seeing for it's marvelous core of main actors. They ultimately make the journey a pleasure, the action (some of which is superb) have meaning, and the movie, as uneven as it is, well worth seeing.</fullReview>

Keira Knightley (fine as always) was great as Guinevere. The knights were awesome as well. I think the thing that made the movie for me was just how passionate Arthur was for wanting to do his duty and not let the Saxon's take over. One of the best moments of the film was when Alecto's father (whose name escapes me at the moment) kidnaps the kid and Keira steps up and shoots him with an arrow, it was just great.I must reiterate this fact that King Arthur was one of the absolute greatest films I have EVER seen.</fullReview>

It was a tad silly that when they were on the ice, the Knights of the Round were armor-clad, and Guinevere was in a flowing dress. The final battle scene was really cool, and Guinevere's woad was interesting. Also, Tristan, played by Mads Mikkelsen, was a fun character. I particularly liked the tattoo under his left eye. Arthur himself was a cool character, played by Clive Owens. Lancelot had a big part but the ending concerning him and Tristan I did not like.

The battle scenes were obviously well planned, and amazingly executed. But I found Arthur's constant appeals to God, who was by and large ignored by the rest of the characters, to be forced, and tedious in nature.This movie would have been much better served if it did not bear the name King Arthur.

He doesn't become king until the last five minutes of the movie, the time in which you are still wishing that the final battle has lasted a much longer that it did. A better title would have been "Knights of the Round Table" or "Knight Arthur" or even "No there isn't a Holy Grail, but we did find Guinevere in a dungeon". The title of the movie should go along with the movie itself. The tagline ("Rule your fate") was better chosen than the title. And that's saying something for some of the taglines that are out these days.On the flip side of the coin, the action was decent. There was more than one "big" battle. The story also wasn't predictable because the accuracy was so far off. Scenery was done fairly well. I wasn't expecting anything special, though. That's pretty much it on the other side of the coin. Not nearly as much as there is to criticize...This movie would have been much, much better if it had been historically accurate. Even if there wasn't as much action, somebody could still understand the story of Arthur instead of reading the entire book.I give this movie 1.5/5 stars. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, though...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>10/10 for Exciting and Excellent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and foremost, I love epic films. I enjoy Braveheart, Gladiator, Troy, The Last Samurai and I really enjoyed King Arthur! I rank this movie right up there with those films. It was entertaining and action packed. The story kept you engaged in the film and wanting more. It had plenty of captivating dialogue and the action was perfectly spread, throughout the film.The movie does not take long for the action to begin, as Arthur and his Knights protect the Bishop and his caravan from Merlin's rogues, in an enthralling fight scene. The scene with Arthur's threat to the Bishop after they were denied their freedom to rescue the "bishop in training" was captivating. Arthur and his Knights looked majestic and ferocious to say the least. They also fought with such precision and command.Guinevere was also a vicious fighting machine! The fight scene on the frozen lake was a thing of beauty. Bors (the big fighting machine with lots of children ... LOL) was very entertaining and funny in the movie, as he was strong. The rescue mission and the final battle between Arthur (and his Knights) against the Saxon's was epic and fresh. The entire movie was a blast and I definitely recommend it.2 THUMBS WAAAAAAY UP!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I definitely have mixed thoughts and emotions about this movie. I can't really say that I liked it. I can't really say I didn't like it. I'm sitting on the fence. I've always loved the story of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, but this movie takes everything to a new proportion. It really has nothing to do with the original story, but I guess that's because it's an adaptation. Still, perhaps stories should not have this extreme of an adaptation. The only thing I truly liked was the actors. Clive Owen, Keira Knightly, Joel Edgerton, Ioan Gruffudd, and Mads Mikkelson among many others made quite the performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best for history, and Good Battle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was great that the History Channel had their special of the story of King Arthur before and during the release of this movie. "King Arthur" compliments that special greatly, and will give viewers the sensation of, "oh yah! that really happened... and thats the right place!"The battle scenes were refreshing. Very entertaining, with an actual taste of suspense. This cannot be said for other "epic" movies of recent times... like the CGI infested "Troy". All in all, it seems we haven't had anything different since "Braveheart", yet "King Arthur" puts some nice icing on things.I will most definitely own this DVD, as it will make a perfect addition to the classic 1981 "Excalibur". "Excalibur" is the 15th century's french rendition of the story of Arthur, whereas "King Arthur" is the 5th-6th century understanding of history to the best of our knowledge.Casting was great, directing did not let us down (like "Troy"), and cinematography was beautifully done.Hail King Arthur!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pray that the DVD is a "Director's Cut"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie suffers from extremely obvious over cutting to acquire the PG-13 rating so sought after by the Hollywood woosies who call themselves "investors"/"producers." Interestingly(?) enough, some kids at the matinee I attended actually slept(!) through parts of the film. Several teenagers who also saw this disappointment of a film at the same showing afterwards joined me in convincing at least 30 people waiting in line for the next showing -- at full price -- not(!) to waste their money. We were so successful that the theater owner threatened to call mall security to remove us.The "battle" scenes are so toned down as to be akin to the those done by Hollywood in the '40s and '50s. There is none of the visceral violence evoked by "Braveheart" or even this summer's "Troy." There is far too much essentially meaningless dialogue, probably left in to make up a decent running time caused by truncating the battle and other action sequences. That said, the cast is good to excellent and one can only pray that a "Director's Cut" DVD version will reflect their work even better.I seldom advise people to avoid a film. This is one of those rare occasions: SAVE YOUR MONEY (AND YOUR TIME) - DO *NOT* SEE "KING ARTHUR!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rent Excalibur instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't waste time and money on Jerry Brukhiemer's (sp?) version of Arthurian History. For the love of God- don't. The historical inaccuracies hurt my head. Not the idea that Arthur was real (although it might not have ticked me off if they hadn't said that there was proof in the opening teaser, the mere inclusion of a lot of characters immediately negates that) but there are many other little things that nag at me. It is laughable whenever they allude to a part of the myth (I was in hysterics during the "sword from the stone" sequence.) Merlin (a character I much love and is instrumental in all tellings of Arthur) is diminished to an old man with two minutes of screen time and of little importance. The depiction of Guenivere is horrific to any lover of Arthurian legend. They made her a chick fighter for peet's sake! Poor Kiera Knightly she honestly thinks that she is a feminist for doing this.The humor is very forced, to the point where after a joke is said you'll wait two seconds and go "oh, that was a joke... ha.... ha...The guy who plays Arthur has one expression and he uses it the entire film. Even when he's getting some he still has his angry expression. When he is getting married he still looks angry. Oy. I just wanted him to try and crack a smile just once.Without the magic and the wonder Arthur is a very dull and dreary tale. The themes are gone, (The closest thing to a theme this movie gets is war: bad, home/freedom: good) and the intrigue and the drama are gone. Just rent John Boorman's Excalibur, honestly, it is the best film representation of Arthur to date. Heck if that's out rent Camelot, that's better than this junk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Arthur compelling but suffers from bad film editing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I took off work early yesterday so I could see Bruckheimer's new "King Arthur" on opening day. I liked this new darker version of Arthur and his knights although I felt the film suffered from some bad film editing trying to fit it into a shorter time slot than it deserved. I think there should have been a more in-depth introduction of characters and examples of experiences that resulted in their bonding as a combat unit and brotherhood that occurred over time as they served together. The film opens with Lancelot being "drafted" and taken from his Sarmatian family as a youth. Then the film jumps ahead 15 years and Arthur and his battle-hardened cavalry are seen riding to the rescue of a bishop traveling to a fort along Hadrian's wall. There is an obvious bond between the men but the viewer is not given any background for this close bond or the legendary exploits that others in the film refer to.In "Gladiator", Ridley Scott illustrates the relationship between Maximus and his men in the opening sequence. You can almost read Maximus' thoughts as he fingers the wheat, smiles at the bird, then his face hardens as he thinks about the battle to come. He passes down the line of his troops, sharing quips, patting armor, obviously respected by his troops as a leader who has shared their lot. He and Quintus discuss the placement of the catapults, clearly establishing Quintus as the second in command and, when Quintus expresses concern about Maximus' safety, demonstrating he is obviously bonded to Maximus as well. Arthur's director, Antoine Fuqua, leaves the audience guessing about the knights and their relationships to themselves and Arthur. A special relationship between Lancelot and Arthur is slightly inferred but not demonstrated well enough to bring the appropriate level of pathos to the final scenes. Several times throughout the film, Fuqua seems to almost pause the action for a "Kodak" moment. The pauses are so noticeable that I felt they interrupted the flow of the narrative although I must admit I didn't mind at all having a long look at Clive Owen in his Roman attire.Slight spoiler ahead: I also thought the sequence where Arthur discovers a Roman noble's bodyguards bricking up a dungeon where Guinevere is being starved to death by monks for her pagan ways while everyone else is fleeing to escape the Saxons (whose drums are heard loudly in the background) a bit contrived. I think it would have been more natural for Arthur and Guinevere to have come into conflict on opposing sides, with Arthur a witness to her warrior skills, then have Arthur get to know her on a personal level when the two sides join to fight the Saxons. As it is, Guinevere is near death when Arthur rescues her. She recovers rather quickly, then is hardly challenged when she announces she is staying with the knights in their delaying action on the frozen lake. Again, I felt there was some insightful film footage that ended up on the cutting room floor. Even so, Guinevere is in a feminine flowing gown during that battle. Later when the Saxons attack the fort, a Guinevere covered with tattoos and sporting a skimpy leather bikini charges into battle and the knights hardly notice the difference.Of course, I was also a little taken aback that Stellan Skarsgard, my sweet Theseus from the Helen of Troy miniseries, could be such a hardened, merciless warrior. He played the part well, however.Overall, however, I liked this version of the Arthur legend better than the fairy tale world of Sir Thomas Mallory. The characters were much more human and believable in their vices and disillusionment that surely were experienced by many Britons during this period of cataclysmic upheaval.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well it's not like we don't know the story of King Arthur, so there is really no need for a plot since we all know that King Arthur will save the day. Well, in this case save the pope's favourite godson.To tell the truth, if Keira Knightley isn't part of the cast, I wouldn't even consider seeing this movie. She might be the only reason people know about this film. I'm not saying this is a bad movie, but after LOTR, people are going to compare and obviously King Arthur will loose. In this film the jokes are funny, the scenes are beautiful, and the excitement does exist but the whole film is full of cliché. You basically know what to expect.Keira Knightley does standout quite a bit. If you like Keira Knightley or simply looking for some thrills then this is not a bad movie to watch during the summer time; if you are looking for a story-based, meaningful film then this is not worth your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Arthur is a good movie, not a great movie. It does away with most of the legendary story of King Arthur and tells the supposedly historically accurate telling of the man who was probably the inspiration for the King Arthur legends. I remember hearing somebody say one time "if trying to decide between the truth and the legend, print the legend." That is exactly the attitude I have about this movie. It is entertaining and the actors do a good job, but I thought the characters were out of place. They should be of a much later period after the fall of Rome. This movie feels like an Elseworlds comic book. For those of you unfamiliar with Elseworlds, they are a series of comic book from DC that put familiar characters in unfamiliar situations. For example, the recent Red Son of Krypton spectulates what would happen if Superman was raised in the Soviet Union, not The United States. That's what this movie feels like. King Arthur, Guineuvere, Lancelot, and Merlin are all here, but in a different situation. It just doesn't feel right. Watch this movie on video or TV but skip the movie theater, it is just not worth it. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable historical fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, set in a period that is not often covered in film. In the waning days of the Roman Empire, Arthur and his horsemen are sent on one last mission north of Hadrian's wall. Their experiences along the way and back are convincing as the "true story" that supposedly inspires the Arthurian Legends. I'm sure this movie is shot through with historical inaccuracies beyond the ones I recognized (and I saw a few logical ones as well), but the overall "feel" got me to buy into the story. The comraderie of the knights was well-acted, and though Clive Owen's Arthur seemed a little superhero-like (i.e. wooden) at the beginning he quickly became a believable character. As events unfolded I enjoyed recognizing the "true" fictional events that would evolve into the later legends.The ending was a little flat, primarily due to the overly-restrained violence and the performance of the Saxon king. He really should have gone Bezerker instead of the slow burn he'd done successfully in previous scenes. And the battle scenes lose a fair bit of punch without any blood being shed anywhere, save but some red-stained swords. Clearly this was done to secure a more profitable rating. Here's hoping for a bloodier DVD release.I've hated virtually every Dark Ages/Medievil/Renaissance/Roman Empire/Swordplay movie since John Boorman's excellent "Excalibur", and I liked this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Arthur One Yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning, this may contain some spoilers:Well, this movie was pretty good. I gave it a nine because it is the best Arthurian movie. No crap about lady-of-the-lake or some evil incestuous sister, no Merlin the Magician.It's a very realistic portrayal of a half Woad (original Briton) half Roman general Arturius who leads a band of legendary calvary knights who are the big names of "Camelot".Guinivere is not a simpering crying hysterical Julia Ormond, she's a butt kicking hot Kiera Knightly who's a helluva lot more realistic than other Guins. She's a warrior of the Woads, a society where men AND women did fight.In the plot Arthur and his knights will gain freedom from 15 years of servitude if they rescue a Roman family deep in Britania, saving them from the invading Saxon horde.Now it did a good job of showing how twisted the Romans could be, but it also really attacks Christianity which was a little disturbing, even to a non Christian like me.Arthur rescues the family who's son may one day be a pope and rescues their servants including the Woad warrior Guinivere.Arthur has been waging war against the Woads for some time but in the face of the Saxons he joins up with them.Parts are cheesy like forcing Arthur to acknowledge his half Woad side, and also the enduring motto 'for freedom!' I kept laughing because every time someone said the fight was for the cause of freedom someone in the theater did a Braveheart routine.Okay, so we get it, the natives of Britania loved freedom.Well the plot moved a little slowly and the battle scenes weren't that great. Why must directors always shake the freaking cameras in battle scenes so you can barely tell what's going on?Also the Woads had no shields, which was pretty odd since they did have them in reality. And the Saxons were portrayed as a barbarian horde which is as far from the truth as the image of shiny metal adorned Golden God-like warriors is.It's much more historically accurate except for a few small details which I know if they allowed in would have slowed the plot even more.It was overall good and I'd recommend you see it in the theaters. However, if you LOVED Camelot and the fantasy that Guinivere was a slut doing Lancelot as well Arthur, this ain't the movie for you.There's great eye candy. Guinivere (Knightly) is mega hot and shows off skin, Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd) is also mega hot but we never get to see any skin. Bummer. But the half naked Woads aren't all bad to look at, girls.I'd recommend this movie, and as a nice change from most Arthurian legends it has a happy ending which leaves you hopeful, though us history buffs know in the end the Saxons conquered the island until the Norman invasion in the early 13th century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, given that it is based on the more realistic side of King Arthur, was very well done. The music and setting for the movie gives the viewer a more,... dramatic feeling of King Arthur and the things he and his Knights have been through. This is one of those movies that draw the viewer in on adventure and the viewer may be able to connect with the basic values that the movie is set upon. the dress that the characters are set in are expected and the actors and actresses do give some more depth to their characters but that can be expected from such a fascinating "tale". The movie pulls you in makes you sort of feel for the characters instead of just waiting for their next move, i don't know i guess it kind of made you anticipate their next action along with them. The reason for my rating of only 7 out of 10 stars is the fact that most of it is expected and you really aren't left with anything else after it ended, the plot alone can get at least 6 out of 10 stars so why should the movie, which simply expressed the plot and touching adventure get a 10?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so excited to see another King Arthur movie ! That is all I read &amp; study. Then alas I am broken hearted again. The time line was terribly wrong!Hollywood really needs to take a cue from Jack Whyte. Give us some real history along with the legend. And reality.And I am very tired of the Lancelot/Guinevere story. So what? If she was a Celtic Queen she could of had lovers. Look who Chretien De Troyes' was writing for. Eleanor of Aquitania!I would love to see Michael Crichton do with King Arthur (With Jack Whyte) what Tom Hanks did for " Band of Brothers". Now that would be an epic. Mr. Crichton has the sense to do his research like he did with " Eaters of the Dead". At least John Boorman did his. Which I loved.In this movie they just seemed to slap it together &amp; put Arthur's name on it. But I did like Clive Owen &amp; the actor that played Germanus. Hell if it would have been Germanus, he would have went himself.(cept he would have too old) And if Arthur was a famous Roman, there would have been records.A great man's name lives on for a reason.... But,Hollywood can't seem to find it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, given that it is based on the more realistic side of King Arthur, was very well done. The music and setting for the movie gives the viewer a more,... dramatic feeling of King Arthur and the things he and his Knights have been through. This is one of those movies that draw the viewer in on adventure and the viewer may be able to connect with the basic values that the movie is set upon. the dress that the characters are set in are expected and the actors and actresses do give some more depth to their characters but that can be expected from such a fascinating "tale". The movie pulls you in makes you sort of feel for the characters instead of just waiting for their next move, i don't know i guess it kind of made you anticipate their next action along with them. The reason for my rating of only 7 out of 10 stars is the fact that most of it is expected and you really aren't left with anything else after it ended, the plot alone can get at least 6 out of 10 stars so why should the movie, which simply expressed the plot and touching adventure get a 10?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood needs to do better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so excited to see another King Arthur movie ! That is all I read &amp; study. Then alas I am broken hearted again. The time line was terribly wrong!Hollywood really needs to take a cue from Jack Whyte. Give us some real history along with the legend. And reality.And I am very tired of the Lancelot/Guinevere story. So what? If she was a Celtic Queen she could of had lovers. Look who Chretien De Troyes' was writing for. Eleanor of Aquitania!I would love to see Michael Crichton do with King Arthur (With Jack Whyte) what Tom Hanks did for " Band of Brothers". Now that would be an epic. Mr. Crichton has the sense to do his research like he did with " Eaters of the Dead". At least John Boorman did his. Which I loved.In this movie they just seemed to slap it together &amp; put Arthur's name on it. But I did like Clive Owen &amp; the actor that played Germanus. Hell if it would have been Germanus, he would have went himself.(cept he would have too old) And if Arthur was a famous Roman, there would have been records.A great man's name lives on for a reason.... But,Hollywood can't seem to find it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad even if you don't know the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you know the story of King Arthur, you'll know that it's the quintessential medieval tragedy. If you know this and see this movie, it'll irk you constantly. If you even know British history, this movie will irk you constantly.And even if you don't know either of these things, the movie is still bad work altogether. My friend had no knowledge of either of these things and he suggested leaving faster than I did. Neither of us left, and we both regret the minutes of our lives we'll never get back.The story begins with the film makers claiming that this movie is based on the true story of King Arthur and recent archaeological findings about him. It then launches into the backstory of how Lancelot, the knight everyone knows was totally fabricated, came to Britain from Samarita (?) after the Romans forced the skilled horsemen and their sons to become knights for the Roman legion. This then awkwardly cuts to Arthur and his knights saving a Roman bishop from the Woad, which are apparently Celts of some sort but the film makers apparently felt that naming them after their warpaint was a pretty sweet idea. Delivering the bishop safely is their release from their indentured servitude, but, hey, who wants a fifteen minute movie? So they have to do one more thing and then they can go home. The knights themselves and Arthur, who should be the focal point of the story, are instead paper thin and uninteresting. They are essentially stock characters, and their determination to going to their distant home seriously violates the historical background many of them have in real life, such as Tristram, who here is delegated the role of the lovable, hawking dunce. The story then bumbles into some sort of sudden invasion of Saxons from the north, raping and killing. Stellan Skarsg?rd here has a fairly interesting role as the Saxon leader, although he does seem to have something like a Southern accent, which is pretty odd. Arthur rescues Guinevere, a Woad prisoner, from a stock character Roman ruler who is doing the work of God, and then they fall in love without any hesitation. Many things in the story, such as Excalibur, are trivialized and seem almost out of place in the scenes in which they're put. In the end the point of the movie seems to be... well, it doesn't seem to have one. It's visually impressive, to some degree (certain effects are quite poor), but it's clumsily put together. The acting is poor in many places and if you know anything about King Arthur, you know that it's supposed to be a tragedy. I'd like to list all the historical and thematic problems with the story, but that would just be a waste of everyone's time. Just don't go see it. Go see Spiderman 2 again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhere between Good-Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Arthur was in some ways a better movie than I heard it out to be. At the same time there were a couple disagreements I had with it. First of all, Clive Owen came off as a better actor then I thought him to be. His character wasn't the most original but he brought about an above-average performance that I agreed with throughout the film. The rest of the knights had their own personalities also that shined through bit-by-bit. The battles weren't the most spectacular that I had seen but they were enjoyable. All the costumes were very well done. The knights' armor looked right for the time, the Woads' attire seemed to fit their surroundings and the Saxons came off as brooding barbarians, easily identifying them as the villains.Now for the things that went sour with me. Keira Knightly as Guinevere (which I think was a good pick) only appeared on screen for about a quarter of the film and her character (among the others) weren't expanded on too well. For only about 20 minutes we see her in her battle garb and blue paint that we're familiar in the movie poster and still shots. Best guess is that Bruckheimer put her in to be a face more familiar to moviegoers, not to mention the two worked together in Pirates of the Caribbean. The Lancelot-Guinevere affair is hardly touched on, only a few scenes of them exchanging glances.I think the film was worth my five bucks for a good Wednesday afternoon. I knew there would be some inaccuracy (or however you spell it) with the movie trying to be historically accurate. It didn't nail it or the story down flat but that's alright. I tried to enjoy it as an epic, Arthur or no Arthur. I'd give it about 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pick the good out of this average film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has become part of my life in a rather unexpected way. When I was first watching it I did not even notice the musical score. It was part of the background and I wasn't trying to listen to it for the sake of review. Perhaps not being noticeable is already a sign of a good soundtrack. A really good soundtrack you do notice, like Ennio Morricone's work, but you also notice a bad soundtrack or one that does not fit what happens on screen. Having rewatched parts of the movie recently and having paid more attention to the music I actually noticed bits of soundtrack being rehashed and glued together in an awkward way, but not too noticeable.Whatever the music's quality is as a soundtrack for this film, what matters is that after I came across it later, without the film attached to it, it has become a permanent addition to my mp3 player. There is a good variety in the soundtrack, in its character and pacing, and all of it sounds epic and emotional, especially the track "Woad to Ruin". I've come up with whole stories in my head while listening to it (and they were better than this movie I think). This is simply one of the best soundtracks of all time, though the averageness of the movie may end up burying it in obscureness.There is another reason for noticing this film. There is a gentleman here who plays the leader of Saxons, a Sweedish actor by the name of Stellan Skarsg?rd. This guy is awesome! His acting is subdued, too subdued perhaps as the director makes him whisper a lot, but there is something regal and menacing about his delivery. His spoken lines are few, but great and meaningful. I wish this guy was in the film more. He is only in about 5 scenes. Someone needs to make a movie about this guy! Everything else about this film reeks with averageness. Well?it looks good, there are some cool scenes, in the background, but these scenes are cool when taken separately. They are cool like a technical cinematographic demo, but the movie as a whole lacks punch. The dialogue is not natural. The characters lack definition, despite being given different looking outfits and haircuts. This attempt at a realistic historical portrayal of king Arthur's legend is unfortunately very low-key and bland.So it is a question whether the effect this film had upon my life, the discovery of an interesting actor and a great soundtrack that has been serving as a source of inspiration for a long time, can be counted towards the score that this movie on its own would deserve. To add to that deliberation, there is supposedly also a director's cut of this film that's a better product...it's a shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De-mythologizing Arthur? Pish!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My reaction to this steaming pile is, What's the point? We don't even know if there ever was an Arthur. The whole thing is a myth, and that is it's value, much like Beowulf. There is no value in perpetrating this brutish, unwashed, demystified Arthurian legend, except to confirm us in our current brutish, unwashed, demystified, already meaningless lives. It offers nothing to aspire to, just more brutish, amoral filth for us to wallow in so that we feel no challenge to ascend further than the ends of our own phalluses. I hate garbage like this. It's a waste of good acting and production value. Who cares what the dirty politics of some band of preposterously over-educated savages was like? The result, while stripped down to its materialistic a priori suppositions, is no less far-fetched or improbable than were the myths! It just happens to mesh with modern materialistic biases. This Arthur is just as fanciful and unhistorical as any of the others dreamed up by either Geoffrey Monmouth or Alfred Tennyson; the whole setting is anachronistic and implausible according to all the historical evidence. This trend of forcing ancient myths to fit some modern materialistic procrustean bed is more arrogantly myopic than anything that ancient literature ever perpetrated on society, especially since it offers nothing to enrich us in becoming more authentically human, which the ancient myths at their very worst, still offered.This film is a symptom of the very worst plague of modern materialism's obsession with re- writing all of history in its own arrogant, self-congratulating image.Pish!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love history films but here's really nothing positive to say about "King Arthur".Love Arthur's dreamy face, from every possible angle. Love Lancelot's perfectly permed hair. Gaze upon Keira Knightly again and again. This film focuses on making the leads look unrealistically beautiful more than a good story.This film imagines Arthur as a Roman Centurion, an idea which might work out well given the proper execution.The plot is underwhelming and loaded with clichés. The acting is poorly directed, and the dialogue is just atrocious. The soundtrack is an annoying hodgepodge of every epic/medieval soundtrack ever made.As you might expect, we get a predictable love affair, and a climactic battle where the good bosses fight the bad bosses. "King Arthur" is hopelessly ridiculous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been watching Arthur movies since I caught a late, late, late showing of Camelot when I was about 14. Before that all my Arthuring was done by book. I read a lot, still do. This movie could have been called Twinkie-Toes and his band of Cream-Puffs for all the info of King Arthur there is in it. It is a great movie but calling it King Arthur was pointless. Watching him call his band of knights by the knights of the round tables names was actually frustrating. The movie could have been about anyone. For a period piece is was pretty darn good. If they had not represented it as a movie about the mythical King Arthur I would have given it a 10. I watched Camelot just yesterday on DVD and started watching King Arthur tonight but just could not make it past the first half hour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely horrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The following may contain spoilers... in fact, it is sure to... so just be careful.King Arthur was a disappointment as both a movie and as an experience. I did not enjoy this picture, not only because of its mediocre acting from otherwise excellent actors who were stymied by bad directing, but also its weak plot device; but mainly because it had the insanity to claim it was "based on a true story".King Arthur is a pleasant piece of European literature, but in no means a true story. This movie pretends that it is, but it is filled with not only very poor historical details (which should be ignored, because Hollywood never really attends to historical details in any case), but it is illogical.I won't bore you with too many details, it's just so ridiculous. One minute a huge army is moving through a green leafy forest in mid-spring, the next day it is snowing so hard that a massive lake is nearly frozen solid, hard enough for an entire army to march over it, rather then go around it. The entire horror of the movie was "north of the (hadrian's) wall", a place so terrible that even the hardest veterans fear to tread, yet it is the same place that a noble family chooses to live without a garrison, or army to protect them; just nobles with lots of marble, treasure and wealth, unprotected and unmolested for long enough to build a massive villa, and now needs to be rescued.Why would nobles live in places that hard veterans fear to tread? Why would the native Picts not destroy the nobles of a nation that they hate when they are clearly exposed? Why would invaders try to invade Roman soil by invading north of the hardest line of Roman defense on the island (the Wall) instead of just sailing south of it? Why would Rome, when encountering an army of these invaders decide that instead of using their massive wall of defense, that they would simply open the doors, and ride out to fight the enemies, and let the enemies inside the same wall of defense? And finally, why would you make a movie called "King Arthur" when you don't have important characters, such as Morgan le Fey, or Merlin? Or any of the mythology that surrounds it? King Arthur the man wasn't real, but the story was. If you don't want to stick to the story, don't bore me with trying to invent history, especially when the "history" is so poorly done.For crying out loud, I may as well have sat through Troy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bold twist on an old tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a teenager anymore but I don't (want to) think of myself as 'old' yet. I've simply accepted the fact most movies aren't made for me anymore. This should be one of them. Still. I'm not English and I love history, so I've never thought for one second that Arthur was a "real" person. If you've seen Excalibur, I mean come on! What are they talking about?! For me, setting this purely fictional story in Roman times gave it an unexpected credibility. I wouldn't have flinched if they threw a fire breathing dragon at me, but Christianity overtaking paganism, the "old civilized world" struggling against chaos... the withdrawal of Roman troops from England is a perfect setting for this story. So you won't see me digging the English hillside for the "real" Arthur's tomb, but I was fascinated by the entire movie. Like the Illyad (the battle of Troy), oral tradition embellished events of past greatness before they were put in writing, and if you made a historically accurate Troy movie, it would have little to do with the book. Like Agamemnon, King Arthur's story is the stuff of legends. This movie's not perfect, but it was convincing enough the make me think I had the wrong story all along, that it all started with a bunch of guys scouting the Hadrian wall and living with the commoners around them. In my humble opinion, the movie deserves more praise than it got.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The funnest take on a timeless legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been many versions of the classic tale of king Arthur and his knights of the round table. This one is my personal favorite thus far. Not so much for historical accuracy or anything like that. What I found to be so enjoyable about this film were its characters. From king Arthur himself to his knights. Particularly Bors and Tristan. Their relationships with each other and just the way they were portrayed was quite simply cool! So for those of you who enjoy action, drama, and cool characters with swords, this is one for you.The beginning of the film states that recent discoveries have shed new light on Arthurs true identity. I myself do not know what those discoveries are but true or not the story is presented in a believable although fantastic way. I know there are certain historical mistakes throughout the film but they only stand out to history majors. This movie is intended to be fun not historical. Its fun factor is exactly what I base my review on. 8 out of 10 for this fun action packed tale filled with cool characters and a believable story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low budget post-Christian revamping of the tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Arthurian legends have historically been much abused to attack different Church teachings. But they also served as instruction and reification of a chivalry that still seems the mark of a brave and honest man.But that's when told straight up. The Knights had to go through Catholic ritual, so the story goes, and receive the Sacrament, the Eucharist. Arthur was a boy given to Merlin, who had another raise him, obviously Catholic and in teaching tolerance and charity toward women, as well as the martial arts. He does marry Guinnevere, but under the image of a Catholic Saint in a Catholic ceremony of matrimony, not with just a few buddies in some nondescript ceremony at some tiny Stonehenge at the water's edge. Again, so the story goes. Even paganism isn't so impoverished (the budget for this film apparently was). Rome doesn't figure in, which was also refreshing about the Connery/Cross/Ormand version - probably still the closest in retaining a sliver of the Catholicity of the Arthurian Legends as they would have been taught centuries and centuries ago.The round table was massive and a gift that came with the Queen from her father the King. In First Knight, the guy was dead. In the story, not so. And the round table was so large it could seat 150 people. No film retelling seems to want to tell that, for some reason (budgets again, I suppose).So what you have, instead, is an enemy Merlin of an already grown Roman soldier, Arthur, the latter stationed to Britain as the 'Empire' is dead, so Gwen insists. Yet, the Roman Empire was not only far from dead, but was reborn just on the other side of the channel not so long afterward to meet the new Islamic expansion. Maybe if it's meant just of Britain, maybe the writers here have a point. But they also want to x-out Catholicism. And that's where they cross the line. The history of the region is still that of a famous Catholic, Bede. And those were Catholic monasteries the barbarians targeted along the coast. So. Anyway, Gwen isn't Catholic. She's some blue-skinned pre-Avatar woman-o-the-woods, not a princess of Leoness, or whatever you want to call it. Merlin looks more the savage than the real enemy in this film, the 'Saxons'.In fact, Arthur is sort of Catholic. But his men are proudly not. And the one most likely to act the barbarian is, of course, the Roman liege lord who is basically a sadist, calls himself Catholic, and is a 'favorite' of the Pope. Gwen is found locked in his torture dungeon as this Private Ryan detail of Arthur's run into Saxon territory to save this guy and his son. Eventually, the guy flakes out one too many times and they run him through. But his son is 'cool'.So the blue Stonehenge people, we're led to believe, and commanded by Merlin got together with less than ten pagan Arthurian knights from Rome and beat the Saxons prior to 500AD.It just doesn't make any sense. Stripping the Arthurian Legend of God, of Catholicism, strips out the very point OF the Arthurian Legend. Again, at least there was a nod in the right direction in First Knight. And admittedly, they had a strong cast (though I still think Gere was mostly lost, in that).Just another effort in this post-Christian world to rewrite the stories and the histories in pagan terms. And suddenly, the stories don't make sense and worse - they just seem a bore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the traditional Arthurian legend but a different and entertaining take nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this in the cinema on its release and recently watched it again on television(I have not seen the directors cut as yet).I guess I can understand those who are upset with the historical inaccuracies, but really who expects Hollywood to be historically accurate anyhow. Most writers and producers change history to suit their own ideas. I live in the UK and did not expect this to be totally accurate and indeed it was probably less accurate than I expected, nevertheless I still managed to put this aside and be entertained.I felt the atmosphere created felt real, the image of Arthur and his Knights was changed from previous screen adaptations but the sense of legend and images of bravery and camaraderie remained.I did find Clive Owen to be not the best choice the first time I saw it, however on second viewing I thought his performance a little better. Ioan Gruffudd performed very well as Lancelot and Ray Winstone provided some humour as Boors. Hugh Dancy &amp; Joel Edgerton were also good as Galahad &amp; Gawain. Stellen Skaarsgard was fitting as the evil Saxon leader, Tils Schweiger was decent but had very little to say as Skaarsgard's son. I found Keira Knightley almost bewitching as the strong &amp; beautiful Guinevere.All in all it was a very entertaining and original screen portrayal of the Arthurian Legend if historically inaccurate. The only problem I had was the utter stupidity of the Saxons in this film to be slaughtered in the main battle at the end. Their tactics were utterly ridiculous and frankly unbelievable. They seemed to have formulated no real plan, and assumed that their greater numbers would be sufficient.Still aside form this I would recommend it and give it 6.5 out of 10. I would say it is not as good as Spartacus, Gladiator, Braveheart or Troy etc.. but I would say if you enjoyed The Patriot or Kingdom of Heaven, this film is pretty much in the same class.Please do not alway's take movie critics views as gospel, it is only their opinion. You need to make up your own mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here we go again - another "reality" film. One of the main rules is that everyone must look dirty and grubby when in fact it is highly unlikely that that was the case and we know for certain that that was not the case for the well off. And of course what were the Romans famous for (apart from slaughtering people) but baths. Then you have to have a bizarre mix of accents - and at least one coarse cockney. Also, the idea that foreigners who have spent their lives killing for the Romans and against the indigenous Britons would suddenly become freedom fighters for the Britons is ridiculous. It's an idea that is pure Hollywood. There's a lot of Hollywood level clap trap about "freedom" but that's all it is. Such concepts meant nothing in the 5th century except as freedom from slavery by Saxons or Romans, nothing to do with individual freedom. The story does not have any "magic" about it. It's true that Arthur the heroic freedom fighter is one of the elements of the story that has captured our imaginations for centuries but so has the "magic" - and Excalibur - and Merlin and his magic. What magic? All we get here is a dirty, wet, dour, cold and violent story. That, in fact, may have been the truth of the story in real life but it's not the stuff of legends! How much more colourful, moving and imaginative is the Boorman version. Here, if you knew nothing about King Arthur you would think the film OK but you wouldn't particularly care. It could be called "Britons versus Saxons" with no loss. It's not the stuff that legends are made of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Seven Samurai, or uh Knights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2004 release of King Arthur provides the movie fan with a rare chance to view two versions of a movie. One that was packaged as a PG-13 summer blockbuster, and the other as the great unrated (really 'R') movie the director had envisioned. Director Antoine Fuqua provided a great angle to this interpretation of the King Arthur story. Instead of Camelot, it is based on current theories that state King Arthur was a roman who led the Britains after the Empire left the island.The biggest issue critics have with the movie is this uncomfortable retelling where Arthur is not yet a King, but an honorable British leader of Sarmatian knights whose world comes crashing down as the Romans are pulling out of England. In addition to that, the movie makes clear references to great classics. "The Seven Samurai", "Brave Heart", and "Alexander Nevsky" occupy positions on Sight and Sound's 100 best movies list. And that leaves no room for error. When Bruckheimer is the producer, well, this could mean disaster. That would be the PG-13 version.However, the director's cut is quite satisfying, if not quite ready for Best Picture. The battle sequences are engaging and believable with the "R" violence. Each of the knights are able to achieve good screen presence early on, which is good, because they get pushed aside by Guinevere when she shows up in the second act. The first great scene is the battle on the ice, which is an homage to "Alexander Nevsky". Here we are treated to 7 knights plus Guinevere trying to hold off an army of 200 Saxons crossing on thin ice. Eisenstein had to deal with Styrofoam ice, while Fuqua deals with goofy CGI. But even with the over-done Hollywood shots, it's still awesome. Themes of soldiers fighting in a land far from their home for an Empire resonate strongly with the American experience. Arthur discovers that his Roman Empire has become corrupted, and in a test of his mettle, he abandons his retirement to lead the Britons against the invading Saxons. Again, this theme speaks for our current world.The use of seven warriors defending natives from invaders seems very close to "The Seven Samurai". The emotional funeral for the death of one of the Knights seems to echo closely to the first funeral in Kurosawa's classic. But when Guinevere decides she and Arthur must express their attraction physically she says "What tomorrow brings, we cannot know." This scene is almost exact to the scene in Seven Samurai when Shino tries to seduce the innocent Katsushiro. Well, other than the humping.The end features a typical "Magnificent Seven" set up as the other Knights are going to leave the battle to Arthur, Guinevere, and various natives known as Woads. Of course they return, and have a spectacular battle.Clive Owens has received criticism for his portrayal of Arthur. While he is somewhat introverted, he delivers a great portrayal. Ioan Gruffudd is wonderful as Lancelot, Arthur's close but more emotional friend. Between them appears Keira Knightley as Guinevere. But instead of the affair and infidelity, Lancelot is true to his lead, and can recognize Arthur and Guinvere's belief in a higher purpose, and his own lack of faith. Fuqua discusses this choice in his commentary, and I feel it is a great one.Of special note is Knightley. This is the first movie I can remember where a woman in battle was very believable. This is partially because during shooting she didn't get out of the way of a stuntman and took a kick in the bust. And of course, that shot was used. Also of great amusement is when the 17 year old Knightley sits on a seemingly terrified Clive Owens for their PG13 sex scene (it stays the same in the director's cut, other than an interruption). Contrast this with the last scene at the wedding, when Knightley seems to try to suck out Owen's tonsils. This time, he is quite happy to let her do it.Fuqua's original ending is another funeral, again echoing the final shots of Seven Samurai. While this is sensitively done, it is understandable why another ending was shot. The end of the movie isn't sad, other than the Knights who gave their lives for English freedom. Arthur is King, Guinevere is Queen, and Boors, Gawain, and Galahad, are now leaders for Britain. Another star of the film is Hans Zimmer's score. It soars and provides bite to the fights, sadness to the mourning, and nobility to Arthur's triumph.To be able to see the two versions tells us so much about editing, narrative, and how to repackage a serious R film as a summer blockbuster.Finally, this film claims to be historically accurate. It's not. I could go on about details, but in the end it's Hollwood. Guinevere's eyes sparkle after battle, and Arthur looks like he just spent that battle with John Kerry's make up man. Even the dead Lancelot looks better than most of the living. But in the end, how could anyone be surprised (and by reading the other reviews, they were). The film says Bruckheimer. Yeh, I really expect a truly historical movie. Duhhhhhhh.</fullReview>

Rome didn't like to post conquered "ethnics" to the far-flung corners of other conquered ethnic lands: afraid the auxiliaries would sympathize, and go native and desert or rebel against the Eagles. And NEVER were they without a firm solid-Roman legionary hand over them, just in case.) A Sarmatian named LANCELOT??? And Galahad and Bors??? A Christian boy destined to be pope called ALECTO (name of a Harpy)? The Pope running things as a military commander and dictating Rome's foreign policy? Nuh-uh. By then Rome was ruled from Constantinople anyway.Pelagius? He died before the historical Arthur was born. They could never have been friends.The Roman pull-out from Britain happened 50 years before the movie says it did. And the Saxons didn't invade until many years into the reign of "Arthur", whoever he was. Hengist and Horsa, people!Bogus battle tactics. In those days, you were infantry OR cavalry, not both. And you don't hurl your axe in battle, 'cause you might never get it back and what will you do after you've flung it and people who hung on to theirs come after you? You're toast, baby.BADON HILL??? Came at the end of Arthur's reign, not the beginning.Mail? Though the Celts invented it centuries before and the Romans improved on it, mail was rare and expensive, and not until the Saxons did it get popular. Nobody back in that day wore dramatic long sweeping cloaks into battle: looks good on film, but they'd impede the sword swing and wrap around your legs.And that's just some of the FACTUAL stuff.The violence it does to the legend (The Sword in the Grave? Oh please! As if an expensive thing like that would have lasted stuck out there in the open more than ten minutes!) is even worse. And the Pagan/Christian thing? I won't even get into it, because my head will explode and there's no one around to clean it up.They couldn't even get the geography right! Giant stone fortresses? Never existed in 5th-century Britain.Stonehenge at TINTAGEL?? No. Just...no. Tintagel on sea. Stonehenge inland. Way inland.Wall in North. No Romans north of Wall, with big fancy villas or not.No Saxons coming from north of Wall. They came from the east and south, like the Vikings 300 years later.No glaciers or big giant frozen lakes in Britain, except during the Ice Age 10,000 years previously.David Franzoni, a scriptwriter I have liked, was asleep at the wheel for this one. He just didn't do his homework. Or maybe the dog ate it and he threw together this farrago so he could hand it in on time. Or maybe he got it right and Bruckheimer messed around with it. I don't know. But it is truly, truly awful.Oh, and the really bad Italian accents for the Roman characters? Hilarious. They all sounded as if they should be reciting the daily specials at my favorite pasta palace.And of COURSE all the leaving knights loyally ride back to the side of the lonely Arthur on the hill awaiting the oncoming Saxon hordes. And of COURSE they go eight against several hundred if not thousands, and of COURSE they are triumphant. How very Kurosawa.Killing off Lancelot was very smart, though. He's a 12th-century French import anyway.I guess we should count ourselves lucky that Rohan didn't ride to the rescue in the ruin and red day ere the sun rose...it was just a bunch of faintly blue, possibly radioactive people in tattoos and skimpy leather outfits coming out of the woods. And...leather bikinis in WINTER??? Once I got over expecting anything good or real, of course, I just sat back and enjoyed the cheesiness. Not to mention the scenery and costumes (kind of hard to do, actually; the lighting director must have been freakishly photophobic--I mean, yes, it's called the DARK Ages, but they weren't literally...), and had many good laughs at the whole thing.Especially the end. So, the souls of the knights dead in battle went into a bunch of very groovy-looking HORSES. I laughed so hard at that one I almost tipped over the laptop...especially at the lingering, almost porno slo-mo closeup on this gorgeous galloping black stallion, who you just KNOW was meant to be gorgeous Ioan Gruffudd/Lancelot...People have played around with Arthur's story for hundreds of years. Even I have tinkered with it... BUT you can't tinker and then still say your version is truthful and accurate and based on the most recent and up-to-date research.Which is what Bruckheimer and Franzoni and even Keira Knightley, poor deluded lass, claimed for this mishmosh. I'd like to see their justification for postulating one Lucius Artorius Castus (a quite historical Roman cavalry officer, but of the SECOND century as opposed to the fifth) as Arthur based on "newly discovered evidence." They want to have it both ways: to have all the Arthurian mojo and cred, and also to pimp it out and glam it up.More cheese than a roomful of cheddar. What a waste. The definitive Dark-Ages Arthur remains to be put on film. I suggest somebody (NOT you, Bruckheimer!) go buy the rights to Rosemary Sutcliffe's "Sword at Sunset"...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So little historical and so bloody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is digging up the myth used by Purcell for his own King Arthur semi-opera a few centuries ago. But he does not really improve the fable. He adds the Romans, the Roman Legion, Hadrian's Wall, and the "Roman" origin of Arthur and his knights. But it cannot reach the sublime music Purcell had wrapped the tale in. So the film can only concentrate on horror. The Roman horror of slavery and forced Christianization, under the menace of dying in some dungeon where you will be buried alive. The horror of the Saxons who do not colonize people but only conquer the land and empty it completely of their inhabitants. And even the horror of the native Britons who are pagan and fierce fighters. This reduces Merlin to some kind of spiritual if not only war leader. Arthur will decide to fight against the Saxons, hence to fight with the Britons and then to Christianize them by marrying the girl he had saved from the Roman dungeons. Of course this film has nothing to do with history and it has no real depth about the real conflict between liberty and the future, between freedom and peace, or should I say rather war? The film is then a long series of bloody battles shown in details, but that's a little bit short to make a good film that has otherwise no content.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

There's more character development, a much more impressive music score, great special effects and this film contains some of the best battle scenes ever captured on screen.The cast are superb and fit the characters perfectly. The climactic battle leaves you on the edge of your seat. We really feel for those who lose their lives. It is the perfect action movie combining action, drama, suspense and love. So don't just limit yourself to the original version, buy the director's cut.I hope you enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director's Cut Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 400 AD, the Roman Empire extends to Britain and the Romans become impressed with the fight skills of the warrior Sarmatian people, which are spared, but have to send their sons to serve Rome in the cavalry for fifteen years. Only after these services, these knights are free to return home. King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table have their last mission before achieving their freedom.I've always wanted to watch this film, not minding the long running time. Well, when I watched it, I really didn't care for anything that is going on. Why am I recommending it? Well, it's a boring, but entertaining at the same time, good film. I hope that made sense.This is the second epic historical movie I've seen. I still have yet to see the others like Troy, Kingdom of Heaven, Alexander, etc. I might find myself dread through these movie because I have no idea who these important people are or what they are doing. These movies just attract me for some reason.I liked the epic battle scenes in here. There are some blood and gore, here and there, even some dismantlement, which makes it a lot better! I liked the casts' acting, including Clive Owen and Ioan Gruffudd.For the most part of why this movie is so long are the really long battle scenes, which I didn't mind. I'm being really lenient on this film because I usually don't give boring films this high a rating. If you like action, some boring dialog, and anything else from an epic, here you go.</fullReview>

I found the movie enchanting, and I would and could watch it over and over again. The movie was a lot more historical, than most King Arthur movies. The word "Arth" means bear. Back then, many tribes had bears depicted on their banners, as a sign of strength. This could be where Arth came from, although there was a Roman soldier by that name who stayed in Britain. Merlin is also a real character, as is the leader of the Saxon tribe and his son. You forgot the five brothers... The hawk, that was a good one! I cannot tell you how many times, we watch movies and hear bird calls for American birds, and they are filming somewhere in Europe. You can thank Cornell University, for supplying most of the sounds for that! Woads----they should have called them Picts..same thing, but sounds better. Where do you think the word picture comes from? The people on drugs (woad) who painted their faces, like on Braveheart. The thing I disliked the most, was the nightgowns Guinevere always seemed to wear. I was cold just watching her. Snow on trees with leaves?????? You have never been to my part of the country apparently, where it happens all the time. I never picked up on any of those "goofs" u mention. LOL a sex scene?? Do you really think most people would be noticing, if Arthur had a cut on his neck? Wow, I was sure concentrating on something else!!! Riding back, or on the other side? Isn't that called reverse? Her dress being down -or up on one side? That was just too funny-happens to me all the time. The director did a fantastic job of it all. I commend him very much....and all of the actors were good!

		<shortDescription>Far-Fetched Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a visually beautiful film, and quite interesting as a fantasy. However, it has nothing to do with the accepted research and legends of Arthur, King of the Brits, and his court. It has less to do with history. The acting and direction are admirable, but the story itself is a travesty.This was a creation of the writer of GLADIATOR, and you can consider it a continuation in that vein. It is rife with historical errors in costume, weapons and events. For instance, there are trebuchets, which are medieval military equipment.According to this far-fetched story, Arthur lost knights of the realm before even founding Camelot. Galahad in legend has always been the son of Lancelot, and yet he is here portrayed as being his comrade at arms, and of the same age.This film also claims that the Knights of the Round Table were slaves from Sarmartia (later Ukraine) in the servitude of the Roman Empire. The Empire itself is portrayed as the Christian Holy Roman Empire, which would not come to be until 300 years later in 800 with Charlemagne.If you are looking for a depiction of the Dark Ages and King Arthur that is at all based in history, you will be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget the legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget the legend - this isn't your grandmother's King Arthur. Forget Disney, forget Richard Burton and Julie Andrews, forget Merlin and Mordred, forget the romance, the magic - this is the down and dirty, sweat and grime, guts and glory story that allegedly started the legend of the Sword in the Stone.Arthur (Clive Owen) is still the powerhouse of legend, even though Excalibur didn't come out of a stone or a lake, but pity poor Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), Galahad (Hugh Dancy), Gawain (Joel Edgerton) and the rest of the knights of the round table, who are reduced to Arthur devotees without too much in the way of individual character. Lancelot isn't even up to a little triangular hanky-panky this time around.Merlin is a wild warrior leader complete with body paint, and the fair Guinevere (Keira Knightley) out-warriors Xena when she's in her barely there battle gear.The battle scenes are great, whether the fighting involves the Woads or the Saxons, and the last time so many arrows flew, it was Jet Li doing some "heroic" dodging.The greatest beating is taken by religion, as only Arthur has any good use for it, and even he gets a little skeptical sometimes.Whether North or South of Hadrian's Wall, Arthur leads his little band on great adventures on the island, one day through thick forests, the next on thin ice, but with rousing war cries they somehow pull through.Entertaining, particularly when Keira Knightley starts her battle snarling, but a little long overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much potential ... so dismally wasted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd intended to see this film at the cinema when it first came out but didn't get round to it. I'm glad that I didn't waste the money. This film had so much potential, an Arthur film set in very late Roman Britain ('England' hadn't been invented yet) drawing on the whole process of myth making as a leader emerges to marshal the Britons to resist invaders as Roman power goes into free-fall.Whatever the magic a great leader has Clive Owen as Arthur simply didn't have it. There were a few moments when he did look iconic, but mostly his acting and manner just didn't match the high values he was spouting.His character seemed to be some kind of proto-Protestant about a thousand years before the reformation, and trying to express some kind of British fairness. The film had an old-fashioned feeling and I could imagine Kirk Douglas delivering some of the lines given to Clive Owen.And what planet was the casting director on when he thought Keira Knightley would make a half believable Guinevere. A twig in blue paint with a Roedean accent - what on earth was she supposed to be? And the inconsistencies ... the film makes a grand effort of showing how heavy the doors are in Hadrian's wall. Two heavy shire horses straining to open them. Later they open and close as if by the power of wishful thinking.The leader of the Saxons was the star of the film. He projected a wonderful ruthless single-mindedness. But did the Saxon's really start their invasion of Britain in Scotland?? And moving Baden hill? And ... well I could go on endlessly.The tragedy of this film is the wasted opportunity. It had the potential to be such a good reworking of the story and ended up being a total dog's dinner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much of what has already been said is very true bar this.The only reason that briton required a permanent garrison (the only territory in the roman empire to do so) is because its people were so unruley. Many, by this time, south of hadrians wall were calling themselves romans (or romano British etc) whowever this was in name only as neither the saxons nor the romans came in sufficiant numbers necessary to have a drastic impact on the gene pool.The point of which is that the film, while using more then its fair share of poetic licence in order to create a deeper storyline and in order to fit in with the myth, has more truth then the previous post is giving it credit for.Of course its important to remember, as with all king arthur films, this is based on a myth and mearly makes reference to certain actual events.

		<shortDescription>Good....but could be better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not prepared to see a good movie. My friend offered to lend me some movies out of the thousands she has. I borrowed many, and one of them was King Arthur. I am a huge fan of periodical, historical, or fantasy films so I was very excited to watch it, be it a good movie or not.The first thing I noticed was that this King Arthur was different. I found out by watching it that it's not Camelot, or the traditional King Arthur legend. On my first watching, I was absorbed in the story. I would probably have rated it a 5.Second time: closely watching. The script was passable, sometimes moving until I shivered and sometimes falling down flat. Clive Owen is plays King Arthur stonily. As someone said on a different review..."While some characters are fantastically flawed like Lancelot, this King Arthur is fantastically virtuous." Or something like that. Arthur in this movie is not a realistic person. He was very different from Lancelot.Ioan Gruffudd played a dark and deliciously mischievous Lancelot. I found much to enjoy in this new portrayal of Arthur's closest friend. Guinevere, played my Keira Knightley, was tolerable. She wasn't particularly bad, but her performance could have been much better.But the actor who delivered the best performance is Stellan Skarsgard as Cerdic, ruthless leader of the Saxons. Fantastically merciless, Skarsgard did a very good portrayal of an evil Saxon leader.Overall, this movie is overwrought with battlescenes, but the dialogue says a lot. It was put together nicely, but could have been better. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting and insightful look at the legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think 'King Arthur' is an interesting take on the legend of Arthur. The fact that they've tried to tell the story in its truth, whether it is actually the truth or not, shows that the writer had a lot of passion for the tales of Arthur. I got the impression that it wasn't intended as a box-office money grabber, but a film telling a story about heroism and the fight for freedom against tyranny.Where the film falls down is the fact that characterisation is compromised for battle scenes. Of course, the battles were necessary since they are part of the story. The scenery, the music and the atmosphere of the film were all amazing, so evocative and profound. However, I can't help but feel a little disappointed with Clive Owen's Arthur. He totally looked the part, but his acting wasn't quite believable, like he was bored and unable to assume any enthusiasm for the lines he was speaking. And,whilst all the Knights are lovable, with the exception of Lancelot and Tristan, they all seemed a little two-dimensional.Mads Mikkelsen as Tristan is, undoubtedly, the best character in the film. Ioan Gruffudd does capture our hearts as the lovable, yet roguish and dangerous Lancelot, but it is Tristan who steals the show.Yet, if you have a love of the Arthurian legends, I would definitely give this one a go. It is compelling and thought-provoking, just don't expect any profound or deep exploration into the hearts and minds of Arthur and his Knights. All that said, it is a movie that I would gladly watch again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was possibly the worst movie ever written. It was historically inaccurate, not cooperating with the Arthurian tale at all and, when viewed as a standalone film is boring. I had to watch this film for an English essay and could hardly finish it. This film is simply a brave heart/lord of the rings style movie with Arthurian character names attached to it. Arthur as the leader, Lancelot as his right hand man, Guinevere as his love interest and knights names for his followers. Even Authurs knights are completely different to their original characters, as in Le morte darthur and the Caxton's papers. in them, Bors is a devout Christian, worthy to see the holy grail, in the film he is a sinner with 11 children out of wedlock. Lancalot was one of the most devout Christians of all time. When he died "the gates of heaven were thrown open for him" he was not an atheist. Most damning of all, was the portrayal of Galahad as a sinner. He was the most pure soul of all time, the perfect knight, the best fighter and the envy of all other knights, he is the only knight pure enough to drink out of the holy Grail. His portrayal as a sinner was the biggest sign that the film had no intention of following the storyline of the Arthurian legend. In short this film is just a blank action film with a brave heart/lord of the rings style epic that is not emotionally fulfilling and should not be called king Arthur do to the insurmountable differences between the texts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too serious to be fun, too stupid to be taken seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, let's get this out of the way right now. Many other comments have focused on the butchering of Arthurian legend and the massacre of actual British history. However, since this movie was marketed as a new take on the story of King Arthur, I don't think it's fair to judge the movie based on the classical literary material that it openly disregards. On the other hand, since the filmmakers decided to bill this as a more historical version of King Arthur, then arguments about the actual *who's* and *when's* seem more like valid complaints to me. Nevertheless, even great historical movies sometimes butcher history a little for the sake of dramatic storytelling.Having said that, I am doing this review based solely on how I received it as entertainment. I have seen the theatrical version once, and the director's cut twice, and though the two versions have differences, my reaction to both remains basically the same.The truth is, I really WANTED to like this movie, even on just a purely visceral level, which is why I've watched it three times now, but its over-serious absurdity and astoundingly dull script prevent me from ever recommending it. I was intrigued by the idea, but made sure to lower my expectations, since many recent "epics" have been a bit on the disappointing side. Yet even then, I just couldn't side with it.While Kingdom of Heaven was a little weak on the action, I liked the political intrigue that surrounded the characters, and it kept me interested. And while Troy was dumbed down beyond reasoning, it had good battle scenes and one-on-one fights that kept it watchable as a simple action movie.With King Arthur, it's a different story. Aside from a rousing action scene near the beginning of the director's cut (the theatrical version is heavily edited for blood and gore), most of the action scenes and so-called plot twists are extraordinarily bad and often unintentionally hilarious.1. There's a scene where the knights are traveling in a forest and Woads fire arrows at them with barbed strings attached. Then they trigger walls of spikes to come up out of the forest floor to chase and trap them in a small area right where they want them. And then.... absolutely nothing happens. Wow.2. A rich, noble Roman family with only a few soldiers and plenty of rich valuables is living WHERE in relation to Hadrian's Wall? 3. Priests WILLINGLY bury themselves with pagans in a cave to absolve their sins. Arthur takes them out, then reburies them, as they scream in horror(?). Then Saxon Guy drags them out AGAIN, and reburies them AGAIN, as they scream in horror AGAIN (?). Or does he kill them? I can't remember. Either way, this is laughable.4. While the scene on the ice lake seemed a good idea, it would be more at home in a fantasy film. Speaking of which, where the hell are they anyway? Are we still in England? The ice covered Rocky Mountains of England?5. The final battle at Hadrian's Wall is almost completely incomprehensible. The camera angle changes so frequently that when soldiers run, I'm not sure if they're charging or retreating. I realize the Saxons are supposed to be confused in this scene, but why confuse the viewers too? Frustrating.6. In every fight scene in the entire movie, we have the infamous "shaky camera" that's so popular these days. I can only assume that it's there attempting to cover up how badly choreographed the action really is.7. Freedom! Rome! How many times can we say these two words in one movie? Clive Owen tries a bit too hard as Maximus Wallace, er, Arthur, delivering some of the cheesiest cinematic speeches of all time. Arthur screams "meaningfully" at people, hurling words like Freedom at them, as if that would mean anything to someone living in the Dark Ages. In Kingdom of Heaven, I could (reluctantly) accept Orlando Bloom's very 21th century character, despite its anachronism, because he represented the voice of the director and conveyed some sort of message to the audience (even if it WAS lazily handled). In King Arthur, there is no deeper intended message; it's all fluff to make audiences like Arthur, since Hollywood can't believe that audiences might actually embrace a character with values different from our own. In any case, it only gets worse when the audience realizes Arthur always talks like that, even when he should be calm and relaxed.8. There's nothing wrong with a movie that is long. But when the movie really starts to FEEL long... well... While the battle scenes look a little better in the director's cut, the filmmakers have also added what feels like hours of extra scenes where characters talk vaguely of concepts like Freedom and Love as they look around, trying to seem deep in thought. Blah.9. I didn't realize it at first, but King Arthur is sort of a pseudo-medieval rip off of The Seven Samurai. Seven well trained warriors, who could ignore the pleas of the downtrodden, instead sacrifice themselves to save a weak people who are plagued by raiding marauders. Hmmm, whaddaya know, it's even less original than I thought.All in all, my final analysis is stated in my summary for the film. It's just too serious to be any fun, and way too stupid to be taken seriously. 2 out of 10 (for some good production values)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shockingly Bad Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was supposed to be a more historical and less legendary version of the Arthur story but it has to be some of the least accurate history and geography ever put on film. Just some points about this: -the English (or Anglo-Saxons, Saxons, Jutes, Angles depending on the term you like) didn't invade Britan from the north crossing Hadrians's Wall. They came from the east over the sea into East Anglia, Kent and other places on the east and south coast of what is now England.-Why is there a noble Roman living in a villa north of the wall? -The Picts may have been the people who lived in what in now north-east Scotland. The tribe living just to the south of the wall was probably the Brigantes though how much difference such ancient tribal divisions made to a people who were basically Romano-British (having been part of a Roman province for about 400 years!). The tribes to the immediate north of the wall were the Votadani, Selgovae and Novantae.This is just a short sample of the problems of geography and history in the film.</fullReview>

Unhappily,this awful thing is even less historical, but an unfortunate example of fast action packed laughable nonsense for MTV audiences. And don't miss "de rigueur" perverse Christian churchmen. Really BORING!!!!In the end, an uninteresting plot leads to the ultimate tongue-in-cheek in Camelot: Artorius married Xena in a Celtic ceremony, some beautiful horses run and the lights fall down (with enyesque song for the credits. Arggghh?).I hope they are not planning a new film to illuminate us the unlearned about the "true" quest of the Grail!!! And the carnival go round ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and Pointless Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I anxiously awaited the release of this movie for years, only to run out and see that it turned out to be a real yawner. I collect historical movies and somebody gave this to me and I didn't even want it in the house so I sold it, which is a first. Also, the only thing that might have saved it would have been playing up Launcelot and Guinevere's legendary affair, which they completed omitted. An unbelievably bad move. So, even though the entire cast is top notch, and the story is a tantalizing winner, they still managed to make a BO-RING and pointless movie. Very disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting take, but some questionable ideas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm well aware that there is no one historical source on the legend of King Arthur, and so I kept this in mind when watching this movie. It's one person's unique perspective on a popular cultural icon. Thought of as such, I found King Arthur at least mildly interesting because of the different way it chose to portray the story. The movie plays down some of the more fantastical elements of King Arthur and tries for a more humanized view. It focused on characterization more than I expected, shedding light on the humanity of the "Knights of the Round Table". There are subtle characteristics of each of the Sarmatian knights that set them apart, which I enjoyed, although I wish there had been more of it. I tire of flat, plain characters who I can barely tell apart. It is even nice to see that not all of them have to be good-hearted, well-behaved individuals. Lancelot, for instance, has some more dubious qualities. King Arthur could have used a few flaws like that. His righteousness grew kind of irritating after a while. The action scenes weren't bad, but not terribly spectacular.My biggest problem is with the latter part of the movie, basically after Keira Knightley's character enters the picture. This Guinevere (not sure if I spelled that right) seemed so wrong-fitting that it actually made me angry. OK, so she's from that tribal people living in the woods. She's not prim and proper like ACTUAL women of the time. But neither should she be right up there in the thicket of battle with all the men. They were looking to make the characters of this movie seem more believable within the historical time period, right? Well, they failed with her character. Under no circumstances would it have been acceptable for Guinevere to act the way she did. And what I'm referring to is the fact that she fights in the battles. It is a horribly transparent attempt to make a "strong female character". Well, there are other ways of portraying a female character as strong while keeping her believable. I love that she can manage to fire a bow and arrow just as well as the men after just having her hand broken. Right. And she can fight in a dress. Or better yet, a skimpy leather outfit that has no tactical battle function whatsoever. Who's going to protect themselves from enemy swords and arrows by leaving tons of flesh exposed? Let's say, for a minute, that her Woads people find it acceptable for women to fight. Where are all the other women? And I love that she's able to withstand physical blows from battle-hardened soldiers, when really they should be knocking her sideways. I could go on, but I think the general idea is conveyed.An decent movie, maybe a little bland at times (and with too many dramatic *schwang* drawings of a sword from its sheath). Except for Guinevere's battle-ready character. I don't buy it. If you feel it's necessary to empower women in historically-based films, do it another way. I found it humiliating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My opinion of the characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I happened to catch this movie on Encore during our free movie month. I always came in somewhere in the middle, so finally, I went out and bought the DVD so I could see what happened in the beginning. I was somewhat disappointed in the movie, although the disclaimer that it was a new take on the legend of King Arthur mitigated that feeling.Although Arthur seemed caring of his "men" and looked after their welfare, I found that he appeared more of a whiner than a leader. This was the most disappointing character, but I think it was more caused by the writing than Clive Owen's acting.The characters of Galahad, Gawain, and Dagonet were underdeveloped and seemed to be filler roles.Tristan appeared arrogant and suicidal.Bors added some interest, but certainly couldn't carry the movie by himself.As noted in another comment on this board, at times, Lancelot appeared gay. But he also appeared to be unnecessarily cruel to his comrades and definitely disconnected.The character of Guinevere was just plain sad. She appeared to be playing Arthur against Lancelot, which made her final choice seem a matter of which man could offer her more in the way of power and position than which one she loved. However, her battle scenes were impressive.The most definitive character was Cerdic. His people-hating and suicidal tendencies were obviously displayed. This made it easy to identify his "bad guy" role.The most noble character appeared to be Cynric. He displayed concern for his "men" and a definite sense of fairness. He also showed intelligence, strength, and good strategy. If I had been Guinevere, I would have chosen Cynric over Arthur.All-in-all, the movie was disappointing but worth watching as a new take on the King Arthur legend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice battle sequences don't make up for a bad script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say about King Arthur? It's an attempt to conform a well loved myth to a historical account. I'm not quite sure how I feel about that. As someone who's grown up loving the stories of King Arthur and his knights, it's weird to have it "historicallized". AKA: the magic was taken away. It's a mediocre film -- so I'll give you the pros and cons right here:PROS: The battle sequences are indeed beautiful. There are some absolutely stunning shots of the Saxon army marching over the ice. I love the smoky affects used in the final battle as well. They are rather drawn out (it takes a LOT to bring the main characters down, they just keep going, and going and going, which eventually becomes something of an annoyance). Keira Knightley -- she does a good job, despite her small and rather weird role. Mads Mikkelson as Tristan, he's the only knight I really wanted to survive. The cinematography is interesting to say the least. There are pretty much 3 colors in the entire movie: green, blue and red.CONS: The script is crap. No buts about it, it sucks. So I guess that there is only so much that the actors could do with their characters. I've read reviews that say Clive Owen is uninspired as King Arthur. And I have to agree. But I'm not sure it's his fault, the character is horribly written. Instead of being a fiery, heroic knight, Arhtur's a wimpy little bible-thumping Catholic. Clive borders on brilliance a couple of times, but he never puts enough fire into the rather drab Arthur. I totally did not understand any of the relationships involving Lancelot. Did he and Guinevere have a little spark, or not? And if Lancelot "knows Arthur best" and is his truest friend, than why do they never get along?King Arthur is nothing spectacular. In fact, it's right forgettable. To Clive and Keira, why did you pick this movie?! You both have so much potential and both of you should learn to pick your scripts better. I cannot believe that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this. But it's okay. It won't blow your socks off, but it's fine -- mediocre. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and ridiculous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The IMDb's plot outline of King Arthur says "A demystified take on the tale of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table." However, this film is far from demystified. In fact, I think it is more mystified than the legend itself. Normally I have no problem with lack of realism or logic in movies, but this movie is simply ridiculous, and its attempts to be realistic just don't work out.At first I liked this film. I especially liked the concept of Rome in the time of its decline. But then the characters were introduced and I immediately began to dislike them. Especially because they're characters defined each by one trait of their personality and their fighting style. So we remember Lancelot as the womanizer with two swords. We remember Tristan as the quiet guy with the hawk. We remember Bors as the big, loud and rude man (a character we have also seen in countless movies). And the rest I can't even remember. The only character that was really fleshed out was Arthur, and I believe that was done only to distinguish the main protagonist from the rest of the characters. And what was most ridiculous about it is that each and every one of the knights fought differently. Each one of them had his own style. Now, I understand that they are auxiliary forces and not Roman legionaries, but the Roman army was based on order and formations, and it doesn't seem right to me that a force of knights fighting for Rome would fight in such a scattered manner. And when Guinevere was introduced, it grew even more ridiculous. I may not be a historian, but I hardly doubt the ancient Britons let their women fight.However, more than being ridiculous, this movie's greatest sin is being boring. Absolutely, dreadfully boring. And it's not supposed to be boring. It's a movie that should have battles, action, excitement! It had about three battles, none of them exciting or particularly engaging. And every scene separating those battles was boring. I actually found myself falling asleep during the last, climactic battle. I had to watch the movie a second time to actually finish it.Also, I should note, that while Clive Owen may be a good actor, he was horrible in this movie. The role of Arthur didn't fit him at all.All in all, this isn't a movie worth watching. It may have a couple or so good scenes, but the parts of it that are supposed to be interesting and most attracting, the battles, are few and boring to boot. Not recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's weird. but before i saw this film, i would think to myself, "this must be really bad if the reviews going around are true!" but like so many times before, i went in with an open mind and was rewarded. Oh, it won't be TOP 100 IMDb within the next ten years but, going in wanting just a action movie, it exceeded my-expectations and was actually extremely enjoyable. The action was good, the storyline was tighter than i expected (there actually was a storyline!) and most of the actors did extremely well. Clive Owen was obviously the weakest overall but was by no means s***, he was just overshadowed by everyone else. Kiera Knightly left me and my five mates watching it in the front room a little hot and bothered and because of that, her job was done. Good for a Sunday Evening Popcorn movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst King Arthur adaptation yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I can respect what others have said about the validity of taking away the magical properties of King Arthur, it totally butchers what authentic myth or history left.For one thing, King Arthur is thought to have been fighting at the earliest in 450, and by that time the Romans were out of Britain according to historians. The battle of Badon Hill (the final battle of the movie) is placed by historians at 500, well after all Romans had left Britain. And in all accounts, he had no ties to Rome. So the main plot device of the movie is completely false. And that is based on historical evidence.As far as a departure from the myth, Arthur was raised by Merlin, not in Rome. Arthur was also raised as a pagan, and converted, somewhat with the help of Gwenevere, who was Christian, and a noblewoman. The only pagan love interest in Arthur's life was his half-sister, Morgan Le Fay, completely missing from this account. Arthur and Gwenevere were married quite young, and Gwenevere had a real affair with Launcelot AFTER she was married to Arthur. Elaine (the lady of Shalott of paintings) is missing from the story as Launcelot's wife. Also, there were no people called "woads"... they were Picts, who used blue woad to dye themselves. That seems a silly change since it would be just as easy to call them Picts.Really, I see no use in making a movie "about" King Arthur if they only use the names of people, and include only one correct event in his life (the battle at Badon Hill). Instead of misinforming thousands of people about the history and myth, they could have just used a completely fictional set of characters. Its not really an adaptation of the myth or history, its a complete butchering of it. It is worse than a Disney adaptation (and thats pretty bad).</fullReview>

I mean Guineverre was sniper accurate with a bow and also deadly with the sword? Historically accurate or fantasy? OK if this is supposed to be a fantasy movie, it pales in comparison to other movies bases on Aurthurian Legend (such as Excalibur etc) or if it is supposed to be Historical and thus realistic - Then it totally missed the mark because as many comments earlier have pointed out it has no credible historical accuracy.Forget it there's to much rubbish to talk about with this film.

		<shortDescription>Not Just Historically Bad-Legendarily Bad Too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had such high hopes for this movie despite the fact that my friends all said it was terrible. I thought it was just because they didn't appreciate Arthurian tails, but I was wrong. The acting was not very good and they couldn't have picked a worse person to play Arthur. I think they did do a good job on picking a person for Lancelot, but that is pretty much where the good ends. It wasn't even the fact that it wasn't historically accurate that bothered me, it was how they ruined the great legends of King Arthur. I am sure that the majority of people who went to the movie hoped to see the noble and caring King Arthur of legend, who pulled the sword from the stone to become a beloved king. Still worse was how they killed off Lancelot in the end. Now tell me, how many people actually thought that was a good idea? This movies was a disgrace and made me sick. They may have thought that they were being so clever by trying a new more "realistic" take, but who wants that when they can have the old legends. I don't care if the old tales aren't accurate, at least they don't pretend to be, and at least they are something that people have enjoyed for ages. This movie was by far one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time, and I've been to Batman Begins not that long ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You see, the main problem with this film is Hollywood's stupid current obsession with "keepin' it real". There's no problem in this (for Batman Begins was one of my favourite films of '05, and truly a textbook example of "grounded in reality" film-making), but Bruckheimer's way out of his depth on this one. First, there's this completely ridiculous title card telling us this is "real" Arthur because "NEW ARCHEOLOGIC EVIDENCE TOTALLY SAID SO"! Oh, please. I have no more knowledge of history than was taught to me in highschool and believe me, this movie gets some pretty basic history stuff wrong. Which isn't bad per se, but why insist on being "THE REAL ARTHUR LOLZ" if you don't even know the Roman empire wasn't ruled by the friggin' pope. Oh, and christians are evil, by the way. They will oppress poor pagan farmers because they're pagan and build special torture-machines to, well, um... torture them. Also, priests/christians are all either crazy, cowards or "fools, bureaucratic fools." Shame on you if you don't know where that's from.It's not really director Fuqua's fault, as the film looks very pretty and it wasn't really bogged by the usual CUT-BLURRY ACTION-CUT AGAIN action sequences most Hollywood movies are plagued by nowadays (or am I becoming so accustomed to them I don't notice anymore?). The score is quite beautiful, and the song sung at the beginning even hauntingly so. The actors all look very good, and the knights were certainly a charming and lovable bunch. Keira Knightley, like Jessica Alba, is a pretty little girl who just keeps being cast in big, big movies because she's... well, a pretty little girl. If this film really wants to be taken so seriously, why not cast a serious actress? Stellan Skarsgard, O! how you ham it up so deliciously! It was a pleasure to watch his villain Cendric interact with Til Schweiger's Cynric, Cendric's son, and their various henchmen. What a delight to not get to know ANYTHING about their motivations or personalities! Seriously, every time they're in the picture, there's a battle scene or they're killing some peasants to show how eeeeevil they are. And get this, you never even get to know their NAMES. Way to go, Franzoni.Ack, Hollywood, how I loathe thee. I hope someone does The Once and Future King credit (some PJ'ish), so we can all forget about this ghastly little mess. Except for Stellan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To watch King Arthur, you have to forget everything you know about King Arthur, Lancelot, Guinevere and the knight of round table. Because Antoine Fuqua's movie tells a different story.Lancelot is a Sarmatian, because of a long term agreement with Romans, (yes it's true, Roman Empire in King Arthur story!) young Sarmatians with their legendary ability as cavalry, has to serve as knights. Something like military service but lasts 15 years. And if this isn't good enough for you, Arthur is Roman! Fuqua made a decent movie with Sarmatians, Romans, Saxons and Woads. Acting is satisfactory, my favorite was Ray Winstone as Bors, the powerful knight who has managed to produce 11 children between his fights.Since Mel Gibson's "Braveheart" it's not easy for a movie to make a surprise by using violent and bloody scenes. This one is no exception to the rule.If you like historic movies, watch this one without prejudice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Picked "King Arthur" up after liking Clive Owen in "Closer" opposite Julia Roberts. He reminds of a James Bond ala Timothy Dalton. He does well in the movie - which delivers well on action and a couple zinging one-liners. Enjoyed the cast - some good camaraderie; Owen manifests himself as a charismatic leader well. And the action is heaped up a-plenty with decent competence. Should not be surprised being a Bruckheimer production. Although this version of Arthur is not as good as "Excalibur" imo, as I enjoy the fantasy-approach, it does take a less mythic fastasy-like side, and deals more as historical-like throwing in the Romans and Saxons on the Isle of Britain. The Saxon thugs are quasi-barbaric - there's sort of the who are the baddest of the bad going on. There's some jabbing at the problems of the church and paganism which was good too. Knightly, who seems to be an actress in demand, does decently. I don't particularly think she's a great actress, but palpable I guess. Merlin unfortunately is more of an after-thought....anyway, pretty good. Rank it under Excalibur and Gladiator, but better than Troy and definitely Alexander.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even thought it had some issues, overall it was a pleasant way to spend two hours and should appeal to fans of Arthurian legend and history alike.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big fan of Arthurian legend, I was a bit skeptical upon hearing of a new King Arthur story based not on the myth, but on a supposed historical figure that inspired the legend. Add to that poorly produced trailers and fairly consistently bad reviews and I just never managed to make it into theaters to see this. However, with the release of the King Arthur DVD I decided to give it a try.The movie proved to be an interesting deviation from the 'standard' depiction of Arthur and his knights. The film is marked as the story of the man the King Arthur myth is supposedly based on; Lucius Artorius Castorus (Clive Owen) a Roman commander. Arthur's knights are actually Sarmatian who must serve Rome for fifteen years before they can return to their homes. Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd) is ruggedly handsome, as usual, but is not fated to fall in love with Guinevere (Keira Knightley), who is refreshingly not shown as a weak woman in need of rescuing, but rather as a warrior and a force to be reckoned with.There is no Camelot, only Britania, which is about to be invaded by the Saxons. Rome is crumbling (and historically, as there is a Pope, Rome has already fallen and is in the process of rising based on religious power instead of military) and Arthur and his men must save the Pope's godson from the invading Saxons before they can have their own freedom granted. Arthur is an idealist man who believes in freedom and equality for all. The film does an excellent job of portraying the characters as real while still showing the aspects of their lives the myth was based on. Amusingly, Merlin is not a mage (in fact, there is no magical properties in the movie at all) but rather is the leader of the Woad resistance to the Romans.That is not to say there were not a few issues with the film (as with most epics, everyone seems to speak flawless English). Arthur stresses the freedom of all men "You ? all of you ? were free from your first breath!" but happily glosses over the fact that the entire point of the film is to rescue a Roman son so his own knights can be granted their freedom (having been pressed into servitude generations past by Marcus Aurelius). Some of the dialogue and the script had their issues, but not to the point of being laughable or unbearable.A complaint levied against King Arthur while in theaters was the lack of blood (to the point of being distractingly noticeable), but as I watched the 2004 unrated directors cut I did not find this to be a problem. I cannot imagine not having the blood or length of the DVD version (giving some insight into why it faired so poorly at the box office). It added greatly to the dark feel of the movie, but was still tastefully done in such a way that it enhanced the plot rather than distracted from it. I would recommend only purchasing this version, and in fact question why they bothered to produce the theatrical release at all. These issues are off set by a truly gifted group of actors. Everyone excelled in their roles. Characters such as Sir Bors (Ray Winstone) added a lot of color and humor to the film, which provide a nice balance to the war torn backdrop of the film.Even with its issues, King Arthur was a pleasant way to spend two hours and should appeal to fans of Arthurian legend and history alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>potentially a good epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was never destined for great things and would never have made it to the level of "Gladiator" or "Braveheart", but it really could have been much better than it was.In many ways it was better than some of the recent epics such as "Troy". Its cinematography was pretty good especially during battle scenes which in themselves are fairly action-packed and entertaining. Visually it is brilliant, the landscapes are breathtaking (though no match for "Lord of the Rings")and the sets darkly creative. The doughnut shape of the round table is particularly original.This film seems far from historically correct however the story is more or less solid if a bit far-fetched and, despite one or two minor plot holes, can be fairly easily followed. There are a few places where you will be left wondering what exactly is going on but you are quickly picked up again however there are a few parts that even I still don't understand.Soundtrack, well what can we say, good old Hans Zimmer has done it again. Whether you like the film or not the soundtrack is worth getting if your a Zimmer fan, it would definitely go in his top 10. The films soundtrack is very historical and in places bares resemblance to that of "Gladiator".That all in all creates a fairly good film worth probably about 7 out of 10 not brilliant but not too bad either. Now for the lead balloon that sunk it. SCRIPT. It can be hard to notice when a film has a good script, especially through all the special effects, action scenes and loud music of a modern day epic, however as "King Arthur" shows it definitely becomes clear when you have a bad one. The script to this film was just plain corny. It was so bad in places that it made the film unbelievable. It tries in vain to take on Shakespeare's approach old English but to put it in Modern English for an audience who doesn't want to listen to hard. The scripts downfall may have been partially down Clive Owens rather wooden acting as his scenes were often the worst, but some pretty bad lines also emerged when he wasn't even on screen. Young Lancelot's last line in the first scene is a classic example.This unfortunately is what crippled "King Arthur" as for as I am concerned. The film has its moments, Stellan Skarsg?rd's chilling portrayal of the Saxon leader for example, and many audiences will see in it the potential for a good film, if only the dialogue was better.</fullReview>

Not only do they put the roots of Arthur further back than the rest but they make him the unwilling hero of the story. Lancelot is not portrayed as a Arthur's betrayer as is also par for the course. In final the Guinevere character is stronger than in any other portrayal. You need to see this movie for its thought provoking story. Unfortunately it did not do well in its release but the acting is wonderful and the action scenes are not only visually amazing but there are no cgi sequences these are all live actors.

		<fullReview>One of the worst adaptations of the King Arthur theme ever produced. This movie belongs only on the Sundance channel with all the other weird and dumb flicks. First the movie pushes the period back about 600-800 years from the long established time-line. It's like putting the Wild West in the 10th century. The Guenivere character is more like Lara Croft- Tomb Raider taking on several vicious enemies in a row with no problem. King Arthur, Lancelot, Galahad and the rest of the cast look like the dirtiest, smelliest people of all time(spare me the explanation that it's the norm for the period). Much like the great unwashed you would see in today's burger commercials. Maybe the same director. No... I don't buy that its great movie making by a new breed of filmmakers. It's more about what Hollywood has become and what there on. All in all, quite boring and disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been fascinated by the Arthurian legend since I read Mark Twain's "A Connecticut Yankee.....". Has anybody read the Pendragon trilogy by Stephen Lawhead. It consists of three books... "Taliesen", "Merlin", and "Arthur". The books trace Arthur's lineage from the lost tribes of Atlantis. A very interesting concept.Anyways...about the film...It was great but not all that great. I liked Mads' role much better than Clive Owen's. Tristan has an understated meanness about him that I dig. Also, Gawayne was a great character. I found Guinevere a pain in the arse, though. Frankly speaking, after watching Pirates of the Caribbean five times (for Johnny Depp's antics), I've had enough of Keira's pouty lips.Can anyone tell me what this word is that's used by Bors and some of the others? They use it when they're drinking, or in battle, and even when Lancelot's family is saying goodbye to him in the beginning. It sounds like "Roooooooz" or "Rooooooj".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally loved this movie. I thought all the actors were fantastic (Keira Knightley, Ioan Gruffud and Ray Winstone especially) And also the director's cut has more blood and gore than the original!! It is much better than Troy as there was an amazing script and plot. the acting was full of emotion apart from....Clive Owen. I personally think that he was miscast as Arthur and they would have done better with someone else e.g. i though Eric Bana was good in Troy.Apart from this, the movie is absolutely excellent and I strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys large-scale epics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique and clever contribution to this genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this film a lot. I originally saw it at the cinema, but only really appreciated it when I saw it on DVD. Which is strange, it is usually the other way round with films as far as I am concerned. To start with, it is a novel approach to the King Arthur genre. Setting the film, probably around 900 to 1000 years earlier, for a start, during the era when Rome was supposed to be in decline and shrinking back from its empires. I believe that there are a number of historic inaccuracies, including the fact that I believe Baden Hill, where the battle is set is much further south and Hadrian's wall is in the North. The large scale 'invasion' of Saxons didn't happen in the manner reflected, it was a more gradual process. Also, like with 'Braveheart', the concept of 'freedom' is much more recent one. People of this eras in history prior to the feudal system were used to living in subjection to a ruling power. However to be fair, the concept of freedom came from Greek philosophy which predates the era in this film.The decision to reflect the knights as what one critic put 'Russian mercenaries', was a novel choice and gave the film a further uniqueness in this genre. Arthur as Roman officer (half Roman/half Briton) is also interesting.That said, the weapons, armour and battle tactics are authentic for Woads, Romans and Saxons. This aspect of the film is to be credited. The location is also good. Using Ireland as a location was a clever idea and reflects a mainland England that was once more rural than now. The training that the actors and extras were put through is admirable. The extra special features on the DVD gives you an appreciation of what lengths were reached to make the resultant film. The choice of cast is also a good one. None of them are what most people think of as major stars in the Hollywood sense. A wise idea, not just from a budget aspect, but also because it would have been a distraction. The use of colours, weather and landscape set the mood for certain scenes. The action scenes were particularly good and very realistic. There was no sense of making sanitising the film in that sense. It reflects a stark reality, also in the way the actors behave, their clothes and general appearance.One aspect was the reflection of the Christian faith. And as a Christian myself, I found this interesting. Those who are supposedly Christian are shown is an unsympathetic characters, some are shown as persecutors. This is an interesting thing as throughout history, the Christian church has become institutionalised and run by power hungry people who twisted the truth for their own ends and instituted Biblical heresies. In this respect, Arthur as a Christian is the only one shown in a favourable light. It is interesting that the Director and Producer should choose to make this distinction. In fact, Arthur is shown as a Christian with a practical faith prepared to fight injustice and make sacrifices. For this, the film makers deserve to been given credit.The musical score is very appropriate and compliments the film very well. I noticed the music more than in other films, because it stood out and was distinctive.The actual plot is a clever one, weaving the storyline between Arthur and His Knights, the Romans, Woads and the invading Saxons. This keeps the suspense and film builds a pace up to a finale that is a little predictable.The Saxons are brooding menace as the main enemies, Stellan Skarsg?rd and Til Schweiger play their parts up very well and looked very authentic. Ioan Gruffudd looks arrogant, ruthless and cynical. He makes a novel Lancelot. Whilst Clive Owen, an unusual choice for Arthur fills the part well. He sometimes appears a little wooden, but overall, plays the part better than some of the Hollywood set would. Physically, he looks the part well. He plays up the virtuous and noble in contrast to villains of the piece. Keira Knightley is also a good choice. She brings an interesting twist to the portrayal Guinevere. One that I wouldn't have expected. She compliments the film well. Her Guinevere works well with Ioan Gruffudd's Lancelot, though I think that given time, this subplot could have been developed further.Each of the knights are portrayed as having a different fighting style and this adds an additional note to the film. Ray Winstone plays up very much the cockney as almost a 'bar room brawler'. Ray Stevenson's Dagonet, was apart from Arthur, the most sympathetic character in the film. More could have been made of his character.Overall, it is a novel entry to the Arthur legend genre and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think that it almost makes an epic piece. Certainly it is better than some of its contemporaries. Worth watching. Just keep an open mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have been a hit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great film. Beautifully filmed in Ireland. The plot was very well developed and gripping. The movie held me enthralled. Kiera or is is Keira Knightley was mesmerizing. This girl is star material. Classy, elegant but nevertheless is very believable in the battle scenes. The breaking ice scene was superbly done. Casting let this film down. Clive Owen was appalling as King Arthur. I got so annoyed with his dopey eyes, and there is something extremely strange about his speech which I can't put a finger on. His big freedom speech aka Braveheart was completely unbelievable delivered to 5 men. Lancelot was almost as bad. The overacting and the coy apparently dark side of the character as he shyly peeked at Guinevere was embarrassing for me to watch. These were the main characters so casting should have got this right. Other than that the other characters were great. I loved merlin, the evil Saxon king and his insecure son, the rest of the other knights were great. Galahad Gawaine Bors and the gut with the falcon. I loved how they each had their own style of fighting. 10 out of 10 for Kiera though. I'm going to join her fan club. George Lucas stuffed up making her the Queen Armidala decoy. She would have been far superior than Natalie Portman as the real queen. Knightley has a regal air about her, helped by her accent which would have really added to Star wars. I hope they make a sequel of this film. It would be great to see Kiera all done up in royal garb. I'd like to see how Arthur builds up Camelot and fills up the round table with new knights. We would have to have a transplanted Arthur though. Clive Owen spoiled this film, which would have been a sensational hit if a Pitt or a Crowe or someone of that caliber had played the main part. I can't understand the logic of putting all that money and effort towards a fantastic screenplay, costuming, music, choreography, and then skimping on the lead actor.Final comment. The costuming was sensational on this film very authentic. The music was great although they played King Arthurs theme too often. The battle sequences were terrific although unnecessarily graphic. I didn't enjoy the rolling heads and blood spurting scenes. Still I saw the directors cut on DVD so perhaps the movie version was toned down a bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a unique take on history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, Hollywood movies have often sacrificed historical accuracy for entertainment (Braveheart, Gladiator etc.) But none have claimed that they were accurate history such as this film claimed at the beginning. It starts with the Roman occupation in Britain fifty years after the Romans were supposed to have left Britain. Then the Saxons invade from the north (presumably Scotland)? Followed by a trek into the arctic wasteland that is the Scottish lowlands (see the film, it's like Everest there... apparently). Clive Owen (who is usually so good) gives a sub par performance and the rest of the cast follows suit. There's more historical problems, but it is worth seeing just to see how life was like as Rome was crumbling in the west (the transition to feudalism) but based on any sort of history, no.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good mucky battle scenes , bad-a$$ Saxons and a good tall tale!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed king Arthur. OK. some of the dialog was wooden and the ending was trite 'hollywoodish' nonsense. As a history lesson it was way wrong in a number of respects (see less-than-satisfied history-buff reviews!). However, this movie was not about history, but about telling a tale (geddit history buffs!?) and depicts a not-too-often-covered 'Beowulf'-like period in movies -the beginning of the dark ages at the end of the Roman empire. The movie is reminiscent of the '13th Warrior' that had a similar dark, forbidding and desolate atmosphere. I enjoyed the somber, gritty and downright wintry setting backing off from some colorful situations and intense, spectacularly choreographed battle scenes. Arthur was portrayed as the Hellenistic hero- he certainly had the worst lines (!), {but then again so did Keaton's Batman against Nicholson's Joker}. Owen was simply the pivot around which the other characters worked. And they did work well! Not least the menacing Saxon king and his sniveling son (well played Till!) which was quite humorous at times. For the 'goodguys', Knightly and Winstone did well in their respective roles as love interest and 'bastard-siring' carouser.A good rental overall giving a good impression of what life might have been like at that time. The movie does not take itself too seriously (unlike say Troy which was over-glorified, stodgy and had blah dialog). This is a movie I'd watch again, not least to see Kiera Knightly with blue skin!I also look forward to seeing Stellan Skarsg?rd (nasty Saxon king) in the forthcoming Bewulf epic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget about Dungeons &amp; Dragons, wizards in long, flowing white robes, unicorns and magic...that stuff does NOT exist in this film, but is often attributed to the Arthurian legend. Even Arthur's sword, Excaliber, plays a minor role! Nope, this one fires from the hip in a gritty, realistic look at what Arthur's life may have been in reality. I enjoyed each of the knights' performances...nicely done. Clive Owen, as Arthur...believable, but oftentimes dry, and not totally emotionally tied to his character. There was a bit of charisma lacking there.Cinematography is incredible, and fits the movie well. Look at Keira Knightley's performance as the token role...she doesn't really do much, but also isn't just the "damsel in distress", either.Overall, 8 out of 10 stars, and definitely worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great, but a refreshing change of pace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm in love with history. So when I started seeing trailers for this version of the Arthur legend, purporting to be the "true story" of the roots of the Arthur myth, I got a wee bit excited. However, I avoided the theatrical version because I heard too many bad things about it.Then, I watched the director's cut on Pay Per View.Well, "true story" it's not. Most of its historical "facts" are dead wrong. About the only thing it gets right is that one of the inspirations for the Arthur legend may have been a Romanized British chieftan in the 5th Century. This movie takes that idea and runs with it... and does so pretty effectively.No, it is not any sort of "true" story. But it is a refreshing change of pace from the over-done and worn-out trope of chivalric knights jousting for fair ladies and taking up noble spiritual quests for their own sake. This film is a de-mystification and a humanization of what had become a tired legend. No magic, no ladies in lakes, no scheming witches; only early medieval humans struggling against ruthless invaders even as the one force that can protect them is packing up to go.The dialogue leaves a lot to be desired and it's about as historically accurate as Pirates of the Caribbean, but nonetheless, I found that at a visceral level, I liked "King Arthur" better than any other Arthurian movie I've seen. And that surprised me.Even though none of it is "true," this movie had more of the feel of history than any previous treatment of the tale. If nothing else, it gave audiences the right idea of where and when to look for Arthur's origins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw the theatrical release, and due to my OCD about historical accuracy and details I made myself crazy finding logic-gaps and felt let down.The second time was the Director's Cut, which added back in some crucial back-story for Arthur, and incorporates some more of the proto-legend in the alternate ending, which I feel would have been better incorporated just prior to the final wedding/arrows scene vs as an alternate...Once I could let go of the fact that Pelagius, Germanicus, and the Saxon invasions did NOT all take place concurrent with the Roman withdrawal from Britain, I realized that the movie really works quite well.Perhaps for those not book- and history/legend-obsessed more verbalizing of the Arthur legend into the story line in voice-over would have helped tie it into something they felt invested in, but I really think most people have very nearly incorporated the key aspects of the story into their common consciousness.I am stunned by the other writer's view that the acting was wooden, Director's cut fight scenes boring, and viewing it as hokey...Not really sure what that viewer was expecting, but it was wonderfully acted by quality cast with none of the interfering 'star power' issues with getting into a movie's characters. Much of the acting seamlessly displayed the different characters' personalities and motivations.The fight scenes in the DC are very graphic, in many ways more so than other 'epics' as the brutality of the injuries and the methodologies of war and survival depicted are authentic for the period and ethnic groups involved.Yes, I agree there are a few 'light' moments in comments or verbal word play that is 'modern' in tone rather than the type of jest common then, but had they spoken in the archaic verbiage of the time-frame, even if it was semi-translated to 'English', it would likely have turned off most viewers.And, had this been dark from beginning to end it would have felt too long and painful to watch.Me? I would have loved an extra hour or two of character development (especially the fellow 'knights'), more on the Picts and their social and political structure, a better idea why the Pope was obsessed with retrieving Electo, etc... But most viewers would be climbing the wall with that long a film!In short, if you are familiar with the Arthur legend, this is a fresh and surprising take with more than a little of the 'possible' vs fable, making you think anew about history and what we believe about ours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How did you become king I didn't vote for you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Arthur: 7/10: If this movie was called Bob the Roman guy it would have been a lot better. Arthurian legend is often awkwardly forced into what is a decent dark ages romp. As a result you have Osama bin Merlin head of what I'm guessing is the Picts. (They are called the Woats but of course there is no such thing. They wear blue battle paint, which is historically accurate if you are doing a film about the Scottish. The Scottish watching a football match in the 1970's mind you.) Guinevere is now a leather bikini-wearing archer. And Arthur is a Roman commander fighting the Blue Meanies of the north. The Saxon's show up and try to kill everybody. So now in that timeworn movie cliché the two former enemies (Arthur and Merlin) have to combine forces. A lot of clichés are evident in King Arthur. The worst is the ahistorical screeching about freedom in what seems to be every fourth sentence of the screenplay. It's irritatingly repetitive, ridiculous (Arthur doesn't become President Arthur after all or as Monty Python put it "How did you become king anyway I didn't vote for you") and it leads to one of the unintentionally funniest scenes ever in a major motion picture release. (As King Arthur gives an almost word for word homage to Mel Gibson's stirring Braveheart battle speech the camera pans back and instead of revealing an army of thousands it has five lone guys. They might as well have been holding coconuts.) Yet despite all this and an ending that reminds one of Kevin Costner's Robin Hood I actually enjoyed myself. The battle scenes were well done, the acting okay and the story moved along nicely. Like Troy the flaws of the movie add a humorous dimension to the proceedings. Plus it has an incredible ice battle unmatched outside of Russian cinema. And don't forget we fight for FREEDOM from the unrepresentative Republic of which I am a commanding officer so we can create an absolute monarchy with a round table.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dismantling a Legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When King Arthur was first released, I steered clear of it thinking it would be nothing more than trumped up retelling of a story that had been told so many times before and simply didn't needed to be told again. After all, how could anything compare to the splendor of Excalibur in bringing to life the Authurian legends. And seeing Keira Knightly holding a bow and arrow in the trailers and the attachment of Jerry Bruckheimer's name as producer told me that this was going to be nothing more than a silly attempt to make King Aruthur hip and modern. But hearing the reviews I began to realize that my pre-conceptions about this film were all wrong. This film was said to be a more historical accurate telling of story behind the legends. I then thought perhaps this might be a fresh approach and possible a worthwhile venture after all. Yet I remained rather skeptical and waited for the video release.Well, after finally viewing the video, I have to say my initial inclinations to stay away from this film were correct. While this film may be more historically accurate than other tellings of King Aruthur , it does less to reveal the reality of legends as it does it does to dismantle them. Arthur and the Knights of the round table, who's number have been dwindled after years of battle, are reduced to just seven men. They are sullen, morose,and devoid of any charm or charisma. It is even hard to distinguish who is who except the fact they constantly utter each other's names as though the script writers themselves came to realize that how utterly non-descript these men were that they had to give the audience some help. Even Lancelot,in legend Arthur's right hand man and supposedly the greatest of all the knights, is merely just one of the rabble in this bleak band of knights. Keira Knightly as Gwenevire, is reduced to nothing more than eye candy. Her inclusion in the final battle scene dressed in ridiculously skimpy garb was a pathetic attempt at some political correctness that only succeeds in undermining the film's only supposed strength, its realism. But the greatest disappointment of all is the "Head Hauncho" himself. Clive Owen's portrayal of King Arthur is so wooden and uncharismatic, it makes you wonder why anyone would even follow this man to a party let alone write legends about him.Certainly the actors can't take all the blame, as the script and directing is really the true problem here. I am no historical scholar, but even I can tell that while this film boasts about historical accuracy, much of the film is still trumped up Hollywood history in the attempt to be entertaining as well as enlightening. Yet it doesn't work on either level. The pace of the movie is so slow, I found myself having to fast forward through much of it. The battle scenes, which could have been the film's saving grace, are few and far between and lack any kind of excitement. And with the film's PG-13 rating, there isn't even the satisfaction of seeing graphic, bloody clashes. There is one slightly memorable battle sequence that takes place over a frozen lake, but it's hardly enough to redeem the entire film. The dialouge is nothing more than a sereies of speeches and diatribes about "freedom" which can almost be accused of plagorsim from "Braveheart" only with less emotional resonance. Even the speech that Arthur gives to his knights before charging into the final battle fails to hit any kind of inspirational note. It was a wonder the knights didn't simply turn around and go home instead of charging into battle and risking their lives.The fact is, King Arthur, despite all the promise of fresh retelling of the legend , proved only to be a tremendous waste of time. For me, its supposed historical approach only worked to kill the legends of King Arthur. I think when I take this back to video store I'll check out "Excallibur" again to get the bad taste out of my mouth.</fullReview>

Whether historically accurate or not, it was a fun ride AND it made sense. Arthur as a Roman commander, Merlin a Wode (Celtic if you prefer) leader, and , c'Mon, Stellan Skarsgard was GREAT as the Saxon leader. OH, and none! of that sappy "Guineverre/Lancelot/Arthur" menage-a-trois. It had a lot of action, characters you could empathize with and a damn good story and just because Merlin couldn't cast fireballs and Arthur wasn't suffering for his incestuous ways it gets a bad rap.

		<fullReview>It took me a long time to see this movie, despite my love of Arthurian legends because everyone panned it. I finally rented it and really, really enjoyed it. Okay, it's not perfect, Keira K for all her beauty really is dreadful at acting and some of the Dialogue (especially that speech before the final battle, yuck) is horrible. There are some slow bits too, but the 3 set piece battle scenes are fantastic. They are full of dirt, gore and savage fighting, which lets face it is pretty close to how it would have been in the dark ages. A history buff friend of mine complained that "they didn't have stirrups in those days" but I don't care (and how many actors out there are going to pull that one off?) because that really doesn't make it a bad film. I thought most of the acting was really good, Ioan Gruffudd was a convincing Lancelot and Clive Owen a solid Arthur. Ray Winstone is always a pleasure to watch and guaranteed to raise a smile. Strong acting in minor parts such as Sean Gilder who plays the loyal Jols and Ken Stott as the wonderfully horrible Marcus Honorius. Definitely worth a viewing just for those battle scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just finished watching "King Arthur" one day on DVD and "Troy" the next; I would vote for "King Arthur". The movie does try to give a historical basis for who Arthur was. And the movie follows closer to the older legends then Troy does. Two thumbs up for this movie. While Brad Pitt once again did an excellent job in a less then great movie (as in "Meet Joe Black") I recommend you watch "King Arthur".The fight scenes are worth re-watching. Arthur also used his "training" by the Romans to win his battles. For those of you who doubt the impact of heavy calvary on foot soldiers a little research will show that the heavy horse calvary (knights) were worth their weight in gold up to the time of the introduction of crossbows on a mass basis, longbows, and gunpowder. While as in must movies there is less then historical accuracy. Crossbows have been traced back to 6th century BCE in China. The Romans knew of the crossbow but it's use was not widespread. I doubt that the Anglos or the Saxons would have had a large number of crossbows in their camps. At the Battle of Aaincourt (1415) only a few bowmen were using crossbows but close to 5,000 longbow-men were in the army.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't get why people bash this movie so much. I honestly cant see many things that are wrong with it. The acting by Mads Mikkelsen (Tristan) was excellent, And of course Keira Knightley's beauty alone is enough to see the movie. I didn't find it to be too boring or long. And i thought that the action scenes were spaced apart pretty good. I mean can you compare it to Gladiator, or Braveheart? no. I can understand how certain people are complaining about the film not being true to the time its supposed to take place in, how Sarmatians never fought for the roman empire, and other aspects of the movie. But people like that have to realize that this is a movie, it's purpose is to entertain, not to educate.However, this is just my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was great! I loved the film, what amazed me, was the quality of acting which I'm surprised not many people have mentioned! Keira knightley, I thought had always been a good actress but looking back on her other films, she has greatly improved since bend it like beckham for instance (though I thought she acted well in this to) she definitely gave a sense of reality to the character Guinevere,I felt i could feel every emotion she had and I loved her transformation from girl locked in a cell, to beautiful queen Guinevere. Arthur stayed the same pretty much all the way through the movie, although he obviously realised the meaning of freedom, I didn't like the amount of depth into lancelots character,I would have liked to have seen more how he feels, and what about the famous love triangle? Oh well, overall Great film, but I have no comment about the accuracy of the historical elements, as I've never heard the tale myself. Watch it! and hope to see keira knightley again soon... but not in pride and prejudice!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be one of the best. Although it did not even come close to the real Arthurian Legends, there were background information and items that supported the movie. Such as the Round Table and Excalibur.The characters were very complex. Although it mainly focused on Arthur, I was able to learn about every character little by little throughout the movie. The way they moved and fought depicted some parts of their personality, and also their dialogue and actions. I do believe that this movie might not please every person, but it definitely pleased me. If you are the type to look for action and satisfaction =P, then this movie might come close to your likings.Clive Owen (King Arthur) and Ioan Gruffudd (Sir Lancelot-my absolute favorite actor) were such great actors in this movie. The power of their dialogue and actions were so real, I thought I was in the movie myself!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome knight movie. Negative reviews are wrong!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the director's cut of KING ARTHUR, so I can't compare it to the PG-13 version. I purposely held off seeing it until the director's cut came out because I didn't want to see a choppy movie with missing scenes.I am so glad I held off. I can't believe how much hate is directed towards this film. THe dialog is not "painful" or "sickening." It's actually very good. Not profound, but the characters get their points across, and what they say is meaningful.One of the things I liked about the movie is how much social relevance it holds today. Arthur and the knights serve religious fanatics who want to rule everything, and they think God is on their side. Sounds very familiar to certain people. It's great to see the Knights of the Round table show how much they are against greed and conformism.Clive Owen is such a cool King Arthur. Normally, this would be a generic role, but he seems to make Hollywood roles more appealing with his rough voice and rugged stare. I wish that more focus was shown for him. (He's the title of the movie!) THe movie opens up with Lancelot joining the Knights, and when it came to the action scenes, other characters seemed to get more focus than Clive. It must have been easy to get confused on who to focus more on: Lance or Art? They are both cool people.Stellen Skarsgard was also great. He also had a generic part, but did cool things with it. He just stood there looking terrifying, and when it was time for him to go to action, he wouldn't do a fancy pose or any fighting stance. He would just plant himself into the ground, and be so intimidating. He used basic sword techniques, and then just pull surprise moves out of nowhere.The action scenes were awesome. I could see them pretty clearly, and the the choreography was great. I hate thinking of how they looked as PG-13 scenes. Keira Knightly who looks like such a frail woman looks amazing. She handle a Bow and arrow almost as good as Legolas, and she totally handles herself in closed quartered combat. (CQC) the whole cast does. Each Knight had great distinctive fighting styles, and it was simply cool.Ignore the negative reviews and whoever hated this movie, too bad. Get the Diector's Cut DVD like I have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion this is one of the best King Arthur films I have seen. The movie doesn't mess around with the whole magic part of the tale, and I think it makes the more believable. I was quite disappointed on how they didn't display the Lancelot and Guineviere love. I think that is the best part of the legend. You can tell though that the characters did have some type of a connection towards each other, so that was good. The people who casted the movie did a great job. All of the characters, especially Arthur, really fit the appearance that a lot of people had in mind for them. So I think this movie definitely deserves a 10, because it rocked!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not "Excalibur", but an excellent film about the reality, not mythology.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Boorman's wonderful "Excalibur" has always been one of my very favorite films of any genre, so any other film I've seen about the same subject is always compared with that, and usually they quickly pale in comparison. Of course, the difference with this film is that unlike "Excalibur" and most other Arthur films, which play up the legend and mythology, this new film purports to portray the real events as they supposedly historically occurred, according to recent archaeological discoveries. I'm sure that some things were embellished, regardless, but I think that is one of the things I enjoyed about this; to get a sense for some of the realism behind the legend and for some of the politics and history of the time. And the execution is very well done... not over-the-top at all, but smart and creative, with very credible performances. That I didn't know any of the actors by name or face probably helped, as the prospect of Richard Gere or Ben Affleck or Colin Ferrell whoever in the roles would have been very distracting to take this seriously. The brotherhood and camaraderie of the knights is well written and portrayed, as are the Romans, Saxons and others.Though it would be hard for any film of this type to compare in cinematography to "Excalibur", which I think is just absolutely outstanding in that respect, "King Arthur" has some nice shots as well and does a very good job of capturing its setting.The action scenes are particularly well done, especially compared to so many other "battle epic" films, where it's a whole lot of chaos and the main characters always survive through fight after fight. There is a sense of being able to follow what's going on, while also being in the midst of it all. Some of the tactical strategies employed are reminiscent of the type of clever tactical maneuvers in another great film, "Master and Commander".I'm disappointed to see this film only rated at 5.9 here, with so many other films less deserving getting much higher marks than that. I give it a solid 9 out of 10. Expectations play such a big part in how I perceive movies, and I suppose I didn't expect this to be so well done, or maybe I expected it to be more "Hollywood" or something. But thankfully there was a lot of craft in the writing, the film-making and acting, and I think this makes an excellent "companion piece" to "Excalibur", in terms of comparing mythology against reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just a cliché medieval movie with a difficult plot to follow, actually there was NO plot. The props were awful and obviously made of plastic or paper mache' due to their hilarious bending and breaking (The King Saxon Invader's Battle Axe.) Also, the acting was stagnant and lacked spontaneity. I have never been so bored in my life. It was actually painful to watch this movie. The optional ending didn't help the merciful completion of this so-called epic masterpiece. How many bad historical movies have arrows (flaming or otherwise) being shot all the time and in every direction in an effort to add emphasis in do or die situations, enough-is-enough, PLEASE. The Saxons should have gotten him. It would have made for a far better ending. Don't waste your money on this one...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always enjoyed legends and the neat and tidy fairy tale versions were wonderful when I was a child but now that i am older I like to see the more realistic versions of my favorite tales, and king Arthur is one of them. Although historically minded friends have pointed out some historical inaccuracies, I found it compatible enough with my basic knowledge of the time period and think it was accurate enough for the average viewer. I liked that the era was more where the basis of the legend may have come from. The romance portion was played down but still present, which I appreciated. The traditional triangle between Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot was hinted at but never a major plot point, which again I liked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking forward to watch this film for historical reasons, you'll be very disappointed, but if you want to watch (yet another) period film about battles with a kewl cast of mostly European actors, you'll be chuffed. I was disappointed with King Arthur because I truly expected it to be a good film but I should have known since it's from the producer of the likes of "Pearl Harbour" and "Flashdance"?But I have to say, there were some enjoyable bits about it. Those familiar with Robin of Sherwood will perhaps find it kind of nostalgic to see Ray Winstone playing another "Will Scarlet" kind of character. Clive Owen is cool and does an alright job but he no longer blows me away like he did in Chancer &amp; Croupier, he also gets to make too many cheesy Hollywood pre-battle speeches which take the edge off his character a little. He was almost upstaged by Ioan Gruffudd who gives the character of Lancelot a quiet but thoughtful edge. It's a pity that Antoine Fuqua is more interested in the action than developing the characters and the story because most of the cast would have been up to the task. The only performance I wasn't happy with was Keira's. She was miscast in a role obviously too unfamiliar for her abilities. The Guinevere character was too much of a job for her and she obviously struggles with, sometimes trying to hard, almost desperately, as if trying to impress Ioan, Owen and her teenage friends in real life. I preferred her in "The Hole" and "Pirates of the Caribbean" and it is perhaps because she is better at playing characters closer to herself i.e. rebellious/popular "teenagers" and "middle class princesses". Til Schweiger was as cool as the "German" villain and the relationship with his father was quite interesting. I also liked big guy "Ray Stevenson" in the role of Dagonet, it's a pity that he gets killed so early in the film. But overall I wasn't happy when the film ended because it felt like it was cut short half-through, we barely got to understand the Woads people and their leader Merlin, Guinevere's relationship with Arthur and Lancelot didn't develop properly and the end was just cheesy and disappointing.Overall this film disappoints because it makes you expect so much more. But then again that's classic "Jerry Bruckheimer"?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie!! It was really well done! I love this version of Guinevere, she kicks butt lol, none of this docile seductress. Merlin, I think they hit it on the head with who he was, but would have liked to see more of him in the film. I love the thing the father says at the beginning about horses. Some of those knights were nice eye candy lol, *drool* I really liked Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd) &amp; Galahad (Hugh Dancy)! The movie is based on some recent archaeological finds and presents a different take on Arthur. The fight scenes are really well done! What I liked is they come across as incredibly realistic (check the bonus features about the movie if you rent the DVD) BUT the director was smart and did not allow them to get gory. You see 'blood' but there's nothing that makes you turn away. I hate excessive use of gore. They also have impressed with their limited use of CGI additions, and when it is used its only in a 'light' form, meaning they don't have whole scenes done in CGI it's more to add depth to backgrounds and it's not overly noticeable. For those that like Gladiator, and I'm not one lol, this movie in my opinion is way better. Entertainment factor I'd give it a 9 1/2 out of 10 lol. The end might have you tearing up, have Kleenex in case lol.Having a passion for history &amp; archaeology I must say I disagree with the theory. My opinion is that it's a great theory, and some of the theories make sense and a very likely to be more truthful then the folklore that has developed (i.e. the portrayal of Guinevere &amp; Merlin). But two major points don't sit right with their theory of Arthur himself, the lack of mention of the Romans or Hadrian's wall in any other Arthur accounts. Usually if a story is true land marks that are well known are attached to the story as 'proof' of a stories validity. Likewise with the deep hatred the people (Pics, Saxons, Britons) had of the Roman's this is not something that would have been lost in the retelling of the tale. The Romans invading and leaving were such huge events they would have somehow stayed with the story as it was retold. All in all though I am totally impressed with someone taking history and going 'what if' with it and doing a VERY convincing job! Really awesome, well worth seeing!

		<shortDescription>Fair Attempt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's begin by reminding ourselves that the story was eked out of archaeological findings and histories written by conquerors (which are always very one-sided), of a group of legendary heroes that were, literally, prehistoric. That means that all of the details are, necessarily, dramatised; so I can't really attack the accuracy of the plot. It was, however, a little cliché-heavy, even for a Heroic epic.Now, I suppose I'm trying to read more meaning into this tale than there truly is, but consider this: Franzoni's Arthur had no identity of his own. He was Briton born, loyal to Rome, and spent most of his life in lands not his own, fighting for the causes of others. When the Woads approach him to lead their rebellion, he refuses at first, but eventually takes up their cause, instead. And then, preparing to ride into the film's final battle, he screams "Rus!" the battle cry of his Asian brother knights. Does he truly have no idea where his loyalties should lie? Add to this the fact that his fellow knights, who wanted only to return to their homelands, turned back and ran to Arthur's side against the Saxon army... Have you noticed that those who seem the most lost somehow engender the fiercest loyalty from their fellows? In the end, I felt more sad for them than triumphant. This Arthur looked to me like a confused and mercurial man that ended up being more of a danger to those that loved him than a help.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a note, I haven't seen the theatrical version, only 15 minutes longer Director's Cut.So, take a legend and spin it around, find some vague historical "facts" and claim, that it all was based on this. Believe if you want. I have my doubts.Plot itself is not very breath taking. Go and save this Roman, whose son is to become the next pope perhaps. So off we go. And during that all, there is some underlining comments about democracy and equality.But, I didn't care about that. There is some nice gritty realism in this movie. Battles are bloody and cruel. heads and limbs are chopped. It makes you feel, that no, that's not the place you wold want to be. Not in that moment of time. But, apart from the realism of the movie, I was surprised of what I did compare this movie to: "Conan the Barbarian". Both of these movies got pretty similar undertone in them. Same kind of brutality. Maybe this effected in my final score.As for acting, well,I really cannot pick anyone from the cast. Grunting flock of brutes, all of them.

It just doesn't make sense to see LotR getting a top ten all-time rating in IMDb's top 250 while this piece gets dissed. It's the same stuff, and if you believe King Arthur is a rip-off then think about Lord of the Rings. I've seen that stuff going on in Willow, Braveheart, perhaps even Robin Hood or Dances with Wolves. There's nothing original in Hollywood film-making so a lack of originality is an argument of nothing. King Arthur sucked just the same as Lord of the Rings did, but on the other hand, seen from the Hollywood point-of-view, it rocked. Just the same. Clive Owen was no worse than Aragorn, believe me. And by the way, at least this flick had a very cool character: Tristan. I cannot recall any character from Lord of the Rings that even came close to the mystical value of Tristan. Well, maybe Galadriel/Cate Blanchett ("All shall love me and despair!") However: stop being hypocrite.</fullReview>

I heard that clive owen was chosen for his "mystery" but since when has monotone been mysterious? i'd personally call it boring. Keira Knightly goes the other way and over acts the part completely, at one point, when she attacks a saxon as a part of the pack i have to admit i was truly terrified...the word psychotic comes to mind.However, Ioan grufford was amazing. I was gutted when he died (sorry to anyone that hasn't seen it). He was the best bit about the film and because he was so brilliant he completely made up for his co-stars inability to portray any kind of realistic emotion.All the other knights were fab and the film would have been so good if guinevere and arthur hadn't been so vile.

Yes, there are a couple of problems with the plot, the Saxons invading north of Hadrian's wall (why not just sail around it) and an important Roman family living north of the wall guarded only by a handful of soldiers. If you ignore these those and view the film as a piece of entertainment rather than a history lesson it's not a bad film at all.The directors cut seemed to contain a realistic amount of gore during the battle sequences (severed limbs/arteries, arrows through eyes/swords through necks etc) without being totally over the top.

		<fullReview>King Arthur is a fantastic film and will blow the audience away. Superior to both Troy and Lord of the Rings, King Arthur is definitely the best film of the year.THE ACTORS/CHARACTERS: The characters are amazing and totally believable, you gradually throughout the film begin to understand their lives and feel their pain. The actors were perfectly cast for their roles, Clive Owen (Arthur) brings a lot of integrity and you can feel his superiority as his character without him having to say it. Ioan Gruffudd (Lancelot) brings respect and loyalty without going over the top, you can understand his character and feelings clearly. Kiera Knightly (Guinevere) is a far more realistic Guinevere and a fantastic warrior. All the other actors and characters were amazing too.THE STORY: The story is totally believable and not at all far fetched like most films these days. It is about the power of the man behind the sword and Arthur earning the right to be king. The audience is immediately drawn into the story with the fantastic lines and breath-taking scenery. The battle scenes are the best seen on screen yet with variety and not merely blood and guts for the sake of it.The film didn't need well known popular celebrities or bad taste pornography to make it get good reviews. It is a film which makes the audience have mixed emotions throughout. You'll laugh, cry, cheer, be frightened, angry and full of suspense. It's a film worthy of the good reviews and should win many awards.I loved it! You will too!10/10 A*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honorable Mention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to at least commend this movie on the whole approach of trying to show what the "real" story of King Arthur might have been, without the augmentation of magic as per legend. In this area, the movie realistically portrayed Arthur as a half-Roman horseman, the Britons as painted tribal Picts (they called themselves Woads; I always thought that was the name of the paint they used), and the main adversary, the Saxons, as Germanic raiders. I was not extremely impressed by the acting, and the battle scenes were just OK. Actually, my main compliment goes to the actor Stellan Skarsg?rd, who played the Saxon leader Cerdic. He made a very effective bad guy; he radiated menace in every scene, and his brooding presence upstaged the other actors. I believe that an effectively evil bad guy is a very important part of a movie, and he got the best lines too ("Finally, somebody worth killing"), great stuff! So, I did enjoy the movie. I would advise however, that if you have no interest in the events of the late Roman Empire/early Middle Ages that you probably won't be that interested in this movie. I wouldn't watch it for the "human drama".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>its good, but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just finishing watching this about 5 minutes ago. It has all the right ingredients but really i don't think it is as good as it could have been. the cast were great (even keira knightly and i don't like her) but i think it lacks the epicness that it needed to show it off to its full extent. i feel that there was a lack of dramatic music that would have made the fight scenes more passionate they were trying to stave of the Saxons, fighting for their freedom. there really wasn't the right atmosphere about it.Overall i thought it was good but not great which is a shame as it promised so much .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been a great film with proper actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is nearly the best Roman epic and the best Arthur film, but it's let down very badly by the horrible casting. Clive Owen is at his very worst here, with his patented flat vocal delivery - like a bored photocopier salesman demonstrating a clapped out machine with one eye on the clock for the pubs opening - working overtime here to suck the life out of every scene he's in. The part is pretty well written, but he's hopelessly out of his depth with dialogue. Particularly painful are his prayer and his rallying the troops, where he just looks bored stiff and doesn't even try. And what's with the look of utter contempt he gives Guinevere in the wedding scene? It's a terrible performance.Unfortunately it's matched by the dreaded Keira Knightley, who is equally bad but in different ways. Her Hollywood career is a bit of a mystery: there are much prettier lasses and better actresses out there and she has no screen presence. She struggles badly with the lines, delivering them in a flat Rodean (a posh English school) accent that is oh so very wrong for a Scottish warrior queen. And when she gets bloody in the battle scenes, she just looks ridiculous, like she'd tried putting her lipstick on in turbulence. The fact that she's so anorexic she looks like a small child could knock her down just by blowing softly on her just makes her action-gal act that much more of a bad joke.Together this terrible twosome sabotage the good work of director and supporting cast whenever they dominate the screen. Luckily the battles and the rest of the knights DO compensate and somehow despite the black hole at the heart of the film the telling sweeps you along. But with proper actors instead of a couple of shop window dummies this could have been a contender. Shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, emotional and good-feeling movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally I liked King Arthur as a new and a bit unusual interpretation of famous legend. For me it's the best Arthurian movie although this film doesn't follow precisely typical classic fairy story about Knights of the Round Table, wizard Merlin, evil Morgana, lovers Lancelot and Guinevere. Now it looks more like a solid medieval epic tale and a completely new view on this legend. There are Romans in Britain and Arthur is the half British half Roman general of a legendary cavalry knights. He is a strong leader, who always takes care of his men and never remains indifferent to injustice, cruelty and religious fanaticism, which occurred alarmingly often during that time. His believes in freedom and equality of all people and there is nothing surprising that such his idealistic thoughts are not very welcome in that troubled time. Clive Owen played Arthur with lots of realism and created a memorable and rather emotional character. After fifteen years in Roman army Arthur and his knights must get freedom but before that they get their last job. They must try to save a noble Roman family in the heart of the country from rampaging barbarian Saxon hordes. Now Roman forces are leaving Britain and Arthur and his knights have to decide are their war is ended or not. King Arthur represents all typical moral elements for historical epic ? fight for freedom, faith, loyalty, courage, generosity and they perfectly work here. The whole movie is deeply emotional and poignant but never looks manipulative. Sometimes it's rather violent and disturbing but it never oversteps the limits of rationality and necessity. Despite lack of famous names most of the cast have solid performances. Ioan Gruffuld is very good as fearless but flawed Lancelot, Stellan Sarsgaard as Saxon leader and a ruthless conqueror. Keira Knightley is also doing reasonably well as Guinevere, female leading character. The battle scenes are mostly impressive and the only problem is that in last several years there are too many epic movies with well made long battle scenes so now it's very hard to amaze the audience with them. However their realism and tension in King Arthur is another positive point of this movie. Saying so many positive things about King Arthur I also should notice some of its flaws, fortunately not numerous. Of course it has some historical inaccuracies (for example Saxon conquered Britain) and it's not free of stereotypes (though there much less of them here then in most modern Hollywood pictures). But positive easily outweighs here all possible minor drawbacks. King Arthur is a really enjoyable and good feeling movie and in my opinion it is easily one of the best summer movies of the year.My grade 8.5 out of 10. Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English.I really enjoyed it. Thanks and sorry for my bad English.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps not quite the worst movie ever but not far off. Utterly disappointing tripe.The director took himself far to seriously. There were many long and self indulgent slow camera shots of Arther and other characters with emotional background music playing.Arthur and his knights are all apparently roman soldiers. This movie is set in a completely different period of history to all other Arthur stories I have ever heard. It was completely unbelievable.Merlin was almost non existent and certainly not a wizard. The main saxon chief had a pitifull American accent and Arthur was more wooden than the amazon.Don't waste your time. Opt for Excalibur, undoubtedly the best Arthurian movie and full of plot, action and emotion.I cant comment on this film's historical accuracy but it sure was boring.</fullReview>

A bow to director, producer and wonderful cast. Now I have a couple of another favorite European actors. Every character is created so carefully and naturally, that you simply cannot answer the question of who was my favorite character and who wasn't. Impossible to name, impossible to imagine the movie without any of the characters or see The Knights of The Round Table somehow differently now. "King Arthur" completely changed my view.

		<shortDescription>Weak, but Consistently Weak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The process of making a film consists of three distinct stages: pre-production, production, and post-production. Usually when a film just doesn't work it is because the wheels fell off during one of these stages and excellence in the other two stages could not salvage the project. Although a pre-production failing like a poor script cannot be compensated for in production or post-production, valiant salvage efforts can make a production technically interesting. Most high-budget films follow this example as a technically talented cast and crew work to turn a flawed concept into something decent. The result is an uneven product that leaves the viewer sorry that so much talent was wasted on something so ordinary. King Arthur is the rare exception where the all stages are consistently weak, in this project the three production stages truly deserve each other. The uninspiring script gives cast and crew little to work with. While there is nothing wrong with giving the Arthur saga an 'imaginative' twist, the traditional story is fun and interesting and creative freedom with non-history should at least inspire a story that is equally worth telling. This version is neither worth telling nor told in an interesting way. Not surprising coming from the feeble pen of David Franzoni (who can also be blamed for 'Gladiator'). Buried in the mess are painful allusions to how every man is born equal and other messages about positive human values ('The Magnificent Seven' written by Norman Vincent Peale) but there are too many characters and not enough time to explore anyone or anything more than superficially. The acting is absurdly lame, something out of the former NFL star school of film performance. None of them appear to be on the same page. Keira Knightley is unintentionally hilarious; she has probably set her career back 10 years with this role. Perhaps she watched Natalie Portman's bored performance in 'Attack of the Clones' and decided to ham up this role or perhaps she was sick during most of the performance; she looks like she just finished a hard month of intensive chemotherapy. Sets somehow manage the unlikely combination of being confusing AND uninteresting. Director Antoine Fuqua was apparently napping during most of the shooting, as the overall production seems out of control. During his waking moments Antoine staged endless 'walking and talking' scenes; directors use these when they are either too lazy to stage an interesting scene or where the dialogue is so horrible that the distraction provided by a tour of the set is necessary. Both were true in King Arthur.The editing is simply incomprehensible. High budget battle scenes jump all over the place without any logical sign of progression. The huge continuity issues in these scenes do not become a factor because the audience is too busy trying to make basic sense of what is happening to even bother with logical analysis. Antoine's probable dementia becomes apparent when he stages a hopelessly poor imitation of Eisenstein's "Battle on the Ice" scene. If you're going to plagerize an idea at least do it as well as the original.The only character you end up liking or caring about is Stellan Skarsgard's 'Cedric' who is the villain of the piece. Interesting only as an example of consistent mediocrity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little long, a different take than usual.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The back story of the movie has to do with the conquering of a far eastern country of Sarmatia by Rome. The warriors that were left standing were allowed to live and were taken into the Roman army, so where their sons and grandsons etc. These Sarmatian knights were the cream of the crop but their servitude has left generations of them wanting to return home. Arthur, also known as Artorius, is a convert to Christianity in these last days of the Roman Empire. He is in command of what's left of the last of the Sarmatian knights, mainly pagans. They are based in a fortress at Hadrian's Wall where Arthur has his round table for war conferences. It is the even of their final day of obligation to the Roman army and they are all anxious to return to Sarmatia and their freedom.But the Bishop has arrived to announce that Rome is pulling out of Britain and they have one last mission to conduct before they are allowed their freedom. They must rescue a Roman family from north of the wall, territory that the heathens and pagans, called Woads, call their own which is in inherent danger of a mass invasion by the Saxons. Arthur feels obligated to his duty and eventually his knights decide to join him too. It seems a bit unbalanced sending an away team of 7 knights against impending thousands of Saxons and hundreds of Woads.They reach the home of the Roman nobleman and discover a walled in prison filled with mainly dead prisoners but manage to rescue a boy and a beautiful "Woad" woman, Guinevere. She's tough, brave and seems to have a fascination for Arthur and he for her. And yet there are stolen glances from Arthur's best friend Lancelot but other than one quick seduction scene the night before a battle, there is no blatant love story here. This movie is not the traditional Arthur tale you know but it tells the tale of how Arthur earned the right to be king of a united Britain, the indigenous armies and the displaced Romans. We know it won't be for long as history points to the Saxons as ruling the island for several centuries before the Conquest.Arthur is played by the lovely green eyed Clive Owen and Guinevere is portrayed by Keira Knightly who continues her feisty chick role. You will remember her from Pirates of the Caribbean, also a Jerry Bruckheimer production as is this. Ioan Gruffudd plays Lancelot and some of you will know him from the Hornblower series, also Poldark. Ray Winstone plays Bors, a character i quite enjoyed. The action and battle scenes are very well done, with a minimum of computer graphics though they are there but not that obtrusive. The fortress representing Hadrian's wall is real, not generated. Actors walk on the walls, the huge gates are solid and ominous. It all adds to the 5th century Britain feel of things. Lots of armour, swords, and archery, Guinevere kicks ass, Arthur and the knights fight bravely. The Saxons are rather understated but clearly the bad guys. The dialogue is a bit lame though. I mean "I'm Arthur. You're safe now" ???? sheesh. The costumes are wonderful, very authentic feeling and the scenery is spectacular. Filmed in Kildare and Wicklow, Ireland, I liked this movie for the fact that it was more historically accurate, assuming there may have been a warrior king named Artorius. There could have been, even if events are fictionalized. There's lots of action and swordplay that maybe goes on a little too long at times. I was a little unclear about whether the knights actually were taken from their homes in Sarmatia or if they were in Britian. I think it was implied that at least Lancelot was from the eastern country but the initial conquest of Sarmatia was 100 years previous to the start of the movie and it seemed like once in the army, most of the soldiers wouldn't likely make it back home to start families and have their sons and future generations then seconded into the army. It was mentioned that Arthur's Roman father married a Briton so it seems likely he was not from Sarmatia. Anyway, that was their ancestral home so i suppose it's irrelevant in the long run.I liked the movie, it was exciting and had some great adventure in it. There's lots of good info on the official site about the movie and the history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been awesome...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a student of Medieval history and literature I really enjoyed this film. Not because of the intriguing plot (there is none) of the in-depth exploration of the characters (none either), but because I kept laughing my ass of! It could have been so awesome. I mean, using the Celtic Arthurian legend for a change (I for one am more a fan of those than of the rather tame, overly romantic French stories of later date) sounded great to me. Trailer looked cool as well. Clive Owen is an actor I already really liked (after seeing him in Bent and Croupier), as is Stellan Skarsgard. So what went wrong....??EVERYTHING! They just couldn't get ANY even remotely historical or literary aspect of this period and legend right! * Saxons invading from the North (and a couple of centuries too early as well) * A Pope as the head of the Roman Church * A bunch of late-Medieval French knights with famous names disguised as "Sarmatians" from God-knows-where * A table with no clear purpose (which, I must admit, was round) * A crazy wizard-who-wasn't-a-wizard with no clear purpose (although, I must admit, he was called Merlin) * A bunch of blue "Woads" who were also "Britons" (I got really confused here, as the Britons were just one of the Celtic tribes, but here the word "Briton" seemed to be synonymous for "Celt" as in "indigenous inhabitant or Britain") * A never fully explored sword-in-burial mount-theme (I must admit, a boy pulled it out of something and it was called Excalibur) * A guy with a stupid Italian accent (signifying him as being a Roman) living in a Roman villa complete with Mediterranean poplar trees, NORTH of Hadrians Wall (???). Did he have some kind of death-wish? * A half-naked, starved Kiera warrior princess pretending to be a Celtic Boadicae, French Guinevere and Maximus the Gladiator all at the same time * A Lancelot who served no purpose but looking good and moaning to Arthur about going home (while stroking a mummified rat, of whatever it was) * A steamy lovescene that wasn't steamy but blue and boring * A Christian Arthur who marries Boadicae/Guinevere/Maximus in a polystyrene Stonehenge near the coast (??), while being blessed by some Welsh-sounding druid wannabe (at least he pronounced the name of Guinevere the right way, since this is supposed to be the Celtic Guinevere) * Mount Badon being near Hadrians Wall (??) * Mysterious doors that need to be opened the fist time by 2 horses, to open all by themselves after that (maybe they had some unseen cave-trolls on top of the wall...) * Clive Owen uttering the most incredibly cheesy dialogue I have ever heard. "Mark my face, Saxon, for it will be the last thing you see on this earth" -sigh-.... I was constantly thinking "this movie could have been remotely enjoyable, if Arthur would just look rugged and SHUT HIS MOUTH". I got the impression Mr. Owen was a bit ashamed of being in this film as well (at least he looked like it) * Stellan Skarsgard doing even worse, confusing muttering one-word-phrases like "burn" and "kill" in a low American accent with being fearsome. He looked half asleep the entire time! and so on and so on.....This could have been a great movie in the tradition of Gladiator (a movie which actually had a PLOT). The sets looked cool (better than those obvious CGI soldiers and ships in Troy). But what this film missed was a plot, a cool hero (sorry Mr. Owen), a cool soundtrack (please stop copy-pasting from your own previous work, Mr.Zimmer) and blood (this film has the most bloodless battles I have ever seen in a period film. Gladiator is a regular blood-fest compared to this one!).Enjoyable if you want to spend an evening laughing, but could have been much, much, much better (if, say, Ridley Scott had directed it and Clive Owen had just kept his mouth shut).</fullReview>

I know a lot of folks had their problems with it, especially those who wanted either a rehash of exisiting 'Arthur' tales, or alternatively expected a 'historically accurate' account.Get a life, people. It's a MOVIE. A STORY. And it's well-told, with the mystical mumbo-jumbo removed and the French soap opera elements tweaked so that just the names are recognizable. Despite that, and that's one of the things I really liked, it managed to retain the flair of 'legend'. It was an uabashed story about a hero, and there's nothing wrong with that.Another nice tweak: Arthur making the transition from trying to serve a 'higher purpose' to humanization, when he realizes that the 'higher purpose' is probably well and truly corrupted, and that if any purpose in life is to be found it lies in the service of one's people. A good and noble soldier's creed. The stuff indeed, of heroic legend, well told, and with a kick-ass cast.Full marks.Till Noever (Author, Keaen.

		<fullReview>What a brilliant film! Kiera Knightly as Guinevere makes a dramatic change from some of her other roles (such as Juliet in Love Actually and Elizabeth Swan in potc) and is a very convincing heroin. Ray Winston I hardly recognised cos' since watching henry VIII I thought he was really old lol and Ioan Gruffudd was so cute and v. sexy and dramatic (in a good way). But I'd never really heard of Clive Owen much before i saw this film and I'm really glad I saw it now as he is gorgeous! Beautiful eyes? Anyway, a great film all around and I think it makes a refreshing change to see a war/battle scene in a film without heads flying everywhere etc because then it appeals to a wider audience. Also the song of hope from Bors wife is beautiful and the music from composer Hans Zimmer who also composed the music for Pirates Of The Caribbean, is amazing. All around this is one great film! The story is quite different from what legend tells us so is a bit confusing at first?but this is another side of the story so it gives the audience a wider viewpoint. Loved the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Arthur....a melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It started with the recruitment of male teenagers to be trained as knights and would only be back after 15 years, when their contract is finish. This group of knights, later called the Arthurians, gained respect and honor from the people for being triumphant on their battles and successfully protect their walled city. And the story goes on with the involvement of Merlin, Guenevere, and the bishop who sent them to their last mission, a very dangerous one, before they could taste the freedom they all have been longing for.As far as i know, the story of King Arthur is not really like the one in the movie (correct me if im wrong), i mean not really this dramatic. The thing about Guenevere as an archer, and Merlin as a Hamlet and not a sorcerer, is a complete shock for me. Well, im not really a pro on the story of King Arthur, but i do have a little knowledge about it. But this new version is one i cannot deny as something better than the original, or in the case of The First Knight.This version is something with uniqueness and a lot more of sense. It doesnt follow on the traditional love story of a King and a Queen which involves a third party. Putting more emphasis on the friendship and freedom is better than a mere love story, which would definitely be more predictable and mediocre.On the casting: Guenevere is undeniably gorgeous, very pretty indeed especially when she was on her battle attire, with paints on her face. The King Arthur, sad to say, had given a poor performance. I dont know if he's a new actor or what, but he just lack a lot facial expression. His acting is very monotonous and plain. The Lancelot is, on the other hand, better than King Arthur. All the other casts did a good job and portrayed their characters far from mediocrity.The cinematography was a two-thumbs-up, seems like similar to the place of LOTR, but still, it has its own distinction. The battle scene was fairly good, but they should've put a better effect on the raining arrows (just like on the movie Hero).This movie proves that changes/revision doesnt always means making taking the essence and beauty of the original (just like HP movies), but in a sense, it does put a better emphasis on a different angle which is a good spice for the audience.My rating: B+</fullReview>

Small things let this film down, the fact that the Romans were pulling out of Britain in 467 isnt true, they pulled out in 410 and Bishop Germanus visited Britain in 426.Clive Owen did an ok job as Arthur but was as charismatic as my right leg, Kiera Knightley was good but a bit wooden, Ioan Gruffud was the best knight in the group but the others were undeveloped as was Merlin even though he is the leader of the fearsome Woads (another flaw).Stellan Skarsg?rd and Til Schweiger were the best in the film although both Skarsgard and Scweigar had very little to do except fight, brood and kill. The battle scenes were far-fetched but good and the story as a whole was also entertaining.Not the best film I have seen, but certainly not the worse. Flawed -and for a big fan of this historical period that let the film down - but good. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A refreshing take on the Arthurian story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this film with an open mind, having read some of the less-than-flattering reviews. Growing up in the north-east of England, I was well aware of the Arthur-related stories and legends that exist in this area including the one about Arthur and his knights sleeping in a cave under The Roman Wall until Britains' hour of need. To me, it made historical sense to set the tale in the early Dark Ages and to represent the legend as based on ordinary men doing extraordinary deeds. After all, most of the legend was invented in the mediaeval period, hundreds of year after Arthur was supposed to exist. I thoroughly enjoyed the film, found it entertaining and beautifully shot, and was impressed by the fight scenes. After so much CGI with massive hordes majestically sweeping across plains, it was good to feel that you were right in the thick of it with them and they were really slugging it out.OK, so it's not historically totally accurate - but how can you be accurate about a legend for which there is precious little solid evidence? Go see it, enjoy it for what it is and don't get prissy about the "facts". Remember IT'S JUST A FILM!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this and after reading all the negative press etc thought I was in for a boring time. I was wrong, OK some bits are a bit low key but the battles were good and there were some good looking knights for the women as well as Keira for the men.OK so it may irritate the purists who like the legend side of things but we do not know who he was or much about him at all but at least the cast was was from the right side of the pond for it. I don't care about the film being historically accurate to the last date as these things happened in the time when there was not much written word and those that did chronicle it wrote long after the events.Arthur could have been a deeper character with more of what the relationship was between him and Lancelot explained in a bit more detail. Bors and Dagonet made up the older element of fighter - the seen it all and done it all type. Gawain and Galahad's roles could had been expanded on as both actors are very talented but this was underused. Tristan's dark brooding was also not fully explained but it made me wonder how he became the way he was - a killing machine first and foremost.Keira was OK as eye candy in the film but I am afraid her delivery was rather flat and emotionless with an upper class accent. The on screen chemistry between Arthur and Guinivere was non-existent, the 'love' scene between them was so sterile with the classic 'glamour model' pose of head back and mouth open that it made no sense at all. The scene should have been much more earthy and frantic with Arthur finally letting his pent up emotions out - the kiss between Bors and his lover was hotter.Still you go to see what you want, you will either like it or loathe it but as entertainment on a purely entertainment scale I found it good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. I've seen this film a few days ago, and thought, what are all these people on about? What do they mean its not very good? What do they mean in saying that it's a flop? And what do they mean by saying it's complete, and utter crap? OK. I admit, there are only a few minor drawbacks to this film. The cast could have been better. Like Clive Owen, he's good, but not for the part. his acting is brilliant, but I think they could have done a better job in choosing the cast. However, actors and actresses such as Kiera Knightley and Ioan Gruffudd were amazing! I mean, why couldn't Gruffudd himself be the role of Arthur? He acts brilliantly. Oh, but all the smoke in the foreground and background? A bit to much. But all in all, it was a brilliant film, I'd definitely go and see it again! The story wasn't too hard to follow and the battle scenes were simply amazing.Good on the directing. Well done!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this is he one &amp; only Arthur - ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Arthur was one of those movies i loved instantly upon reading the online advertising before its American release - after which i completely forgot about it because it took almost a year to see that memory visualised in our theaters. Now what were my expectations ? A nice historical mix of Roman &amp; Celtic cultural elements with a budget big enough to provide the 'major-battle' custom to every historic epic since the collisions in Ben Hur. They were fully forfilled and even came with several extra spices, such as the bold humorous dialogues between the knights, mostly regarding Bogs offspring, some beautiful panorama's ( especially of Hadrian's wall ) &amp; an almost unrecognizable Guinevere in combat. On a deeper level, King Arthur offers some clear but amusing references to Gladiator: not only might the leading man just have been Russell Crowe in that armour, he also swings his sword the same way as during the 'Hannibal reenactment fight' &amp; as a first opponent during the major battle, takes out a Saxon carrying a long battle axe. But the one scene that really made my cinemaniac soul go emotional was the battle on the ice, with the cracking &amp; the grasping of the pieces &amp; such, ... it was pure Aleksandr Nevsky.Now for the critical part. The portrayal of the peoples seemed rather accurate, the difference between the short Roman swords &amp; the knight's Celtic types was a nice touch as well as the worldly affairs of the church and its members for the early period, ... but all the Roman footsoldiers carrying that 'Pax' or 'C-R-istos' sign on their shields to indicate the Empire has converted to Christianism is a doubtful element, especially because they are already shown when the time indicator is standing on 300 AD while Christianism wasn't recognized until 312 and declared official religion until 395. Plus, those men are referred to as auxiliaries, who mostly where foreigners with their own specific weapons and skills, not conscripts in a standard legionnaire suit. i hadn't checked on the origins of 5th century horsemen in Great Brittain or the actual timeline for the Saxon invasion, but i'm sure the crew came pretty close with their setting. Only that stupid "Rus !" yell i didn't get ... that was the name for 8th century Viking settlers in present Russia, what has that got to do with 5th century Brittain ?The one thing that just stinks is whatever is preserved from the Arthurian legend apart from the name Artorius - naming the whole gang after the knights was cheap, the Merlin character a hasty solution to the question of making what out of the medieval wizard &amp; i could have done without Lancelot looking at the bathing Guinevere, since nothing further happens.So for once my '8' voting is fully logical : take one point for the Arthurian elements &amp; one for the historical flaws. BUt as long as there isn't an entire flock of Arthurian movies set in this transition period this remains by my judgment the finest Arthur movie ever, outranking Merlin, Excalibur, and Robert Taylor matinees like Prince Valiant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Arthur, The Leader: This role was displayed by Clive Owen in a way in which the viewer witnesses a portrayal of a man who is driven by one faith and one goal. Owen brings the character of King Arthur to life.Lancelot, The Charismatic Ladykiller: Gruffudd brings a breath of fresh air to this film. His portrayal of Lancelot is somewhat different to that we remember from the legends. He is shown as a killing machine, he has no faith, no God, no rules to live by, accept his loyalty to Arthur.Gruffudd has some of the most amazing and spectacular moments of dialogue. His line I don't believe in Heaven! I've been living too long in this hell" and his constant banter with Ray Winston's character is one of the amusing moments in the film. Bors, The Family Man: One word to say about Winston's performance as Bors, UNFORGETTABLE. His role in the film is only a supporting role, but he brings his role into one of the major characters of the film.Guinevere, The Queen: It's a shame that we don't get to see much of Knightly in the film, she could have bought a sense of originality to the love triangle between Lancelot, King Arthur and Guinevere. (This does not appear in the film). To be totally frank i did not really know what her role was in the film. This film totally out classes The Lord of The Rings: Rethurn of the King in its battle sequences. Amazingly Directed by Antonio Fuqua. The Scenes show the unpredictability of battle, and the way in which it can change in seconds. There is no CGI in these sequences, which helps to give the film a sense of authenticity. This film sticks out in my memory for a number of reasons:Ray Winston's total take on the character of BorsIoan Grufudd's amazing portrayal and dialogue as LancelotSome of the most amazingly directed battle scenes:And most of all the sex scene between Arthur and Guinevere, why was this there, it was totally Unnecessary and to be quite frank, poorly acted.On the whole this film is amazing and I would recommend it to any one who wants a "On the edge of your seat" thrill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My 2 cents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK...this is just my opinion...but I liked this movie. For once, for me, it was a story about Arthur and his knights, not the triangle between Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere. I also loved the fact that it focused on the battle scenes and at the same time, you got to meet the characters for who they were, even brief. This movie was well done, but again, that's just my opinion. I was happy to see that it focused on more then the triangle...even if I was personally disturbed by the ending. But again, it's a movie based on something that is fictional...legendary. Then again...I don't know the true 'story,' just from movies and what I have been told from friends...but I enjoyed this movie.Please be gentle with the comments if there are any...I am only saying my view :=)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"King Arthur" could be dangerously too close to Troy or LOTR, where millions of computer-generated men fought in well orchestrated but still fantasy battles. It could be but it's not. What we got is good directing, believable battles with living actors that can be counted on the screen, nice script with an interesting idea (Arthur is a roman army officer guarding Rome's outposts in Britain), very fine acting with some great characters (Bors, played by Ray Winstone - Will Scarlet from old Robin Hood English series, Clive Owen, Mads Mikkelsen as Lancelot and last but not least Keira Knightley - still a little bit wooden and cartoonish but damn she's got a lot of charisma as brave Guinevere). The plot itself is just a simple construction to show us some unforgettable battle scenes (the one on the frozen lake will remain in your mind for quite a long time - I can assure you) and moments of great valour, bravery and real friendship between seven knights who remind me "Magnificent Seven".You'll watch the movie on one breath, it's an entertaining and wise story about values that passed away with their bearers. It's strong 8 out of 10 for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had all the great qualities of being a good movie. It has humor,tragedy,suspense, and a love story. This movie was just about perfect.I enjoyed mostly the performance of Clive Owen(Arthur) Ioan Grufudd(Lancelot) and Ray Stevenson(Bors). This was a hilarious movie and it showed human pain and human sacrifice. You could really relate to all of the knights and what they were feeling and at some points it nearly brought me to tears.You could just really get into this movie and feel what the characters are feeling and understand it. These people just really want to go home. Then they realize that friendship and loyalty is the most important thing. Stick with your friends. They really care about you.People must understand that these men are bound by blood and sacrifice and their wills to go home but in the end they realize that some things are more important to them. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone that love humor, loss, and love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far better than you may have heard!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had low expectations going to see this, but my friend got free tickets, so why not?! Especially with the prospect of the gorgeous Clive Owen, if nothing else!But I loved it! I've read some of the comments here, and will resist the temptation to respond to some of the individual comments. Suffice to say that a lot of people need to understand that 'Legend' does not equal 'Fact'! All these complaints about it not being the true story, or historically accurate! Who knows?! From what I've read, as written by those who might be expected to know, this is based on the latest historical evidence.I found it very clever, and pretty convincing, the way elements of the myth were portrayed as believable events, which could have been built upon by centuries of balladeers and storytellers (a good example being Arthur extracting his father's sword from the earth).I also did not find it at all insulting to Britain, as one person here said - quite the opposite! Guinevere's petitions to Arthur to lead his people, and the observation that Excalibur was forged in the fires of Britain, were very stirring! I wanted those Romans and those Saxons OUT OF MY COUNTRY!! OK, so a lot of modern Brits are descended from those invaders, but hey - British can be defined a million ways, there's no pure blood in these islands. And frankly those knights are more than welcome here, because everyone knows that whinging about the weather is THE defining feature of Britishness!Anyway, I digress! I loved the relationship between the band of knights; yes, there was a touch of Henry V, or the Magnificent Seven, but that's hard to avoid in such a situation. I found the 'romance' between Arthur and Guinevere convincing - she's a kick-ass warrior, who made him see things differently than he had always believed; he's a legend in his own lifetime, but also a good man, with ideals. (and he's Clive Owen - who'd say no?)I was a bit annoyed that Lancelot came to her rescue in the big battle, but its a minor quibble. And I was slightly distracted by the variety of accents, but I got over it, because who knows what is accurate anyway? Although I was stunned for a moment when I thought the bad guy might actually be played by an American (is that allowed?) but then realised it was a (great) European actor who has picked up the accent while learning English. Ah well, maybe one day.The battle on the ice has been mentioned as a stand-out scene, which it most certainly is, but I can't really pick out a lot of others, because I just enjoyed the film as a whole.And, the unexpected death (not gonna spoil it!) was a welcome twist, because if there's one thing you think you know, it's who will survive. And it's great to have that confidence knocked occasionally in a movie.All in all, a really enjoyable film, that will stir your British blood!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw it tonight, and I'm sorry, I thought it was awful. The lead actor made me giggle. He was so gormless, it was like he was constantly searching for the autocue - or maybe they hid some of his lines underneath a goblet. We were cracking up laughing as he was trying to deliver some lines while trying to remain in control of the horse at the same time. His terrible acting delivery totally ruined the movie for me. We were taking the p1$$ out of him for most of the duration, and that should not happen in such an "epic movie" where the lead actor should command respect from the outset. This guy was an embarrassment. They should have hired a rugby league player to do it instead... they would have done a far more admirable job. The one high point in the movie though, was Kiera Knightley. What a ba-a-a-a-a-be! Swoon!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I confess, I was dragged by my 12-year-old son to see this. But much to my surprise I LOVED it! This was a chance to really feel what it was like to experience that period of time. I thought it was the first intelligent, thoughtful look at the reality of living and surviving in Britain at that time. The knights were human. They had fears, frustrations, needs and wants. The battle sequences were intelligently handled. I understood more about war strategy than ever before. The battle sequences were, to me, totally believable ? and thankfully not bloody. I have a whole new respect for the bravery of every man that went to fight; it was history coming to life. Only part I didn't like. Clive Owens performance, he looked great! I like him in other performances but this was too stilted. The rest of the cast was very good. I will watch this movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another good idea badly implimented.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following in the footsteps of Troy (and very much in the same style) This film is an interesting take on the Arthurian legend, however it is a long way from being historically accurate (even to what little information we have about that age - and shame on you so called "history buffs" for thinking otherwise), suffers from several modern Hollywood clichés, has wooden acting and mixed up accents.First thing I should say is that this is an *attempt* at a historical version of the Arthurian story. Those that prefer fantasy over history will definitely be disappointed and I would recommend for those digging out a copy of Excalibur (which while being very much fantasy over history it is a far better film on the whole). You don't need to even bother reading the rest of this review because you can trust me that you will be disappointed.I very much like the idea of attempting a historical perspective on the legend, however the key word where this film is involved is "attempt" and no one should be fooled into thinking this is anything more then a mixture of educated guess and Hollywood razzle dazzle.It's been a few years since Hollywood has made the English out to be the bad guys so this is somewhat of a return to form for them (and no surprise to find it's a Disney production). Yep that's right; the Saxons (along with the Angles and Jutes, and later on the Normans) form the majority of modern English blood. Yet for some reason they are near mindless (and completely ignorant to any kind of tactic or battle skill), Nazi like (determined not to mix their gene pool), killing machines (and for some reason the appear to be led by a John Wayne impersonator). The historical truth of the matter is that the Saxons where no more bloodthirsty then any other tribe/race at the time, including the Celtic Britons and the Romans. It is funny how perspectives on a people change depending on circumstances. In Hollywood terms the Saxons suddenly become good guys once they have converted to Christianity (and funnily enough are fighting off Heathens in the form of the invading Danes). But while they are Heathens they are evil.Having said that, at least the Britons that are still Heathens are given a kinder portrayal. But then Hollywood does like to show the dark side of Rome (which is one thing I do appreciate) and so the need to have misunderstood, oppressed good guys in the plot led to the acceptance of at least some Heathen tribes. The real truth of the matter though is very much un-Hollywood and for that matter un-Christian. There was no good and evil, simple different sides of a struggle for survival. The term "Woads" doesn't sit very well with me either. The "Britons" were Celts, and the term Woad, last I heard, was actually a Saxon term anyway (meaning Madness). The Celts migrated to England just as the Saxons did (and the Jutes, Angles, Danes and Normans). In actual fact the Saxons, Jutes and Angles were invited in as Mercenaries to defend the country after the Romans abandoned it, it was only later they saw the opportunity to make the place their home. Meanwhile the Celts where renowned for their savagery and their enjoyment of combat (they used to charge into battle naked and painted), they claimed the British isles from the people before them, whom they likely slaughtered or at least forced to move on. So you couldn't really call them in original inhabitants (as far as we know they originated somewhere in Asia). At least when the Saxons came they were able to retain Hibernia and Caledonia (Ireland and Scotland) and they were being moved on by three tribes not just the Saxons. Oh yeah and the Saxons were largely motivated by their own survival too, a point overlooked in this film. They were forced out of Germania by the Romans and they sought the decent farm land of this country so that they may feed their people and ultimately survive. They were also defending their religion, indeed had they been willing to convert to Christianity they would have been under the arm of Rome the same as the Britons were. The Saxons were fighting for their freedom, their religion and their right to live. That doesn't make a good Disney baddie though....The most conclusive research I've seen on Arthur would suggest that the legend is in fact based on two different people with the elements of legend roughly divided between the two. Unfortunately that wouldn't make for a good film, so a lot of elements are thrown into this supposed historical perspective as a way to justify various parts of the legends and a lot of that seems rushed and badly thought out. There were also a whole load of other historical inaccuracies. I never really understood the point of correcting some of the standard inaccuracies of a Hollywood historical epic (such as Guinevere) and ignoring a whole load of others (amongst others, why are there so many crossbows?). So having failed to achieve its original goals of a fair historical perspective we are left to examine the film as nothing more then a film. So what do we have?Well the film is incredibly predictable. While Guinevere may be more accurate, it is typical of modern day Hollywood to cast a woman in an ass kicking role. I'd like to give the makers the benefit of the doubt of making her kick ass out of historical perspective but sadly I think it is just because it's the trendy thing to do. The final battle was mostly predictable, especially the final combat between the big good and the big bad. The overall theme of freedom was a bit of the false side given what I mentioned above (and remember the Celts converted to Christianity fully long before the Anglo-Saxons, and when the Saxons came to Britain there was a resurgence of Heathenism even amongst the Celts who had those trends oppressed under the Romans).The end is incredibly cheesy, and when you consider the real historical perspective of it all (i.e. that the Saxons "won" in the end), it's a bit of a joke. The acting is at times reasonable, but mostly poor. While the old Hollywood concept of placing supposedly chivalrous 14th centaury knights in full jousting place in the middle of the dark ages may have been swept aside in this film they are still using totally inappropriate accents. The new rougher Gwen for some reason still has an ever so posh English accent, as do most of the characters in this film (the most noticeable exception being the Saxon chief whose accent sounds American for some unknown reason). The script is unbelievably Clichéd, and at one point Arthur he even seemed embarrassed to be uttering his own lines. The acting as I said at the start is poor but I would be willing to give benefit of the doubt to a lot of the cast due to the poor script and sub standard directing.Really there isn't a lot of redeeming qualities to this film. I would recommend watching it only as a point of interest and so you can make your own mind up, but I should warn you that for the vast majority of people this film will not entertain much and will always be considered inferior to Excalibur. I would advise against paying to see this in the cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the build up that this movie had, I was sorely disappointed. The concept is a good one and they had a chance to make a terrific movie, they just didn't. For a hero Arthur is pretty lame. Very little facial epression throughout the movie. If the makers of the movie intended for you to get behind Arthur, they failed. Kiera Knightly is always a pleasure to look at, but even her performance is monotone. The plot drags through the movie, plodding along painfully slow. The main "Bad guy" has a southern United States accent while his son speaks with a french accent. (Anyone remember Kevin Costner as Robin Hood?) I would not recommend seeing this movie at the theater. Don't waste $10 on a ticket. Wait for video or, even better, wait for cable or network television. It's just not worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whats your problem? - Read a book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand what all the hoo har is about people criticisms on King Arthur. Heaps of people are saying that the story is inaccurate.....Well according to the Anglo-centric story spun in the 15th century, which like most Ancient Greek history, has maybe 1 milligram of true historical basis, then it was inaccurate. But according to archaeological studies and earlier literature written a little after the period that is associated with Arthur, the movie has some merit. True the movie has inaccuracies. But so does Troy (and Homer's version itself) and just about every other period piece that comes out of Hollywood. Unrealistic battle scenes? - who was complaining when they saw Lord of the Rings or any other action flick, like Bad Boys. So what's your problem people? It was a great story and from what I saw, it did make an attempt to paint a picture of what could really have happened. Some people complain about the Roman setting, well true the Romans officially pulled out of Britain in 410 AD, but the Church didn't. Thats not to say that "Romans" as such were not still around. The movie did not show masses of Roman legions, just a garrison to protect a Bishop - plausible but whether its true who knows - but plausible. The fact is THERE IS NO CONCRETE EVIDENCE OF THE FACTS......YET. Most sources place Arthur between approximately 420 and 540 AD, the time of the Saxon invasions. That adds merit to the story. Guinevere, if she was a Celt could plausibly have been a worrior - as was common for Celtic women (e.g. queen Boudica in the 1st century AD). Most believe that Arthur was a Romano-Celt. So whets wrong with that aspect of the movie? Hadrians wall was still there around the time of Arthur, there were many forts left behind by the Romans (bigger than any built but those who came later). So why couldn't Arthur base himself in one of those - the Britons were trying to cling to Roman civilization during that period. Some archeologists think that Arthur's "Camelot" may have been a Celtic Hill fort - heaven forbid that! Or better yet, did you know that some archeologists even propose that Arthur as we believe him to be never existed but instead it is the story of about a noble Roman in Britain who live in the second century AD fighting the Picts. Oh but it can't be you say!!!! Others think that the battles associated with Arthur were not necessarily led by him but by the organised group of resistance he was associated with. The only things that are close to certain is that the name Arthur is derived from Latin, the period was soon after the Roman withdrawal and the areas which successfully held out against the Saxons were Wales and Cornwall. So for those who dispute the history, I would say read some books on archeology and try to grasp what the period was like. Some of the complaints I have read border on idiotic. The movie paints a more plausible picture of what could have happened than any other I have seen, and I have seen them all and read the historical sources. Gladiator was completely bunk historically but I didn't see too many complaints. And those who want to see a fairy tail type movie, well wasn't Harry Potter and lord of the Rings enough for you? If you think you can do better, make one yourself. Instead of complaining about things that you seam to not know much about use the movie as inspiration to learn what is actually known. And if you can't deal with this then maybe you should follow some other pursuit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PLOT - 8/10 They're essentially looking at archeological findings and bringing us the TRUE story of King Arthur, and not the legend that we are all familiar with. Whether or not this is true or just another Hidalgo remains to be seen.ACTING - 10/10 If there's anything Antoine Fuqua knows how to bring to the screen, it is an actor's potential. Clive Owen, Keira Knightley, Ioan Gruffud, and Stellan Skarsg?rd brought their respective characters to life beautifully.SCREENWRITING - 4/10 This is my biggest criticism. A film of this magnitude both deserves and requires a longer running time. Two hours just isn't sufficient to capture every single element we're intended to capture. Other than that, some scenes could have afforded to be shortened while others should have been elaborated upon. I am especially disheartened by the blatant underuse of Merlin. Come on, now. I know this is the "true" story behind the legend, but that doesn't take away the fact that MERLIN WAS A GREAT MAGICIAN. Okay, if you're not going to use authentic sorcery which you obviously can't use in this situation, can't he do something that makes his enemies THINK he's a sorcerer? I honestly wouldn't have cared if they let him use some sorcery (he IS a sorcerer after all), but why is it necessary to reduce his screen time? He must have had about 10 minutes on screen.DIRECTION - 6/10 I haven't seen any of Fuqua's other films, but direction-wise, he really didn't do anything special. Maybe all this time in Tarantino-land made me score this harshly. You can tell the director wasn't absent, but he obviously did very little above the bare minimum.VISUALS - 6/10 Maybe I was tired, maybe it's the fact that my eyes were irritated when I saw this, but the cinematography in this film is extremely poor. You'd expect much better cinematography from a Jerry Bruckheimer production. Even the mediocre Pearl Harbor was visually appealing. But this one hurt my eyes. Making up for the poor cinematography, nice fight scenes. Really nice battle sequences. And Keira Knightley. In a scantily clad warrior outfit. And a bow and arrow. And body paint.MUSICAL SCORE - 10/10 Nice. Really nice.OVERALL I'd be lying if I said that I didn't thoroughly enjoy this film. Yes, there was MUCH room for improvement, and it could have been MUCH better if more effort was put into the screenplay. But it is still a very enjoyable film.Quite disappointed, but all the same...THE SMITTY APPROVES. (7.3/10)</fullReview>

The research behind the film also breathes new life into the characters. The "new" history of Arthur's knights as Sarmatian warriors adds a new depth to the familiar names as Lancelot, Galahad, Gawain, and Tristan! Merlin has a wonderful new role as the leader of the Woades. The soundtrack will be collector's item, from Fenora's sweet ballad to the full orchestra's recurring theme to the sounds of the Saxon drums! Finally, Gueneviere as a Warrior is the best version yet for Arthur's future wife! ARTURIUS RULES! Clive Owen is the best Arthur yet!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you go into this film expecting to see Knights in shining armor or a love triangle b/t Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot, then perhaps you will be let down. However, If you want to see a "historical" perspective, this is the film to see! For once, we learn about the other knights, (all of whom perfectly fit their part). The battle scenes are incredible, the story is loaded with documented evidence on what was really the germ that started the legend, and you find yourself believing it more than say "First Knight". What a great blend of history, action, humor, and honor! I spent the entire film wondering exactly which knight I enjoyed the most. Dagonet with his father-like manor, Tristan quite full of indifference, Gawain and Galahad willing to do their mission even as they long to go home...the loyalty to Arthur, and Bors giving us comic relief. And Clive Owen....he puts Sean Connery to shame as a powerful King Arthur! I predict that this movie will only rise in popularity over the weeks as word of mouth spreads. I saw it with a 10, 14, and 18 year old and it appealed to all of them. By far one of the best movies I've seen this summer!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After putting off the inevitable(sp?) I finally went to view King Arthur. I was concerned because much discussion on the boards referred to the movie as butchering the myth. Leaving out the mystical/magical. It is indeed a different take on the story, and yet... I loved it!!!(spoiler maybe from here to end) Arthur's striving for something more, the mystery that drives him to love the land and its people, the drive that demands him to take a stand and be victorious in his fight for their freedom, and his victory that is used to heal the land, and unite the people so that a more utopian community can arise, comes through strongly. And to my surprise, after all the hullaballo that that arose on the boards, the story line does indeed present Arthur as Celtic, well as a Celtic/roman crossbreed. So he was a son of the land too. There are also hints of the more romanticized threads of the traditional legend....Lancelot/Gweneviere, the sword, the knights of the round table and Merlin - but their stories are sketchy backdrops. This story is more about who Arthur might be, and what he supposedly achieved, if even for a short time. The scenery, acting, fight scenes, and overall feel, I thought was awesome. The movie wasn't long enough for me - it left me wanting more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rent or buy Excalibur instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is terrible. I really wanted this movie to be fabulous. I am not one of those that is mad because I think no other King Arthur movie should be made past Excalibur.If you are in the mood for a good King Arthur movie, rent or purchase Excalibur.If anyone replies to me that this movie wasn't supposed to be Excalibur, I do realize that, but the movie still sucked.The movie is a big fight scene, a couple of little ones, 4 characters named Arthur, Gwen, Merlin, &amp; Lancealot, a sword called Excalibur, and nothing else.Practically no plot, no character development, a disgrace.If you have never seen Excalibur, and have seen this movie, please don't think all King Arthur movies are boring. There are good King Arthur movies with Excalibur being the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clive Owen is a great King Arthur!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen a movie that Clive Owen has been in before, but I'm glad I went to see this one! I love England and the legend of King Arthur, and granted this movie was a little different than what I expected, but I still enjoyed it. I read a review earlier which stated the movie should have explained why King Arthur decided to switch sides, so to speak. I understood the reasons, the Rome he had dreamed about did not exist anymore. It was not going to be allowed to exist! The movie visited his heritage, which would also explain the switch. The interaction between the knights of the round table was really funny! I'm not one for gory fight scenes, so the scenes in this movie were fine with me, any bloodier and I wouldn't have wanted to see it. I think the movie could have expanded more on the relationship between Arthur and Guinevere and her relationship with Merlin, but overall, I really enjoyed seeing Arthur in action! I'm looking forward to seeing more movies with actor Clive Owen as part of the action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An almost excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerry Bruckheimer, one of the best producers ever kind of failed on King Arthur. Yes I agree, the movie wasn't extremely good, and needed some more work, but it was so close to being one of the best historical films of all time. Right now being either Gladiator or Brave heart. If King Arthur had another 6 months work, and spent 15-20 million more, it could have easily become an Oscar winning epic. There are parts in the movie where it was detailed and good, like the intro, when Arthur gets to the city of the popes godson, and the ice scene. Those parts were very good, and Clive Owen had an excellent performance. But the whole Beginning was confusing and the final battle scene was disappointing. And to everyone who comments about King Arthur not having to do anything about the legend...no duh...the movie wasn't about the legend but about the "TRUE" story that "INSPIRED" the legend....meaning this movie has nothing to do with Camelot or Merlin's magic or any magical powers. Overall a good movie, about 7-8/10, then again, all movies have SUCKED this year, except for a few exceptions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable "alternate" storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've all heard the legendary story. This " Arthur" takes on a moredown-to-earth tone or maybe the "other side of the story." Someknown historical facts are intertwined with possible scenarios asto how and why an Arthur came to be. It is a film which focuseson loyalty, the concept of freedom, commitment, courage. (Timelytoday I would say). Battle scenes are numerous, violent and vivid,yet this is accomplished without gallons of blood coming at yourface. I found the pace of the film fine - the first half provided background . Keira Knightly appeared midf-film and was a "thinkoutside the box" character portrayal. Though liberties where takenhere, it did add a bit of "fun." Clive Owen was cast well as Arthurand his knights were human and believable. While the truthsabout this legendary king may never be fully known, perhaps it willopen the door to more research or at least imagination. I definitelyenjoyed this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historically accurate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, an Arthur story that is close to being accurate as historians can come. If you're looking for the typical Arthur story, where Guinevere cheats with Lancelot, you'll be disappointed, but if you enjoy early post Christian history and Terrific battle scenes,you'll love it. The introduction of the "Woads" or Druids is outstanding, and Guinevere as a druid was bad to the bone. True to history and great acting made for a terrific film. Not all swords and axes, there are quite a few lighthearted moments, and even the bad guys "Saxons" had their good moments. Highly Recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a different take that's still worthy of the legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's tough to think anyone could improve on the King Arthur legend but Antoine Fuqua and his crew take a noble stab at it. The story is rousing and compelling, though at times the film seems like a want-to-be "Braveheart." Still, Keira Knightley's Guinevere is a tail-kicking, warrior princess with an unbelievable aim - what's not to love about that? And Clive Owen's Arthur is more of a struggling leader with a good heart than the spectacular King we've heard so much about, giving the story more depth and credibility. We also get to know more of the knights than usual, including the hilarious Bors and young, gentle Galahad. As a huge fan of the Arthur legend and historical drama, I was completely thrilled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No resemblance to the Arthurian legends, and a poor film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd been looking forward to this 'big-budget' version of one of our best-loved 'legends', as too many earlier attempts have set it in the middle ages rather than the dark ages, and usually made in candy box style. Well at least they got the period and look more accurate, but apart from that the film was a major disappointment. I could forgive the story departing from the well known legend(s) if it had been a good one, but it bore no relation and has a paper thin plot. The dialogue was often plodding and predictable, often comic-book in its banality, and the feeble ending with it's sickly speech unforgivable. Even the set piece spectacular weren't, and the fight scenes were poorly cut.We've all seen how Hollywood has rewritten history so why should we be surprised that they've now decided to rewrite our legends - now the Knights of the Round Table are supposedly 'Samatians', from around the Ukraine area, fighting for Rome in Britain? This is one that I definitely won't be getting on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who needs fairy tales?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazingly well done piece of movie magic.I never liked the fairy tale version of King Arthur. If you enjoyed the retelling of Cinderella in Ever After ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120631/ ), then you understand King Arthur.The Guinevere of legend is not someone that I ever looked up. A woman who has her entire life defined by her ability to procreate? Finally, someone gave us a Guinevere to emulate. This version of Guinevere is an Amazon. She can stand up for herself and fight along side the men. She doesn't need to be protected by any means. When she was found in the horrific Christian dungeon, she didn't have the energy to help herself. However, she was still on guard around Arthur. He earned her trust.Thank you David Franzoni for making Guinevere into a woman.</fullReview>

I have read Entertainment weekly and the changes put on the director to make the movie different than his goal of having more history and more legend busting. He wanted an R version, but with Troy not hitting the audiences it could have, I suppose it was wiser to do this movie PG-13. I think his version will be out on DVD. So I will buy both versions. It also should have come out in August and not a week after Spiderman 2. Overall it was great story telling and worth seeing great acting and eye candy in Clive, Hugh,and Keira.

When I first saw the trailer I was excited, when I saw the other trailers, I got even more excited. Then the day finally arrived, I had some money and took me and my brother to see "King Arthur". And I'll tell you something, it was my style of movie and it was done perfectly in my opinion.The Knights were played by extremely talented actors, who all shined throughout the entire film. The music and the scenery were awesome. This movie was a treat from start to finish and I had chills on my arms from the start of the movie until about 45 minutes after it. Which hasn't happened to me since "The Last Samurai".I don't really care about "historical accuracy", I just like a great movie, and I got what I asked for and more.

		<shortDescription>Not Your Father's "Arthur"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now that I can finally see (Long story, don't ask), I ventured out into the real world and caught a new flick. How lucky was I when I strode into the theater and found myself buying a ticket to see 'King Arthur'. Now I had extremely high expectations for this film as I love medieval pieces and especially ones involving anyone from the Arthur lore. But this isn't Arthur lore; least not the type movie goers are accustomed too.Written by David Franzoni (Gladiator) and directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day), this film abandons all premonitions of what Arthur was and what he is in all our memories. They do keep some of the same, more recognizable, legends of the king. The Round Table makes an appearance but is not nearly held with as high regard as in previous legends. Also, Excalibur still sits on the hip of Arthur. But there's a different twist here. Where in other legends, Arthur was the son of a poor man who pulled the sword Excalibur from its stone, therefore establishing Divine Right for King of England; here Excalibur is his father's sword. His father is killed in battle and the young Arthur pulls the sword from his father's dead body and carries the sword since. Fuqua decides to use the same imagery as if Arthur was pulling the sword out of a stone but just the idea that Excalibur was pulled from his father's body and he has carried it ever since, establishes a little more depth to the story. And that's where most of the similarities stop. This story is based on historical finds that have been discovered recently that have not been established in other Arthurian literature or film works. Arthur is a Roman that has to serve out his duty to the Roman Empire until he realizes he is fighting for a Rome that is too idealistic to exist. Lancelot is an amazingly gifted warrior who was recruited from a young age to join the conquering Roman army to serve for 15 years. He has more of a friendship with Arthur than a king/knight relationship. Guinevere is not a princess from the neighboring France but an English born slave who is discovered and rescued by Arthur's knights. And Merlin normally considered the lovable magician is more of a rebel ghost who leads a rag tag group of English fighting the Roman Empire. So no, this is not your typical 'Arthur' movie.But what truly surprised me were not the entirely new interpretations but how well every aspect of the film was done. The cinematography was unbelievable. Most of the shots look like they could have been taken start from artist renderings of Arthurian literature. Breathtaking establishing shots of the snowy English landscape transport you back into 400 AD where nature was virtually untouched and made you wish you could visit this country on holiday. The script for the film was done very well also. There weren't those blockbuster, crappy lines that one would expect from a Bruckheimer film. There wasn't even the one liner, 'Braveheart-like' war anthem when going into battle but a very stirring speech from Clive Owen (Arthur) that made you think 'They better kick some Saxon ass.' And it was funny. Not in the modern way either but they took humor and situations from that era and made it funny to today's audience, a true accomplishment.But there are two things that make a blockbuster, period piece like this work?the battle scenes and the acting. First off, the acting was very impressive. Fuqua casted relatively unknown actors, besides Owen and Keira Knightly, to play the other pivotal parts in the film. None of the performances seemed forced and all appear to become their characters which was probably easier because they did not have to play the well known characters. These were all new interpretations of Arthur and his knights, allowing them to play the characters as they see fit. Who was impressive though was Knightly. Although I am a fan, I was even more impressed with the way she handled the role of Guinevere. Guinevere is no longer a princess who watches from the background but a warrior of Merlin who contributes greatly to the battles. Not many young, very young (19), actress today can pull off a role where you have to be a gorgeous potential Queen one minute and then a brutal warrior the next. And it was these battle scenes that made the film stand out just that much more. You have to appreciate it when directors and writers try to find new and innovative ways to have a battle scene that isn't two giant armies running at one another, swinging large weapons. 'Arthur' is one of those movies that made you believe these were how battles of that time should have been fought. And they were fun to watch.All in all, 'King Arthur' amazed me. Very rarely to I walk into a film with such high expectations that they would never be filled. Yea, 'Arthur' surpassed everything I ever imagined. It is by far the best film I have seen this year, yes even better than Spiderman in my opinion, and it will be hard to beat it in the coming months. You might not agree with my assessment of the film but hey, you're not me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the previews for King Arthur, I was very excited because I like some of the movies of this genre and I love Keira Knightley. When the movie was released, the reviews were so-so. However, I have a different opinion.Antoine Fuqua, director of Training Day and the Replacement Killers decided to tell this "historically" accurate version of the man known as "King Arthur" more through basic gestures of human emotion. I do note that the movie does have a few lag points and was in need of some better dialogue. But I think that it was brilliant and awesome all the same. It was a bit difficult to keep up with the actual plot line with all of the characters involved(as in literature each character has a story unto themselves) and the story is more focused on the actual politics behind the Roman Empire and its presence in Britain during that time in history.Clive Owen, Keira Knightley, Stellan Skarsgaard, Hugh Dancy, Ioan Gruffuld, Stephen Dillane and the rest of the cast gave great performances that were not overdone as in another Roman era movie that was released not too long ago. I enjoyed seeing the depictions of Paganism among the Knights and Merlin. That is a sentiment I don't get to see in very often in film. Yea!!As far as the technical specs of the film, Antoine Fuqua did a great job in his direction of the battle scenes and the movie in general, although the cinematography could have been a nanometer better. I give this film a full-fledged two thumbs up in enthusiastic glory!I will be buying King Arthur on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very existentialist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent all-around piece that presents the basis for the Arthurian legend we're already familiar with. Merlin as field marshall and rumored mystic. Guinevere as beguiling and charismatic warrior princess. Lancelot as noble but conflicted knight. Arthur as world-weary social crusader. The Knights of the Round Table as battle-hardened, homesick conscripts. The performances are heartfelt. Clive Owen's charisma was apparent early in his career when he delivered intense and focused performances in such films as "Close My Eyes." He would make an excellent James Bond if the franchise's producers ever made the wise decision to return the character to his roots. Lancelot, Guinevere, and the Knights are delivered in an understated manner. Particularly memorable for me was Stephen Dillane as Merlin. The film's centerpiece is a clever battle scene between the Knights (plus Guinevere) and a company of Saxon marauders on top of a frozen lake. The climactic battle scene compares favorably to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields in "Return of the King." I would have liked more exploration of the "wolds," the Pict fighters led by Merlin and Guinevere, as well as Guinevere's relation to Merlin, but time would not have permitted. I enjoyed the existentialist theme. What is a soldier's purpose amidst the endless, meaningless conflicts of a collapsing superpower? Arthur, Lancelot, and the Knights face these questions and search for their answers the only way they can. Compared to recent sword &amp; sorcery films, I'd rank this a notch or two above "The 13th Warrior," several notches above "Braveheart" and "Troy," and just under the "Lord of the Rings" films, which of course are in a class all their own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off I should say that this was the summer movie I was the most excited for. I was excited from the moment I saw the first trailer attached to Return of the King. Clive Owen is one of my favorite actors and recently I have become very attached to both Ioan Gruffudd and Hugh Dancy. By the way, in my opinion all three of them did very good jobs. I read that this movie was supposed to be R rated originally and that it was sliced up so that it would make the PG-13 cut. I think it would have been a better more sound movie as an R rating. I also hear that perhaps the DVD will restore that footage. Here's hoping this is true. However, I did enjoy the movie. I think it was filmed well. Hans Zimmer did a very nice job on the music. The battle sequences were well done, besides the chopping to satisfy the MPAA. The cast looked to have trained well and I enjoyed their swordplay, especially Lancelot with his twin swords. I think what is most necessary to enjoy this movie is to separate yourself from the original legend of King Arthur. Let it go. Think of this movie as an adaptation of a novel. The director and writers took creative license. Enjoy for what it is. A summer movie trying to entertain you. Let it do so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"King Arthur," scripted by David Franzoni ("Gladiator"), is a marvelous work indeed, especially considering the cultural poverty that Western civilization is presently undergoing. That Jerry Bruckheimer, noted for much more lightweight fare, produced it, is astonishing.In a time when movies about flesh-and-blood (as opposed to comic-book or mythological) heroes are few and far between; in an age where most moviegoers want to see films about non-descript, jaded non-entities in order to reassure themselves that "yes, life shouldn't be taken seriously" and "see, I'm not so bad after all," it is heartening to see a movie that bucks this trend with a cinematic vengeance worthy of human dignity. "Arthur" takes the myth of a well-known legend and makes it a plausible, highly-inspiring history.We are piloted into the period's atmosphere by Lancelot, who tells us that the Church is in charge of Rome and Rome of the world. Arthur is a British-born Roman citizen in charge of a crack squad of renowned fighters. He is a Christian, a follower and student of the Catholic priest Pelagius (who was condemned by the Church not of the more influential, scheming patristic, Augustine. As such, Arthur's highest concern is the freedom of the individual His men, however, are pagans of unspecified denominations.On the day they are to be relieved from the military service of Rome, Arthur and his men are given one last charge: to retrieve, from Britain, a young boy with a powerful future and to deliver him to Rome where he'll be safe.The rest, is the story.And, contrary to what virtually every reviewer I've read has written, "King Arthur" keeps and "explains" each and every aspect of the legend: Arthur's retrieval of the sword Excalibur; Lancelot's place as the King's champion who will stop at nothing to protect his Queen; etc. It's all there. Attentive minds will pick up on these things. There are also solid touches of Romanticism which enliven the story, such as its portrayal of the fact that, in real life, most of the time, men of action attract similar women and vice versa.The only downsides to the movie are the coarse jokes about unwed fatherhood and physical endowment, which should have been left out.This, ladies and gentlemen, is high-level entertainment, with superb acting, tight direction, and kick-ass fight scenes.Enjoy.9/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this a very worthy version of the Arthurian legend and don't think it suffered at all for the loss of magic. Those who need magic and wizards and coloured smoke are welcome to the Disney version. This story really looks at the roots of the legend and the treatment is plausible *and* exciting. The exit of the Romans from Britain was both dramatic and traumatic for the peoples who had been under their yoke for hundreds of years and for those waiting to sweep in and take over. Its not a story that really needs magic to work though we can all still love the magical versions. The action was near constant but there was enough of the knights as men to see what sort of people they were and to acknowledge the price they would pay to stay loyal to Arthur, their captain. The scene on the frozen lake is wonderfully filmed and Keira Knightly is simply smashing in blue. Despite an ending that is a little weak, I say ignore the critics and go see it.</fullReview>

Gone is the familiar magic and love triangle, instead replaced by a reportedly more realistic and historically accurate portrayal of Arthur and his knights.The story follows Arthur and his band of knights, out to complete one last mission for Rome before they are released from their duties to the empire. Of course, the story becomes more complex as Arthur gets involved with the Woads and their feud with the invading Saxons, but suffice it to say, this is not the Arthur that most are familiar with. All of the actors are very good in their roles, Owen giving us a more somber, brooding Arthur, a man on a mission not only for his knights and people, but for himself. Keira Knightley, portrayed as the sweet girl or damsel in distress in her other films, more than holds her own as a more intense, violent Guinevere. None of the characters are extraordinarily deep, but it is easy for the audience to connect with the ideals for which Arthur and his people fight, and the emotions the characters feel. And fight they do. The film sports some astonishing fight sequences, including a wonderful spectacle on a thin sheet of ice. As we've seen in his earlier movies, Antoine Fuqua shows an eye for visual flair in his film.As for the bad, some parts of the battle scenes are rather poorly edited, though it doesn't detract too much from the excitement. My real complaint here is the obvious pain the filmmakers went through to get a PG-13 rating. We could have been treated to a much more visceral, gritty film with an R rating, a feel I'm sure the filmmakers were going for. Unfortunately, Jerry Bruckheimer seems to think good film is made at the box office. The story, as I've said, is well worn, a story that is much more effectively presented in films like Kurosawa's Seven Samurai.In the end, for a satisfying, entertaining way to pass two hours without having to think to terribly hard, King Arthur is just what the doctor ordered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Moose Hole - Review of King Arthur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What would the summer season be without another action-packed adventure flick from Jerry Bruckheimer? Since Top Gun officially deemed him one of the leading producers in the summer of 1986 (though, to his credit, it was Beverly Hills Cop that really kicked his career into high gear), he has revved up the careers of such current super-stars as Tom Cruise (Top Gun and Days of Thunder), Will Smith (Bad Boys and Enemy of the State), Nicholas Cage (The Rock, Con-Air, and Gone in 60 Seconds), and Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor) as well as director Michael Bay, with whom he has worked with on five feature films over the years. And don't think that time has had effect on his ability to keep turning out hits, not only in the theaters but television as well, or his ability to make stars of his films into leading actors and actresses. He hopes to add Clive Owen onto his already extensive list of accomplishments in Hollywood with the historical take on the Arthurian legend.The story for this telling of the adventures of King Arthur takes away the mythological aspect and place emphasis more on the historical roots that led to the creation of the legend centuries later. Arthur is the leader of a group of loyal knights in the service of the Roman Empire and one who only wishes to finally fulfill his obligation to the Empire and return to the city of Rome to live out the rest of his life in peace. But times have changed; the once great empire that was Rome has become dangerously corrupt and now faces the threat from Barbarian tribes like the Saxons who kill anything and anyone in their way. Those Saxon tribes now have their eyes set on Britannia and Arthur, along with his knights, are sent on one last mission for Rome, which is to bring the favorite godson of the Pope of the Catholic Church to safety. But while accomplishing his final task for the Romans, the realization that the once great center of civilization is gone sets in and Arthur comes to decision that he must take up arms with his former enemies in order to unite the people of Britannia and repel the Saxon force that has invaded their homeland. The story for King Arthur seems rather lifeless and bland when one compares it to the legend on which it is based but taking it for what it is, a historically tweaked version of the story, it is at least a noble effort, if not one that comes off more mediocre then the filmmakers would want. The problem is that Hollywood is devoting too much time and effort into grand historical epics, referring to the lack-luster Troy earlier this year, when they should be putting more thought into bringing the legends to life, not through historical context but through the full-realization of the myths themselves and what they stood for those who heard them.The feature's lack of star power is not its primary draw-backs, in fact it's one of the its better assets, but rather the blame can be transfixed on the script's undeveloped and, at times, meaningless characters. Clive Owen takes his first leap onto the main stage as the historical equivalent to the legendary King Arthur, known as Arturius, and produces one of the film's best performances. Despite an exhilarating performance given by Owen, the audience is often left confused as to the just end Arthur is seeking. At one point, he fights for the Romans, but with the empire crumbling and the realization that his utopia doesn't exist, he shifts course ? if only the filmmakers informed us what that is. Obviously at the end, everything comes together and the goal Arthur was seeking becomes, but unfortunately it comes too late for us to put too much emotional investment in the film's climatic battle sequence to care all that much. Keira Knightley's role as Guinevere is another in which there is confusion placed on the movie-goers as to certain actions that are placed around her. For example, what is her exact relationship with the tribal leader Merlin? In one scene she leads Arthur into a clearing in which the tribal leaders comes out to speak to him about the invading Saxons ? Is she his daughter or just a loyal tribal follower? And what was the sole purpose of Ioan Gruffudd's Lancelot? He's suppose to be Arthur's most devoted follower but often he comes off as whiny and too much of annoyance. And is the whole Lancelot glancing at Guinvere every now and again the best the filmmakers could do into incorporating the Guinvere and Lancelot adultery aspect of the myth into this story? It's not romantic but rather creepy and flat. Overall, for those who had grown up reading about the legendary King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, the Jerry Bruckheimer spectacular may come as disappointment, not so much as to the point of echoing Warner Brothers' Troy, but rather for its less attractive approach to the legend. For the less informed individuals of this society not willing to venture to Spider-Man 2 for the twentieth time in a week, King Arthur at least offers itself as a reasonable, if not an inferior, alternative. When Jerry Bruckheimer originally envisioned the film, he had planned on a no-holds barred blood, sweat and tears aspect of the Arthurian legend but unfortunately producers must bend to the whims of their studio masters, in this case Disney (can someone just dump Eisner already?), and so the wonderfully choreographed battle sequences are toned down to the level of PG-13 audiences in order to reap in more box office coin. As one can probably guess, the film, namely its action sequences, suffer severely because of this ? perhaps if they had left out a `love scene' between Guinvere and Arthur, which, considering their ages (Knightly ? 19, Owen ? 39), comes off as more disturbing then anything else, and the language had been toned down a bit, certain sequences could have been saved. Don't get the idea that the film's an utter mess; it's actually quite decent if one understands the historical context in which the film is placed and isn't expecting something on the level of Gladiator but more along the lines of the usual Bruckheimer diversion. It's definitely a disappointment considering the amount of marketing blitz Arthur has been given and Bruckheimer's 2003 summer hit, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, but if one goes in looking for a simple diversion for the summer, then you won't come out demanding your money back at least.My Rating: *** ? out of 5 (Grade: C+)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been a great many historical war epics in the history of cinema. A lot have come in what i consider the modern era (1980-present). In the modern era, they range from the great with Braveheart, and the outright terrible and disappointing with Troy.On the Braveheart side, we get King Arthur. It's not a great film. The acting is better than average, the fight sequences are great. But the story brings it down.Antoine Fuqua makes a great directorial effort. And you completely forget that this is the same man that directed the corrupt-cop drama Training Day.Clive Owen, Keira Knightly, Stellan Skarsgard, Ioan Gruffudd, Ray Winstone, and Stephen Dillane turn out great performances. I believe all of them in their respective characters. Now the downfall of the movie. The story. They present it as fact. I don't know how much of it is historical fact. What they do, is present the Myth of Arthur in a historical manner. They strip away the mythical, the romantic, the fairy tale aspects of the legend of Arthur, and present it in a very real way. I applaud them for that. But it's a slow moving story. They needed to keep the pace and flow up. In a war epic, I don't want a slow moving story. I want to get the action, get the character's inner turmoil, get the character relationships, and i want it now. And that's not what they did. I'm not saying that it should have been shortened, but it should have been sped up.Like i said, great acting, great direction, good, if not slow, story.In the end, i give it a 7.5/10</fullReview>

The acting jobs are amazing. Clive Owen does an amazing and quite emotional job as Arthur, Keira Knightly is very intriguing and mysterious, and conveys the character well. Ioan Gruffudd also does a very good job with great facial expressions and amazing voice talent. Others were also very good...but these, of course really stood out. If you're looking for a very well done movie with great acting jobs, please go see it.But keep this in mind...don't base it on other movies. Think of it as it's own independent movie. Because in that aspect, you'll find it to be very enjoyable.</fullReview>

Some characters had the same names as the tale of Arthur (and one character had the name of a completely different celtic tale). I understand that they state in the beginning that historians have learned something different. Decided to translate Le Morte d'Arthur differently? Make up a new one? It was a nice portrayal of the time period. The costumes were pretty good and I like the Britons war paint. Great war scenes. The main actor could have learned some different facial expressions. Overall, good saxon war movie but should have been called Saxons! without any correlation to Arthur.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a worth while movie to watch. However there was certainly room for improvement. Some aspects were a bit over the top and I am not talking about the action sequences.Even the music was a little too modern. It would have been nice if it had been more true to the period.Yet this is a great film, although I would say it is not a must see before you die type movie.Great actors not bad performances by them, but certainly not their best and they could have given it a little bit more in terms of being convincing.The best actor for me was Keira Knightley! She was amazing and totally owned in this movie as Guinevere. Most believable as a warrior in the battle scenes as well. Basically all round best actor in film for me.Excalibur sword was a let down. The legend of the real sword states it was so powerful and Holy it could cut through anything! When it was swung at a target, the atoms of whatever the target's material was, would open up milliseconds before the blade made impact. That is why it is said, that no blood was ever spilt on the blade.Supposedly an Angel came out of a lake and took the blade back to heaven, when there was no longer a person left righteous enough to wield it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those of us who have read and seen the Arthurian legends based on Morte de Arthur, this is a fascinating look into the possible beginnings of the legend. Since Bruckeimer is producing and Fuqua is directing, the film is filled with fantastic battles and gore, but the plot is solid and the acting is superb. Clive Owen and Iaon Gruffudd (Mr. Fantastic) show incredible insight into their roles, building strong characters for us to consider, as do the remainder of the cast. Kiera Knightly is exceptional in role of Guinevere, the Wode "princess" rescued from the Roman torture chamber. Stephen Dillane is fascinating as Merlin, the guerrilla leader of the Wodes and Guinevere's father. Stellan Skarsgard as the Saxon king is dark and determined, and you get the impression of three distinctly different cultures who have come to that place in history where the world will change. Overall, the film is a stand alone historical perspective with only one tastefully done (and wholly unnecessary) sex scene. Rated R for the gore and violence, and some language, this film will probably not offend teens who play video games with violent content. The little ones should be asleep before you slip this one in the player. Collectible for the history buffs, or for anyone who enjoys Bruckheimer's work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give this film - '7' Knights...I am the extra 1 Tremendous film making, film making working its wondrous best. From the look of the film, the language of the camera, to the fantastic story, to the mesmerizing performances, simply powerful and setting the bench high.There might be those detractors out there that want to say that this is not depicting history in its truth. King Arthur has never really been about truth, but this film works to cast a spell over this myth and conjur up a gritty piece of hard realism - and succeeds.But...there is also still Merlin on the flanks. What in God's name is he up to? The look and tone of the film is magical. You will love the changing colours, the transforming landscapes, the emblazing battle scenes. I have used the word "realism" to describe, let's say, the "tone" of this film - but now that I wonder upon the movie, it is something quite un-realistic, and i'll leave the viewer to think more anon on this point.The performances within the screen space are enough to make the hairs prick and fear to the needle point. Stellan, Griffud, Owen, and sweet Jesus, who could forget Kiera Knightly ? YES.Watch this film... in my opinion, there is more than meets the eye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly underrated, solid movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie. If you're the sort of stuck-up, self-important dweeb who thinks the point of film is to educate the public about facts, then you won't love it. If you enjoy dramatic, epic action movies that are a little cliché, you might.Arthur in this movie is almost believable in his unfailing virtue. Clive Owen does what he can with some cheesy lines; in some places delivery is a little square, but in many others it's admirable. Keira Knightley is about as "Natalie Portman" in her acting as usual, but she isn't a major part of the movie, really. Lancelot is exceptionally passionate - probably the most convincing character of all.The minor characters get a lot of air time - both the Saxons and the Britons. In some ways this detracts from the story, but in other ways it adds, since most or all of the actors are little-known. The Saxons are kind of dumb-seeming, but it fits their brutish character; Merlin in this movie is way more intimidating than any wizard could have been; the Romans are self-righteous and indignant.The music, by Hans Zimmer, is gorgeous - of comparable quality to Gladiator and POTC:DMC. The visual experience of the film almost made me believe the characters who said wintry Britain was beautiful. All in all I find this definitely entertaining.Letting factual accuracy get in the way of your enjoyment of movies is just denying yourself some of the best that are out there. They are, after all, fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like the Round Table - wooden, with a big hole in the middle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People usually complain about plot holes and inaccuracies in movies when the story fails to engage them. In King Arthur the story is confused, weak and broken, and enjoyment is so thin on the foggy, boggy ground that picking holes or spotting clichés once the battle scenes pall is often the only fun to be had.The 'history' in this movie is a clunking sideshow, that fails to compensate for the absence of character conflict, or motivate the characters in any believable way. It simply doesn't raise the personal stakes high enough for Arthur, Lancelot or Guinevere, who don't seem to need each other beyond the odd fumble. Casablanca - you know, the one with three people caught up in a WWII love triangle - it ain't. Your only reason for identifying with a character here is because you're fond of the actor. Me, I think Clive Owen's acting wouldn't have worried Elvis Presley. Even dead Elvis.The low point is Clive trying with his school-play voice to render a so-pale-as-to-be-transparent imitation of Henry V's 'St. Crispian's Day' Agincourt speech, before the Magnificent Five or Six take on the massed ranks of the Irish extras, sorry Saxons, who do their very best to commit mass suicide before hand-to-hand stage combat takes place. Oh yes, those Romans taught the Brits the technology of war well. I think I've worked out why Clive Owen annoys me so much; the dirtier his face gets in the course of his action movies, the more his expression resembles Chicken George (see Robert Downey in Tropic Thunder). He tries to look tragic and moody, but it's more like somebody stole his shiny new mouth organ. And he does it every time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Real Star Of 'King Arthur'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'King Arthur' finds producer Jerry Bruckheimer labouring uncertainly in the territory previously occupied by 'Gladiator' and 'Lord of the Rings'. Like Gladiator, King Arthur takes a genuine historical situation and invokes moral outrage over it. In Gladiator, it was slavery and the coercion of men into killing each other in the arena; here, it's the press ganging of conquered citizens into the Roman army. From Lord of the Rings, King Arthur takes it's small group of heroes bound together by fraternal loyalty. It also determinedly avoids the familiar elements of the King Arthur story, so that there's no Camelot, no Lady in the Lake, no round table. Merlin and Guinivere are 'wodes', an otherworldly people who live in the English woodland; Arthur and Merlin rarely meet and when they do they don't like each other. The staple elements of the Holy Grail and Guinivere's infidelity are nowhere to be seen. Instead we have Arthur and his loyal subordinates risking their lives on what appears to be a waste of time conflict with some invading Saxons.It's hard to imagine this film getting made without the muscle of Jerry Bruckheimer behind it. Antoine Fuqua, who directed the very urban 'Training Day', silhouettes his actors against cloudy skies and you can almost smell the rubber tyres which must have been burning just off camera to create the affect. The characters do some illogical things too - why, for example, does Dagonet act suicidally during a battle in which the knights have the upper hand? The supporting actors are generally fine, but Ray Winstone and Stellan Skarsgaard are both cast so close to type that they virtually disappear off the screen. Only Ioan Gruffudd gives an actual performance, and like everyone else, he's hampered by the unspeakable dialogue.The real star of this film, though, is Clive Owen's dentist. In every scene, Owen's gleaming porcelain dentures yank us out of the film and into the 21st century, reminding us we're watching an English actor in the process of crossing over to Hollywood, rather than a historical figure. And it's not just his teeth which are unconvincing, every other inch of him is too. The lack of conviction with which he speaks his lines has to be seen to be believed, so much so that you may doubt your own sanity when you hear him speak the devastating line 'Prepare for combat'. Jerry Bruckheimer may have got this film made, but it might have been for the best if he hadn't.</fullReview>

It may just be because Clive Owens is my favorite actor, but everything about this movie(I thought) was great. Even though it was based off of the "Historical" Arthur, they still had elements from the mythological one. The rivalry between Sir Gawaine and Sir Launcelot, Launcelot was a womanizer, Launcelot and Guinevere loved each other even though Guinever and Arthur were "a pair," even Tristram with his hawk, it was still the mythological King Arthur with a more "historical" twist. The battle between the Saxon's and King Arthur's Knights/The British was great! I mean, I was actually sad when Tristram and Launcelot were killed. It may just be me because I've always loved anything that is King Arthur related, but I thought the directing, the acting, the plot, everything was great about this movie. Two thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Arthur (Clive Owen) and his knights have been fighting battles for the Roman Empire for quite awhile. Their true freedom from the empire rests on one last mission. They must rescue some Roman citizens, including a priest, who reside in a territory that is being invaded by others. They accept the dangerous mission. Along the way, Arthur gains help from a warrior princess, Guinevere, and her people. The two fall in love but it is a fierce struggle to defeat the enemies. Who will emerge victorious? This is a wonderful look at the man behind the thousands of legends. Arthur is a great warrior, yes, even without the Camelot mystique, and Owen embodies this part like no one else could. Keira Knightley, as Guinevere, also fills her role well, even when she breaks down stereotypes and emerges as a fierce and brave fighter who stood beside Arthur on the battlefields. The other actors do very well in giving their mythical roles a human side. The battles are quite brutal, so the faint of heart may have to look away from the screen from time to time. The settings and recreation of a medieval world are superb. If you want to watch a historical movie on a grand, grand scale, start with this one. It will reign as the definitive King Arthur for decades to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dismissed this movie from the first commercial trailer I saw in 2004. I rolled my eyes and figured it was some awful retelling of the King Arthur legend reminiscent of First Knight. Well, two years after its release, I idly borrowed a copy of the director's cut and was surprised to find it was nothing like I expected.This movie takes more of a historical bent and, while I cannot attest to the accuracy, it was a decidedly refreshing perspective. The history of the knights was quite different.The legend of Arthur has been told from so many different slants: from weak ruler and cuckolded husband to romantic, noble King, to historical war leader, that this movie is nice to throw into the mix. Sure, there are moments you'll question, but they're easily overlooked by the end of the movie.P.S. I prefer the alternate ending in the director's cut!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After I've read the comments about the bad accuracy with history and places, if there is any accuracy at all, I still love the movie. The story itself really has almost nothing to do with the original King Arthur story, but, as a totally different story, it's great. The battles were good (especially if you compare them with the scenes in Alexander the Great...), the horses were majestic, especially if you're a horse lover like myself, and the Knights... Great. Mmmm... I can almost taste them :). Can't forget about the music. The "We will go home" song nearly made my poor longing-for-freedom heart crying. The iced lake and snow-covered mountains in Britain is a funny thing when you think about it, but who said the movie has to be dependent on places?People should forget about the actual history facts when watching a movie, and enjoy in it. I did and it was a pleasure to watch the movie even the second, and the third time as well.</fullReview>

The fight on ice was the best the graphics were really good, the soundtrack also is awesome. Obviously it would be good it was from the same director as pirates of the Caribbean!!! The whole film was filmed in Ireland which was a great choice i thought cause it is a beautiful country and there were loads of people also i really liked the clothes they wore they were awesome!!! Clive Owen was a very good Arthur, Keira Knightley was a good Guinevere an Ioan Gruffudd was a good Lancelot shame he had 2 die !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, let me start by saying that Keira Knightley is my LEAST favorite actress of all time. Despite her terrible-as-always performance, I adored this film. The locations were perfect and breathtaking. Also, the knights had a really believable, almost symbiotic, relationship that I found quite endearing. Mads Mikkelsen as Tristan made this film worth watching. Whenever he was off-screen, I found myself waiting for him to appear again. Ioan Gruffud also does a really nice job as Lancelot, although Clive Owen bogs every scene down with his wooden acting.The script is really original, as far as I'm concerned, although the Guinevere subplot seemed too obligatory. Like they only put it in there because they had too. Plus, what the bloody hell was she wearing at Badon Hill? Are they going to an S&amp;M party after the battle?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone who grew up on the more romantic King Arthur stories, I kind of liked this alternate slant on what the legend is based on. Obviously no one knows what the real story is, but I kind of like the idea of trying to frame it within the context of historical happenings. Not necessarily facts, just what was going on at the time and how the legend might have arisen. This movie definitely made me do some research on Sarmatia and see how "accurate" the writer tried to be. It is an entertaining movie if you let it play. I do believe the "knights" steal the show. They are the entertainment both comic and action. I thought it was a great 2 hour plus ride. Sometimes you have to let the less than stellar acting slide and enjoy the ideas.

		<fullReview>I may start saying that it's one of my favorite movie. It's unbelievable. The scenario is extraordinary, all the emotions, the story around the religion, everything is almost perfect, the director didn't leave anything behind. The faith shown by the character of King Arthur as well as Guinevere is touching. I definitely recommend this title. The length is perfect, not too short but at the same time not too long. Is also amazing to compare and contrast this movie with the ones before telling the same story. This is the first one to tell the true story, or at least one that looks like so. All the others were no more than legends. In addition to all the things mentioned, I think that the romance between Arthur and Guinevere is very sweet. She is so beautiful that she seems to be from other world. No more words to describe the way i feel about this movie. It'll last forever!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Arthur was a very entertaining movie. It had lots of action and a new twist on the Knights of the Round Table story. Sure, it wasn't historically accurate, but it's a MOVIE not a DOCUMENTARY of a LEGEND. Just watch it for what it is and you'll be very satisfied. People need to understand the term dramatic license. Who knows what the real story behind Arthur is and who cares? I liked the characters, the dialog, and the fact that Marian is a strong female heroine. The action and battle scenes were very entertaining as well. It was my first chance to see a lot of these actors, led by Clive Owen, and I am very pleased by all of their performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Word:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have read most of the comments on how bad King Arthur is and have not seen if for yourself then READ THIS ONE.King Arthur Movie: When I first saw it I cared nothing for the historical facts. Yes its dates were out, would you feel better if they didn't put a date in at all? Woads are Picts, Picts are Woads, they got that name for the blue plant they marked themselves in (it was called Woad) we in fact use to use woad to dye our jeans blue (many years ago). I loved the battle-scenes, the humour (what there was of it) and every surviving knight at the table. King Arthur was a very entertaining movie and quite a gruff, gritty and manly one at that. The knights weren't squeaky clean (which I hate in historic movies) Merlin was not magical (which is more believable). The only problems I find in the movie -as an entertaining sit down (which IS what a movie is, this is not a documentary)- was Guieneve's accent (too posh and clean for a woad) and in fact anything with her in it, she seemed to die the movie down from Rough, Grr Grr type to love, romance and mush. When she did fight in the end it was better because she lost the damsel in distress and became a grr-grr like the knights but her outfit TERRIBLE cover her up! I know they used to run naked but they gave her a "whorish" appearance. She was much too clean throughout the entire film even with the gritty woad attire.Other than her entire character (not Kiera, she is a fantastic woman this just was the makers of the characters fault) the movie was in my opinion better than Merlin and far better than a book. So if you want action, romance, sexy knights, gritty battle scenes, sad endings (well sorta) amazing horses, beautiful costumes and superb acting then King Arthur is for you! Tiffany</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually think this film is quite good, yes Clive Owen is wooden, but the rest of the actors are good. Lancelot - Ioan Gruffudd gives many good performances, including his speech in to Arthur and the way he speaks of his homeland.Okay the voices seem a bit wrong though, Keira Knightly with her upper class drawl brings the film's believability right down, along with Aussie actor Joel Edgerton, who for some bizarre reason uses an Irish accent. But the photography and CGI is good and the fight scenes make up for the more poorly acted parts. Ray Winstone - Bors, also gives a good performance and I feel Mads Mikkelson is well suited to the role of Tristan. However the other knights are less than distinguishable and Galahad and Gawain keep getting mixed up.Also in the final battle, a brilliant fight scene, why is Keira Knightly wearing what seems to be just two belts? Overall this is an enjoyable film, if not historically correct.</fullReview>

There is no denying she is lovely but she overacts in every scene and what it that thing she keeps doing with her chin? God it was so distracting and annoying! Every time she was on screen I ended up staring at her weird jaw movements, she was just plain terrible, there was nothing convincing about her performance. ( I did like her in Pirates) With that exception I found the rest of the cast to be convincing and Clive Owen most compelling as Arthur. jmho</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A taste if life in the dark ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that the most misleading part of this movie is the title. Most people watching this will be expecting yet another rendition of the familiar tale of King Arthur, Camelot and the knights of the round table. The characters are all there but the story is completely different. If you want a beautiful story of Knights in shining armor, Chivalry and gleaming castles, this is not for you. However I found it to be a refreshing look at a period of time that is very seldom depicted in movies. As for being 100% historically accurate, it is probably not. If you want that then better watch the History channel.I found the depictions of the Saxons and Woags especially interesting. The saxon commander was almost devoid of emotion. His campaign was simply that, a job that needed to be doing. Cruelty and death were a part of the campaign, but nothing to be worried about. The woags (I would assume that these are actually Celts or Picts) were depicted as wild eyed naked yet noble savages. An attempt to portray their language was absolutely haunting.As for Arthur and his knights, they were depicted as what they were; forced conscripts into roman service from conquered Barbarian territories. Each had his own personality and style.Most of what you will bring out of this movie is a feeling for the rugged uncomfortable, dirty times of the period known as the dark ages. It was not a fun time to be alive and I think this movie depicts that very well. Other comments refer to the negative treatment of Christianity and Christians by the knights. Remember, at this time Christianity had not spread world wide. These knights would not have come from Christian lands and thus would not have been born Christian. As is common throughout history, unscrupulous people used religion as a way to assert authority over others.</fullReview>

The score in this movie was well written, Hans Zimmer did a fantastic job. Not only was the lead well acted, but most supporting parts were well done, making the movie all that much better. I enjoyed the close-ups, and enjoyed that they were not overused. I would gladly see this movie again. This movie is great for fans of movies like The Patriot, which also had plenty of gore. Because of some sexuality, one scene, this movie is best for those of ages 13 and over. Some dry parts slow down the momentum of the movie, but overall it is well written.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"King Arthur" with Clive Owen is a fascinating movie. There is a solid plot with fine acting, good directing, and lots of great action. I think this film was very unfairly underrated by critics, and moviegoers didn't give it much of a chance. Maybe that was because it's an unusual take on the Arthur legend? Too gritty and medieval for everybody? Too bad, because it's terrific and compelling in many ways, with a strange mystique all its own. I was really glad to view the DVD to get a closer look at the story as well as see some background on the screenplay and the making of the film. I have only one big concern: the alternate ending provided on the DVD is a huge improvement all around to the theater release. In my opinion, a much more compelling ending and a way better fit than the one shown in theaters. Why was it changed?! That would be a good story to hear about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not Camelot, not Excalibur, and definitely not Monty Python and The Holy Grail.Purists will object to the either the diversion from the beloved legend or the propounding of a recently advanced (and much disputed) scholarly theory on the origin of the legend.Since it is a legend we are dealing with here, the movie makers are free to put a spin on the story. The familiar names are all there - but some suspension of disbelief is necessary to enjoy the movie.And enjoy it I did, despite the fact that I have a degree in history with a focus on English Medieval History. I know the facts, I know the theories, but this movie was a very watchable exercise in "what if" with some exciting action scenes and a twist of an ending.And the movie made me interested in learning more about the new theory it propounds, as well as revisiting other bits of history (for instance, the Pelagian Heresy) that are mentioned in passing.I was given this movie for Christmas and will probably watch it again, as well as lend it to my friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action film is better in the directors cut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I originally saw this film when it first came out and was very annoyed that this was suppose to be a historical Arthur. While it maybe historically "right" to the period its not like any of the supposed real histories of Arthur that have been popping up other than Arthur is really a general and not a king. I suspected that on a second viewing, preferably of the directors cut I would like it more.Well I just finished the directors cut on DVD and I was right this is a better film. Apparently in addition to blood and violence there was some changing of scenes and for me it works so much better. I don't know what was added or changed, but what ever it was this was the version that should have been released to theaters.The plot has Arthur and his knights going on one last mission for the Romans who are rapidly pulling out of Britian. In the process they find that they've been lied to about any number of things and and they discover what it is they believe in. Its not that syrupy but underneath the heads and arms being hacked off thats what its all about.If you like action, see this movie. If you were disappointed like me in the theatrical release see it again, only make sure its the directors cut.A good meaty action film that makes popcorn eating fun again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented Paparazzi, which looked like the potential for it to suck was pretty high, so I got King Arthur just to have something to fall back on. Besides, I have been meaning to see it for months, since I never got around to seeing it in the theaters. As it turns out, I was completely wrong. Paparazzi was outstanding, it was King Arthur with all the suck potential. The movie bills itself as the truth behind the legend of King Arthur's knights, which should have been a warning sign to me because Hollywood is not exactly who you want to turn to for the truth behind stories and legends that are centuries old. And after watching the movie, I am reminded of a possible truth of King Arthur that I actually learned in a historical literature class at the University level, which was that there was more than likely not literally a "round table" involved. This movie disagrees.A big step that the movie makes in trying to live up to its promise of providing the reality behind the legend is that Guinevere and Lancelot are not lovers, they just flirt a lot. Lancelot is far too loyal to Arthur, whom he serves and who IS Guinevere's lover. I guess the fact that a Hollywood movie that has two sexy actors of the opposite sex not ending up together at the end of the movie is a good way to give the illusion of reality. By the way, I say illusion based on my immense doubt that the movie really has much to say about the reality behind the legend of King Arthur, not because of any deep knowledge on the subject myself.If you want an interesting story about the time of King Arthur, Mark Twain wrote an outstanding book called "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court," and I very highly recommend it. It is incredibly well written and is a fascinating story, and probably involves more truth about the legend, even though it contains a bit of time travel. Merlin is even more different than his legend in that book than Arthur. Twain actually makes him a villain in his book, which threw me off because my previous knowledge of the legend came mostly from The Sword in the Stone, one of my all time favorite movies.I have to say that I was impressed with Keira Knightly's performance, although under certain conditions. I loved her performance, but her part was badly written. She is given cheesy lines but delivers them as well as they could have been delivered, and here's the even weirder part, I liked her better in this movie than I did in Pirates of the Caribbean, although I liked Pirates of the Caribbean much more than King Arthur. This is also one of those times that I have to disagree strongly with the critics, who compare it to "last summer's disappointment" (London Times Online) or "the flat out silly" (Roger Ebert) Troy. I liked Troy. Maybe I should acknowledge that it's possible that I don't know what I'm talking about.Nah.The climactic scenes of the movie involve lots of stabbings and swordplay and skewering and whatnot, reminding me that I'm really getting tired of these epic battle scenes. They blew me away in Braveheart, but have become so commonplace that they become tiresome to watch because I've seen it all so many times before. At the very least, they really tried to keep the digital effects to a minimum with the battle scenes, which I appreciate. And here's another odd thing, minimizing digital effects was certainly not a priority in Troy, and I liked that movie much better. I think that the small fights were so good that I was able to forgive the tedious digital battles.For a Hollywood Arthur, Clive Owen delivers a fine performance. He looks the part and he is one of the relatively few characters in the film who doesn't have an accent that is wildly out of place and time. James Bernardelli points out that the legend of King Arthur is one of the most enduring stories in all of European culture, a statement with which I whole-heartedly agree (which is also significant because I usually have the exact opposite opinion as he does about movies). And given that, it is hard to believe that what is presented in this movie is what grew into that legend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film overall. I know that a lot of people see the name Bruckheimer and they immediately have preconceived notions as to big over-the-top explosions and action sequences combined with a poorly written plot. Well, I am happy to say that King Arthur was much better than the critics will lead you to believe.The film takes a more realistic approach to the story/legend than maybe what has been seen in the past (ie. First Knight and obviously Sword in the Stone). Gone are the flowing robes and clean faces of the actors that play Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere. In their place is grit and dirt, sweat and blood. I think that's one of the strenghts of the film in not sugar-coating the "history" behind the story. The battle sequences remind me of Braveheart (but then again what sword and shield action/drama doesn't these days) and Arthur is written as a true hero. Maybe that's why the critics hated it so much, because Arthur was portrayed as a true, courageous hero who gets things done and not a weak, unassuming husband who has no idea Lancelot is getting it on with his wife.I liked this version and found myself drawn in. If I had a critique, the director's cut runs a bit too long (two hours and twenty minutes) and the cinematography in the final battle sequence was a bit too obscure and tightly framed, while all the previous battles are beautifully shot.Maybe it's not the true story and maybe it's not the most historically accurate, but it is definitely entertaining and in some places, an inspiring piece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incredibly poor character development is the main problem (you just don't connect with or care about any of the characters, and I even had trouble telling some of them apart!). Too much smiting (with all too obvious spurting fake blood bags) not enough plot development. Obviously made to try and cash in on the Lord of the Rings success. Obvious improbabilities: in an early scene the gates through Hadrian's Wall take about 6 draughthorses to open, but when the invading Saxons arrive later the said gates are flapping in the wind but then mysteriously close (without 6 draughthorses handy) and you are asked to believe that Britons and Romano-Britons instantly make a truce (after smiting each other for some time) when faced with Saxons. Even as an attempt to "demystify" Arthur this fails: if they are trying to show it how it might have been, then how come the french 15th century names from the Arthur legend - Lancelot and Guinevere -(nothing to do with early Britain) - are being used in the movie? This is just crap, and not even worth renting. How Ionn Gryffud ended up in this is beyond me (must've been desperate for work).</fullReview>

Uther Pengragon has now become a Roman and at the end of the film decides that he will be a king - where did that come from? The film tries to maintain an air of mystery throughout but this just serves to confuse the plot (Merlin's visit to Arthur a case in point) The film is rather disjointed has relatively poor dialogue yet the cinematography and the lovely Keira Knightley make it bearable. There is a particularly wooden performance from Arthur to whom every line appears to be a war winning speech. At the end you're left feeling a little cheated. So much more could have been done with a film of this scale.Disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Too bad this wasn't called KING ALFRED or KING ALRIC or KING GEORGE THE HUMANE or almost anything but KING ARTHUR. Then I could have bought it. But KING ARTHUR? Uh-uh. It has nothing to do with the legend we all know and love, the first (and admittedly fictional) King of England as immortalized by Mallory and White and in previous movies like CAMELOT, KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE and Excalibur. It also is a bit confusing, trying to keep straight who's who and what's what. Apparently, Arthur and his knights are Dalmations (Sarmations in the movie, but I prefer the word Dalmation) who have been raised and trained by the Romans to do their bidding, even if it means slaughtering their own people. The Dalmations go around in the movie dressed as Roman soldiers, even though Arthur refers to them as knights. A group of blue-faced woodsmen (never named, so we shall call them Picts or Merlin's men, since they are led by a hairy, unkempt woodsman named Merlin) basically hide in the forest from Arthur and the Romans. Yet another group, the Saxons, are on the hunt against Arthur and the Romans. They appear to be bloodthirsty Berserkers, or Vikings, which I doubt is historically accurate. Someone who knows more about this stuff than I told me Saxons may have been of Norse origin but they were not ax-wielding savages. They simply were looking to find their place in a land of immigrants. Eventually, the Romans abandon Britain while Arthur and his crew, along with the blue-faced boobies -- I mean Picts -- defeat the Saxons in a bloody if confusing battle that is no match for a similar showdown in the recent TROY, where the Spartans, Greeks and Trojans have at it. Arthur himself is badly acted by Clive Owen, an angular-faced, hoarse-voiced British actor relatively unknown here but whose name was briefly bandied about as the next James Bond. Gueneviere is played by Keira Knightley, the Natalie Portman-lookalike who costarred in PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, and is portrayed here as a blue-faced warrior princess. She kills with the best of them. Knightley's awful in the role, through no real fault of her own, I suspect. It's the script. To give her credit, she is nearly naked in parts of this movie and that makes up for much. Lancelot is played by some forgettable Brit actor. The CGI is unimpressive, and the battle scenes are few and far between. This looks to have been shot on a fairly tight budget. TROY does a not-dissimilar plot much better, and was shot on a much larger budget. If you have to pick one, see TROY instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Welllllll.....what was this one about.....King Arthur but set in the 400's, late Roman times, and it's against a Saxon invasion while trying to help the last of the Romans pull outta the UK. That and the Picts (Woads here) being portrayed as Cherokees more or less.I donno how much to fault this movie for-okay the whole Ice battle scene is goofy, the let's run thru the wall and shut the door behind us bit is silly, you donno one knight from the next, and they totally leave Camelot itself outta the mix-but okay, if it's a Bruckheimer take of the old legends ya want--this gives it to ya in spades.Crewcut Knight #2 is kinda fun to watch, you like Lungealots' twin sword routines, Keira is alright as an archer chick, while Clive Owen more or less acts ala Jonathon Frakes in the Trek series...woodenly and not very well.This was a surprise for me too. I thought he would be better, he does have the look etc for the Arthur role. Starsgard shambles around ala Nick Nolte, doesn't have much to do besides stab people and look menacing. The same goes for his army. They don't really DO much, ya know? Fight scenes are good, yes. They did get the Gladiator look down and I am sure that if the actual plotting and writing had been up to par w/ the production values--you would have had another Gladiator.As it is, I think its fine for what it is, good B movie flick ala Errol Flynn or someone like that in the 40's.**1/2 outta ****--def. not Braveheart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Action, Bad "History"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To really enjoy this movie, you have move beyond the obvious.Within in the first 10 mins, I was disappointed. The chronology is a joke. And the set up of the major characters is laughable.Since when are Arthur and Lancelot the same age? And the 15yrs later thing would make Arthur around 25, 27 at the very most (given the approx age of the kid in the beginning). Clive Owen is young looking for his age (I guess), but c'mon.!!! And didn't Romans require 20-25 years of service? Needless to say, as a retelling of the Arthurian myth, this movie is substandard.This has nothing to do with Arthur as Roman. It's about trying to mesh that early 5th century myth with the Medieval French details. "Lancelot", "Dagonet", etc...Those names just scream medieval French.Guinevere's character came across as an after-thought and frankly, could have been left out completely. Especially given Knightley's lack of chemistry with the two male leads.HOWEVER....If you look at this movie as telling a story of men caught between honor, duty, loyalty, friendship and the longing to be "free" and finding their place, this is a great movie.Others have described the main performances as wooden and lacking emotion. But given that these are men who have spent 15+ years killing other men up close and personal, as their duty - Men taken from their homes as children and taught to kill - How much emotion can we expect? I saw this lack of emotion as men who had grown used to distancing themselves from the world around them. And who had become just plain tired of the killing (obvious in their longing to be free).Clive Owen played this brilliantly. Every so often there's a glimpse of the turmoil beneath and we watch as he struggles to bring it under control.Watch the actors and their faces. It is the subtleties of their performances that provide the passion and make this movie. Moreover, even these "good guys" aren't so black and white. And that makes them all the more believable.This is an action movie first and foremost, and one of the best kind. NOT a "history". (good thing there isn't much dialogue, cuz the script sucks big time.) Overall, one I will add to my collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historical Accuracy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot believe some people have such an issue with "historical accuracy" in a film based on myth and legend. King Arthur and his knights never existed in and of themselves. They are based on several historical figures from several different time periods. Enjoy this movie for what it is. One person presenting an interesting, though different, interpretation of a myth. I like this movie. I haven't seen Troy or Alexander so I'm not comparing with them. I like it for what it is, a good adventure movie. Perhaps in Hollywood these days it's not possible to be entirely accurate regarding history. I love historical fiction and in my opinion that is what this version of King Arthur is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Advance review of the DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been able to see an advance copy of the DVD, Fuqua's director's cut. I feel this version, his original vision, is much better than the original release. Touchstone/Disney insisted on his cleaning up the violence in the battles, giving it a fairy-tale ending (the wedding) and other PG fixes. Fuqua's audio commentary is extremely frank in discussing this, as well as offering insights on how/why he made the choices he did. The DVD also shows his original ending, which I found far more subtle and less obvious ("on the nose," as we say in the business). Other extras include a 17-minute "Making of" featurette, which is interesting and informative and a round-table discussion with Knightley, Owen, Dancy, Gryffudd, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, writer David Franzoni and director Anthony Fuqua. On the whole, I think this one is a worthwhile buy. I understand it will be available Dec. 5.</fullReview>

Clive Owen and Ioan Gruffudd were brilliant, the friendship between their characters shone through and i thought it was the best part. The battle scenes were amazing with toughing loyalty towards Arthur from his knights. This film gives an alternate point of view of the tale of Arthur and his Knights and is the best i have seen. This film is one of the best i have seen this year even though it is till approaching Christmas and is a blockbuster in my eyes.All in all a brilliant film that i could watch over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Battles - a Great Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clive makes a good Arthur. Keira makes a great Guinevere. The supporting knights are great - different, funny and strong. The script is not spectacular, but it works well. The movie is great, but do not expect it to be 100% fact and do not expect the standard Arthur legends to be told - or told in the same old way. I like that! Arturius - the leader of the Samarian Knights defending the Roman empire in the 'British' frontier just south of Hadrian's Wall. The movie does seem like it could be true. I think it is cool that this shows Arthur wearing Roman armor. Some say it is 1st Century vintage and this could be accurate, but it does give the proper impression. Roman did rule much of Britain and the Saxons were invading.The fighting was great and the story was excellent. This is how Arthur became King - or one possible way this could have happened - based on historical facts. This is not Le Morte de Arthur (the death of Arthur). I am sure the studio took some license to fill out the details and add some depth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great look at a "non-fairytale" Arthur and his Knights.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After recently viewing this movie I can simply say that this feature is by far a great look at a "non-fairytale" version of Arthur and his Knights. Although more battle action could have been of good use, that is not what the story of Arthur and his Knights are truly about. I would have personally liked to have seen a longer feature giving insight into the pasts of his knights as well as his love Guinevere, along with Merlin himself, although I think this portrayal is very "real". It doesn't have the glitz and glamor of cgi or anything alike, just a realistic story line into a fabled legend. I believe Guinevere was portrayed and written excellently, although I believe Lancelot as well as the actor that played should have been written in with more personal dialogue with Arthur, which there was just enough to let you know there was a deep relationship, but not enough to display a "true bond" with Lancelot, seemingly just loyalty and likeness.THE PLAYERSMain Hero's:Clive Owen as Arthur; I believe this was an excellent pick for Arthur. Arthur in my view is a very steadfast and honorable leader, all of which Clive captures with brilliance.Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot; Although I believe Ioan was an excellent choice for Lancelot, I do not believe his acting abilities were given enough opportunity to shine in this written role, as I said earlier I believe more should have been written for him, most of which should have been of personal dialogue.Keira Knightley as Guinevere; a beautiful play by a beautiful actress. She captured both beauty and "warrior spirit" in a most electric manner. I absolutely love how Guinevere was portrayed in this film, not as a "softened queen" but as a heroic participant in what would eventually shape the freedom of her people and country.Main Villain'sStellan Skarsg?rd as Cerdic; although I believe Stellan is an excellent actor, I do not believe this role was best suited for his acting talents. Maybe it was that there was not enough written or possibility correctly written, but he just did not seem to have the presence of a villain the caliber of Cerdic.Til Schweiger as Cynric; Til however I believe had an excellent presence and should have in my opinion been cast in the role as Cerdic at very least, this role for him I believe was almost a disgrace to the talents he has, which never ends to amaze.In conclusion; The legend of Arthur and his Knights is about a man and followers who's dream was above all to have equality for man and country, along with their actions to create such equality. This movie valiantly and poetically gives insight into that "dream". A definite must see, especially for the poetic of mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, this movie should not be held up to Lord of the Rings. Nothing really can stand up to that trilogy, so people should stop comparing it to things.I loved this movie, but not because of the battle scenes. What made this movie good was fellowship and characters.In my opinion, each character was developed as much as it was possible, considering it was a regular length movie, NOT a three part fantasy epic. I came out of it with a fairly good grasp of each knights character.Also, the way the interacted with each other was great. Just enough humour to keep them going and viewers interested, but they still stay solemn enough at the appropriate times.Emotion did run through this movie, and I thought it was perfect. Clive Davis did an amazing job as Arthur; and I felt that his inner struggle was well shown. He was fighting to believe in something that his heart didn't believe in, because his mind thought that it was wrong.I just loved the movie, and I feel that people who are rating the movie lower are not giving it enough thought or consideration.</fullReview>

But she was cool so I didn't mind. Overall, I was pleased with this retelling of the story. Hopefully in a few years this story will be factored into the myth. The movie itself had a great combination of action and drama. The action scenes were very well made but not too gory. Clive Owen was an amazing Arthur. He had all the qualities Arthur was supposed to have and in this telling he wasn't the perfect King with the cheating wife. I personally liked this retelling much more than other versions. Many people don't like this version but they are expecting the Camelot from Sir Thomas Malory's story.

		<shortDescription>So in conclusion; this is another great movie from Jerry Bruckheimer with a lot of heart and great performances along with a great score by Zimmer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw King Arthur for the third time (yeah, baby!) this Saturday in a much better theater with great a sound system, and this made a difference in watching the movie. Watched KA the first two times in the local theater which has a poor sound system and the most uncomfortable seats my ass has ever sat in! Anyway, the movie, King Arthur. What made it better this time? Was it good enough this time around for a 10/10 rating? Oh yeah, you better believe it! Because of the differences between the theaters that's mentioned above, the whole experience was so much better; I could live myself into the movie, laugh and cry with the characters and sit on the edge of my seat during the fights and battles. What is King Arthur about? The Roman Empire is stretched across many nations, including Britain. In their conquest for more land, the Romans went into Sarmatia where they fought the very brave Sarmatian cavalry. The Romans, impressed by the Sarmatian's weaponry and fighting skills, included them into their army as knights. After 15 years of serving and fighting for the Roman Empire, the Sarmatian Knights are about to be free as the Romans are leaving Britain. But the Knights must carry out one final order before they are free. A Roman priest and his family, especially his son Alecto, must be rescued from the invading Saxons. But there is another danger lurking on the road to freedom - the Woads, British rebels who hate the Romans. What makes this movie so damn good then? Let's start with the comradery between the Knights. You can really feel that these men have been fighting side by side for 15 years, the interaction between them is very well-written, kudos to David Franzoni. The story is also very well-written, and capturing. Characters could have been a little deeper, but what was there worked for this movie. The acting performances were outstanding. Clive Owen as Arthur was a very good choice from the director and producers, he has this depth in his performance that you don't see from many actors these days. Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot was also a very good pick. I would say he had the same depth as Owen in his performance, very rare. Ray Winstone as Bors, what can I say, just simply amazing and amusing! He definitely provides the funny moments in KA. Keira Knightley as Guinevere was very good, I love to watch women who fights (just look at Uma in Kill Bill). And the villain, Cerdic, played by Swedish actor Stellan Skarsg?rd. The first time I saw the movie I wasn't THAT impressed with him, but the second and third time he just blew me away - "evil as hell, he MUST die", that's what I was thinking during the movie.And the music by Hans Zimmer is one of the most amazing scores I've ever heard, after The Last Samurai. It's not too overwhelming, but it helps make the movie stronger and more powerful in many scenes which is just a bonus.The cinematography by Slavomir Idziak is great. In many shots I was just like "Wow" and "Ah", especially in the ice battle, my God, that's good stuff right there. So in conclusion; this is another great movie from Jerry Bruckheimer with a lot of heart and great performances along with a great score by Zimmer, although it has taken a lot of cheap shots from reviewers and critics. If you like movies like Gladiator, Troy and The Last Samurai, you will probably enjoy King Arthur. 10/10Review by Andreas FurumoGet Ready to Rock!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Noble intention, poor execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*MINOR SPOILERS*Logic dictates that taking Britain's most well known and oft told myth and stripping it of everything that makes it memorable is a bad idea. This did not deter the makers of 'King Arthur', and while the premise is interesting, it's execution is sloppy, leaving behind a film doomed to reside in the shadows of such great predecessors as the film 'Excalibur', and the TV min-series 'Merlin'.Historians have long speculated over the real identity of the mysterious King Arthur and his knights of the Round Table and, as the prologue of this film tells us, recent archaeological discoveries point to him being a descendent of Sarmatian knights. As it stands, this is only speculation, but gives the film its premise. As the film opens, the Romans are pulling out of 'indefensible outposts' such as Britain, leaving the native people to defend themselves against the bloody thirsty and murderous Saxons. Artorius (Arthur to his pals) and his knights are eagerly awaiting their deeds of emancipation so they may return to a home they barely remember after fifteen years of service in Britain. But he and his knights are handed one final mission - to rescue an important Roman family who have settled, for reasons best known to themselves, on the other side of Hadrians Wall. This is the film's first misfire - it makes no sense. If this family are so important, why have they been allowed to live in such a dangerous place? To reach them, Arthur and his knights are forced to travel through territory controlled by native Britons, known as 'Woads', making their task a virtual suicide mission. Except it isn't. Because Merlin, paying lip service to the Arthurian legend as the leader of the Woads, knows that the rampaging Saxons will shortly be on their doorstep and Arthur and his knights could be their only hope against a much stronger enemy.After a strong first act, the film becomes a gloomy, murky stew. The characters founder - Arthur's knights are virtually interchangeable and have surprisingly little of the screenplay devoted to them. Ray Winstone's rambunctious Bors is memorable, but all the others, even Lancelot, are as dull as ditch water. Keira Knightly adds her own sparkly charm as Guenevere but her character is woefully underwritten. Her only purpose is to let loose a few arrows - Orlando Bloom showed her a thing or two on the set of Pirates of the Caribbean, it seems - and throw a spanner in the works as Arthur's love interest. But this only paves the way for what is, in my mind, the biggest disappointment in the film - the fabled love triangle between Arthur, Guenevere and Lancelot has been scrapped. Oh sure, Lance spies Guennie looking fetching while bathing and there are a few meaningful looks, but the ultimate opportunity to create a drama with the potential to actually suck us into this world and make us care about these characters has been abandoned. Still, that may be no bad thing because the fewer occasions on which Clive Owen is required to emote the better. Clive has his own physicality that serves him well in the fight scenes, but speaks his lines as though reading from a cue card. This is disastrous - like Russell Crowe's Maximus in 'Gladiator', Arthur is the foundation this whole house of cards is built on.Oh, if an actor of Russ's caliber had taken the helm, it could have been a completely different film. Without a charismatic leading man, the film steadily crumbles as it heads towards a climax you just don't care about.But, hey, it doesn't matter if the hero is a big dull dud as long as you have an interesting villain, right? Ehm, wrong. As the leader of the Saxons, the usually serviceable Stellan Skarsgard looks bored and gives the impression that he is working on another much more interesting movie during the week and only mucking in on 'King Arthur' on his days off. We only know he is a baddie because he issues orders like "Burn every village, kill everyone" and, in a confusing sequence, saves a woman from being raped and then orders her death.So the film lumbers on to the inevitable final climactic battle. Guenevere reappears in a costume (well, if you can call two strips of leather a costume) that Xena, Warrior Princess would blush and back away from and Arthur and his knights get to look cool while silhouetted on a hill top - the filmmakers apparently confused as to whether they are retelling the Arturian legend or paying homage to 'The Magnificent Seven'. The battle that follows is confusing, choppily edited and uninvolving. Some of the fighting is impressive, but pales in comparison to the far superior swordplay in previous epics such as 'Troy'. Like much of the preceding film, it's dark, dour and gloomy. When it's finally over we are treated to the prerequisite happy ending, which contrasts too much with the rest of the movie not to throw the whole thing off balance.The look of the film is another major downfall. Yes, this is a 'realistic' retelling of the story of King Arthur, but why must it be so gloomy? Sitting in the cinema I felt like somebody needed to turn the contrast up. It lacks an epic feel that you might have expected in this sort of movie - there is a stunning paucity of sweeping aerial shots and stunning scenery. Instead, it gives the impression of being made on the cheap, with one section of forest standing in for a variety of locations. Everything is dark - the sets, the costumes - nothing stands out as remarkable. There is none of the punch or dazzle usually associated with a Jerry Brukheimer film.'King Arthur' would have benefited from a tighter storyline and more focus on the central characters. I would have liked to see the relationships between Arthur and his knights better developed. We find out nothing of their motivations or why they are so attached to Arthur that they will follow him to almost certain death instead of beating a path to the utopia of Rome like sensible people. That's the film's biggest mystery - why would anyone want to follow the sour faced Mr Owen ANYWHERE?Overall, it's a pleasant way to waste a Sunday afternoon. Much of the fun is in seeing the filmmakers' imagining of where the classic hallmarks of Arthurian legend - the round table, Excalibur - originated. Remove the familiar elements and you are left with a gritty and sour period piece that is ultimately disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie to watch for the action fan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many different historical figures that might be the basis for the Arthur of legend. Some believe that the Arthur of legend is a combination of several characters in history or never existed at all. Whatever is the truth is, this version of Arthur is probably closer than any previous version that has come to the big screen. No golden camelot on the hill or mystical magic from Merlin. This movie is very realistic. Lucius Artorius Castus and his imported Sarmatian cavalry is probably the best candidate currently for the basis of the legendary Arthur and his knights. Clive Owen plays the Roman/Briton warlord Lucius Artorius Castus (Arthur). He does a wonderful job playing the Arthur of the film. Keira Knightley plays a sexy and amazon like Guinevere. Ioan Gruffudd plays a credible Lancelot. I was surprised at the negative review of this film in my local newspaper. All I have to say is the critic is an ignorant bum! There are no spoilers in this review. I do not want to spoil it for you. The film is dark and gritty and is very appropriate for the time period. The violence is abundant but not too graphic. I give it a 9 out of a possible 10. Great flick!</fullReview>

They must rescue the family of the Pope and defeat the invading Saxons.The acting is very good. Clive Owen is the perfect choice. I liked the other actors who played knights such as Ray Winstone and Ray Stevenson. Stellan Skarsgard is great as Cerdic.I enjoyed the music a lot.

No wizards flying through the air no obvious special effects but a very tight story that puts the whole legend in another era and under far more realistic circumstances. Once again the fine British actors win the day. If you read the bios of the cast their training is remarkable. They have all paid their dues.

		<shortDescription>The True story behind the Legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Readers,Since Children we've been reared on the Legend of the Knights of the Round Table. There have been dozens of movies and books made about the Arthur legend. But where did these stories come from? There was actually an Arthur, a Roman knight, and his knights of the round table were Sarmatian soldiers forced to serve Rome. There was a Gwenevere and a Merlin. They were leaders of the Woad people and fought to keep Britain from falling under the rule of The Romans and The Saxons.After ten years of bondage in Britain, the Knights of the Round Table have one last mission before they return to Rome and Sarmatia. As they travel to rescue a Roman family, Arthur begins to see the cruelty of his fellow Romans and begins to save people from their oppression. At the same time The Saxon Army, led by their leader Cerdic and his son Cynric, arrive on Britain and begin to march south, destroying all in their path. The Knights of the Round Table prepare to make a valiant stand along with the Woads against the Saxon Army to free Britain once and for all.King Arthur is probably the coolest epic there is, next to Lord of the Rings and Kingdom of Heaven. Clive Owen acts Arthur superbly and stonily while Keira Knightly is attractive as always as Gwenevere. Ioan Gruffard is okay as Lancelot, though his bigoted personality leaves something to be desired. Cerdic is quite the villain played brilliantly by the popular actor Stellen Skarsgaard while Cynric is played viciously by Til Schweiger. The fight scenes and battle scenes are gritty and gory but tons of fun and the acting is superb.Signed, The Constant DVD Collector</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watch movies (usually) to escape from the real world for a while and be entertained. This film does all of that in spades. Regardless of whether it is historically accurate or even based on any accurate fact, from the opening scenes to the final conclusion it grips the viewer's hand and takes them on an adventure to a time and place that most likely none us will ever know or experience. The costumes and scenery seem very convincing as as being spectacular. The impression of Britain of yesteryear (along with the actors comments on the climate) seems as appropriate now and then. Not much has changed! Of course the film has "Hollywood" style melodrama and sometimes, when thinking about what is happening as opposed to just enjoying its entertainment value, the drama is contrived. But then if one wants real life the TV is full of reality shows. This film provides lots of action, splendid costumes and magnificent settings. The cast work well together and obviously put a lot of effort into their roles. The fight sequences, especially the sword play, are well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At last, a King Arthur that might have lived!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just to clarify, at the start, I am not saying this is the true story of King Arthur. I think that is something no-one will ever know. But, at least this is a story that could (historical inaccuracies etc aside) have happened. There is no magic or wizardry to bring the story down to pure fantasy.This is a brilliant historical film which gives a wonderfully intimate view of life and warfare in the dark ages. Not everyone is Christian and married to have children (shock horror)and not everyone believes in the cause they are fighting for. There are huge grey areas on morality which many films try to dismiss that are shown here.The battle scenes are gritty and show individual characters fights rather than just one overblown CG experience to show 'what they can do nowadays'.Yes, there are faults (like everyones perfect, pearly white teeth!) but these are present in every film, especially historical ones.I had been looking forward to this film for a long time before its release and was worried I would be sorely disappointed but it was everything I had hoped it would be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this film was wonderful so did several of my friends. We have all purchased the DVD &amp; I for one have watched it about 20 times. The music is also superb but you can't go wrong with Hans Zimmer &amp; Nick Glennie-Smith. The percussion sections are incredible &amp; I have a compact disc for my car &amp; one for in the house which drives my family mad, BUT I LOVE IT. The drumming for the Saxons is particularly exciting. How they made the battle scenes without somebody not actually being killed is amazing. I loved the storyline it made a lot more sense than Mallorys which now seems like a fairy story for children. I understand there was truly a battle on Bowden Hill with a warrior from Rome leading the Britons against the Saxons although his name is not known it has been proved that there was peace for 40 years &amp; the Saxons left our shores.Mary UK</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems everyone giving 'King Arthur' bad reviews is the smartest person in the world and that they know everything which is BS. I hope people in future, review this as a movie and not as an insult to the King Arthur tale. As if anyone here really knows what went on back then. I do least of all that's for sure. But from what I know nobody was there back then. I love this movie and everything about it. The Badon Hill scene is great and so is the ending. There isn't one boring moment in it. It is beautiful.This is a long movie. Sometimes I will take 2 days watching a movie that lasts over 2 hours but I can't take my eyes off 'King Arthur' and can watch this in a day. I love the action, romance, the friendship and everything. Down to the smallest joke to the biggest battle. From the coolest battle moves to the great cast.Each character shows development unlike other films. And there are many characters including knights, leaders, priests, rebels, and you will remember each one through out this epic. The cast shines and does not over act, make you bored, and it'll make you feel for them. King Arthur is superb and unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie - Get the DVD !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a truly great motion picture.There appear to be many inaccurate and misleading negative comments about this movie. When it first came out, the harshly negative reviews and the 'dark' preview caused me to miss one of the best movies in 50 years. I don't want to be too hard on critics, but for the benefit of others who may want an informed opinion on the 2004 motion picture, "King Arthur", I recommend you buy the DVD if interested in possible historical origins of the Arthur myths.For a critic to simply say the movie is 'non-historical' is well off the mark, and in fact not true at all. For beginners, one might refer to Linda Malcor's excellently researched and fully documented articles; one is online at,http://www.mun.ca/mst/heroicage/issues/2/ha2lac.htmand her book, coauthored with Littleton, "From Scythia to Camelot". Sadly for those who would prefer some mythical - yet no doubt 'British' origin of Arthur - it appears almost certain now that he was in fact a Roman army officer. There are stone-carvings with the name 'Artorius' in his honor; there appears to be no trace of any English or Celtic root for the name, Arthur, contrary to the desires of many English medieval kings (and their public) who wished such a lineage.There are, in the movie, a number of deliberate departures from known (or probable) history; for one, the Saxons would be hardly likely to land north of the wall, knowing of its existence as they do in the film, then having to face it later. But it is easy to see that these are nothing more than 'dramatic license', which add to the storytelling, and do no damage at all to the main point of the movie - Arthur as the Roman, and the knight stories as transfers of Sarmatian myths. In fact, this is far and away the most realistic movie - or story - yet made about Arthur. The medieval tales, and the comic books, are clearly all myths.Some argue that it would have 'made no sense' for the Romans to move captive soldiers from one end of the empire to the other, to provide local defense. In actuality, this was a rather common practice of Rome's, see for example Goldsworthy, "Roman Warfare", 1999, Cassell, Great Britain. And in point of fact, approx. 5500 Sarmatian cavalry were transferred to Britain, many to service on Hadrian's Wall, after their defeat by Marcus Aurelius in the 2nd century A.D. It seems probable, following Malcor and Littleton's research (among others, beginning in 1925), that the commander of these Sarmatians was a certain Roman officer named L. Artorius Castus.That is why this movie is such a grabber - it may not portray every event, or even most events, accurately; it may not get every sequence correct; but it goes a long, long way to capturing the essence of what many now believe about Arthurian history. I submit that is all a movie can do in 2 hours - and most fall miserably far short of the standard set here. Of course some myth- lovers are defiant: they have lost their stock in trade - the discussion of Arthur in mythological context only. The story is real, and bears only a little resemblance to the myths; in fact, it is a better story than the myths, and more exciting, as fact almost always is. The music and acting are superb, and sent shivers down my spine. It makes 'Camelot' (1960's), 'First Knight', 'Excalibur', etc look like the fairy tales they are.Though I am a Christian, it is good to see an accurate portrayal of the early Church. Such extreme treatment of pagans - and heretics - was not unusual, and the Church was at times synonymous with the Roman State. I believe that was why the artifice of Pelagius' presence was used - it forms a central part of the development of Arthur's character. And in fact, Germanius did actually go to Britain - to preach against the Pelagian Heresy - that too appears to be well documented. Again, it sets the tone.A suggestion - the movie happens fast. It really does not become clear in a single watching. Those confused might try a 2nd or even 3rd viewing. The DVD is better by far than the theater version. The CD music is haunting and beautiful.jrc</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why i love king Arthur!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i am totally in love with this movie, esp the battle scenes at the climax. i feel that they were particularly well shot, though the film was a tad too gritty at times. my fav character is Lancelot, something about the way the actor (ioan gruffudd) playing tt role, made me like him immensely. and when he died in the end, i actually cried! the snow mountains were magnificent. shooting there must have been so much of fun! and the castle of Romans was also a mighty thing to behold. does anyone know tt if it is really a castle or did they build it esp for 'king Arthur'? keira knightley was beautiful yet very brave &amp; frank. i loved her character too. though i strongly feel tt Lancelot shouldn't't have died. instead, he should have married Guinevere instead of Arthur. i mean Lancelot deserves Guinevere more. he was the one who saved her at the battle field after all. and died cos of her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional adaptation. Shockingly underrated. Beyond original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first visited this page, I expected the overall rating for this movie to be much higher. I can theorize as to why perhaps this movie is not quite yet getting the credit it deserves from the userbase as I am a huge fan of the King Arthur legend and before having viewed this movie was extremely skeptical seeing as, in my mind there could never be a movie that would top John Boorman's "Excalibur", which is probably my favorite movie of all time.When I finally conceded to risk seeing "King Arthur", there was something I liked so much about it... just the overall feel of the movie: the story and how it was all put together... and yet I needed more time to get used to it because the truth of the matter is, this movie is in a class of it's own. So when I saw it for a second time (this time the Director's Cut, which is the best version not just due to the extended fight scenes but notably for more detail on the relationship between Guinevere and Lancelot) more was made clear to me...the character of King Arthur is presented as a historical figure who is linked to Rome and the conquests of the Roman Empire, and the struggle to liberate Great Britain from Roman occupation and Saxon invasion.Comparing King Arthur to Excalibur is like comparing an apple to an orange. There is no point because each is its own freestanding entity. In other words, one must distance oneself from the closer-to-fiction-like versions of King Arthur, and open ones mind a little to a more realistic and closer-to-history version/vision of King Arthur, or Lucius Artorius, the name by which he is known in Rome. Lancelot, Guinevere, Merlin and the Knights are all portrayed differently than in prior adaptations and even if you're addicted (like I am) to the more fantastic, there is a chance you will really enjoy this movie, especially if you (also like me) have a love of history, lineages, past cultures and excellently choreographed battle scenes.Clive Owen is perfect for the role he plays (Arthur). The closeups of him mounted and in full armor (the costumes are fabulous in this movie) epitomize him as the Brit/Roman in the traditional dress of an officer in the Roman Cavalry: he is absolutely majestic. I find it extremely interesting that he is, of course, British and yet he seems to have some almost Nicolas Cage-type attributes as if maybe in real life he is partially descended from Italy or someplace nearby.If there is possibly an actor who fits a designated role even better, it is Stellan Skarsgard as the leader of the Saxons. Whoever's idea it was to cast Stellan as the Ultimate Viking, as in this movie, should get some kind of award, seriously. I have been in awe of Stellan ever since I first saw him in "The Hunt for Red October" (another one of my favorite movies). He is such a versatile actor and seeing him in this light; the image of him: tall (they do a great job of emphasizing his height in this movie), and about as Norse looking as it gets (not just the classic long hair and braids, but also his exquisitely Nordic facial features) is an unforgettable experience. His overall presence along with his characteristic gruff, raspy voice and blunt mannerisms showcase his talents in a way better than ever.On that note Til Schweiger, whom I had never seen prior to this movie, really caught my eye. As with the rest of the cast care is taken to focus on his features (in his case classically Germanic), and this along with the determined, fierce look in his eyes makes a very convincing son and second in command to Cerdic. Arthur's Knights all hail from the Eastern European regions, I believe, and once again the casting here was superb. Keira Knightly's Guinevere is actually a Celt in this movie as is Merlin, who is portrayed as somewhat of a wildman and is very striking. The acting job of everyone is superb.In closing I need to say that I, like others, have been very disappointed with past attempts to create a story of King Arthur for movie viewers. Before I saw this movie, after having seen others fail, I didn't know how this movie was to succeed, especially having the monumental Excalibur to live up to. If you decide to give this movie a chance, you may just find yourselves swept away by it just like I was. I read someone comment on a bit of excessive bloodiness in the movie, and I agree with this which could qualify as my only (minor) quibble. I'm not a huge fan of unnecessary violence in movies. There may be a couple of instances where the fights were a little savage for my tastes, but these instances were relatively few in this movie (there are much, much worse in this respect out there). For the most part the battle scenes were quite thrilling; filmed very well along with the dramatic music. The scenery and special effects were absolutely beautiful and, in response to naysayers who claim to have a problem in that some of the scenery does not depict any part of England actual I feel inclined to remark that this movie is shot in a different time than our present one, and even if there never was anything like "ice" in England...this is, well, after all a movie and if it adds anything to the drama or flair and excitement (which I certainly thought it did), I don't mind one bit. Artistic Licence exists for a reason. Ability to use this license well is what separates great movie makers from the rest. The Bruckheimer/Fuqua collaboration is a winner. The movie is a triumph. I look forward to more good work by everyone involved in it.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"King Arthur"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a retired archaeologist and a scholar of ancient history, especially that of Britain. I found that this film portrayed what the actual settings may have been as well as the historic backgrounds of 'Arthur' and his warriors before being mythically re-created by the French writer, Cretien and the English writer, Mallory. Historically he would have been from a Roman/British family, and although not mentioned by name in later texts of early historians Gildas nor Nennius, there are enigmatic 'hints' in their writings of a 'Dux Bellorum' being named at about this time in the 5th C. CE. Whether they were writing about the historic Ambrosius Aurelianus or another figure such as 'Arthur' will probably never be known for certain, but I found it much more believable historically than the other movies that have been made associated with this subject. Excellent film! As well as beautiful theme music for which I plan to look. J.R.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like this movie because it's a new and fresh vision about King Arthur, his Knights, Merlin, and Guinevere. I really don't know how close to actual reality it is, but it's very refreshing. A good movie, no doubt of it. Despite the not so well known actors, it gets to the point of telling an also not well known story about the mythical King Arthur. It was really a surprise for me to learn about the roman blood on Arthur's veins. I would like that Merlin's part could been a less darker role, because it is described as a dark wizard, and in deed, it plays like one. Guinevere turned out to be a pagan and ferocious warrior, and it's not clear if she was a kind of princess among her clan. The story suggest that, but the issue was never truly clarified. Undoubtely, it's not a very easy movie to watch, sometimes it gets a slight slow tempo. And the action scenes sometimes were too bloody. The production it's good and also the music. I would certainly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is 'cinematically' better than "Troy" and "Alexander" - Clive Owen as King Arthur, indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reflecting on the period epic offerings in 2004, I like director Antoine Fuqua's "King Arthur" with Clive Owen in the lead more than "Troy" (d: Wolfgang Peterson with Brad Pitt lead) or "Alexander" (d: Oliver Stone with Colin Farrell lead). Its organized screenplay, sure-handed direction, solid performances and fantastic production - all cohesively presented as a gritty historic adventure.Clive Owen can do no wrong, even in the rather depressing film from director Peter Hodges, "I'll Sleep When I'm Dead." Even in a mushy drama as "Beyond Borders" opposite Angelina Jolie, you can't take your eyes off Clive. I first noticed how his performance stood out - even though he's not that striking a face - in writer-director Stephen Poliakoff's "Century" 1993. Owen was playing opposite intense actors like Miranda Richardson and Charles Dance. He was irresistible in Poliakoff's "Close My Eyes" 1991, opposite Saskia Reeves and Alan Rickman. There's his first collaboration with writer-director Hodges in "Croupier" 1998. Followed by being the "Driver" in the BMW film series "The Hire". He's popular in the PBS series of "Second Sight" playing the 'half-blind' role of detective Ross Tanner. His latest impressive performance being in the role of Larry in director Mike Nichols' "Closer," opposite Jude Law, Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman. He is in such superb form and unspoken coolness, indeed. King Arthur he is - such steadfastness, decisive leader, and observant. (Look forward to his role in the elaborate ensemble cast ever in director Robert Rodriguez's dazzling visual interpretation of Frank Miller's "Sin City" 2005.) Great casting, with Ion Gruffold (I first saw him in the tragic romantic story of "Solomon and Gaenor"), Ray Winstone (cannot forget his outstanding performances in "Sexy Beast," "War Zone," and "Nil By Mouth") and meticulously selected knights to King Arthur's fighters, not forgetting Keira Knightley as a fearless Guinevere that we've not seen before. A lot of research went into the script (writer David Franzoni), production design and costumes, period weapons/archery, planned shoots of the battle scenes - mounted cameras on horses constantly on the move and on swords and weapons.I had enjoyed director Fuqua's debut feature with the pairing of Chow Yun Fat and Mira Sorvino in "The Replacement Killers" 1998. Here in "King Arthur," he has given us a worthwhile epic, definitely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One Word: hideous. Shame on you Antoine Fuqua. After Training Day you came up with this pile of dung. Why can't a story just stay as it is. We are talking about a folktale here. Why try to make it look like an "based on a true story" and fail miserably. As just basic fantasy it could have worked. It's like trying to squeeze a true story out of Lord of the rings. That's just stupid. I'm almost certain that in some part of Hollywood lives a tribe of producers who believe that only "based on a true story" -label sells tickets. A bunch of retarded creatures that should be banned from the studios. First it was fun to watch Hollywood gang banging European cultural heritage. But now I'm desperately waiting for some international coalition to stop producers and their ignorant sidekicks from ruining the rest of the still remaining original folktale. Make up your own legends and myths and keep your uncultured fingers away from European ones.</fullReview>

There are no good actions sequences, you don't get to know the characters well enough to sympathize with them. It's a waste of time.

		<shortDescription>really enjoyed this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think King Arthur is a much rather underrated film, and a good film at that. It is a more gritty, real take of King Arthur and his knights, although in Fuqua's version the knights are believed to be samatian, and they joined the round table because of the roman empire's decree, that certain samatians, and their sons and sons after that, owe a debt to the empire. In the mix is a story about how the knights have one last mission to fulfill before they can go home, and in doing so they encounter the woad's, savage warrior's from the woodlands, and the barbaric Saxon army. The story in my opinion, is just another take on the King Arthur Legend, and one should not be concerned as to why bruckheimer would try to prove a different legend into fact. It is both an interesting and fresh take on king Arthur, and people will appreciate the mud-flinging gritty sword-fights and battle scenes.The casting is nothing short of excellent, as Clive Owen brings a dark, passionate portrayal to the character of Arthur. He has the look, and the acting ability to be both stirring and convincing. Keira Knightly i think is a wonderful actress, not even 21 and she did most if not all of her own stunts! Very beautiful and powerful performance, its as good as it gets- cant wait to see her later work. All the supporting actors do a fine job, bringing their own distinct traits to each of the knights, and stellan skarssguard is just scary as the leader of the Saxon's.The film looked visually breathtaking. The cinematography was very good, and the costumes and sets had a very gritty quality to them, as well as historically accurate and all around nice looking. The acting was on par- the dialog was sometimes maybe a little cheesy and some parts made me laugh rather then be tense, but with that aside the actors and crew did a fine job. The battles are particularly nice, especially the ice skirmish and the final battle, with dazzling sword-fights that may have been seen before- but were done very nicely.i wouldn't say this is the best epic type picture ever made, but truthfully i would say to people that they should give it a chance. Its a both dramatic and fun movie for anyone who likes sword and sandal epics, and don't forget Hans zimmer's brilliant scores for the film- honestly i see some of the reviews and i say how can people say such things- i didn't see anything wrong with the film (im not that big into proper historical documentation- if the actors speak in the wrong accent or something i don't notice and couldn't care less)- i wouldn't change a thing- and ill give it a 9/10- satisfied me enough to want to buy it on DVD. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film, but not Lord of the Rings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read quite a number of reviews for this film, and the opinions seem to vary wildly from really love to really hate.The problem I have is that the many of the people who really hated it seemed to be making the assumption that the film was meant to be the 'Legend of King Arthur'. This it simply was not.The actually legend of King Arthur is about the Roundtable, the knights, the sword Excalibur, Merlin, Lancelot and Camelot. If that is what you want to see then go and watch 'Excalibur' or the TV series 'The Legend of King Arthur'. These film/series are merely re-telling (well I might add) the legend and myth that has perpetuated for many years.This film clearly states at the beginning that it is NOT trying to follow this well beaten path, but is trying to tell the actual story on which the myth and legend is based. How much historical truth there is to this story, I do not know.Because I am able to take the film in this perspective I really liked it, however there were weak points. The characters could easily have been developed more, and there were a few chronological discrepancies for example. Unfortunately a lot of people will think that this is an attempt to re-tell the myth when it is not.Jerry Bruckheimer has quite a reputation as making really big showy films that simply end up as eye candy with limited plot. 'Gone in Sixty Seconds' for example was great eye candy for car lovers and Angelina Jolie was good for the boys, but the plot was limited and the characters with one exception were not developed.Unfortunately Mr Bruckheimers influence does show quite clearly in this film, but personally I don't think that it is ruined by it.The fight scenes are excellent, especially the one on the ice flow, and although the plot was a little poor, I can quite happily recommend this film.</fullReview>

The actors are wonderful, and the decision to use mostly unknown actors (with the exception of Keira Knightly)instead of filling the screen with Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom was genius. I wasn't watching "Brad who happens to be playing the role of Achilles"; I was watching King Arthur and Galahad and Lancelot and Guinevere. The scenery is breathtaking, the music is heart-shattering and the story is simply fascinating. I was impressed by the way it was so un-movie-ish; it wasn't 'epic', it was just really really good... I do suggest that you go see this movie--if not for the plot then at least for the battle scenes, which, if I say so myself, are really cool!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, some people have panned "King Arthur" but I just got back from it and I loved it. I know a lot of people dislike it because it's not the "romance" movie they have in their head and the characters are different than the Morte D'Artur that they've read all their life but I liked it BECAUSE of those things.I've got quite a massive library of Arthurian books, everything from the Malory to the Welsh tales and all the way up to the historical searches with the archeology going on to try to figure out the "legend". I've authored several collegiate thesis on the subject.Even my former folklore teacher will tell you that legends are based, somewhat and somewhere, on a fact. It can be only a single fact but it is based on a fact and that is where this movie begins, trying to pin down a fact. Yes, there are bit of license with some of the legend as it's been written but there were licenses in the legend when it was being told by roaming minstrels over the ages, with each telling the story changes and grows, shrinks, and grows in a different direction, much like a tree.One thing I liked is that Artorius is the Roman that he is most probably going to be, and Guinevere is the native that she is most likely to be. The basics of the most popular legends are there: Artorius's father was with a native woman and was buried there after his death. I also liked the fact that Merlynn was the leader of the "woads" (which is one of the old words used in some of the research) and was holding the leadership by the old ways of illusion and magic as well as wisdom. It makes sense. Artorius believes in Christanity but allows his knights to believe as they will and actually fights for their right to believe that way. The story has a lot of good elements of the "legends" that are not so much the old "shiny armor and fair damsels" that most expected and that's why some panned the movie.Me, I loved it and will be getting the DVD the day it comes out.And I saw Caitlin Matthew's name in the credits as the author one of the songs (I think it's the "going home" song.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>hehehe there are a lot of comments for this film so here I am adding my two bits worth ^_^.See this movie. It's not great. It's not going to change your life. But it is very entertaining. Lots of fantastic battle scenes (shouting, mud, swordsmanship and all that lovely stuff) as well as gorgeous scenery and just loads of atmosphere. The acting isn't all that brilliant but some of the knights are good looking so who the heck cares (Mads Mikkelsen is wonderful as the slightly loopy Tristan and he provides the only humour in the entire film in my opinion so 5 stars just for him.) If you love Arthur (and who doesn't) it may be quite difficult to separate yourself from the legends and magic which have so much meaning to you. At first I found it so. But then I realised that what I was watching wasn't really the story of Arthur at all.I was told the movie was a historical and realistic take on Arthur without all the magic and fairy tales. I interpreted this as: if the Arthur we knew really had existed what it would have been like in Britain for him and all the other fighters against the Saxons, Angles and Jutes who began invading Britain in the early 400's. Well it isn't! First of all this story must have taken place about 100 years before the possible Arthur fought his battle at Mount Badon so all that Roman intrigue and political backstabbing etc would never have been a feature of the life of the true Arthur. And he wouldn't have been a Roman but a true Celtic Briton just as in the legend and so what need he of Guineviere to convince him to fight? None at all (her role in the movie is pretty flimsy in any case) And the geography is all wrong - Hadrians Wall is miles from Mount Badon.But anyway - don't get caught up in all that. Just watch the movie for the entertainment of it. Or watch it for Mads Mikkelsen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As far as myth/legend movies go, an excellent movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big buff when it comes to mythology and legends, and due to my fascination with the pagan religions and the middle ages, it is only natural that the Arthurian legends are among my favorite. Based on trailers, I expected to see a movie that used the Arthurian legends as an excuse to make a movie to jump on to the whole "swords, horses, and war epic" trend Hollywood has been feeding off of since "Lord of the Rings" was first being hyped. And that's exactly what it turned out to be, and it happens to be damn good, at that. The whole "proven by discoveries" and "historically accurate" is also just hype BS, as there is quite a number of historically inaccurate happenings, however minor they may be. Other than that though, I thought the film was excellent historical fiction LOOSLEY based on legend. Very loosely. In fact, I would recommend forgetting everything you know of Arthurian legend before you see this, as it is barely followed at all. Either way, however, I felt it was an enjoyable and fascinating movie, despite it's claims of being the real story and historically accurate. In the action department, at least, better than Excalibur. And for those who disliked it for being "too violent", well, why are you interested in a middle-age story that involves both pagans and christians?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was a comedy, right?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"King Arthur" tries to palm off a ridiculous new "real deal" version of the King Arthur fable by shoving Clive Owen in our faces (with both of his expressions) as Arthur and Keira Knightly a Guinevere, a sort of sometimes snarling and sometimes winsome warrior princess. In this grunge version sans shining armor, Hollywood pits Arthur and his not-so-merry knights against an army of Saxons as they fight for...well, really because fighting is the only thing this PG-13 Hollywood ripoff has to sell.At one point Knightly is preparing to fend off 200 or so Saxons and one of the knights says (paraphrasing): "There may be many lonely men over there" to which Knightly's Guinevere replies: "Don't worry. I won't let them rape you.""King Arthur" is the kind of condescending approach to film making which assumes all audiences are morons who can't wait to throw their money at the ill conceived Razzie material they pass off as entertainment only to prove once again they're right. An action/adventure flick which will appeal most to teens. (C)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Arthur. I supposed before the film that it would be more of the time when Arthur was the king. That just happened to be the very end of the film. Fighting and battles were extremely well made, I don't doubt that they didn't leave anyone cold. But the thing is that the fighting was more or less the main point in the whole film. That though was just the tip of the iceberg and the first thoughts that pop up in my mind. I was surprised that this movie had quite a bit to do with Christianity. I myself appreciate that. And I was quite surprised at how Arthur sided with Christianity and made excellent points on that. Like many, I believe, I noticed that the question "What cause are you fighting for?" was asked quite a bit. That was also a point that couldn't be missed. I can't help myself not to add the fact that the knights and male actors were quite attractive. I'm especially glad that they're not the same Brad Pitt's and Tom Cruises, but talented actors that haven't been in the biggest of films yet. It was great to see so many good-looking men :) And about Keira Knightley, I think that her role was awesome and she did more than better playing it! That was definitely a positive surprise. She definitely has matured. Overall the film was enjoyable for me, since everything to do with legends and history is intriguing. It was very intense and a bit scary too. There was also some sad parts, I almost cried... This is a 8.5/10.</fullReview>

We enjoyed it all the way through, great actors; for a moment we thought that Merlin was Billy Connolly (no offence to Stephen Dillane!).

		<fullReview>I went to this film only because the one I wanted to see, I missed. So, I decided to give it a shot. All in all, it was a pretty good film it served it's purpose to entertain. As for the accuracy of the film, I have to say it lacked a lot in that area which many here have commented on so I will skip that. The one pet peeve I do have is that you can tell that it's freezing outside (mostly due to the snow) and somehow, while everyone else has on layers of clothes Guinevere has on a flowy, lightweight dress holding a bow and arrow knowing they have to walk back to the horses while standing on a frozen lake. HUH? It amazes me that Hollywood wants to dumb things down for moviegoers but all that said, I am happy they decided to use pretty much unknown male actors for the leads here. In my opinion, Ioan Gruffudd (Lancelot) and Clive Owen (Arthur) have a future in Hollywood and it's great to finaly see some men on screen that don't look like they walked off a GQ ad. If they had taken the same liberty with the character of Guinevere it may have been a bit better for me. Still, I did like the film and would see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better historical treatment of the legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been a scholar of the period, I find that this film represents a much more plausible explanation for the source of the Arthurian legend. The general plot is historically accurate, although the fleshing of the characters is no more realistic than the next best historical treatment, namely Excalibur, by John Boorman, which I find to be a much superior cinematic experience.My greatest quibble with King Arthur is the presence of and performance by Keira Knightly. Who doesn't adore her? I certainly don't. But she is miscast here, and has absolutely zero chemistry with Clive Owen, who is superb in the role and in the many stunts he performs. I would say that Keira is not feral enough for the plot, or that she could have been invested as a successor to Merlin to explain her presence as a Pictish princess worthy of dynastic union. The ending wedding scene is quite contrived, though foreshadowed, and ultimately unbelievable.The stunts and fight scenes are first rate. The camaraderie of the knights is believable, as is the "Sarmatian" element as a plot device. The interjection of Pelagius, and his doctrine, which is the evocation of free will, is perhaps the most redeeming quality of the script (see the wiki article at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagius).Idea: 10 Script: 7 Director: 8 Producer: 5 Cast (except Keira): 10I adore Keira, but this just was not her vehicle--but remember, too, this was when she was 17 and her first film after "Bend it Like Beckham".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had a few flaws, but it is not nearly as bad as some make it out to be-ie: in the league of GLITTER, or BATTLEFIELD EARTH et al.The unused ending would have made it a better film, and since it was a 'Directors Cut' I don't understand why Fuqia didn't add it. The acting was very good, and the choice or Arthur and his men was impeccable, down to each one of them. I think perhaps too many people could not get past the "legend" of King Arthur that we all grew up with.It is solidly entertaining-well, paced, and plausible to the degree that I know of history-but then, this was not meant to be a documentary; I get the feeling that a longer version with the unused ending would wind up a very decent film.While I loved the music, sometimes it got to be a wee bit TOO bombastic and grandeur-ish. An why did Zimmer give the tracks such ridiculous titles on the CD?It was also remarkable to me that a film of a myth so dear to the hearts of (Caucausians) Anglo-Saxons was directed by a black man-I mean this in an emboldening way-because it would surprise me just as much to see Spike Lee direct something so dear to "Officail (White) History" Though there was some talk that there may have been Black Gladiators in that time, why he chose not add them, I do not know. Wouldn't have been any more revisionist than having sleek young maidens in gauze-like gowns doing battle in amongst crowds of bulky, thug-like Saxons. I give it a 10 on purpose and also to weight the average up just a wee bit. The film is just not that bad. I have not seen the Theatrical cut.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had absolutely NO expectations at all on this movie. I see myself as a kind of "historical guardian", a person who usually hate movies that has a lot of historical errors or is plain fiction based on a well known history. Most of my friends and family did'nt like it at all. But...Hey..I LIKED IT!!!! You don't really know so much about that time of history in England, so the movie does not feel THAT disconnected from reality, but I saw it not as an historical movie, but as a fantasy movie, and it really worked out nice! But the most important thing is that the movie has SPIRIT, something too many movies lack now days. You can actually feel that the director and the team behind the movie really enjoyed themselves and tried really hard to bring their wild visions and fantasies to life. The acting is also very good indeed- I liked the Saxon leaders; Stellan Skarsg?rd and especially Til Schweiger, but also Clive Owen as Arthur and some of his knights. Beautiful Kiera Knightley is also good as Guinevere. Damn, she has spirit and looks really fierce! AND she is a lot better and more agile fighter than, for example, Miranda Otto in The return of the King. It is SO good that you don't see many famous familiar actors in the movie, I'm SO tired of actors like Orlando Bloom for instance, and it's good to see some new people get a chance. If you just sit back, switch off your brain and enjoy this movie, you will not get bored!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsHollywood is one of those places in life where the mighty can fall faster than a tonne of lead from a 20 foot building.Take director Antoine Fuqua,for instance.Two years ago,he was the helmer of the award-winning,mind blowingly brilliant Training Day,only to follow this with the deadly dull wartime thriller Tears of the Sun.And now,cashing in on the summer blockbuster period,Fuqua has taken charge of a film that is,well,even duller.Downright dreary,in fact.Arthur (Clive Owen) and his knights of the round table are tired of fighting bloody battles for the Roman empire and what to be set free of their charge.They agree to this,under one condition:he commandeers one last mission,to rescue a woman and a young child from Saxon invaders.It's baffling how,having only comparatively recently commanded such a mesmerizing,oscar-winning performance from the brilliant Denzel Washington in Training Day,Fuqua can here only demand such a dull,lifeless,laughably and embarrassingly wooden lead performance from British 'thesp' Owen (only,if he's ever turned in a better performance elsewhere,one wonders what he would have done to have otherwise earned such a title.)Kiera Knightley as Guinevere isn't much cop either.In fact,most of the main cast are wooden,and the ones that aren't,e.g. Ray Winstone and Ioan Gruffudd,are woefully under-used by an already patchy script.As I already mentioned,it's dull stuff too,with an uninvolving story,a tedious pace and a dismal lack of action.Some good battle scenes come at the end,but by then the story has already bored you to the point where you just don't care.The fact that it's not as long as it could have been had the makers become too self-indulgent is really what the film has to thank for being able to see it through to the end.The Arthurian legend has never held much sway with me either way,so the re-working of it failed to entice me much either.Pong Arthur,more like.*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly more truth than fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I'd like to give a number of commentators a C- simply for a natural lack of curiosity due to a sad educational system. Recent evidence in the social history of the Scythes and their descendants ( the Sarmatians ) has tied the origins of the legend of King Arthur neatly to that part of the world and NOT England. The Sarmatians ( who historically were superb horsemen ) made up a large contingent of the Roman army of occupation in ancient Britain. There was a historical Sarmatian commander named Aurtoius with considerable power. Arthur is not a Celtic name. And Roman cavalrymen were called 'Knights'. The final battle against the Saxons actually did take place, but little evidence exists as to the composition of the British/Roman Army. The film's storyline made a nice stab at it but there were probably far more Sarmatians and Romans and other auxiliaries involved. Though the film showed a strong desire on the part of the Sarmatians to return home after their tour of duty was over, by that time there was no Sarmatia. The Huns had pushed them into Southern Russia and Poland ( in Poland their legacy can be found in Polish heraldry ).Many Roman Auxiliary troops would inter-marry with the locals. More than likely this was the case with the Sarmatians. And from them stories would pass from generation to generation. Though the costuming in the film was off ( budgets! ) for the time period where the Romans are concerned, there is a splendid scene before the final battle where three of the Sarmatian knights are decked out in Sarmatian armor ( even to the conical helmet which became popular among European knights centuries later ). All in all there was possibly more truth than fiction in this film. The pace was fast, battle scenes furious, acting ( for an international cast and considering a lean script ) was fine. Label this a 'guy's' movie as long as the 'guy' isn't hung up on the fantasy of the Legend. I give it 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK! I'm not too sure PRECISELY when the Romans withdrew from Britannia.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(some spoilers?) * * * * * But, I agree with the script writers. It was sometime in the 5th century AD (or, CE--Common Era--for all you British readers). That being said, I think this movie is the most historically accurate swashbuckler, in recent years. Even more so than "Gladiator" and "Braveheart" put together! For instance; there were, indeed, conscripted POW'S employed as auxiliary cavalrymen in Roman Britannia. Especially, near Hadrian's Wall. Some of them were Sarmatians (racial kinfolk/rivals of the equally equestrian Scythians), whose heraldic flag was a dragon-headed banner. Others came from North Africa, Spain, and even Gaul (alias France)!I find the latter fact very interesting. Because, while I know that this movie's version of Guinivere is written as a warrior princess of the Woads (in Latin; Picts), in most traditional compendiums of Arthurian lore, her father was a _French_ king. Gorlois, I believe. Whose to say that the real-life basis of Guinivere wasn't half-Gallic/half-Pictish? That would certainly explain why this movie-version felt such an intense attraction to the Romano-Britonic Arthur! In any case, I give Mr. Fuqua et al five stars for both originality, emotional involvement, and action-packed storytelling. And, if you see any other movie after "Spider-Man 2," make it this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great movie! I highly recommend it. However, if you do not like violent battle scenes, then watch at your own risk. This movie differs from all the other Arthur movies that I have seen in that Gallahad, Lancelot and Arther are all around the same age. In fact, all the knights are (30ish.) There is no real love triangle to speak of. If in fact King Arthur did exist, I would like to believe this is how he lived. During a time when great armies took what they wanted, devouring all in their path, Arthur and his knights defended the common man. Although Arther had a superficial allegiance to the new Rome, he believed that each man being free from birth had free will. This was a novel idea during his time. Arthur is a great film. Do yourself a favor and see it ASAP!</fullReview>

The visuals in this movie are amazing. The characters are so easy to relate to, the storyline is believable and the filming is excellent.The fighting in the movie is impressive. Each character has his/her own fighting style which each actor pulls off very well. I was impressed by the fight scenes and the sheer intensity of each actor's performance. You really feel for Arthur's knights.The storyline was unusually believable. Most-likely to be seen in any other Arthurian tale is magic and Merlin with sheer fantasy backing it. In this presentation, the creator decided to go on the more historically accurate route. And it surprisingly works. The one thing I think was missing, was the love triangle between Lancelot, Gwenevere and Arthur. But that's just me. I'm a stickler for the romance between Lancelot and Gwenevere, and there wasn't that much in the film. But it sets it up so that one can imagine that it becomes more later on from where the story takes place.The camera shots are amazing. The way they shot this thing was innovative and unusual. Great angles and such.Overall great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A both positive and negative look at King Arthur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Positive attributes: Story is the backbone of every movie ever made. If it's loose or incomplete, the whole movie usually falls apart. Luckily, this movie's story is good enough to keep it on its feet. After years of mandatory service to Rome, Arthur and his knights are just one mission away from the sweet, sweet freedom they've craved all their lives.Good acting for the most part. Clive Owen delivers a realistic performance as the legendary King Arthur, portraying him as a loyal and level-headed Roman commander. Ioan Gruffudd also does a great job of Lancelot, Arthur's loyal but very different friend. Merlin has been completely stripped of his magical powers and given a much grittier feel as the leader of the Woads, the warlike rebellion against Rome's occupation of Britain. The award for best acting, though, should definitely go to Stellan Skarsg?rd, who gives a rough and scary portrayal of Cerdic, the ruthless, bloodthirsty leader of the Saxons. The battle action isn't anything you've never seen before. It's bloody, brutal, realistic, blah blah blah... Hans Zimmer shines (in moments) as the movie's composer, eliciting a powerful score to wrap the rest of the movie in.Negative attributes: If over and underacting annoys you as much as it does me, then wear a mouth guard, for you'll be grinding your teeth quite a bit. Overacting seems to be popular amongst (mostly) the secondary actors in this film, for whatever reason. Unfortunately, Keira Knightly (who plays Guinevere) only provides more evidence to my suspicion that she can't actually act by her displaying some more of her acting abilities in this film (or lack thereof).Also, if you're an avid hater of clichés (as I very much am), be prepared to catch a net-full. In fact, there are so many in this movie that they become downright tiresome almost right away.Another minor complaint I have with this movie is that it didn't draw out the love triangle between Guinevere, Arthur, and Lancelot as much as I would've liked.Conclusion: Overall, King Arthur is an OK movie, certainly worth seeing. For me, what is most disappointing is that Antoine Fuqua, the acclaimed director of Training Day, took over this after Michael Bay (who I don't especially like) dropped out, and I can't really imagine what Bay might've done differently (with the exception of maybe subtracting some from the story and tossing in a few more special effects). As long as you aren't expect Shakespeare when inserting the disc into your DVD player, you'll at least be entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In a demystified version of the King Arthur legend, Clive Owen (Arthur) must fight for the freedom of Britain from an invading Saxon army.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This new version of the King Arthur legend has gotten a lot of bad criticism, but is also not recognized for its better meanings. One of the major changes in the story is that Arthur, not yet a king, is a Roman officer who is in charge of a group of Sarmatian knights. These knights take on the legendary names such as Lancelot, Gawain and Galahad.Some elements of the story from a historical point of view are inaccurate. For instance, the time period of the film takes place long after the Romans have already left Britain and also when the Roman Empire itself had basically collapsed.The character of Arthur is also altered. He is given a much darker personality, and is a man who contradicts himself throughout the movie. The character of Guenivere (Keira Knightly) is also different as she is a brutal warrior rather than the classical lady in white robes. As for the knights, I would recommend that you see this movie several times to get their individual character traits as the story focuses mainly on Arthur, Guenivere and a very brave, very unfortunate Lancelot (Ioan Gruffiudd).The extended director's cut is a better version of the film as it provides a more brutal and therefore emotional environment, as well as a better film of character development. The film includes wonderful costumes, brutal battle scenes (that includes an amazing duel between Stellan Skarsgard and Mads Mikkelsen), okay acting, a beautiful environment and also a well played score by Hans Zimmer.All and all this is a well made movie that focuses on another perspective of a legendary tale, a concept that I always enjoy.I would also recommend Braveheart for its theme of freedom and Gladiator for its brush with the Roman world.</fullReview>

The only reason I can see that I enjoyed it so much when others loathed it is that I am not too familiar with the story of Arthur, Lancelot and all of them. I think the fact that it gave a different view on the characters from what people may be used to gave them a bitter taste in their mouth, clouding their judgement. I had to watch this film two more times after the initial viewing because it was so entertaining. The fight scenes (of which there are many) are phenomenal, it has very good character development, and the cinematography is amazing. If you take offense to any slight alteration to the legend of Arthur and his Knights, this may not be the film for you, but for your average joe this movie rocks just as hard as Gladiator, Braveheart and the 13th Warrior, a definite must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Magnificent Seven meeting Tears of the Sun meets Troy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>spoilersA little bit of an unexpected turn is that King Arthur is so much like The Magnificent Seven. There's one little different: 4 survive at the end of King Arthur while only 3 in The Magnificent Seven. To see the similarity, think of the first confrontation in The Magnificent Seven (close you eyes and visualize the scene): Yul Brynner standing in the middle, with Steve McQueen and James Coburn on each side. Then think of a similar scene in King Arthur when the knights confront the Roman soldiers, Guinevere standing in the middle, with Arthur on one side and Lancelot on the other (lazily resting his two swords on his shoulders). King Arthur however has more thrown into it, most prominent of which are Tears of the Sun (rescue mission) and Troy (big battle).To fully enjoy the movie, forget about the myth and/or history, which the devotees and purists are unfortunately probably unable to, ending up as unhappy as some people are with Troy. For those seeing it purely as an adventure escapade, King Arthur should be well satisfying. The storyline is focused, and simple enough so as not to distract or annoy. The amount of 'emotions' ingredients is just about right in the recipe. The action sequences are well above average and the 'showdown on thin ice' scene is like nothing you have seen before. These days, good cinematography is something that would be expected but even with this expectation, you'll find that King Arthur is still able to surprise and delight in this department.If there is something that I would like to see more of, it's the development of the characters of seven knights, particularly Galahad. Still, what we have is sufficient to give us a reasonable feel for each. And then, we have lovely Keira Knightley firing deadly arrows, a most beautiful sight to behold. Good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know why this movie didn't catch much press and is now on sale at the local discount store for $9.95, a bitter disappointment and 139 minutes of fighting to stay awake on the couch watching the DVD.Now before you say, "well why did you buy it?", I didn't. My dear sweet wife of 21 years saw it on sale at the local Target store, and knowing I am a big fan of the King Arthur legend, she thought I would enjoy having this in my DVD collection. Wrong sweetie, I love you but you could have spent our money more wisely.Expecting to see an updated version of John Boorman's 1981 classic, Excalibur, King Arthur is somewhere out in left field, way beyond the fence. Maybe I was expecting too much, or then again, maybe King Arthur missed the mark all together. The legend of King Arthur and his knights of the round table are just that, a legend. A place in the mind for fantasies about good versus evil, right versus might and all of those other clichés of the land of Camelot.By somehow trying to add a bit of historical credence to an otherwise fictional story was abysmal at best and a waste of 2 plus hours of my time. Fans of the King Arthur legend will find King Arthur the movie, boring, confusing and down right sacrilegious. If somehow as a child, you missed out on the Sword in the Stone, Excalibur, Camelot and other cinematic depictions of the legend, then perhaps you will find King Arthur entertaining.In defense of the movie, the cast is superb, locations and cinematography of Oscar quality and a nice job of direction by Antoine Fuqua. But that is it. For the price of a DVD rental plus a couple of days of late fees, you can own King Arthur for your very own, but then again, why pay the bucks to have it collect dust in your DVD cabinet. After all, with one viewing, that is probably where it will wind up anyway.</fullReview>

Overall the movie was good... not great or excellent, but good.I like the period the movie is set in so i was hoping that it would not be a bad movie and it wasn't. The acting was acceptable and good at times. The sets were not spectacular, but the flow of the story was bad at times. The plot was good which had me talking for hours about how it places in with legend and history.I can't blame the director because he has done some great work before this picture. I attribute the less than excellent outcome to overall production of the film which felt TV movieish at times. This movie covers an important period in western civilization... Romans decline forges a multitude of fledging nations (and 1000 years of misery). A movie that tells that story should be epic and grand.Overall I liked it.. I was entertained.Pax Britania</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Epic but still fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with a prior post about the fun of this movie. I have studied Medieval and Renaissance literature and I know my Arthur mythos. However, I also went into this movie knowing that it was going to attempt a pseudo-historical interpretation. Also, even in a movie dedicated to "legendary" focus, it would be impossible to include every single aspect from every single myth. Where would the director choose from? Sir Gawain and the Green Knight? Mallory's Morte d'Arthur? The Chretien de Troyes romances? The Welsh stories in the Mabinogion? All of those show vastly different aspects of the myth. Different portrayals of Arthur. Different opinions of the greatest knight. Different mores. Because of this, all I wished from this movie was a fun way to spend an afternoon. The movie had some interesting battle scenes although not as visually intense as the recent Troy. The story itself does seem to be slightly less than epic although it is obvious that the director is striving for that label. My recommendation? Check your prejudices at the door, get a big helping of the snack of your choice, sit back, and enjoy a matinée.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK the history was a bit off. But then we are supposed to believe that the story lines of Troy and Alexander are accurate. Apart from that, this was brilliant. I was told to dislike this by the stupid critics in the press. IMDb reviewers however seemed to like it so I gave it a chance. Am I glad. The Saxon leader. What a psycho ! Totally believable. The battle scenes were mostly good. Only one Braveheart style charge, and this from the Picts. They were supposed to be this stupid, ignoring childishly the tactics of more sensible armies. Kiera, despite being beautiful, would have been chopped to bits by the Saxons as she has little or no muscles and limbs like matchsticks. Her berserker antics were a tad silly. Clive Owen, who I really didn't have time for before, was excellent. They should have made him Bond not that blond bloke. Ray Winstone. Pure class ! Everyone else, even Schlockmeister, well done. You are forgiven for Pearl Harbour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unorthodox take on the famous legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sadly underrated "King Arthur" provides a rip-roaring and original take on the classic Medieval legend. The film is set in the brutal world of the 5th Century AD, right at the moment when the crumbling Roman Empire is turning inward and withdrawing its forces from far-flung outposts such as Briton, where barbarians from the north, sensing Rome's weakness, are beginning to make incursions into the regions south of Hadrian's Wall. In this version, Arthur's famous Knights of the Round Table are a compendium of conscripted tribesmen who have faithfully and courageously served the cause of Rome for the past 15 years. Now, just at the moment when they are about to be granted their hard-earned freedom and are eager to return home, they are sent on a final dangerous mission deep into Saxon territory to rescue a boy who may be a possible successor to the Pope in Rome."King Arthur" focuses more on the geopolitical aspects of the tale than the customary romance and magic - although neither of those has been completely slighted in this telling. The film opts for a darker, more realistic treatment of the story - there's no talk of Camelot here - one in which, Arthur, Lancelot, Guinevere and the rest undergo internal conflicts and moral struggles often overlooked in earlier versions of the story. Arthur, in particular, the product of a Roman father and a Saxon mother, is torn between his loyalty to Rome and to the island he calls home. But, above all, he is faithful to the men who have served under his command and, with whom, he has been able to forge a chivalric code of ethics - one whose very cornerstone is individual rights and freedoms - that seems like an anachronism in a world dedicated to enslavement, brutality and destruction. The violence in the film is grim, graphic and gory but appropriate to the times in which the movie is set.David Franzoni has written an intelligent, dramatic screenplay, and Antoine Fuqua has directed the movie with flair and style. The action scenes are vivid and intense, and the film features the best ice floe battle sequence since "Alexander Nevsky." The acting - by Clive Owen as Arthur, Keira Knightley as Guinevere and Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot - is no great shakes, but at least it's unobjectionable.For the most part, the movie's attempts at de-romanticizing the legend work well - although turning Guinevere into a halter top-wearing, bow-wielding combatant on the order of a Boudicca or even Xena-Princess Warrior, does seem a bit much. However, since the film is less a retelling of the Arthurian legends and more a chronicle of the "real" people on whom the characters were allegedly based, such re-imaginings are more forgivable than they might otherwise have been. And like most actions films these days that don't seem to know when to leave well enough alone, "King Arthur" is saddled with a saggy third act whose repetitive battle scenes drain some of the life out of the story.All in all, though, "King Arthur" emerges as a handsomely produced, thrilling tale of love, hope and freedom that should satisfy the schoolboy adventurer in all of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent variation on the legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like seeing new angles on some concepts. It's always interesting to see how different director's approach something like this. I'm more of a fantasy fan myself, but I liked this gritty telling of the Arthur legend. The characters were well done, the story set near Hadrian's wall was a good touch, and Stellan was an excellent villain. Normally, you'd want a larger than life villain to chew the scene, but here he plays it quiet and almost without emoting, and it works.I liked the various elements of Arthur Legend thrown in various places (The Sword in the ground, glances between Guinevere and Lancelot, etc) The only detail I wanted more of was Merlin. Not enough Merlin in the story, but Otherwise this was cool stuff. The music by Hans Zimmer is excellent and the big battle at the end was fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressively made and well acted by an attractive cast...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written by Todd McCarthy of Variety:Brandishing a surprising seriousness of purpose for a would-be summer blockbuster, "King Arthur" bracingly repositions the Arthurian myth in a specific and savage historical moment quite removed from its usual placement in a bucolic world of chivalrous knights, a mischievous magician and an errant queen. Impressively made and well acted by an exceedingly attractive cast, this dark tale of ceaseless conflict is adult entertainment and will likely disappoint viewers expecting a "Camelot"-like love triangle, as it will the fun-seeking youth audiences that made "Pirates of the Caribbean" a smash for Disney and producer Jerry Bruckheimer a year ago. As a result, domestic B.O.B.O. will likely be closer to that of "Braveheart," which grossed only $76 million even with its Oscars, than to the Bruckheimer norm. In line with most big-canvas action fare, overseas should yield considerably higher returns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Arthur we haven't seen before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I'm the first to admit that this version of Arthur is flawed I still think that this is a very interesting and gritty film that does try to show what things were probably like during that period. Story shows that young boys were taken to serve in the Roman army for 15 years until they are discharged and Arthur (Clive Owen) and the rest of his knights of the round table are just days away from being discharged but are ordered to do one more dangerous task. Arthur and his men are to escort a group of Romans to Rome before the invading Saxons try and take over. The Saxons are led by Cerdic (Stellan Skarsgard) and his son Cynric (Til Schweiger) who want to take over England but a group that live in the woods called the Woads decide to help Arthur thanks to Merlin (Stephen Dillane).*****SPOILER ALERT*****On the trip Arthur finds a female prisoner named Guinevere (Keira Knightley) and saves her and eventually a romance blooms between them despite the flirting of Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd). They finish their dangerous task and are discharged but with the Saxons on their way Arthur decides to stay and fight much to the chagrin of the other knights who at first just want to go home to Sarmatia but their loyalty to Arthur cannot be ignored.This film is directed by Antoine Fuqua who made "Training Day" and he once again shows that he is one of the most promising directors to come along in years. He doesn't seem to be the right choice given the material but he handles it well and the overall look and mood of this film is quite effective. In this film there is no shiny armor or flowing gowns for Guinevere, instead we see Arthur and the rest of his knights as dirty and tired men. They're angry and grouchy and if in the wrong mood (Which is most of the time) they will kill if needed. Merlin in not portrayed as some seer or magician but as just a disheveled old man asking for forgiveness. There is a strong sense of realism to the film and for the most part the script goes back to it's origins but this is not a great film and it's hard to ignore the flaws. Knightley is a strong presence on film but I feel she was miscast and in a film that was striving for more realism it practically went out the window once she appears on screen with her perfect lips and model features. Her Guinevere was on deaths door one minute but a few scenes later she can split an apple with a bow and arrow at 100 yards. And the romance between her and Arthur just seems forced and Arthur looked as though he had other things on his mind instead of her as he should. The accents range from traditional Oxford English to Cockney and the Romans speak in thick Italian. This is a vastly different take on the story of Arthur and it's both a hit and miss but with the dark and dirty look and a pretty strong performance by Owen I found this to be a fairly effective film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every single Message Board on IMDb has someone who posts "Worst Movie Ever". There are a great many terrible movies made every year, but this was not one of them in my humble opinion. It was very entertaining and introduced the audience to a new take on the Arthurian legend. As noted in the IMDb goofs section, there were a number of historical mistakes if this was to have taken place in 5th century Britain, such as the use of crossbows and trebuchets. However, that didn't take away from my enjoyment of the movie.There were some scenes which were kind of ridiculous, but well filmed. For instance, when they defeat the Saxons on the frozen lake. I thought it was very well filmed, with great special effects, but the whole idea was pretty far-fetched. And later on we see Keira Knightley, all 105 pounds of her wearing a leather bikini, attacking the Saxon hordes. She does quite well in battle, killing at least 6 of them by my count. Obviously, that is just not realistic even if she had been trained by the 5th century equivalent of Jet Li. Just a few short scenes ago, she had been imprisoned and starving in a sadistic jail cell, and is now offing 230-pound muscular Saxons by the handful.Neverless, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I thought the battle scenes were really well done, and it was not at all what I was expecting. I have no idea why some people are posting "This movie sucks" other than the fact that they just like to post that regardless of what they actually thought.R.</fullReview>

Picture, sound effect , scenes was awesome especially the music. There are people who talking about it that is worth bying and it is. I sit here right now listening to the main theme, Tell me now by Moya Brennan and its such a beautiful song.Clive Owen is a actor i heard before, but i don't know the names of his movies, but i know he did a movie with Angelina Jolie(my favorite actress). He played perfect as King Arthur and should get a Oscar or be nominated.Ioan Gruffud is so hot as Lancelot, I've seen him in Titanic but didn't know it was him. Lancelot is a memorable and performing character, many people who saw this movie sure agreed. He is one of my favorites in my movies. I hope to see him in more likable stories like Arthur.Keira Knightley is definitely one of my most favorite actresses. Since Bend it like Beckham , she became popular and most trend woman of Hollywood. She was stunning as Elizabeth in Pirates of the Caribbean. Also her role in Love Actually inspired me. she must get more awards for her acting and i think in this movie she was best.I give this movie 8/10 because the great scene effects and the music.</fullReview>

I have to be honest, I didn't recognize any of the actors when I watched it the first time and for some reason, that made it even better.The scenery was stunning and the storyline would have had me by its grip even if the characters had been 100% fictitious and it had been King Filo instead of Arthur. Each character was well written, each with a unique trait I enjoyed.As riveting as the story was, the music by Ms Maire Brennan or Moya as I see she is going by now, is truly beautiful. Its also quite powerful at certain moments and reminds me of my favorite movie, Braveheart which also had a great soundtrack.On thing that both puzzled me and disappointed me was a recent comment from Clive Owen (King Arthur) when asked why King Arthur wasn't the hit some thought it would be.

That is why I enjoyed it, I've always liked hearing the truth behind the legend.This film boasts great performances across the board, notably Clive Owen as Arthur and Ray Winston as Boris. Also Keira Knightley gave a good performance as Guenivere. Although she does have room for improvement, considering she was 18 when she made this film she has proved to have talent beyond her years. When most people her age are just doing teenybopper movies she's actually doing drama's and pulling them off.The battle scene's are pretty well done although they got a little cliché with the characters dying in revers order of where they appear in the credits but they were still exciting.I really enjoyed the gritty feel to the film. It really gave a realistic feel. And the screen writing was superb.It has it flaws but it is still a good movie. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Original and Very Different Approach of a Legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 300 AD, the Roman Empire extends to Britain and the Romans become impressed with the fight skills of the warrior Sarmatian people, which are spared, but have to send their sons to serve Rome in the cavalry for fifteen years. Only after these services, these knights are free to return home. King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table have their last mission before achieving their freedom."King Arthur" is an original and very different approach of the Legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. I was quite reluctant to see this DVD, but in the end, this movie was a great surprise for me and I liked it.. The gorgeous Keira Knightley is amazing in the role of an unusual Guinevere. Unfortunately, the powerful role of King Arthur deserved a better actor: Clive Owen works well in the action scenes, but in the dramatic and romantic parts of the story he is simply awful. The music score is fantastic, with the wonderful voice of Maire (Moya) Brennan, the sister of Enya, singing awesome songs. The direction and the cast are excellent; the battle scenes have magnificent choreography, and I specially liked the one on the ice, which seems to be a homage to "Alexander Nevsky". My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Rei Arthur" ("King Arthur")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome New Take on the Legend!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard about this movie, I was expecting another remake of the old legend. Which was fine with me, as I am a great fan of the legend. I went and saw it, and was completely surprised. What we have here is not a fairy tell brimming with completely selfless men in shining armour, doing their duty to protect peace without a thought for themselves. No. This is a much more realistic take on the legend, in the sense that it shows the actual harshness of the period in which it takes place. Nobody (Romans and Arthur aside) wears flawless armour and carries a jewel-encrusted sword. The knights are just ordinary men, taken from Sarmatia by the Romans to serve in the Empire as knights. They are not at all pleased to be fighting, and long to get back to home. Doesn't that sound so much more likely?This movie takes place at the end of the fifteen years a group of Sarmatians (Lancelot, Galahad, Gawain, Tristan, Bors, and Dagonet) have to serve to Rome. They are eagerly anticipating returning home, when they are sent on one final mission. They are extremely displeased, as would be expected. They must rescue an important Roman family in the north from a massive Saxon invasion.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I don't actually care if the history was slightly off (Saxons and Romans at the same time), it was just a very entertaining film. The characters are interesting, the scenery is terrific, the battle scenes are brilliant, and the script can be funny even in such a serious plot. My only criticism would have to be that I found Arthur himself a little wooden. But that does not affect the movie in any way, because he is still an extremely cool character. All the knights were, in any case. Bors was hilarious, Tristan was just so stylish in his fighting, and Dagonet (my favourite) was a formidable fighter but turned out to be the soft one, when it came to children.If you are expecting the traditional legend and seeing it differently will anger you, do not watch this movie. Myself, I actually liked this one more than the old one. I give it 10/10!Bors: "Beautiful Sarmatian woman? Why d'you think we left in the first place? Moooo!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had potential, but the characters hold it back from greatness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie in a nutshell is a missed opportunity. You've got a great plot basis but not enough historical evidence to prevent you from making your own story. The filmmakers certainly did make their own story of the legend, but they kind of shifted their aim halfway through making it and missed the target. There are some good points to it, but it definitely could have been better. The main two problems are that it 1) tried to be like Pirates of the Caribbean too much, and 2) tried to rationalize too much of the legend into a more realistic context. The latter mostly comes out in the characters, who end up being pretty disappointing. Arthur and his knights in legendary form might not be true to life, but they are nonetheless good characters. Part of this comes from the fantasy element of the legends, which makes them nobler and generally more memorable. So putting it into historical context, while sound in theory, turns out like it would if you re-made the Harry Potter movies to be about a school of exceptional magicians instead of actual wizards. Historical accuracy is fine in some films, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it will be a good story. Braveheart has a lot of historical inaccuracies, but it's still regarded as very good film, and I think they could have taken a page out of that book here.The plot itself is not bad, even if it's action driven. Arthur is asked to send his knights on one last mission just as they are about to be given their freedom. This involves them traveling into hostile lands and rescuing a high-ranking roman's family. After that, they have to protect the entire village that they end up bringing along with them from the barbarians of Britain. The entire plot structure has a very Bruckheimer-ish feel to it with the ideas of rebelling against the powers that be and those characters that play are both friend and foe, sometimes simultaneously. None of the plot is based on the stories or on any historical evidence except for the setting. All other factors aside, the plot gets a B to B+.However the characters are another matter. They aren't terrible, but they could have been much better. Arthur's leadership and strong defense of his knights is presented pretty well with the injustices done to them by the roman superiors. His other qualities are unremarkable for somebody in his position, and his relationship with Guinevere was given almost zero plausible development. Guinevere could have been done better, though I liked her statement about how Arthur is described as "somebody so selfless and noble they can't be real". Her character is only half complete and almost makes her seem like she's acting for somebody else since she has motives, philosophies, and battle skills to boot, but no real personality to compliment this. The inverse can be said of Lancelot, who has a personality with dignity, but his intentions are unclear and/or inconsistent. This is really too bad since he dies at the end and his death scene could probably have been better if he had a little more depth. Cedric and Cynric are okay villains, though Stellen Skasgard's performance was slightly disappointing. The other knights are fair characters, and will probably seem only slightly above or below average depending on whether you liked them. I couldn't stand Bors and liked Tristan (Mads Mikkelsen), but others will feel differently. The supporting characters were written well, with the exception of Merlin, who is added into the story pretty haphazardly without doing justice to his part in the legend.The action's not bad and feels a lot like the action scenes in Gladiator, though of course without the Gladiator fighting setting. It's not a huge adrenaline rush or a great work of choreography or effects like the Matrix. The best action sequence in almost every regard is the frozen lake. A lot of it is small scale skirmishes until the big climatic battle. The final battle isn't terrible, but it's kind of disappointing for a climatic scene. There's a bit of blood throughout, but nothing too intense. The screenwriters made a few attempts at comic relief, mostly generated by Bors. I really disliked this aspect of the film because I didn't find any of it amusing and it the only character it ever really developed was Bors, who I don't like anyway. Saying that the comic relief is straight up bad is too much, but it's definitely sub-par especially for a Bruckhiemer flick.The technical execution was pretty good. The costumes, editing, spfx, and acting were just fine, maybe even above average. The script wasn't too bad either, even if the characters weren't written well. Hans Zimmer's score was below average for him, and sounded a lot like a blueprint for his Pirates of the Caribbean scores. There are a lot of melodies that should sound vaguely familiar to Pirates fans, though not quite as good.Overall, it's not a terrible film, but it could be much better. I would recommend it if you're looking for a strictly action film, but consider some other options if you're seeking a great cinematic work. If Bruckhiemer is your absolute favorite producer/director, go ahead and buy this, but I advise everyone else to rent it. It's not a general crowd pleaser or a group movie that you can talk to your friends during, so only watch it with a max of about four people. If you aren't enjoying it after about an hour, I would suggest stopping because the second half won't change your opinion. Overall Rating: 7.7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie for the first time just recently, after many years, so I have passed the prejudiced feelings of release-time hype. As an historian myself, I found the movie had many historical flaws, especially in its main theme of Arthur and his "knights" being foreigners recruited by the Romans from faraway Sarmatia - a recently proposed hypothesis that has no factual support, especially as the Arthur legends themselves have little factual support. And of course we know that the Saxons did not come down across Hadrian's Wall, they came mostly from the east of England. What I do like about this film, however, is the departure from the romanticized Camelot and Round Table chivalry styles we are used to seeing, with all the noble derring-do of Arthur's knights. The real Arthur - if he lived - lived in a much earlier time of Roman Britain, and the movie did away with the ridiculous elaborate suits of armor, jousting and banner-laden lances of the later Middle Ages. The movie as filmed was beautiful, with its green Celtic Britain landscapes, weather, and the stone circles (of which there are many all over the British Isles), so the imagery and atmosphere are very well portrayed - much like in the Lord of the Rings films. You feel like you're really there. The acting sucks, mostly. Clive Owen and Keira Knightley are both wooden actors who - in this and all of their films - cannot seem to loosen up or unfreeze their faces for anything, no matter how emotional or expressive. Knightley's mouth moves slowly and steadily while her eyes and face don't move at all. It's difficult to sympathize with them when they are so superficial; it's like, "OK, so am I to feel sorry for these two about anything? All they do is look forever serious for some reason they're not telling me yet". I can think of a hundred better actresses for her role here, both physically and in acting ability. Uma Thurman comes to mind - they should have used her for Galadriel and not Cate Blanchett who also had Keira's boring frozen face look). However, the other actors, from Ray Winstone onward, all did remarkable jobs and made up for the lack of the two majors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The idea of making a historical Arthurian movie is fantastic. Show the knights as real men, show Arthur as a real person, etc. But, there is just so much wrong with this movie from start to finish that it is hard to watch without cringing. I won't even get into the historical inaccuracies... my problems are just with dumb mistakes made by the characters in the story:- The film maker reinforces that no Roman ventures north by showing the gate through the wall is rusted shut. Yet, there is a Roman villa two days north? It isn't just bad history, it just doesn't make sense.- Why would a bishop know more about the Saxon invasion then the local commander? - The Saxons don't understand that bunching together on ice is dangerous and who stand there while Arthur's man is breaking the ice with an ax. These are Saxons... from northern Europe.- In the final battle, the defenders have a 40' stone wall and bows with better range. Yet, they open the gates and fight the Saxons in a m?lée. Why? A man on a wall is worth 10 on the ground, and archer on a wall is worth 20. Arthur is a poor tactician and hundreds of his men died for no reason.The trivia section notes that the movie had a lot of 'tinkering' by the studio execs, and that might explain some of the problems. But, I think the problems run deeper, originate in the script itself. With a better script, this would have been an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting take of the Arthurian legend, fails to convince</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arthur, King of Britons, as a Roman officer. It's not as outlandish an idea as it first might seem to be. There has a been a lot of debating going on about the possibility of Arthur Pendragon being at the very least based on a true historical person. And there lived a Roman man named Lucius Artorius Castus in the late 2nd and early 3rd centuries. This movie is based on his fictional exploits in the conquered Britain, long before knights and castles.As said, an interesting idea and the film has some good things going for it. Clive Owen makes for a fantastic King Arthur. His nobility, creed and pure will to do right shine from his every expression and he can totally sell the warrior king aspect of the character as well. The rest of the early Knights of the Round Table feel equally interesting and unique in their own ways. The movie has gotten some critique about the fact that they changed the knights's personalities too much from the legends, but because the very premise of this film is such a huge step away from the traditional, I personally didn't mind too much.Keira Knightley as a female pagan warrior Guinevere is something of a hit and miss. She has a few good moments here and there, but most of her performance consists of her glaring around petulantly and being saved by the actual knights. It's not as bad as in most movies, I'll grant the film that much, but it's still there. Merlin (Stephen Dillane) is another character I think wasn't realized as well as he could have been. Now he's more of a sidenote in the story, when he should be the driving force behind Arthur's ascension to the throne.Furthermore, the battle scenes fit the intended era quite well and are fun to follow. Unfortunately the same cannot be said about the villains, who are just a one-sided bunch of barbarian conquerors. They try to give them a bit of character, but it never rises above clichés.King Arthur is a good movie to check out if you like the Roman period or are interested in seeing a totally different take of the Arthurian legend. Few of its elements rise above average, but it's not a bad film by any means.</fullReview>

The opening scroll-down boldly announces that historical research has now established the truth behind the legend of Arthur. Really? I don't think so. But with that said, we, the audience, are then supposed to believe that what is presented in the movie is historical fact. It is suggested that the "real" Arthur was in fact one Lucius Artorius Castus, a Roman cavalry commander in charge of a group of Sarmatian horsemen stationed at Hadrian's Wall. There is some historical evidence that such a man existed, but that particular Artorius Castus lived in the second century CE.This movie, however, takes place in 452 CE, about three hundred years later. Our film's Artorius Castus (Clive Owen) is half Roman-half British (Celtic), and his knights of the round table&#x2015;yes, there is a round table in the movie&#x2015;are Sarmatian cavalrymen. Let's see. The Sarmatians came from the region north of the Black Sea (present-day Ukraine), and they are known to have been closely related to the Persians. And Roman cavalry consisting of Sarmatians did serve in the Roman Army stationed in Roman Britain. But they almost certainly would not have resembled the movie's Sarmatians, and they certainly would not have had names like Lancelot, Gawain, and Galahad. These are pure Thomas Malory. I guess giving them Sarmatian names would have been too "historical." We don't need no stinkin' history to confuse things! And while we're mentioning history, all the books that I've ever read say the Roman legions departed Britain around 408 CE, forty-four years before our story takes place. Oh well. And a Roman villa north of Hadrian's Wall? I don't think so. No Roman would have been that insane. And then there's Keira Knightley (Guinevere) prancing around on the ice in a Peplos-type gown that has no more consistency than a modern nightgown. Hmm! Wouldn't she have gotten a bit chilled? Didn't appear so though. No doubt she'll be playing Queen Boudica soon.I did find the Saxon army convincing, even if they didn't use crossbows. But in Dark Age battles, it generally wasn't death to the last man. The battle stopped when one of the war-leaders was slain, and his head and hands hoisted on poles for all to see. And for those who know their "history," those nasty, brutish Saxons of course did succeed in repulsing the British (Celts), driving many of them out of what is today England into the hills of Wales and Cornwall. Some no doubt mingled with the Germanic invaders and adopted their Germanic tongue (Anglo-Saxon or Old English, which eventually evolved into Modern English). I'm leaving out two more significant invasions of England that occurred later: the Scandinavians who established the Danelaw (chiefly 9th-10th centuries) and the Norman conquest in 1066. They are not pertinent to the subject of the movie but did contribute greatly to the formation of modern England. BTW the term England comes from a variant on one of the other Germanic tribes that was invading Britain at the time, the Angles: Anglaland. Land of the Angles.It's been pointed out numerous times that Hollywood epics aren't meant to be historical. OK. Then why imply historical accuracy at the beginning? Why don't such movies just be forthright and honest? Either strive reasonably for historical accuracy or else just say that the story's meant to entertain. Unfortunately, this King Arthur lamentably falls on its face in both departments.3/10 (as I said, I liked the depiction of the Saxons)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sword Is Still In The Stone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a thought-provoking story. The thought it provokes is, "What the hell is going on?" I always get these characters mixed up, colorful though they are. I've struggled to get through Malory and Tennyson and failed. I never even attempted Mabinogion. I don't even know how to pronounced it. And then there are not only the central characters that everyone is more or less familiar with -- Arthur is married to Guinevere but Lancelot takes a shine to her -- but also similar figures like the Green Knight, and characters like Tristan (not to be confused with Tristram) and Roland and Percival (or is it Parsifal). Really, it's tiring but I did try. I went so far as to visit Glastonbury but when I reached Connecticut I realized it was the wrong Glastonbury.On top of that, there have been multiple movies about Arthurian legends, with which I haven't tried to keep up. There was one with Robert Taylor, I think, and another with Sean Connery as the King, in which everyone's wardrobe seemed made for a science fiction film about space travel.It came as a surprise here to find Arthur and his compadres defending Hadrian's wall from the invading Saxons at a time when the Roman occupation was undergoing a withdrawal. The wardrobe here is strange too. It's colorless, to begin with, and varies a good deal. Some is Roman, of course, but one of the guys is wearing a helmet that looks left over from the Greco-Persian war.The editing is a little confusing too. I gather there are several groups that have issues with one another. There is the Roman Catholic church, which is treacherous and no good. There is some kind of tribe of Wiccans or something, to which people like Merlin belong. Then there are the Romans, cowed with surprising ease. Then there are the Knights of the Round Table. Then there are the marauding Saxons from the north, led by the always-sterling Stellan Skarsg?rd who makes no bones about his character. "Burn all of the villages. Kill everyone." When he meets Arthur for the first time and Arthur insults him, he practically rub his hands with glee and mutters to himself, "Finally, someone worth killing." I had a problem with Skarsg?rd's hair though. It's very long and stringy as is his beard. Just a bit of his face peeps out, as in a cartoon. But among the unruly waves there are a few strands of hair that have been carefully woven together into braids. It must have taken hours. And he's neglected his entire do in order to weave those few braids.The problem with his appearance is nothing compared to Keira Knightley's. She's found by the knights to be a prisoner of the Christian monks. She looks awful. But she's soon buffed and polished until her ravishing beauty is apparent to both Arthur and Lancelot. In this production, anyway, Lancelot dies so Arthur can get her. But apparently she's not only a stunning woman but a warrior as well. She appears on the battlefield painted a cunning lavender and when she opens her mouth, hisses, and shows her teeth like an angry tiger, her teeth look dazzling and her maw a startling pink. All I could think of was the new Miley Cyrus with her tongue lolling out of her mouth. Knightley is dressed in a stripped down black leather outfit and dashes around the field dealing out martial arts blows with her bubbies bobbing.I kind of enjoyed it. There is the usual gloomy photography that's become so fashionable these days. There's rain and mud. That's depressing, but on the other hand there isn't an excess of computer-generated graphics. The few we see are well integrated into the story. That relief is worth a bonus point or two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty much hogwash, though 12-year-old lads might like it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If your fancy takes you in the direction of a cinema showing this version of King Arthur or your TV channel of choice happens to be screening it and you fancy brushing up on your British mythology, the chances are that you will be a tad disappointed. Antoine Fuqua's take in the Arthurian legend has precious little to do with chivalry and gallant knights, pennants a blowin', saving damsels in distress. Instead there's a lot of portentous loose talk about 'freedom' and 'free will' and a storyline which is at times difficult to follow.Arthur in this version wasn't the king at Camelot, but a cavalry commander serving Rome in Britain, the son of a Roman and a British women. As played by Clive Owen, it has to be said, he comes across more as a dull real estate salesman. His bride Guinevere ? they do get hitched in the end, although she makes it obvious that she would have preferred Lancelot but he, unfortunately for them both, is killed in the final battle ? is a British woman who likes nothing better than to go into battle in skimpy clothing, but is no mean fighter.There is admittedly no definitive version of King Arthur's life despite the spurious claim when the film kicks off that archaeological evidence is being discovered that Arthur was much like the man portrayed in the film, but take that with a pinch of salt, because he probably never existed (and is probably not sleeping in some cave waiting for the call from a grateful nation to free Britain). This Arthur is very much an acquired taste. I personally prefer the 'gramercy, my liege' and 'I must shrive my soul' version of the myth.There is any number of infelicities: the tribes in the North of the islands which the wall built by Hadrian was intended to keep out were Picts and Scots, not Saxons (who didn't arrive until a couple of centuries later). And there was no such tribe as the Woads. But what the hell. This version should go down a storm with pre-pubescent lads who enjoy World of Warcraft and like a bit of fighting and carnage, but more discerning viewers will have to be pretty terminally bored and very much at a loose end to consider giving it much of their time. Basically it's hogwash ? well made hogwash, certainly, but hogwash all the same. The giveaway if the never-ending, loud and stirring soundtrack: as a rule the louder and more stirring the soundtrack is, the less real excitement a film has to offer. Oh, well. See it with your lad if you like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad I can't remember it (and don't want to)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although that's probably because I fast-forwarded through most of it (I pity those who saw it at the cinema. Dear God, what a bitter disappointment). Why did I fast forward? you ask. Because as soon as I saw Kiera Knightly shoot an arrow 500 miles and knock some guy off his horse I knew this was going to be the kind of Hollywood PC crap I can't stand; the kind where the female character is smarter, stronger and more wily than any man ever was and dresses in revealing garments even in the snow country. In reality Ms Knightly wouldn't even have been able to draw the bow back let alone hit anything from the back of a horse, but let not reality get in the way of a good PC scene (it never does anyway). For all I know while I was fast-forwarding Ms. Knightly single-handedly wiped out all the bad tribes in Britain and re-united the rest under herself as Empress, but I really don't care; I just want to know when this PC crap will finish and we can get back to portraying women as they actually lived in times past and not as they might have lived had Germaine Greer been born in 500BC. In short, historical reality, guys, not feminist fantasy. It's not that hard; just try it for once, you might be surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Arthur Becomes A Generic Action Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Arthur is an ambitious attempt to wed the legend of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table with known historical facts of the era.It stars Clive Owen as the title character together with Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot, and Keira Knightley as Guinevere.Mads Mikkelsen,Joel Edgerton,Ray Winstone,Stephen Dillane,Stellan Skarsg?rd,Til Schweiger,Hugh Dancy and Ken Stott co-star to play key supporting roles.It was written by David Franzoni and directed by Antoine Fuqua. Arthur, a heroic knight and devoted Christian, is torn between his desire to travel to Rome to serve his faith and his loyalty to the land of his birth. As England falls into lawlessness, Arthur throws in his lot with a band of knights who hope to restore order to their fair and pleasant land and hopes to win freedom for his comrades, among them Lancelot,Galahad,Tristan,Gawain,Bors, and Dagonet. In time, Arthur and his men join forces with Merlin, a shaman whose band of renegade knights were often pitched in battle against Roman forces. Forming a united front as loyal Englishmen against the invading Saxon armies, Arthur, Merlin, and the brave and beautiful Guinevere are determined to unite a sovereign Britain under one army and one king.It's got a round table, some knights, and a noble warrior who rises to become King Arthur, but everything else about this revisionist legend is pure Hollywood and it has become a generic action film. That's not such a bad thing if you enjoyed Rob Roy, Braveheart, Gladiator, and Troy, and there's some intriguing potential in presenting the "real" Arthur as a 5th-century soldier of Rome, assigned to defend Roman-imperial England against a hoard of invading Saxons. As revamped history and "archaeological findings" would have us believe, Guinevere is a warrior babe in face-paint and Lancelot is a nonentity who fades into the woodwork. Never mind! Best to enjoy the harsh, gloomy atmosphere of Irish locations, the ruggedness of Owen and his hearty supporting cast, and the entertaining production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite the band of brothers then</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe this film is a critique of colonialism ? Arthur and his gang a group of third world soldiers uprooted from their own culture and mores sent out by a first world power to do its dirty work, with only Arthur, the charismatic leader, embracing the first world's propaganda. The rest of the gang clearly haven't. The Arthur/Tristan relationship is interesting in this context. Functioning as Tonto to Arthur's Lone Ranger, Tristan does much of the dangerous work, gets none of the glory and is expendable while Arthur does the "thinking". This film promotes cultural imperialism - Lancelot and Tristan offer verbal or disengaged opposition to Arthur's propaganda so die leaving Arthur free to spread a weak version of the first world's cultural values. Parallels with today's world? A novel masquerading as a screenplay, the plot is a melange of those Hollywood movies heavy on stunts and low on characterisation. The silliest moment for me is when Arthur gives his gang a pompous pep talk just before the final battle. At that point the gang should have scragged him and gone home to Sarmatia, scragging Jerry Bruckheimer, Antoine Fuqua and David Franzoni too. What was the motivation of the Woad who betrayed everyone to the Saxons? Clearly he was devised in lazy scriptwriting to feed the plot to the audience.Antoine Fuqua never bothers to differentiate Arthur's gang at the beginning, so they stay a muddled group throughout. The wedding scene at the end is worse than his original low-key ending. Fuqua's "skills", honed on pop videos for MTV, are responsible for the lack of emotional attachment between the major characters and this technical inadequacy contributes massively to the sense of dislocation and disbelief built in to the movie. Poor Clive Owen as Arthur looks desperately worried throughout as indeed he should, being stuck with the clunkiest dialogue that has ever graced an historical epic ? "I'm sorry for your loss"! Another problem with his dialogue is that there is so much of it. Owen should have taken the Clint Eastwood option and ripped pages out. His voice, though a pleasant enough baritone with a hint of midlands, is monotonous when there is so much justification/ exposition to get through. Nice eyes and a sympathetic manner don't cut it here.Contrasting with Owens' rather desperate delivery, playing Lancelot is second lead Ioan Griffuds' and his high pitched Welsh tenor (when he's conveying strong emotion) which one can have far too much of, especially in the form of a voice over at the beginning and end (Lancelot from beyond the grave) in his distinctive yodel. The base baritone is supplied by Ray Winstone who plays Ray Winstone playing Bors and why not? No one was ever going to grab an Oscar for this little jaunt. The other guys in Arthur's gang are rather hard to distinguish from each another. I was confused by Ioan Griffud looking identical to Hugh Dancy but no, Hugh Dancy wasn't Lancelot but Galahad. Joel Edgerton played Gawain with a fabulous wig straight out of the Prince Valiant comic strip. Ray Stevenson played a kindly Dragomet with no hair. He died early. Wouldn't you just know! Mads Mikkelsen as Tristan accessorised his inner Samurai with plaits and tatts but still managed to look more vital and interesting than any other actor in the film (hindsight/ not bias), aided by the fact that his dialogue was minimal so he could concentrate on providing a convincing physical warrior ? supple of movement, quick of eye, fast of reflex. He found ways of disassociating himself from the verbiage around him ? when someone wittered on, he just ate his apple ? but he did talk to his bird (succinctly of course). Keira Knightly has an interesting facial structure and that sort of bony body girls want to emulate but she's a plank as an actress ? no emotion ever mars those porcelain features. In her woad she seemed the inspiration for Avatar which conveys her level of animation. Ken Stott did his best to lift the energy levels playing with a cod Italian accent to match the genuine Italian accent of Ivano Marescotti playing Bishop Germanius. I would give blood to have heard the actors' comments over their beer and cigarettesat the end of each day's shoot ? it would have paid to speak Swedish! No wonder Stellan Skarsg?rd and Mads Mikkelsen bonded. The director borrowed some good visual things ? one is the battle on the ice from Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky (1938), another the shot of Arthur on the hill with his streaming banner from Fritz Lang ? Die Nibelungen: Siegfried or Kriemheld's Revenge. Cool ? if you're going to steal, steal from the best! The idea behind this film had potential so I hope everyone got paid well and lived to tell the tale. I am also heartened by the enormous number of people who worked on it - at least it kept the Irish economy afloat in 2003.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has a lot of MAJOR problems, but the mediocre action makes it up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Arthur is a movie that makes the King Arthur stories realistic, and seem like they could've really happened. But the thing is that there never was a King Arthur, or at least we do not have enough evidence to support his existence. So pretty much everything in this movie is made up. That's not necessarily a bad thing though. I am reviewing the Director's Cut since that is the preferred version.If the movie had tried to have kept to realism then I would've liked it a bit more, but the problem is that the movie throws in too many clichés and makes the movie more like a standard action movie instead of a dramatic war tale or even an epic. It's as if the movie is trying to fool the audience by saying that everything is "realistic" but then the next second it does the exact opposite. The realism is inconsistent. The biggest issue with the action is that it makes no sense. The strategy and tactics that Arthur and his men use look dramatic, but are entirely suicidal and beyond ridiculous. To give an example: Arthur and the Picts (or Woades) have a wall between them and the Saxon army. What does Arthur decide to do? He opens the gates to the wall, fires one volley of arrows, and charges them even while they are still over a quarter of a mile of a way. This plan makes no sense whatsoever! Wouldn't you want to use the wall? Isn't that the point of a wall? And even if he didn't use the wall why did he try to charge them even when he had less men? It still would've been much better to keep on firing arrows until they came into close-range seeing as how the Saxons had them out numbered. Oh well, there are still more flaws to find in this movie.OK I will admit that action isn't that bad, and some of the fights are kind of cool. I guess one problem this movie has is that the characters seem invincible. There are 6 or so main characters, and they pretty much single handily charge through 200 enemies and wipe them out without taking an injuries... come on! That doesn't make any sense! The enemies' numbers also constantly change. In one particular scene it shifts back and forth from around a group of 30 to a group of 200 or more. The acting itself isn't all that bad, but the dialogue is filled with some clichés sprinkled here and there, and the characters are all 2- dimension (if even that). Honestly there isn't a good reason to watch this film. The ending battle really wasn't all that great and all of the characters were forgettable. The final wedding scene was kind of laughable. I would not suggest this movie personally.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting, realistic, but a man's movie for sure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Touted as the 'real' story of Arthur of legend, it is beautifully filmed and well acted. However, I found it to be a very typical man's movie. Guinevere is supposed to be near death from starvation and torture when found, yet the men fall for her, despite that she likely smelled and had bad breath, until later when fed and bathed. She remains scantily clad throughout, considering the windy wintry weather, even while bathing, again exposed to the wintry cold inside a sheer tent. chuckle. Who Guinevere is in the scheme of things is never elaborated. Then there's the oft inaudible or unintelligible dialog which is often difficult to understand and the storyline seems spotty at times. Much is not explained, or explainable in the time allotted. And there's the ending, typical mythology, showing Arthur marrying Guinevere and being proclaimed King, yet there are only a small band of people present, supposedly representing 'all' of Britannia. It seemed silly to me. But I did enjoyed the cinematography, the sets, and the gorgeous horses. It does offer a different take on the story, but not nearly enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nobody will ever know if Arthur existed, but what cannot be disputed are the origins of the legend. For over 1000 years the stories have evolved, and the line between myth and reality has become famously blurred.What is indisputable is that, whilst the real people who may have inspired legends have long since faded into the mists of time, their lands remain. The castles, fortresses, forests and lakes are all well documented and exist today as they did in the middle ages when the legends really came to prominence.The vast majority of places exist in the Westcountry of England, namely Cornwall, Devon and Somerset. Some also refer to South Wales. Tintagel is perhaps the one place most often linked to the birth of the legend, and remains here date from the 5th and 6th centuries with the main structure as we know it dated to the 13th century.This is the basis of the stories, and they have not changed for a millennia. Until now. This film has no historical basis at all, and clearly that can be proved. More to the point, it has no basis in any of the Arthurian legends, and that is unforgivable.Had it been presented as fantasy or fiction, and the names changed to remove any links to existing stories, it might have been acceptable. It is not a bad film, though not good by any means. The landscapes are clearly modern - hedgerows, stone walls, cropped grass and trees all point to an enclosed, livestock-based agricultural system that was non-existent in Britain until well into the middle ages.Set aside the bendy plastic swords and wood/fibreglass castle, and the film is pretty good visually, with some attempt at creating atmosphere. The camera work is good, scenery impressive, and the direction competent. Script and acting leave something to be desired.Ultimately though the film is judged by the presentation of a supposed accuracy that could not be further from reality. On that basis it is an insult and a disgrace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stellar performance of Stellan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was watching this film very carefully and when it was over only one thing crossed my mind. I had the feeling that film was undeservedly named "King Arthur" due to brilliant performance of Swedish actor Stellan Skarsg?rd in the role of Saxon leader. Stellan gave so much to his character that King Arthur and Lancelot, as his the most significant knight, look like two boys comparing to Saxon chief. In my opinion, Clive is not a bad actor, but he simply do not have charisma necessary for King Arthur. Perhaps it should have been better if the main role had been entrusted to Ray Stevenson who is the only man in that casting who could be equal to Stellan as a Saxon tribe leader. This could save the film. Thus we have been denied of real pleasure to watch two equal rivals in their fight. On the other hand, scene where Christian priests were burying pagans alive seems so unreal if we have in mind that the early Christians where those who where prosecuted and killed and this was not the age of Spanish inquisition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another hollywoodized version of an epic myth that was trying to be different.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About 4 and a half. If this movie had taken place in some distant mythic land it would have been okay. The cinemas practically threw their money away with this movie. It is not historically accurate in the least. At first I thought that this movie was about a 5 and a half because I thought that at least the battle scenes would be entertaining. On the second time through the movie however, I saw people supposedly hacking through each other but with no wounds only sound effects.Frankly this movie was handed to an inexperienced director and was written by a writer on the spur of inspiration and not confirmed as true history. The worst thing about this movie though is that it says that it is the true rendition of the King Arthur myth. This is incorrect. I particularly dislike this because many people who watch the film will think it is the real thing. In fact the man they based the King Arthur character on in this movie was called Luscious Artorious Castus. His middle name was the Latin version of Arthur which stretches the truth unbearably. Arthur was a real person who repelled a Saxon invasion, only he lived years after the Romans left and didn't necessarily have knights and a round table. If you want King Arthur look elsewhere, this is merely another hollywoodized action movie masquerading under the guise of a famous legend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to believe this was funded by the pentagon to make the American people think the war in Iraq, and more widely, a war against a billion Muslims, is a good idea. Note the 2004 release date, right when the American people began to realize they were conned about Iraq. OK, it was not as overt as 300, but 10 to 1 is a BS battle, but 100 to 1? Come on, bad enough to lie about history, worse yet to lie about battle, but unforgivable to lie about human nature. Read Terry Jones, yeah, the Monty Python guy. Read his serious book about Chaucer*, how these white knights were really opportunistic mercenary warlords. Now that is revisionist, but it is more plausible than this BS. It would have made a better movie. This movie is crap on a lot of levels. It's not a first person shooter (FPS) made into a movie, its a first-person slasher. It gets quite boring watching all this hacking. You mind as well get a job in the Chicago stockyards. I guess the biggest problem is the complete historical lie that that the movie promulgates. Sarmatians? Merlin as a Saxon warlord? A coastal henge used a a war after-party? Trebuchets? Give me a break. King Arthur himself is probably made up. Since the whole movie is BS, it is useless to even ponder, although it did make me realize Hadrian's wall was already built when the myth of King Arther was invented.OK, the realistic depiction is something like this. When told by the Bishop that they were betrayed, they would have killed him, taken those handy pre-printed travel passes and just left to go back to Iran or the steppes, or the Ukraine or wherever the heck Sarmatians come from. Remember, there is no communication faster than horse or boat, so they could have just waltzed home and been done with it. OK, if that is too short a movie, then they would have gone to village, grabbed the kid, and left everyone else behind. Back to the wall by dinner, travel papers retrieved, and home by spring. Still too short? OK, they take the kid, anything with a vagina, and all the other soldiers. Then they use the gate the same way that Agincourt used natural landscape. They make their stand just north of the gate, strategically falling back when they get overwhelmed, and fill the gate with dead bodies, all the while pouring boiling oil on anyone who is stupid enough to get close. Repeat 3 to 5 times, voila, battle won. And the whole thing is still stupid since even the yanks know the Saxons eventually win. That Braveheart-style speech at the end was laughable.Speaking of vaginas, where were they? Some near-dead bimbo from the Woads (actually she would have been Pict), and a few scenes later she is fighting, and then, total ludicrous, leading some amazon dyke troop into actual battle? Oh please. And wasn't she going to boink Lancelot, so that was sure a quick switch when she ends up with Arthur. Great, a two-timing whore as female lead, but she has killin' skilz so we are supposed to like her anyway. In a war-machine recruiting film meant to get impressionable young rural males to join the Marines, they can't really show sweet decent mothers and wives, since that just makes the kid stay home and enjoy life rather than provide the meat deposit slip so the politicians can withdraw 2 trillion dollars and hand it out to their cronies and deadbeat relatives. I guess all we can expect is objectified woman, this is an invented ancient hip-hop culture after all. Yo. Represent. And join the Marines.Go get a big twenty-pound iron pipe. The swing it around for 10 minutes. Note how fatigued you become. You can hardly lift the pipe after a few minutes. Even sword fighters have this problem. They can last 3 or 4 times longer, but these protracted battles are absurd. Also the fact that an arrow or slashing blow kills instantly. Meanwhile they show guys getting run through with spears who keep on fighting. I noted that this mysterious invincibility depended on the characters' billing. Extras dropped dead if you look at them. Leads can get hacked to bits and still fight. They did allude to the primary death in medieval battles, the foot soldiers that get hacked to death by cavalry when the soldiers lose will and run from the battle. Others here have already noted how a knight off his horse is a dead knight. I did like how they strapped down the female leads breasts-- I never knew you could make them so flat.*Chaucer's Knight: The Portrait of a Medieval Mercenary (1980)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but completely inaccurate movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not really sure why they even bothered to attach the name King Arthur to this movie. It would have actually been better if they used completely fictional characters, because then they wouldn't have needed to worry about historical accuracy. Of course, they didn't seem to worry about accuracy anyway, despite what the introduction said.I think that using the characters from the stories of King Arthur actually took away from the story though. I kept trying to reconcile what I saw on the screen with what I knew about King Arthur and British history, and I had very little success. I am no expert in Arthurian legend or British history, but I know enough to know that this movie was way off on both accounts.Despite its historical inaccuracies, it's an entertaining but predictable film. The battle sequences are well done, and the characters are generally well done, although I wish it would have delved into the minor knights more than it did. The good guys were very good, the bad guys were very bad, the hero got the girl in the end and everyone lived happily ever after. It was fun to watch, but not something I would go back to again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderfully ambient movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At last an Arthurian movie which places the events in an historical context. I love this film, for me it is on a par with Gladiator, maybe the Ancient Brits don't have the same glamour as the Romans but it is still highly watchable with excellent music sound track. I really get sense of how Britain was in days of yore and woad! Brilliant Good choice of cast, I thought Clive Owen a bit weak on first view but he improves on watching , and Ioan Griffiths is great as Lancelot. The violence is enough to convey the way things were without sensationalism . Its just a shame about Keira in her leather bra thong! She must have been really chilly! In the face of all those arrows surely a breast plate would have been in order?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, bad marketing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The studio wanted this movie to be a summer blockbuster, but it failed in that role, and consequently didn't last long in theaters. Clive Owen was not yet a star, and no one else in the movie had name recognition in 2004. With its gloomy mood and winter setting, it was out of place as a summer movie. Still, it is definitely worth watching. The ensemble cast is excellent. Owen is riveting as Arthur, and Stellan Skarsgaard is a delicious adversary, as is Til Schweiger. The knights (Ioan Gruffudd, Hugh Dancy, Ray Winstone, Ray Stevenson, Joel Edgerton and Mads Mikkelsen) are wonderful. The theater cut is much more humorous and dedicated to character development, but the director's cut has better battle sequences. It is a totally different take on the Arthurian legends, but I'm not an Arthurphile, so I didn't mind a more historical approach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>that ain't Stonehenge!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was okay, I found it at least an interesting way to pass a Sunday night. The only thing I found disappointing was the scope of it. It seemed to be more of a "day in the life of King Arthur", than covering an of the grand scope of the whole Arthurian Tales. I guess it'd make for a long movie if they included all that, but the slice of life they showed was really small. I also found it too bad that they only introduced Keira Knightly after an hour's worth of movie! Her 'woodland' warrior girl character was interesting to watch, so I found it too bad they didn't use her more.All in all the film felt like it didn't really cover enough of anything. But it was okay to watch and pass an evening.And in response to all the comments on the geography being wrong for Stonehenge - um, in case you people didn't know, there's hundreds of standing stone sites all over England! The only thing the site in the movie had in common with Stonehenge was that it had big stones. The shape, the orientation, even the number f stones was wrong. I don't think this is meant to be Stonehenge, just an ancient ritual place. So enough with the Stonehenge comments... that's like identifying all over Ireland as shamrocks and leprechauns. Get over yourselves already. It's not Stonehenge, it's not meant to be Stonehenge, so stop you're whinging already!Webster</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW! King Arthur was really surprisingly awesome! When I watched King Arthur, I was hoping for a little movie like Eragon, with battle scenes a little bit unrealistic, but no. King Arthur's battle scenes are surprisingly realistic. The actors do such great jobs, so we really get attached to the characters. Ioan Gruffudd's character (Lancelot) was one of the coolest character. Too bad Lancelot had to die in the end. Keira Knightley and Clive Owen (Arthur and Guenievre) are both really convincing, and the backgrounds were beautiful! So King Arthur should suite more than your needs on a Saturday evening or another occasion. It's a movie filled with excitement, sadness and action. Great movie for adults and pre-teens!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different version of the classic story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Arthur was NOT what I was expecting. I was, having deliberately avoided paying much attention to reviews and trailers, expecting the usual Knights, Round Table, Camelot type of deal. Instead I got a "re-imagining". Now, I'm usually the first person to yell "foul" when such a movie rears its ugly head, mainly because the re-imagining destroys my sense of right and wrong about the story and often completely wrecks the characters (see Battlestar Galactica - the new series). However, in a story as tired and done to death as the legend of Arthur, I found the hugely different storyline to be a vast breath of fresh air.Never mind any historical inaccuracies....I overlook such things so long as the movie is good enough to stand on its own two feet. And King Arthur is. It reminded me somewhat of The Thirteenth Warrior, a film which I also like, in both style and story. The cast all give good accounts of themselves, though I remained unconvinced by Clive Owen's Arthur throughout the film. Someone with a bit more charisma might have done better in the role. However, Clive wasn't awful, so it wasn't a major issue.There are a couple of points which did make me think "Wha?" The chief of these was why was the Roman Villa beyond the wall? A wall, it seemed, whose main access gate hadn't been opened for years. Hmmm.But other than that, I found nothing irritating enough to distract me from the film, which was a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours.It was different: It was MEANT to be! Ignore the poor saps who post here about "being bored before the opening credits finished" or, my favourite, rant on about "mythical inaccuracies". Give it a view and make your own mind up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Movie of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie to be the most realistic version of Arthur and His Knights. How refreshing to see Guinevere as a feisty warrior rather than a pampered princess. The legends of Arthur and His Knights fascinate me. I found the movie very historically correct and it showed the beginnings of what would become the Saxon wars showing their brutality towards the people who got in their way. This movie is my favorite of all time and I have watched it several times. It is so sad when Lancelot and Tristan die, but remember - Fallen Knights return as trusty horses that will protect their riders. I especially liked the final shot of the three horses running free. Afterall, the fallen Knights were free of Roman rule and it is only fitting that their trusted steeds should run free as well. I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in Arthur and His Knights. It is especially refreshing to watch the movie in Knight Vision. The tidbits at the bottom of the page are very informative. I might add as a final thought: the soundtrack is wonderful as well.</fullReview>

Fugue should have picked an-all star cast, instead of actors that are not really gonna be well remembered apart from Clive Own, Ioun Gruffod and Ray Stevenson.An overview of this film would be to say it is very good in places, and a nice and bloody movie you would want to see.

		<fullReview>I've never critiqued a critique. But some people confuse memorizing the multisyllabic words in the dictionary and mixing that rote skill with pontification, condescension, and self-contradiction, as being the same as clever. For the critic below who starts out acknowledging the Arthur is MYTHICAL, he spent much of his review talking about historically inaccurate it was. How can Myth be inaccurate? By definition it is neither real, nor a history lesson, nor a documentary. And what was with the personal jabs? Just because some reviewer failed in his attempt at Mensa membership, is no reason to take out his anger on a pleasant little piece of cinematic distraction. If this film had attempted to deliver on all the demands of said reviewer, it would've been 46 hours long. I viewed this film in a theater. If you plan on using it to write a history paper, you'll be in trouble. If you're looking for hero's and swordplay, you'll enjoy this film. And I'm sorry for the "calling out" from this IMDb fan. But the pomposity on IMDb get's overwhelming at times and needs to be commented on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guinevere reminiscent of real life Queen Boudicca....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the extended director's cut, and I can say the fight sequences are pretty realistic.Someone criticized how ragtag and crude the Britons were, esp Merlin. But, having read and seen documentaries about the natives of Britain during those times, I can say this is a pretty good portrayal.As for Guinevere being a warrior, her portrayal reminded me of a real life warrior queen, Boudicca, who united the various tribes in Britain for the last revolt against the Romans.She was a tough cookie. After her daughters and herself were raped and beaten by the Romans, she came back with vengeance and showed no mercy. In all, she killed about 70,000 Romans.In their final historic battle, although they vastly outnumbered the Roman legion sent to subdue them, they nevertheless fell prey to superior Roman military tactics.Boudicca was never heard from again, rumored to have either been among the slaughtered, or committed suicide.So, from this perspective, the movie did a fairly accurate job in portraying the pagan tribes in Britain.HOWEVER, I can't help but compare it to Gladiator, since some who were involved in the creation of that movie were also involved in this.No doubt, the creators were aiming to make an epic as rousing as Gladiator. They certainly had the right subject matter in King Arthur.But in this effort it fell far, far short. It just didn't have the same emotional depth and resonance. It lacked that magical something that was in Gladiator. Hans Zimmer's score for this movie wasn't anything like that for Gladiator, and all the actors here lacked the depth and conviction of those in the other.The characters here simple weren't as likable/detestable as those in Gladiator. I didn't find myself drawn in as much.Maybe it's unfair to draw a comparison between the two movies. Taken on its own terms (at least the director's cut), the movie isn't bad, and the military fight sequences are certainly comparable to Gladiator, though there are several plot holes, not to mention narration by a character who's dead by film's end.At any rate, this is as far from the classic Arthur and the movie Exaclibur as you can get, and you can debate the historic accuracy I guess, but King Arthur is a legend anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent review/post by friedman-8; thanks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My take on this movie is similar to what you can find in friedman-8's first-rate writeup. The film is more historicalicious than historical, but I still appreciate the attempts to cross some cultural mindsets to tell a story. So while the notion that Roman conscripted Sarmations would be defending Hadrian's Wall is pretty goofy, at least young people who saw this have now grasped at a non-trivial example of how Rome operated, by massive employment of taxation and conscription.As a movie, I rather liked this. In another review, the recent movie Troy was mentioned. Troy was a catastrophe for me, primarily because it was a horrible bastardization of Homer's allegorical masterpiece. You can't break the foundations of an archetypal story and remain with anything but a cartoonish fiasco. There was no need to 'interpret' Troy, since it is a work of fiction to begin with. Eric Bana, and, to a lesser extent, Orlando Bloom, save that movie from flat out disaster.Getting back to King Arthur, I find I have some respect for the story and the characters because of their simple fallibility. I walked away from the the movie feeling like they, quite decently, portrayed regular people thrown into in an irregular, changing time, rather that the typical superhero fantasy story. The scenery and cinematography are first rate.Make sure you see the director's cut; much more gore (read more realistic), pretty much what you would see when people get hacked up with blades and hammers. Its not pretty and not meant to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad, If Taken for What It Is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'King Arthur' is a curious production that has understandably aroused quite a bit of disagreement among critics, historians, and fans of the Arthurian legend. But really--this is a Jerry Bruckheimer production, people! Let's keep the operation in perspective! Bruckheimer has always been about one thing, and one thing only: spectacle, a.k.a. cheap thrills. 'King Arthur' might be gift-wrapped as a revisionist history, but it's a popcorn movie, plain and simple, and as such, it is for the most part a success.The main premise of the film, of course, is that the Arthur of legend was not, in fact, the magical king of Camelot, but, rather, a half-Roman, half-Celtic warlord--the captain of a clan of Sarmatian knights pressed into service to the Roman Empire as young men. Our tale is narrated by Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), who (like Arthur) is introduced as a young boy on the day of his departure for his 15-year term of service to the Emperor of Rome. The film jumps ahead to the final days of that term, rejoining the characters as seasoned warriors: the familiar names are there--Arthur (Clive Owen) and Lancelot, joined by Gawain, Galahad, Bors, Dagonet, and Tristan. Although most of these characters bear little to no characteristic resemblance to their legendary precedents (Galahad, for instance, is traditionally described as Lancelot's son, not his contemporary; Bors is usually described as pious and devout, as opposed to his rugged, profane characterization in this film; Dagonet--heroic in this version--is usually represented as Arthur's court fool), the actors each manage to project strong, distinct characters for the audience to identify with. Especially strong are Ray Winstone (Sexy Beast) as Bors, Ray Stevenson as a quietly heroic Dagonet, and Mads Mikkelsen, who nearly steals the film as Tristan, here presented as a falconer and expert archer in Asian/Mongolian-style dress and armaments. The fine performances of these actors were clearly noted by casting directors: Winstone is set to play another early English epic hero--Beowulf--in a forthcoming adaptation; Stevenson was cast as another formidable but good-hearted warrior in HBO's 'Rome'; Mikkelsen--a star in his native Denmark, but an unknown elsewhere prior to 'King Arthur'--is set to play the villain in the forthcoming James Bond film, 'Casino Royale.' The basic plot positions Arthur and his knights as having earned their freedom towards the beginning of the Roman Empire's decline and fall. No longer able to afford the human and material expense of holding its most distant territorial outposts, Rome has decided to abandon Britain, leaving it to be fought over by its various tribal factions and invaders from neighboring lands. The history is fuzzy here, but again, this is an action movie, not a documentary, so picking apart the historical inaccuracies seems beside the point.The Romans are in full retreat, but the Bishop Germanius (Ivano Marescotti) won't give the Sarmatian knights their discharge papers until they complete a final task: rescue a young Roman noble beloved by the Pope whose family estate lies in the path of the Saxon invaders. The men reluctantly accept the charge out of loyalty to Arthur, who prays to his Christian god for the safety of his pagan knights (another big deviation from Arthurian legend, in which Christianity figures heavily as part of the code of chivalry).The film's advertising gives top-billing (along with the infamous digitally-enhanced bust) to the sublime Keira Knightley, but her Guinevere appears late in the action, so don't rent this one expecting to see too much of her. In this version of the story, Guinevere is the daughter of Merlin (Steven Dillane), who is initially Arthur's enemy, as he leads a tribe of Woads (a version of the Picts), native peoples of Britain who wage war on the Roman invaders Arthur and his Sarmatian Knights serve. Eventually, Arthur and Merlin join forces (thanks to Guinevere) to defend Britain against the invading Saxons, led by Cerdic (Stellan Skaarsgard, who seems to be really enjoying himself playing a bloodthirsty viking).This scenario affords director Antoine Fuqua plenty of room for expansive battle sequences, some of which meet and even exceed the standard set by 'Braveheart' for the genre. There's quite a bit of gore, and at times the battles seem endless and repetitive, though there are a few fine sequences, especially a battle that takes place on the frozen surface of a lake (nevermind that a Saxon army would never have invaded in winter; snow battles are cool!). The first half of the film allows for some nice, subtle character development for the knights, but without the familiar antagonists and problems (Mordred, Morgan La Fey, the Lancelot-Guinevere-Arthur love triangle, which is barely hinted at in the film), Arthur is a generic hero whose battle-cries for freedom are both contradictory and achingly derivative of 'Braveheart.' Clive Owen is a fine actor who acquaints himself well here, but his character is dull and one-dimensional, and seems much less compelling than secondary characters like the enigmatic Merlin, the intrepid Tristan, and the courageous Dagonet.Nevertheless, I felt like I got what I paid for from 'King Arthur.' The acting is above average, the costumes are cool, the villain is nasty and scary, the fight sequences are well-staged and visceral, and the soundtrack appropriately martial and dramatic. While I can understand why Old English history and Arthurian legend buffs might object to it, I think I'd prefer this film to one which tried to recreate the aspects of the myth already portrayed in other Arthur films, especially 'Excalibur,' which, for my money, is the gold standard of King Arthur flicks.</fullReview>

Not to mention each dialect the actors had in the film was a wonderful "ReAl" touch. I love how they incorporated the old religion into this film, most people think Christianity was the supreme religion, they didn't know that pagans were forced/killed/tortured into submission, nor did they know that when Christians had pagan "slaves" if u will building there churches and such that they incorporated their own beliefs into the architecture...Anyway, Great Movie.

		<shortDescription>King Arthur, although not historically correct, is still very enjoyable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you liked "Gladiator", "Troy" or "Kingdom of Heaven", you will probably like King Arthur. These are not the knights of "A Knights Tale". The story is set in a slightly earlier period (2AD) than to when the legendary Arthur was thought to have lived (4 - 6AD). Basically it's about a half Britton, half Roman (Arthur), his "knights", his "Lady" and a quest.To me it was an enjoyable movie. The acting was good, sometimes even great. The battle scenes are big, well done and believable. This could very well have been the legend of Arthur and is believable even though historically not accurate.The film's marketing department claims it is "The Untold True Story That Inspired the Legend". If you are looking for a film about the "historical" Arthur, then this is not it. In fact there is no "true" account of King Arthur. There are only bits and pieces, legends, folklore, stories, clues, deductions and tales spanning centuries on which our modern day romantic hero King Arthur is based.Also, like most Hollywood productions, there are a lot of "mistakes" in the film. Its seems as though the filmmakers took all the references and tried to concoct one "true" account.If you were disappointed with "King Arthur" for being historically inaccurate then you will also be disappointed by Gladiator, Troy, Alexander and Kingdom of Heaven which are also historically inaccurate in depicting a certain time period. Nonetheless they are thoroughly enjoyable movies.The nice thing about watching this on DVD is you get to see the "Making of .." part and hear all the commentary as well. Most of the time the film maker will tell you where they got their information, how they deviated from the "truth" and why. After all this is about entertainment and someone else's impression of the truth or what could have been believable. Unless it is made for the history channel, it does not have to have a scrap of evidence to it.I watched this and was entertained by the action scenes and to see King Arthur depicted slightly different, and more believable to me, than any other film done about King Arthur.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked it in spite of some rather serious flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-- Based on the Director's Cut -- If anything, this movie is a highly unusual take at the beloved legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. In fact, apart from the names of the characters and the location (England), it has next to nothing to do with it. Also, in spite of claims that this is the "true" story of King Arthur, I seriously doubt that this has much to do with real history. Sure, there were Romans in England, and Hadrian's Wall was a real structure, but this movie is full of historical inaccuracies and anachronisms. I have nothing against this, but please don't claim it's the real story when it really just isn't.Another gripe I have with this movie is that the legend of King Arthur is abused to tell a very contemporary and rather moralistic story of freedom and equality. I love freedom and equality as much as anybody, but trust me, this is something people in the Roman and Middle Ages really weren't familiar with and that didn't start appearing until the 18th century. It also doesn't help that there are some fairly easy-to-point-out inconsistencies in the entire story: if Arthur values equality so much, then why does he become a king (who is by definition not equal to the rest of his people) and how does he combine his belief in free will with his belief that it's God's will that Lancelot dies instead of him? Then again, maybe I'm reading a bit too much into this. In spite of its fairly heavy-handed approach, this really isn't a movie that shouldn't be taken too seriously. And judged as entertainment only it's certainly very decent. For one, Arthur and his knights are a very charming bunch, and they really come to live due to some fine acting. Of course they're all pretty flat characters, but they ARE colorful.Next, "King Arthur" looks absolutely marvelous. The landscapes, shrouded in fog and snow, are a sight to behold, and combined with the great musical score and the good-looking costume and set design they do create a really epic atmosphere.Also, I have to say that I really did enjoy the action sequences. For the most part, they are truly spectacular, without ever becoming too unrealistic (no bullet time here, fortunately, just good old-fashioned sword fighting). There's also plenty of gore, at least in the director's cut that I watched. Also, fortunately, the action doesn't suffer from the frenzied editing style often seen in similar movies: at least, here you can see what's going on.In the end, this leaves me with mixed feelings about this movie. For the most part, it's a really well-made, exciting action movie. It's just a shame that it takes itself so dreadfully seriously, with a rather clumsy message and a lot of false claims about historical accuracy.*** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was actually very excited about this film. I was on exchange to Scotland at the time, studying actually this period in history. I know that there was a historical Arthur, Gwenfyar etc., but I also loved the mythology behind it. I also love these kinds of period pieces.1.) First- I am an Archaeology student- WHO was fighting WHO now? All the groups looked exactly the same and I had no idea who they were exactly fighting all the time- is that the outskirts of the Roman army, the Saxons, villagers what? 2.) I did like that Gwenfyar seem to have a pair, and they made her Pictish. They could've gone into what she was a little more, and who those people fighting with her were. I don't like that they cut out the love triangle between her, Lancelot and Arthur.3.) Uh, Arthur was NOT Roman, or from the Roman Empire. He was part of the groups (Celts living in England, or as some call him "The Pictish King".). I don't know why they felt they needed to make him Roman.4.) Most of the groups that encountered the Romans fought with every fiber of their being. The Roman's didn't even go further into Scotland because they were afraid. 5.) I understand the need to make a "historical" piece. But why, with the exception of a tiny appearance by Merlin, cut out any religious backgrounds of the people? The Roman Empire, for all its faults, was very free in regards to religion. Up until Constantine, that is. Couldn't they at least have Morgaine, Lady of the Lake, etc., as just plain old priestesses? The Druids gave council to the rulers of Kingdoms throughout the British Isles. Again, a reason to make Arthur a Briton.6.) Unsatisfactory, anti-climactic ending. So they have a big wedding and thats it? Very, very bad. Read Mists of Avalon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer of this film in the cinema, I thought "Wov, it looks great, and it is always fun to watch movies from the medieval times...". But it didn't turn out to be like that.First of all, the story lacks unity. Yes, we are indeed with our knights right from the beginning to the end but the events are so discrete that by the end of the movie, I found myself watching a war without even feeling anything for those who are involved. I was kinda on the knights side, with all the things they've done and how legendary they were so that they should not be killed... The feeling was not strong, shortly. The story didn't quite developed in a fashion that will make me strongly favor one side. I expect a classic Hollywood movie to make me shed a tear,stress my heart such that I have trouble breathing normally, or at least make me feel disappointed and uneasy when one of the main characters is lost. (Like Qui-gon in Star Wars ep. 1 or Trinity in Matrix) Unfortunately this is not the case here. They fought and they died... (Lancelot and the other guy) For god's sake, they were fighting in a battlefield with some people dying every second. And also, they died for a cause they didn't even favor strongly, neither they had understood fully if you've asked me.For the character performances, the only thing a found significant was Keira Knightley. Although joining the scene around the middle of the story, she took all the glory to herself, even shadowing the mighty King Arthur, the man who gave the movie it's name! Actually everyone besides Arthur did fairly well, he was too dull for the character, from his sound tone to the look on his face, it was like the role had been given to him without his will and like. Maybe it was his (Clive Owen) performance that ruined what could have been better. Sometimes a single leading character can change the entire feel of a film, even though the story itself may not be fascinating. (and the biggest examples of that are the Schwarzenegger movies, which I always have fun watching without expecting much) The leading character's performance is that important.Other than these, it was a Hollywood movie in the end and carried that feeling until the end. (I'm talking about the budget here) That is what prevented it from getting a 2 or 3 from me; there is a cross line between a Hollywood movie and a world movie, and this thing is right above that cross line.I don't know, maybe it was because I had so high expectations for this movie that has made me feel so disappointed when watching it. Maybe if I watched it never seeing its trailer and never hearing a thing about it, I would have more fun and say to myself "Umm, not bad :)" in the end. Actually this is what this film is all about; not bad, not good thus I think it's just at the center.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had seen maybe one preview for King Arthur before it came out and didn't hear anything about it afterwards. After awhile a buddy of mine rented the film and we both watched it. We were both highly disappointed.The story of King Arthur is retold with alleged true origins being used from recently discovered documents. Arthur and his band of Knights are soldiers for the Roman Army. After word reaches the Roman held city of London that the Woads are invading Roman territory, Arthur (Clive Owen) and his Knights are sent out on there last mission before being set free. They're orders are to rescue a Roman Noble and his family from the invaders whom live in upper Britain. Arthur and his knights experience arguments that could easily make a friend an enemy to only find the next day that everyone has made up and there all merry. After reaching the noble, Arthur makes a gruesome discovery with local villagers and draws his sword at least a dozen times, and takes the nobles and villagers by force into the mountains. Suddenly the Woads, who are at least a days march behind the much smaller company appear. The army is sent out and in one of the most ridiculous battles I've ever seen, Arthur and his 5 companions hold off an army of around a thousand. From hear the army gets even more ridiculous with Merlin just randomly popping up out of the woods, acting like a lunatic who gives advice, then disappears. But the end, I was so tired of long speeches and so called emotional love scenes that I was ready to just flick it off. but for some stupid reason, I left it on. The visuals aren't bad but visual effects are used way to much. I did like the setting of Britain and the background of Arthur but he is portrayed horribly. Clive Owen is bland, boring, and and just plain silly. The battles are mediocre at best. The end battle made no sense whatsoever. I tried to not think of the original novel and tried to watch a more believable retelling of the tale but found this more unbelievable then the book. Some scenes are well done but the movie in its entirety is a big disappointment. Clive Owen makes you want to go to sleep, Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot has so many "emotional" scenes that he should be in a soap opera, and Kiera Knightley as Guinevere is just there for eye candy.I may have bashed this film a little more then I should of but it really wasted two hours of my time. I found it absolutely ridiculous from the battles to the characters and thought it to be a huge disappointment.King Arthur. Starring: Clive Owen, Ioan Gruffudd, Kiera Knightley, and Stephen Dillane.2 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film I have seen once and listened to a second time as I was averse to watching it...why? Well, First time round in the cinema...great soundtrack, breathtaking fights, good war tactics and battle ideas...but the voices were annoying. When we have such a visual film, why does the dialogue suffer. Clive Owen was the most wooden sounding choice for king Arthur. He looked the part but was not inspiring to his men or to the characters legend. Lancelot, Mr Gruffudd, was the most overacted and uneven accent. The leader of the Saxons was as bad. Keira Knightly was the best of the lot but how posh can you get during a film...Ray Winstone was the truest to his accent and his part was brought to the fore by a sterling performance. Continuity and casting needed to improve to bring off an immense idea like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>KING ARTHUR (Un-rated Director's Cut)RATING = 5/10. A creative take on the old familiar tale that is less satisfying than the original. The characters do not develop fully in this dreary movie, leaving the viewer uninterested at many points in the film. A great fight on a frozen lake and a decent battle at the conclusion slightly redeem this movie.The GOOD. The storyline is new. A great fight scene on the ice in the mountains. (Easily the best scene.) Great looking armor. Keira Knightly is entertaining, pleasing to look at, and believable as a battle-ready warrior.The BAD. The fun has been drained away by the generic story. The setting is very gray and dreary for the entire duration of the film. The characters don't develop enough for the viewer to care about them. The older love-triangle tale is more entertaining. Merlin looks like a homeless man or Rob Zombie. Clive Owen does not come across as the type of man who could lead a kingdom. (Not strong enough.) The leader of the Saxons seems to be miscast. A cheesy ending doesn't help this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This King Arthur is a mishmash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have nothing against a reinterpretation of the legend of King Arthur. This movie however lacks a coherent tone and appears to have been directed by several people who didn't even know each other. For instance Clive Owen, with his working class British accent, seems strange commanding actors with upper class accents. It's not that it couldn't possibly happen, it just should have been addressed by the film. The knights are all supposed to be from the same tribe.The actors are individually quite able, but often don't seem to be talking to each other. The dialogue is laughable. When one of the knights balks at the difficulty of an upcoming assignment Arthur actually asks him "how many times have we snatched victory from the jaws of defeat?" At another point a warrior is told to "Stand down." This is supposed to be the Dark Ages!It was nice to see Keira Knightley's Guinevere as an archer and warrior, but her bikini battle outfit was another pointless anachronism. I didn't feel much chemistry between her and Clive Owen's Arthur, and he seemed oddly passive in their love scene... particularly for such a passionate warrior. Is that a J. Crew sweat shirt he wears in the following scene?The gore during the battle scenes was plentiful and lengthy, a poor man's rip off of Gladiator. In another scene ice breaks in a way that defies the laws of physics... though maybe that was meant as a display of Merlin's magic. The reinterpretation of such a well known legend is an interesting idea, but here it is mangled into a mishmash of a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who doesn't love a good King Arthur tale? Excaliber remains my favorite Arthur movie, for its darkness and just plain strangeness at times. This film, King Arthur, claims it is telling the true story behind the Arthurian legend. Well, OK. I didn't check up on the facts but I'll go with it for now.The Good: The winter scenes are terrific. You practically shiver as the characters make their way through icy, snowy passes. And some of the shots with blowing snow as the characters talk to each other are fantastic. The actor who plays the leader of the Saxons is very good, giving us a confident, yet enigmatic villain.The Bad: Clive Owen seems too old to be Arthur. And too bleak. He has morals, but we are unsure how he developed them. There is no overarching dream of a Camelot, and there is little in the way of explanation as to why he acts as he does, given the world he lives in.The Ugly: This is why the movie barely deserves a 6 - editing. Individual scenes are done well, but the transitions from one plot development to another are vague and convenient. You often find yourself saying, hmm, OK, well I guess that happened, but it doesn't seem like it should have been so simple. I would say more but this spoilers rule has me worried about being blackballed for life.King Arthur is a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A much different King Arthur tale, I like it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is well established now that many negative comments and reviews have been written against this version of the 'King Arthur' tales. Knowing that, I tried to view it with an open mind and no particular expectations. I found the whole 2+ hours a fine movie, a very interesting and different version of King Arthur tale. It is a tale, a legend if you want, and even if King Arthur, Lancelot, Guinevere and all the others existed, no one really knows what the tale really was. So I viewed this one as just another possibility.Clive Owen plays Arthur who had been 'recruited' into Roman service as a young teen. The bulk of the movie is 15 years later, having served well and coming to the end of his servitude, looking forward to making a home in Rome. His men were looking forward to settling down somewhere in England, south of the Hadrian Wall. The north section was over run with Saxon heathens who took pleasure in killing their adversaries.There was a catch. A bishop representing Rome gave Arthur and his men one last assignment, to go into the north of England and rescue a young nephew of favor, and see that he was sent to Rome unharmed. A difficult task, but Arthur and his men made it, the defining battle came on a frozen lake, and sacrificing his life ultimately, one of Athhur's men used his axe to crack the ice to seal the fate of the enemies.Safely south of the 'wall', Arthur's men were content to be headed home after being given their freedom. But Arthur decided to stay and fight, his homeland, England, was worth it. His men after a short while turned around and joined him in a fierce battle. Guinevere, whom Arthur had rescued from an unholy prison when north of the 'wall' turned out to be a fierce fighter also. In the final battle, just south of the 'wall', and using smoke and fire as part of the strategy, killed all the invading Saxons from the north. In the end, there was a simple ceremony near the sea, amidst a structure of large stones similar to Stonehenge, where Arthur and Guinevere are married and Arthur is chosen as king. The idea that being king is an achievement, not something you get just by pulling a sword out of a grave or a stone.Ioan Gruffudd was Lancelot, Joel Edgerton was Gawain, Hugh Dancy was Galahad, Ray Winstone was great as large and excitable Bors, Keira Knightley was a sightly Guinevere, and perhaps the best was Stellan Skarsg?rd as Cerdic, the leader of the band of invading Saxons, a powerful warrior who would not hesitate to put a knife through his own son's heart if he thought he was giving less than 100% effort and loyalty. His final battle was the showdown with Arthur.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As something else then the famous legends of Camelot, this might have been a tad better, but although I did appreciate some elements of the movie, the rest has left me really unimpressed.It seemed to me an unoriginal mix of Braveheart, Gladiator with a slight touch of The Last of The Mohicans (the music even reminded me of the last two).Possibly due to the dialogues, I felt the character set-up was unconvincing, the historical facts sadly abused and the intensity pretty much inexistent (except the ice scene with Dagonet which was rather good) and despite many attempts at typical hero dilemmas, romance and male bonding, nothing really touched me.Although I love many of the actors in that movie, it seemed a poor choice for them to star in it, except possibly for Keira Knightley who actually manages to be pretty hot even covered in grime.Redeeming points were the cast, the artistic direction (which is quite nice) and a couple of shots where I'll admit the girlie part in me loved the incredibly cool eyes of Clive Owen and managed to forget all about the movie while I drooled a tad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caught firmly in no man's land...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The legend of Arthur, an early King of what would eventually become the so-called United Kingdom, has been rendered in many ways. It has been done as a serious drama, a comedy, and even a cameo appearance at the end of a Kevin Costner film, where Arthur was, ironically, played by Sean Connery, a fierce Scottish nationalist. Jerry Bruckheimer, however, pulls off a Peter Jackson by taking one of Britain's most revered legends and pulling it down to the lowest common denominator.If Bruckheimer's goal was to make Jackson's rendition of Return Of The King look good, he failed by making King Arthur at least somewhat cohesive. And therein lies the big problem. It is not good enough to work on its own merit, and yet it is not bad enough to be good as an unintentional comedy. So all around, the entire film can be stated as a failure that sits in no man's land.Let's start with the casting. The Knights are not well-developed enough to really be memorable, but the actors make a decent enough fist of them to at least say they put in the effort. Even Lancelot, who is presented as being ambidextrous here, really doesn't get much more than one dimension. But the real problem here is the man they cast to play King Arthur. Clive Owen, whose inauspicious performance in Beyond Borders was enough to make many a struggling actor wonder why they bother trying to develop their craft, is so unconvincing that it is hardly any wonder this effort literally came and went by itself at the box office. He sounds more like a member of the Trainspotting cast than a Roman Knight. Keira Knightley, in the role of Guinevere, acts rings around him.Another big problem is all the made-up elements that try to demystify the Arthur legend. I can accept the idea of Arthur and his compatriots starting out as a Roman Knight, becoming disillusioned with Rome, and forming a Kingdom in Great Britain. What I cannot believe is Saxons, Woads, and Romans all fighting one another in the same island and time period. In the time period claimed for this film, the Romans would be fighting Celts and/or Gauls. The only reference to Woad I can find in more credible stories is the plant's use to paint the faces of guerrilla raiders who sacked English encampments in Scotland, about a thousand years after the Norman sacking of England. Speaking of which, no mention is made anywhere of Normans.But it gets worse. Although the battle scenes are beautifully shot (no shaky-cam here, thankfully), the sheer number of mechanical and scientific inaccuracies is dazzling. In one battle that takes place on ice, a Saxon archer fires an arrow at the Knights, only to have it stop short. While I can accept that the Knights may have bows with better range, what I can't stomach is how the Saxons with crossbows don't line up and fire instead, at least not until they're nearly a mere forty feet away from the Knights. Crossbows fling bolts at a much faster speed than bows can ever hope to accomplish, and therefore should have a much greater range, not to mention armour-piercing ability, than the bows. I also find it difficult to believe that the "Woads", who do not even seem to have basic housing, can slap together trebuchets for a major battle.Then again, given that they couldn't even get the accentuation in Stellan Skarsg?rd's name right, I would hardly expect a Bruckheimer production to correctly depict logistics of fifth-century English warfare.I gave the director's cut of King Arthur a two out of ten. The acting is sometimes bad enough to appall, but not bad enough to amuse. Ditto for the script, the effects, and most of the designs. As a result, King Arthur stands firmly in No Man's Land. It is worth watching once, just for a bit of amusement (preferably while you are doing something else, just so the time is not completely wasted), but this is far from a keeper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but still very much the same as always</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many negative reviews and quite a few positive reviews made me not prepared for what I was about to see. I have seen many King Arthur tales from nights of the Round Table, Excalibur to First Knight so what it so different and unique about this new telling of the legend. Well not much really apart from it's new idea of Arthur being more of a general than a king and n some level it works quite well and still stays true to the legend we know all about.It would be fair to say that this has Jerry Bruckermer written all over it, you just have to listen the music score to figure that out. Training Day, Tears of the Sun and now King Arthur which is a big change of scenery from the streets of LA to the medieval origins of King Arthur but he still comes out on top. The version we saw of King Arthur is by far not the one Antone Fuua intended for us, Disney who are trembling as we speak got the last say and released a more candy coasted summer blockbuster where Antoine's is apparently more dark and gory. I thought for the first one hour and thirty minutes we had all this and much more but I think the end just wasn't up to scratch and seemed all to familiar from other films we have seen in the past. I am still undecided whether Clive Owen was a good choice. He slightly reminds me of Nigel Terry's performance in Arthur in Excalibur but less character. Ioan Gruffud was the best casting of this entire film and it doesn't stop there. All the knights of the round table were all perfectly put together as they show the best chemistry of friendship a film has done in a long long time. Their bond between knights and friendship is very touching and works well on screen. Keira Knightely wasn't as bad as everyone makes out but she didn't have to be there as she didn't really bring anything to the story apart from wanting to get off with Arthur or making eye contact on more than one occasion to Lancelot so poor Keira really. I thought the movie overall brought something new to the medieval table. The scene on the ice with the two opposing armies was fantastic and keeps you on the edge of your seat amongst other scenes but because of the distributors or whatever they are called, to keep them at bay they had to keep the film quite bittersweet at times which ruins the film really but that is the way it is these days and it is something we have to get use to but that's why we cherish and look forward to DVD's as I am sure a director's cut is to be graced upon us to share wit the rest of the world. Don't go into the film with the idea that it is going to be really bad because you will be surprised by one or three scenes which will make the film a better experience, so take it with a pinch of salt and just watch it for what it is which is an enjoyable and meaningful medieval movie.</fullReview>

It might have had some similarities to braveheart but the awesome battle scenes with all the violence that rocked in braveheart it missed out due to the toning down to pg-13 rating.2 - Not nearly an epic like it should have been. The movie should have been 3 hours.. not 2 hours. Just not enough was put into the movie.3 - The story was TOO "real". Not that by any stretch of the imagination this is based on more than a little "real" evidence anyways. Just nothing at all spectacular about the movie.

		<fullReview>I had high expectations for King Arthur, being a fan of medieval/roman/etc type movies I usually like the movie even if it isn't all that great. However there is NO WAY to like "King Arthur". First of all the movie goes on and on, but nothing seems to happen, I was VERY irritated by the lack of coverage of the knight's voyage to and from the rescue mission. They just leave the "north wall" then bang, they'r at the destination... Also the movie talks a lot about the "powerful sarmation knights", however, it lacks any kind of demonstration of these knights power. The ONLY battle which they engage in does not show them as the powerfull warriors they are cut out to be.Perhaps if I had expected a low-budget, low-time film I might have enjoyed it a bit more, but as it is, King Arthur managed to inch its way into my 10 worst movies of all time. Do yourself a favor and keep away from this one...watch "First Knight" which depicts the same story in a MUCH more entertaining and artistic form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I really disliked this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason, my thoughts are that if you've seen one epic you've seen them all. This could not be any more true here in this film which seems to cliché to describe accurately. It tries to crack jokes which clearly don't lend themselves to the storyline. For example, the "baby holding an apple" joke is not only inappropriate when we are dealing with one of the all-time greatest heroes in history but it is also not even original. A joke like this was made before in 'Austin Powers: Goldmember'. Now how can a historical epic use a crude satire on British Intelligence as a reference to a joke? Honestly. What really ticked me about this movie was the acting. I know I wasn't around in the Dark Ages but I'm pretty sure that King Arthur would've been a fine leader not a block of wood as is portrayed by Clive Owen. And Keira Knightley as Guinevere? I really dislike her. She seems laboured in her acting and delivers every line as if she's reading it. Granted, the direction is great. But, clearly, Antoine Fuqua has nothing to work with here in this run-of-the-mill, laboured epic. * *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much has been made of the historical significance of Antoine Fuqua's take on the story of Arthur and his knights. The ad men purport it to be the `untold true story that inspired the legend', while scornful detractors have dismissed it as being as fictional as the traditional myth. Unfortunately, the end product leaves the viewer caring little either way.Far from the magical medieval world of Camelot with all its swashbuckling sword-fights and sorcery, Fuqua sets his story a thousand years earlier in the barren, misty wastelands of Northern England. A group of Sarmatian conscripts plucked as boys from their Eastern European homeland to fulfil a debt of gratitude to the Romans have just completed their 15 year tour of duty in Britain. Having served under legendary Roman soldier Arthur (Clive Owen), they have developed into a tight-knit fighting unit revered by their public and feared by the insurgents who plot raids from North of Hadrian's Wall.The Romans' occupancy of Britain is coming to an end. Arthur dreams of a return to Rome with all its culture and liberty, while his knights are looking forward to going home to Sarmatia, but before they can leave they are given one final mission to rescue a wealthy Roman family caught in the far North in the middle of a Saxon invasion.Hence we have the time-honoured scenario of a bunch of brave warriors outnumbered by thousands to one marching glibly into certain death, wise-cracking all the way. It is fairly standard stuff: The pretty boys with the wavy locks, neatly trimmed beards and chiselled features, led by the irritatingly handsome Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd) are offset by the lumbering, gurning Bors (Ray Winstone). All are fairly tidy in the fighting department, though it helps that arrows seem to bounce off them and opponents appear to queue patiently before being slaughtered by axe or sword. This film is so full of epic-battle, courage-under-fire staples and stereotypes, it makes it hard to take its sincere historical credentials seriously.It doesn't help that Jerry Bruckheimer (never a man to favour substance over style) is producing it. With him, it seems, all subtlety and nuance is immediately binned in favour of another sweeping battle scene or Ray Winstone making tiresome gags about flatulence. Which is a shame, because there is a lot of potential intrigue amongst the trite, ham-fisted set-pieces. Lancelot and Arthur are best chums, but both harbour feelings for the beguiling Guinevere (Keira Knightley). You get the impression Fuqua is keen to explore this conflict more, but was perhaps vetoed by Bruckheimer who evidently wanted to forego an emotion-wrought love triangle in favour of more footage of men in armour running at each other really fast.Performance-wise, King Arthur is adequate, but it is very difficult for actors to be believable when they are spouting such clichéd, clunking dialogue. When it comes to brooding, it is hard to match Owen, but he is hardly physically imposing. When he brazenly stands alone on a hilltop in full battle regalia facing hordes of Saxons, he is not so much the bristling epitome of menace as the simpering pinnacle of high camp. As it becomes clear to him that his beloved Rome is tarnished with corruption and greed, he faces an identity crisis: Half-Roman and half-Briton, he is forced make decisions about who or what he must fight for, but all his inner demons are masked by the same drab, humourless expression. Even the prospect of bedding Knightley isn't enough to put a smile on his face. There is just no pleasing some people.The rest of the cast are OK. Winstone is ludicrously over-the-top as the boisterous Bors and Stellan Skarsgard is a scene-stealer as the Saxon leader Cerdic. The excellent Australian actor Joel Edgerton plays Gawain, but is underrated and hence woefully underused. None of them, however, are good enough to make this anything other than a turgid time-filler.Bragging about accuracy is fine, but to then employ every unimaginative device in the book is nonsensical. The Saxons here are portrayed as filthy, snarling savages raping, pillaging and looting their way through the countryside while the knights have honour, comradery and dashing good looks on their side. Fuqua would have been better off saying `bugger historical precision', slapping a pair of tights on Gruffudd and Owen and settling for a more traditional Camelot. Instead we have ghastly allusions to the established Authurian legend ? the scene where Arthur retrieves Excalibur from the stone is particularly awful, and Merlin, instead of being a kindly old wizard, is a bizarre tree-hugging loon caked in body paint.It is difficult to be too critical. Filmmakers deserve credit for trying new ideas and straying from the beaten path, but this effort doesn't know whether to be wholly original or stick to well-worn formulas and it ends up as a curious hybrid of the two. There is no mystery and no magic, but nothing new cinematically either. The film itself is, like the argument between the producers and the historians, essentially pointless. 6/10</fullReview>

Comically, if not impossibly cast (Clive Owen doing his best to look/act/sound like Nick Cage! (!!!Nick Cage as King Arthur?!?!?) Raising the Three Stooges Curly Howard from the dead and casting him as a tough-fighting/talking/wenching pedophile??? Merlin in blackface??? Uma-Thurman-like Keira mostunKnightley with spindly, unmuscled arms as an expert archer??? Stellan Skaarsgaard doing his best (but truly laughable) Marlon Brando "Godfather" impression!!! C'mon! Gimme a LARGE BREAK!)Gawain as a marshal artist-style swordsman!?!Lancelot as a dual-sword-wearing peeping tom!?!A script that plagiarizes from Sunday comics balloons."Armour-piercing" crossbows that look like toy-soldier wooden guns?!?Arthur's changes of armour do not reconcile with the most-un-armoire-like space available on his steed?!?And the horses' armour!!! The headgear alone is worth the price of admission! (see last line)Even the strong aroma of popcorn couldn't mask the stench coming from the screen. This can only be high comedy. Go to it with that expectation, and you may be mildly entertained. Otherwise... stay far-frigging-away. Everyone involved in the production of this mockery of a farce of a travesty should be mightily embarrassed.In a word... FEH! (Costumes are good. Prolly the only redeeming feature of this ridiculous sham.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor attempt to combine braveheart and gladiator. -- Possible SPOILER --</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-- Warning, possible spoiler... if possible --Well to start with: My opinion is that the movie could be a action, drama movie where you combine action with real facts and a dramatic touch of dying people you care for.... but the facts are twisted... a Chinese wall in england? Anyway, this is not an action drama but a dramatic action movie.The movie starts of with a short story about the grip rome has on the world during their greatness. Of course a detailed map is shown and by the time the story starts they have invaded / conquered some Russian ground. There is a small group of horsemen who swear allegiance to rome and by doing so, condemning their offspring to serve rome as well. OK so far no problems.Then all of the sudden, a young boy is shown called lancelot. The boy has to serve rome alone? (There are a lot more kids his age) The people cry out victory in their native tongue which could lead to a "goose bump" moment but it doesn't. We are not introduced to the characters at that moment to care enough. Then a little girl gives a trinket that is no longer used in any meaning way during the movie and he takes off. (Bear in mind this is the first 5 minutes of the movie)All of the sudden the story takes the viewer 15 years further. As we see fighters rescue a priest. Why they rescue him or even wait for him is not explained. Of course, you cannot tell it all but hey... this is still 5 minutes in the movie. (Oh and they ride from a Chinese wall....) The priest dies and all of the sudden the leader of the band is the real priest. Surprise.... Well this is almost the only surprise in the movie.Later on we find out that the horsemen are not released from the roman army after serving 15 years but have to perform one more task. Rescue a certain person who could be the new pope.. OK the round table is introduced and we see that the places are not entirely filled. Only 8 knights? roman soldiers? remain. Nice detail but aren't the fallen been resupplied by new men? Is there a riot in the homelands? No, again empty spaces.After a quick ride in the woods the men are at the place where the new young pope resides. OK a small skirmish with the woodland people again takes place and they are easily captured.... but merlin the woodland leader blows a horn and releases them. Merlin then is given a hard time by tribe leaders? about this decision. He does later on confront Arthur, the roman leader of the horsemen who rescued the priest etc, to join the brits in the fight against the saxens.... since rome is leaving england the saxens have free play... (Didn't the vikings invaded first?)Anyway, this goes on and on, more dramatic scenes of characters we do not care for enough because they are not introduced or given enough background. The only one we remotely care for is the father of 11 children but he doesn't die...OK one good fighting scene on ice... but at the start of this particular scene it is obvious that the entire opposite army will crash through the ice. Please note... a humor line appears here.... One of the 5 in total I recon.OK the saxen army still advances to the "roman" wall and the entire roman camp behind it disappears. Including a big peace of the castle to make way for the battle ground. (How they did that last is still a mystery but my girlfriend thinks merlin did it.) And the only one that stands tall is arthur. Why, no one knows... Of course he made an allegiance with the braveheart people who hide in the woods. Naturally the friend of arthur return for the big fight and all of the sudden arthur is maximus (Gladiator) giving a cheering speech for the 6? already motivated men standing at his side to fight the entire saxen army. (nice awww moment is the flag poles with horse heads on them.. a symbol not shown before in the entire movie? Or at least not very visible..)The first part of the saxen army advances and is crushed by arrows from the braveheart people. (In real picten amazones...)OK big fight with a lot of fire and smoke. Nice shots of kiera fighting. (The only good part of this movie is the way she acts.) Also funny is that the mayority of the amazone army is made out of men....OK they win the fight and some people we still don't care for die...End...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It had the potential...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I happen to be a big fan of epic films. You know, films set in the time where sword and bow where the only weapons, and grand warriors and heroes grace the screen. Action scenes are usually abundant, vast and hugely entertaining. Large armies clashing in the scene, trying to cut each others throat by any means necessary.None of these things fit into this movie, sadly. It had the potential to become a great action/adventure/epic. But many things dragged this film down. Mainly the script, which was average at best. Only thing that is relevant in this film is the main plot, even tho there are several subplots. To bad the subplots are extremely poorly written and executed. They could be cut out of the film completely, and it would actually have made a better movie. OK, so let me get going with the story...In 300 A.D. the romans waged war against the Sarmatians, whom they defeated. However, they were so impressed with the Sarmatians fighting skills that they let them live, in exchange for them fighting in the roman army. This deal would not only go for the sarmatians who survived the battle, but all sarmatians, and their sons and grandsons and so forth. Now, fastforward to 452. Lancelot, Bors, Gawain, Galahad, Dagonet and Tristan are all young Sarmatian boys who live in a village. One day the roman arrive and take the young boys with them, so that they can serve the Roman Empire. The boys are stationed in southern Britain, under the command of Arthur...15 years later, the boys have almost fulfilled their deal with the Empire, and are ready to go home to their native lands. However, they are given one last assignment: They must travel north, into the lands of their enemy, and fetch a Roman noble. The reason for this is that the Saxxons are invading the lands from the North, and the Roman empire can stand no chance against them.Hmm... Could certainly be a good plot there. But it isn't. The movie tries to introduce to many characters. The only characters that get a real development are Arthur and Guinevere. Not even Lancelot, who is supposed to be the third main character in the film, feels anymore alive than any of the other knights. And they are all 1-dimensional. This is basically the character development done for the knights: "We want to see our native lands. We hate Rome. We fight for a cause that isn't ours.". And that's it. This is all done in the first twenty minutes of the film. Speaking of characters, the knights are not the only 1-dimensional characters in this film. Merlin is pretty much in two scenes. Why the heck did they even put him in there? He serves no purpose whatsoever! Guinevere gets some screen time as she claims that Britan is "her land" and that she "belongs to it". OK. That's it for Guinevere. Oh, and she heals rapidly, too, she must be some kind of medieval Wolverine. One day she is found tortured, pale and badly beaten. Her hand is pretty much broken. But hey, the next day she is up there, standing with the knights, fending off the evil Saxxons. Interesting. Oh, and speaking of Saxxon, I have never witnessed such a poorly executed gang of bad people. Their leader, Cedric, is seen bossing them around in a few scenes, saying intuitive and clever things such as "Burn the village..." or "Kill her..." or even "Obey me or die...". And that's it for him. He has a son too, who seems to care more for his men than Cedric does, but never challenges Cedric to a duel in order to take his place as the leader, even though he watches Cedric willingly slaughtered his sons group of warriors. Man, those saxxons are stupid. And not only are they stupid, their reputation doesn't really do them justice. In the film, the romans fear them. They even flee from Britain in order to avoid dealing with them. Yet, when it comes down to fighting, the Saxxons ENTIRE ARMY, are easily dispatched by seven knights and a group of perhaps 200 native people, with horrible fighting skills (and don't say they were good fighters, cause in the first battle of the film, the woads were slaughtered without really killing anyone, even though they vastly outnumbered the romans). Conclusion: Saxxons really suck ass. The knights could probably have taken them down themselves. In every battle, the Saxxons are completely slaughtered... And we're supposed to fear these barbarians? A group of peasants could easily have taken them down.Some of the acting is pretty horrible too. Clive Owen was definitely the wrong choice for Arthur... But that's all I'm gonna say. The only thing about this film was the score. It was pretty good, but not great. The soundtrack is probably better than the film itself. I think I might actually pick that up.Toss out all logic, all dreams of having an interesting story, all character development and add ONE half-decent battle scene. And you get King Arthur. Sounds good, eh?4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Arthur suffers from the same fate - it's boring! The fight scenes are pulled off well enough and I could even handle Merlin being some dark wizard / pagan. It's just that there was nothing exceptional, nothing to really get my teeth in to! Clive Owen is dull, lifeless and soulless, when he predictably announces that all he wants is freedom for all, instead of cheering I scoffed and went out for a bathroom break. Kiera Knightly is stunningly beautiful but manages to transform herself from helpless victim into super-warrior bitch in the time it takes to put on some makeup and squeeze into something more revealing. Is her mystically fast transformation ever explained? I can remember, I think I was nodding off...I can see this being slammed by the critics and whilst normally I would try my damdest to defend a film from blanket criticism let me be the first to put a nail in the coffin: King Arthur, you didn't even come close - be a good boy, put the sword down and disappear into DVD oblivion would you?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Arthur: 6/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I come from a place where many Americans are-"All I know about King Arthur I learned from Monty Python and the Holy Grail." But, it doesn't matter, because almost none of the movie has the King Arthur that most people know. Instead of doing the legend of King Arthur, King Arthur is the supposedly "true" story of Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. It's rather ironic because there has been no evidence that Arthur even existed. Methinks that this was just a huge marketing ploy that backfired. I've barely seen any marketing, and it's not one for the teen demographic anyway. It'd probably bore them, anyway.Knowing that this is a Jerry Bruckheimer film, it kind of put me in the right mindset. I'm just biding time until Anchorman comes out, so I see this. I try to keep an open mind going into it, but I find that it's hard to do. Bruckheimer's films are known to be showy and big-budget, but lacking in cinematic elements, such as script and plot. And when you have a movie that's based off of something well known, such as the legend of King Arthur, you need those elements. Unless, of course, you change what you say "actually happened". Then you can get away with it, and Bruckheimer continues his streak of mediocre films with large budgets.Instead of focusing on anything that people know about Arthur, Arthur (Clive Owen, from the wonderful Croupier) and his Knights of the Round Table have to go out to Britain and get a boy who will become bishop (or Pope). There are supposed to be many dangers. Guinevere (Keira Knightley) is rescued about halfway through, and becomes a fearsome warrior a few times before going to the background. There's also some stupid animal symbolism and morals thrown in, along with neo-feminism and Stellan Skarsg?rd with a braided beard.The battle scenes were quite good. Unlike so many other movies out there, they never got old or repetitive. They were pretty exciting and involving. It seems like the whole movie was leading up to the final battle scene, with good reason. But that leaves no room for any real relationship to develop with Guinevere and Arthur (and Lancelot, as the story goes), and it basically makes the first half useless, since it's resolved so early. It's almost like two separate movies there. Also, there's almost no character development. Merlin comes in once, and Skarsg?rd, as a random Saxon warrior appears randomly. WHO is he? The Knights' names are barely mentioned. I wish I knew who played the large, ax-throwing guy, because kudos to him. He's the comic relief.Although not as much as Eric Bana did in Troy, Owen puts a good performance in his widest film yet. He's not amazing, but he doesn't let the movie down. Knightley, besides being in the film for about 20 minutes, puts in a one-note role and now seems to be a teen idol. I liked her better when she was in things like Bend It Like Beckham. She's just here to draw in audiences. And Skarsg?rd, who I'm looking forward to seeing in Exorcist: The Beginning later this summer, has fun with his role. King Arthur is an unmemorable but entertaining movie that plays faster and looser with facts than Michael Moore. But it's worth a visit if you're bored.My rating: 6/10Rated PG-13 for intense battle sequences, a scene of sensuality and some language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Arthur - The Director's Cut (Widescreen, 2004). Runtime: 142 minutes."King Arthur" sheds the legend and theorizes the true story of the British leader of the late 5th and early 6th centuries, who led the defense of Britain against Germanic invaders (the Saxons) in the early 6th century as the Roman Empire was crumbling.This is Medieval-British Isle flick in the tradition of the three 1995 films "Braveheart," "Rob Roy" and "First Knight," as well as 2006's totally underrated "Tristan and Isolde," which I feel is the best of the batch."King Arthur" is my second favorite, followed by the underrated "Centurion" from 2010. "King Arthur" is visually gorgeous, shot mainly in Ireland, but also Wales and England. It has a good assortment of actors, including Clive Owen as Arthur, Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot, Keira Knightley as Guinevere, Ray Winstone as Bors, Stephen Dillane as Merlin and an outstanding performance by Stellan Skarsg?rd as the Saxon villain, Cerdic. Although I'm not a huge fan of Keira she certainly has a striking face, utilized to great effect in this film, and she looks awesome as a blue-painted Pictish warrior (i.e. a "Woad").The soundtrack is good and is sometimes reminiscent of "The Last of the Mohicans" (1992), but blander and nowhere near as overpowering.The theme here, other than duty and war, is that of finding one's true home and calling. Many of us dream of "home" as some far-off place to find in the near or far future, but home may be closer than we think. We just need to be open and open our eyes. This reminds me of this story of a Texas minister who wanted to move to a place with small lakes &amp; springs, etc. and the LORD told him it was ALREADY there on his property, he just had to use his imagination and create it. So he made some small lakes on his property with seven springs, as well as other modifications. Later, when his father was visiting, the subject of vacationing came up. His dad confessed that he enjoyed coming to his son's house rather than traveling elsewhere because it was so beautiful and peaceful that it felt like paradise. The minister learned a lesson: You might be sitting on your paradise (or "home") and just don't realize it. In short, quit looking for the greener grass somewhere else and simply open your eyes! FINAL WORD: I put off seeing "King Arthur" all these years for no particular reason and, after finally viewing it, I must say it's much different than what I expected. I expected another take on the legend like "First Knight" or "Excalibur" (not that those two films are in any way interchangeable), but "King Arthur" is totally different. It's got a unique story, full of savage Medieval action, but it also possesses an undeniable air of beauty and reverence with quite a few epic/dramatic moments.GRADE: B+ or A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not historically accurate. At all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate movies that have false advertising, and this movie tops the charts for how much garbage they try to pass off as 'historically accurate'.Arthur, a Roman? He might have had Roman blood in him, but from what we can gather from the time, the Romans had already been gone for quite some time before Arthur appeared on the scene.The Knights of the Round Table being from... Well, it shows them in a fielded country, which combined with most of their looks, would make me assume Gaul. But then you have Lancelot, who looks/fights/dresses like he's from the Middle East. All of them Roman conscripts (who aren't Roman), who have been fighting in Britain since they were twelve (and survived fifteen years, without running off)? They all wear armor that either blends together multiple times/regions, or is just so historically inaccurate it almost hurts your eyes. The differing weapon styles (almost none of which would have been taught in the Roman army) combined with historically inaccurate/region inaccurate weapons... Put it all together, and you get... well, this train wreck of a movieGuinevere being a 'warrior princess' who leads troops into battle, and has ridiculous accuracy, especially after getting all of her fingers broken/dislocated? Firstly, women of that time didn't go into battle. If need be, they could and would fight on the home front, during raids or the like, but they didn't go marching into battle with the boys. Secondly, the clothing she wore? She would have been branded a harlot and hung/drowned/burned at the stake. She wouldn't have made it out of her bedroom -never mind the house -wearing clothes like that before somebody killed her. And lastly... I've had a lot of broken fingers. It's not as simple as, reset, wait a day or two, and you're back to normal. Doesn't work that way. And there's no way a woman of her size, with or without broken fingers, would have been able to shoot a bow of that size and make as far as the men. Not possible. Even if she knew how to shoot, which is as likely as her walking around in those outfits.Combine all the 'historically accurate' mistakes (and I've mentioned only a few) with the terrible acting, and you get a movie that makes you want to hurl. Clive Owen tries giving these Brave Heart type speeches that fall flat on their face due to his monotone inflection, and blank face. The only thing that ever changes is his pitch, never the inflection. Louder or quieter, it all comes across the same. Keira Knightley doesn't do much better, with stupid clichéd lines, a bored or pained expression throughout, and a 'I'm as good as any man... Save me!' attitude. There's no redeeming qualities to this movie whatsoever, other than the shots of the scenery, which were quite beautiful. Otherwise... It was a puke fest, the whole way through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kayma's snobbish attitude is going to prevent him/her from enjoying a lot of movies. Movies are entertainment, not history books. I enjoyed every minute of this superb movie. The actors were terrific, the screenplay was excellent, and the cinematography and scenery were unforgettable. History? I am aware that all dramatic portrayals take liberties with history, so I am not looking for perfect accuracy; I am looking for a good story and storytelling. I keenly enjoyed this completely different casting of the Arthurian legend as it is usual done, with kings and queens living in luxury in castles with servants and ladies-in-waiting and knights in shining armor and all that. How much history was in that legend (a la Camelot)? This was far grittier, earthy, human, and passionate. Movies can be at best a kind of celluloid synecdoche for actual events; 'King Arthur' as a movie did what I hope and expect of the best movies - it captivated and entertained me completely, and piqued my interest to learn more about the actual history from books. It was an exhilarating ride, A+ for entertainment. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this on DVD last night. I found it quite entertaining for the battle and action scenes, like the encounter on the frozen lake. Stellan Skarsgard does well as the villain, opposite Clive Owen in the lead role. In my opinion Owen is an awful actor - slow, ponderous and clumsy I cannot believe he got chosen for this part. if they had given Ioan Gruffud (lancelot) the lead role I think he would have made a better fist of it, After this I hope Owen is not given any more lead roles in potentially decent films because his presence (or lack of it) brought this one down a bit. Ultimately Disappointing but probably worth a watch all the same. 4 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously, why is this movie even named "King Arthur"? Arthur doesn't become king until like the last 3 minutes or so.I had serious doubts whether I should watch this movie or not. I'm quite fond of the legend of King Arthur and I heard that this movie totally ignored almost every aspect of the legend, to so called, tell the 'true' story of King Arthur and the knights of the round table. Still I decided to give this movie a chance. The story simply has too many historical inaccuracies to call this movie the true story of King Arthur but if you're able to ignore this things, you might be able to take the movie for what it is; pure and simple entertainment.It's not just the story that makes this movie a bit of a disappointing one, it also is the treatment of the characters, or maybe not the characters but more the actors that portray them. Clive Owen was about the worst choice they could make with casting Arthur. Owen is incredibly boring in his acting and he has absolutely no charisma. This is not a man I would follow in battle! And there is absolutely no chemistry between him and Keira Knightley (Guinevere). It's totally unbelievable that a girl like Guinevere would fall for a man like Arthur, who also looks about three times her age. Their love story was portrayed poorly, the movie made it seem like the only reason for Guinevere to fool around with Arthur is so that he would fight for her people and defeat the Saxon's so that her people could rule Britannia. It was also a totally wrong choice to make Guinevere a Woad warrior and quite frankly Keira Knightley is far too beautiful to be a believable rebel warrior that is used to living in the forest and sleeping in the mud. And why is Merlin suddenly the bad guy? The rest of Arthur's knights role is too limited to get emotional involved with any of them (With the exception of Lancelot, who disappointingly gets killed at the ending, which also makes it even weirder that the story is somewhat told from Lancelot's perspective and even begins with his character narration followed by his youth.) and I still don't know who is who exactly.The actors give the best they got but the dialogs are just plain weak at times, which makes their acting performances also look silly at times.But still as entertainment this movie is perfectly watchable. It's obvious that Antoine Fuqua is a great action movie director. The battles are looking good and spectacular but unfortunately the story and characters make sure that this movie is also a forgettable one. The atmosphere was better than I expected. I don't know but for some reason I expected this movie to be full of far too bright colors (Maybe it's because of the movie its reddish cover?). The musical score by Hans Zimmer is good on its own but isn't really ever able to sparkle in the movie itself. If your able to ignore all the inaccuracies and poor character treatment, you might be able to enjoy "King Arhur" as pure entertainment.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a great shame that a great legend was turned into Hollywood tripe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A big budget film based on the Arthurian legend sounds like a great idea for modern technology to tackle. There's more than enough about this great piece of legend to make a great film, so when I heard that one was being made I was relatively excited to see it. That is until I heard that Jerry Bruckheimer was set to produce the project, and then all hope of it being any good faded. Bruckheimer, with his 'high concept' films has become well known for creating overblown pieces of trash, and that's exactly what this film is, I'm sad to say. Most probably in the name of entertainment, this film claims to be about the 'true' events of King Arthur's life, and this means that King Arthur and the noble knights of the round table have been miscast as a bunch of thugs that wouldn't look out of place in a post-Lock, Stock gangster flick. This silliness puts it on the back foot from the offset and it never regains it's footing, as it's hard to take a bunch of fifteenth century knights that sound like gangsters seriously.This film's main problem is that, like The Last Samurai before it, it's simply too ridiculous. For most of the movie Clive Owen looks bored, and for the other half he's making 'awe-inspiring' speeches to his men, and the performance doesn't bode well on the whole at all. I don't know what's going on lately, but it seems nowadays every film of this nature has to include the hero giving speeches to his men about the virtues of freedom and whatnot, and it never quite works as it should. The overbearing soundtrack doesn't exactly do the film any favours either and merely serves in making the finished article more ridiculous (which is basically exactly what a score shouldn't do), and a torrid script that features any number of the daft moments that I mentioned earlier also drags the film down. It's a shame that all historical epics these days have to be in the style of Lord of Rings; comic book battles don't work well with a film that is supposed to be based on one of the greatest legends of all time.Like most people, my number one reason for seeing this film after I found out Bruckheimer was involved was Keira Knightly. Knightly was voted sexiest movie star by Empire magazine recently, and although this isn't true; she's very sexy. I haven't thought much to her before this movie, as she tends to either star in movies I couldn't care less about, or not look particularly startling in the ones I do. Here, however; she gets to wear skimpy outfits, have her hair dark and generally look very sexy. But...there's a catch. You have to wait almost an hour before she makes her appearance, which isn't good when you're spending that hour waiting on it as there isn't much to entertain you in the meantime. As you might expect, all of her best moments are included in the trailer anyway, so when she does appear it isn't that good as you've seen her best moments from the trailer. I suppose it's probably better if you haven't seen the trailer...or the film.</fullReview>

King Arthur is by far the best way to tell the King Arthur legend. Starts out with Lancelot saying goodbye to his family and hello to being a knight. about 15-16 years later pass, and Arthur,Lancelot,Galahad,Bors,Dagonet,Tristan,and Gawain are sent on one final mission for Rome,during which,they meet Guinevere, a Woad warrior considered high birth among Woads,who wonders if Arthur is ready to become king. You'll meet Saxons Cerdic and Cynric,and go on an adventure of a lifetime when you see KING ARTHUR. I've given it 10 stars and hope you do too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the most amazing version of of the story I've ever seen. What a wonderful job of Directing, casting and the acting is SUPERB!! Reading the material that is out there about what is known about whether King Arthur was a real person, this is the most believable film version. Though the French created a beautiful fantasy story of which I love as well I appreciate this version that is probably the closest to the possibility of what really was. Honestly, I would never have thought Clive Owen to be as perfect a King Arthur as he proved to be. Seeing the great sense of truth, justice &amp; righteousness of King Arthur and his knights makes me long for more people like that to exist today. I wonder about how accurate it was though that the Saxons were preoccupied with ancestry perfection from back in those days. Anyway, Keira Knightly was impressive as always; the wonderful actors playing, Lancelot, Gawain, Galahad and all the other knights as well. I recognized them all as fantastic actors and they were so well-suited in the roles they played. I found myself routing for the characters immediately. That is indeed the sign of a great writing, production, directing, acting, story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hated his movie. Being British, the Arthurian Legend means a lot to me. This movie deconstructed the legend and made everything I hold dear obsolete. I prefer Excalibur - it's a film that is honest to the legend (not the alleged truth), and succeeds as such. The 'truth' that King Arthur purports to depict is far less a convincing - or interesting - story than the myth, and is not helped by anachronistic speech (such as the foppish accents) and characterisations that are evident in this 'film'. If your going to make a film about the dark age, at least do it with some credibility. It seemed like the people in the film came from the 19th century but were wearing 4th century clothes. Not good enough. All in all, it was stupid, insulting and a bad movie overall. Watch Excalibur instead. Don't bother with this rubbish. It's not worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great film but enjoyably low-key and gritty with a patient pace and solid development</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After fifteen years "in service" of the ruling Roman Empire, the Sarmatian knights are to be given their freedom as the Roman Empire prepares to withdraw from the hard to defend, outlying colonies. However on the very day of their freedom, Arthur, their leader, is given a final mission to head north and bring back one of the Pope's favourite godsons. The Saxons have invaded the north and their army is sweeping south and Arthur's men reluctantly accept their duty. Heading directly into the path of the Saxons, Arthur finds not only the boy Honorius but also villages of people he cannot leave behind, including a captured woman from the Woads ? the English rebels.With middling reviews (lets be honest) and not any real interest in the first place, it was no wonder that I decided to leave this film until such a time that it came to DVD or something like that and, this week, it did just that and I relented. While the film is undeniably "good" it is perhaps a bit too gritty and low-key for its own good ? certainly it never gets the feeling of grandness that comes with, say, Gladiator. It is still quite good though because of this same grit and low-key approach, I was more convinced by this than the sweeping sentiment of some other films or the focus on the magical side of the Arthur legend of other versions. The slow pace may put off some viewers and I know that many have complained about the lack of real gore and excitement but these were both things I could cope with and suited the whole mood the of the film. One thing I would have liked would have been better development of the characters but then they were still sturdy enough to do the job.The cast are a bit mixed but they serve the material well despite being perhaps being a bit too modern at times. Owen is a strong jawed presence and he suits this sort of role ? manly but not macho, suave but able to get gritty (sound like any other famous character?). He is well supported by a cheeky Winstone within a strong group that also includes manly performances from Gruffudd, Dancy and others. Knightly hasn't convinced me she is anything other than the next pretty young thing yet but she is a good presence here, even if her Guinevere smacks a bit too much of modern sexual treatment rather than a supposedly "realistic" portrayal of who she would have been ? still, as a male fantasy she still works well while also doing enough to convince as a woman opposite Arthur. Skarsgard does the minimum but still is an enjoyable main baddie. Generally the cast do help the material by adding a bit of gruff humanity to it.Overall this is a good film but the lack of anything that special prevents it from really sticking in the mind. It is enjoyably low-key and gritty even if its claims of realism didn't really convince me that much! The pace is mostly slow but with tension and atmosphere and the battle scenes are enjoyable even if they do lack a bit of the sweeping majesty that many will have come expecting due to other films in the similar vein doing it.</fullReview>

Aha... well ... uhm ... as long as it will be as grand and fabulous as this one .. who cares to wait some decades !!Because this film is so fabulous, so marvelous, AND SO THOUGHT PROVOKING !!! Here we have all our heroes and heroines, set in a scenery that is not mystical at all !!By no means disregard the mystical ! Read all you can about King Arthur and Celtic Myths ! There are trillions of exciting books out there !!!!The English Folio Society have published beautiful books about that. And if the name TRISTAN as one of the knights tickle you, do not miss the many splendid publications about him, most brilliant among them all the French edition in the glorious La Pleiade Library, called 'Tristan et Yseult'. THAT Tristan too, is represented here...And in such breathtaking way ! Of course I am an everlasting silly boy even tough I'm older than King Arthur could have been... And sure, do not shy away of the fun and leisure of Disney's SWORD IN THE STONE or the rather silly yet funny QUEST FOR CAMELOT, to name but some animation 'quests'. And certainly there is a lot of good times to be had while watching a 'Yankee in King Arthur's Court', 'Mists Of Avalon' and 'Excalibur', and some of the Arthurian movies with the blessed Sean Connery in it (thank you, dear sir !!), and so very VERY many others.

I think it might have been vastly improved if performed only by horses. At least then the dialog would have contained more than two words.

		<shortDescription>Another Bruckheimer Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The summary line says it all. There will be people out there who enjoy action films, heavy on the action and light on plot, character development, and acting. They will like this movie. I did not. Movie making can be a craft. Not every movie needs to be crafted like a Hitchcock, Leone, Rob Reiner, Farley Brothers or Wes Anderson film. Variety is important. But please give the audience a little more credit than wooden dialogue, perfect heroes. To make a really good movie it takes more than adrenaline.To start, the movie does not follow the folklore most of us are familiar with; that of Uther Pendragon, etc. For that storyline see the movie Excalibur. This story follows the legend of a Roman figure named Arturius. Arturius is a good Christian and loyal Roman that believes in the inherent freedom and equality of every man. Beliefs at odds with the Roman Empire. The storyline concerns him and his small band of knights as they believe they are free of their tour of duty in Britain. Instead they are given one last impossible task. Of course they complete the task. (What good are 200+ Saxons when faced down by 7 Roman knights and a bow-wielding Guinevere.) At the end Arturius joins Merlin and the locals (the very rebels he just spent 15 years keeping under control for the Roman empire) and defeats an obscenely large Saxon army. (By the way, how do the rebels--that live on the North side of the wall, only fight Arturius with axes, a few rusted swords, bows and arrows--suddenly show up on the South side of the wall with half a dozen trebuchets ready to go?) All the characters we do associate with the legend are in the movie. Some of them are very different from what people might expect. Merlin, most of all. Merlin is written as the rebel leader originally fighting Arturius, but the story doesn't allow us to know anything about him. We can't even tell if he's particularly wise, let alone a decent leader.Keira Knightley is always a pleasure to look at. But she wasn't given much to work with. And no matter whether or not you buy this is the true Arthurian legend (as the movie claims) or not it is tough to stomach the idea that the best fighter in all of Britain outside of Arturius and his band of knights is skinny little waif of a woman recently freed from torture, starvation and near death. Clive Oven looks every inch the conflicted loyal Roman leader. Unfortunately too many times the dialogue sounds more like political speeches than any type of conversation actual people would have. The rest of the actors did as much as they could with the limited writing.The cinematography was good. The actions sequences fast-paced, if a little unrealistic.If you enjoy movies where action is a premium over story, dialogue and character development this is for you. You can tell who the good guys and bad guys apart from what color hat they're wearing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It entertains but clears up less than what it promises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been several famous stories that take place in medieval times. Much of these legends are based on some sort of fact or documentation, and then there are also the ones that don't and have been a mystery since they surfaced. Apparently, this film clearly states in its intro that there was newly found evidence of King Arthur that shed light on his life. OK well that's pretty cool, viewers should have no problem with that. In fact, people should be excited to see exactly what the evidence was that brought this film to fruition. Sadly even with this grab (that isn't clarified) the film has a number of issues that don't make it as entertaining as it could've been. The big problem among all things is that the writing covers several different themes and subplots but doesn't complete many of them. Thankfully, the story wastes no time jumping from Arthur's youth to when he is leader of the round table. With that however, comes a sacrifice of the majority of other knights that Arthur is associated with. The audience is given a back-story to how the other nights came to be, like Lancelot, but no one else but those two characters are given a scene dedicated to their youth. It's harder for a viewer to come to accept and appreciate its main characters when you don't know much about them as they grow up. There are various places of character development but most of it centers around Arthur and his beliefs in what he is doing. The different angle at which Merlin is portrayed is different but he too is left under developed.Merlin is in charge of what seems to be a barbaric tribal cult that resembles that of pre-conceptual ideas for James Cameron's Avatar (2009). What's their purpose? Beats me, it's never explained. There's just so many ideas but all them feel underwritten. The actors who play the knights are fun to watch nonetheless. Clive Owen could surely pass as King Arthur and since his cast members are for the most part from UK vicinity, they too sound and look like they could be knights. Along Owen there's Ioan Gruffudd, Joel Edgerton and Ray Stevenson to name a few. Playing the main antagonist is Cedric (Stellan Skarsg?rd), a Saxon who shows no mercy in his purpose. Yet he too is underplayed - with very few tone raises. Just monotone whispering and mumbling.The rest stills keeps the attention of its viewer. The director's cut has much heavier violence and feels more realistic. Plus, sword fights are always entertaining. It's combat that isn't use practically at all now so it's a different viewing experience. The best action scene possibly belonged to the frozen lake fight. There was high tension in that scene. The camera work by Slawomir Idziak has wonderful pictures of the England grasslands and mountaintops. Very beautiful. Hans Zimmer's music was enjoyable too. It had a theme that sounded almost like Steve Jablonsky's Transformers theme (2007). Either way, it is respective to the time and sounds very noble. It also doesn't contain as many deep bass tones which is the usual Zimmer technique. It's fun but it requires not looking at it too deeply.The actors cast for the roles do a good job along with fun action and music. The writing however is too muddled with numerous subplots and little exposition. You think for a 2 hour long movie, it would clear up something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I for one liked this film, since I'm a sucker for medieval period films (Kingdom of Heaven, Gladiator, Centurion) -- but I didn't love it. I can see the reason why there stands much criticism of it.Apart from historical inconsistencies, which the film never promised anything, there were several issues I had with the plot. Firstly, the emotional connections seemed to be forced onto the audience. The strong relation between the first knight to die and the lost boy and Bors seemed to come about only so the audience felt a shred of remorse when the first knight died, but it was shallow and too early. They attempted a love triangle between King Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere, but it never took off, which can also be said for the movie's potential. I did not like that ironclad Saxon savages lost to cloth-wearing savages, the Saxons were portrayed to be too inexperienced and helpless. The action was decent, although I would have liked to seen more focus on an epic 1v1 battle instead of cut scenes between them.All in all, great acting from the cast of knights, although Knightley's performance was forgettable</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possibly one of the best comedies of its year,"King Arthur" benefits enormously from a fey performance in the title role by Mr C.Owen. With girly hair and spaniel eyes he offers a degree of camp to England's most famous imaginary king not seen since the days of Robert Taylor. He fails happily to be ruthless,resolute and righteous,settling for the occasional snarl,pout or stern look as he considers appropriate. Mr R.Winston reveals previously hidden comic talent as a gruff cockney member of The Round Table.He barely restrained himself from going on about apples and pears and dog and bone,me old china plate. In the first ten minutes we have references to "Gladiator","Hawkeye and the last of the Mohicans","Braveheart",and as many Westerns as you can tip your hat to.That's kinda fun,too. Acting of pantomimic proportions abounds throughout and when I saw the movie the audience could scarce refrain from booing or cheering as the situation demanded. If your idea of King Arthur is Richard Harris in an immaculate tabard then Mr Owen may be a bit much to swallow. But if you're open - minded and up for a colourful romp through God alone knows whose idea of the time when knights were bold and ladies were grateful...well,this version of the Arthurian legend may appeal. It certainly made me laugh a lot - if you'll pardon the not - quite pun,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flunks at History, passes (just barely) as entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's begin by saying that as entertainment, this movie is passable (albeit, just barely). The scene of the battle in the ice is certainly one of the most exciting scenes shown in movies during that year. As for the actors, most of them lack charisma in their roles, except for Keira Knightley as an improbable woad warrior. Clive Owen, specially, is totally devoid of charisma in the lead role (though he has gotten better in later films). OK, now let's turn to history. This movie was promoted when it was released as the true historical portrait of King Arthur (someone who, most likely, never existed), so it's fair to question this aspect of the movie. According to this film, Arthur was a Roman general who, by the time of the withdrawal of the Roman troops from the British Isles in the 5th century, decided to join the Celtic locals against the Germanic invaders and eventually become their king. Well, where one can start? With Arthur's warriors shown as improbable proto Russians? With its anachronic portrayal of the Catholic Church, already more powerful than the Roman empire and engaging in the inquisition (an invention from the late middle ages)?. With its laughable references to historical figures like Bishop Germanius and the heretic writer Pelagius? If you want to see an entertaining movie, you might enjoy this film, but if you have some interest in the history of the period, you are bound to came out very disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ambrose Aurealanus--the roman 'Count Of The Saxon Shore' (known to us through legend as 'King Arthur') perished during Britain's Easter Annals while fighting a terrible force that was led by an enemy named Mordor. The good news is, this movie doesn't end on quite such a depressing note, which seems like Hollywood, and it is, but this is also a breakout motion picture that attempts to treat this subject matter realistically, and historically.It was a commendable attempt, and consequently, an excellent film. Clive Owen's Arthur was a warrior, and a visionary, but also a flawed, rather never human being. Guinevere was portrayed as lovely, and resourceful; strong-willed, and fragile; treacherous, and arrogant. There are also Grade-A performances from the actors who portrayed the knights.I thought there was one, really rich irony that was left out of the movie for narrative reasons, and it's kind of shame because it really lends credence to the adage that there is no black, and white, only shades of gray. Arturus provided the legendary name, but it was another historical figure who actually embodied King Arthur's courage, and inestimable character. That person was (drum roll): Alfred of West Saxons--the King of England following the roman withdrawal from the British isles. So, a member of the invading army we saw in the film actually added to the Arthurian mythos. In the future, it would be interesting to see a drama that compares, and contrasts these two individuals who did so much to shape the face of British, colonial history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great epic filmed based on the legend of King Arthur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike other films based on King Arthur this was the best one. It's realistic and truly based on the legend. Great actors such as Ioan Gruffudd and Clive Owen who did excellent jobs as Lancelot and King Arthur, fitting the parts perfectly, plus Keira Knightley was beautiful as Guinevere. Antoine Fuqua and Jerry Bruckheimer did a great job with the story and the action scenes were intense. The action scenes were great because camera's were placed everywhere so you see different camera angles of the battle. The location were the film was shot, which was Ireland near Hadrians Wall, which fit perfectly with the film as the outpost of King Arthur is at Hardians Wall and the final action scene is held there. Overall the film was shot beautifully, the actors did marvelous jobs, costume and set design's were great, and the story was actually based on the real King Arthur.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps one of the greatest movies in history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I waited for King Arthur with great anticipation (quoting bishop Germanus) and I was more than satisfied. The movie is outstanding, perhaps one of the few that will stay in history because of its uniqueness and its perspective that very few can offer nowadays. It stands above the common movie with the common clichés which is something that has particularly impressed me. Keira Knightley has been the perfect choice for the role of Guinevere, although perhaps a slightly older actress (like Sophie Marceau a few years ago) would have a very good choice indeed and Clive Owen is an excellent actor for the pragmatic and idealist role of Artorius Castus. The background of the characters could have been developed, I'm referring in particular to the conflict between Pelagius and those loyal to Germanus and the Woads themselves. Alike the LOTR most of the setting was actually built, something that I will always appreciate in any movie. Furthermore the sceneries and the atmosphere that surrounds the movie leaves the mystical imprint of the lands of Scotland and Northern England. There is an important balance between action scenes, narration scenes and scenes that lead the viewer to ponder over universal themes like religion and the freedom of men. There are various side-scenes which do not follow the general storyline but give the characters a chance to evolve and open themselves to the viewer which is fantastic, I'm referring to, in particular, to the scene of the Christian shrine where pagans were tortured which has an important outcome on Arthur's judgment of the ideals he had cherished for so long. The use of actors who do not appear in blockbusters is, again, a wise choice. I was very enthusiastic of Mads Mikkelsen, the actor who plays Bors and the actor who plays Lancelot. I've also appreciated the relationship that is built between the knights across the 15-year service period. The deaths of Dagonet, Tristan and Lancelot are much mourned for but unfortunately they become necessary to the course of events. I was very enthusiastic of the presentation of the Woads and Merlin and the language choices (both in the Woads and the Saxon). The only "coquille" as the french would say is the ending, it becomes too banal and tends to diverge to ceremony rather than effective curtain falling over the 2 hours of entertainment, the alternative ending which can be found in the bonuses of the DVD is much more effective and much more appealing, in particular for the symbolism of the little pagan child taking the sword out of the mound. I hail Fuqua for such a successful movie which has left me breathless and full of uncluttered emotions through the waves of a wondrous soundtrack.Absolutely outstanding, deserves a few nominations at the Oscar prizes and will certainly be better than the blockbuster Alexander.In some ways this movie reminds me of the 13th warrior, which again, despite a few wrong choices, was an outstanding movie for the history of the northern European cultures in the so-called dark ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good try. Good music, although a rip off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I grabbed this DVD to have it as a 'sure thing' in my library of top movies, I was in for a surprise. Or, actually, two.The plot seemed OK, the cover OK and, last, but not least the trailer was inviting.The first thing that really surprised me was the music. Almost a total rip off from 'Gladiator'! Non the less good! Having a movie setup in the higher class really brought forward the music. If nothing else, the movie music lover will appreciate this music.The second surprise was the actor of 'Cerdic'! I recognizer him rather quick; Stellan Skarsg?rd, a fellow countrymen of me!This movie reminds me of 'Three Suns', the idea is to portray a story with limited resources rather than the story itself. The actors are the main asset. It works, but can go only so far. Ironically I think the director thought that the story was the thing that he needed to get on the silver screen. I disagree.I'm not sure this story would have been better screened than this. As good as it is. 'The general who became a slave and then challenged the Emperor' is by far a better story. Even if it, probably, has no claim to have ever happened.Yes, it is well worth to see, esp. the battle scenes are excellently made. But that's it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable possible history of Arthur and post-Rome Britons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, unlike most who have reviewed it. The screenplay takes a "legend" and, with the help of history of the period, rewrites it to fit what may have actually occurred.Students of history know that the story of Arthur was a fairy tale that was probably passed as lore for generations but it probably had some basis in fact. Most Britons at the time of Arthur were just being released from the subjectivity of Rome. The few that could stand on their own were probably trained as Roman soldiers. Many feel that a Roman trained Briton by the name Riotamus may have been the source of the myth of Arthur. Many of his conquests matched those of Arthur and in the same time period.The cinematography was outstanding (a la John Bormann although not as lush, which is in itself a plus since the dark ages were truly dark for many reasons). The period wear, the treatment of Merlin and the Woad, the weaponry and warring tactics were all done to satisfy historical accuracy rather than exploiting the same old story. It made this movie just that much more attractive and entertaining. I give it an 8/10 and I will definitely be purchasing the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>loved the one who played Tristan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I re watched this movie (the Director's cut) and liked it more the second time around. I know history and battle buffs have been pouring scorn on this film and i think they should take their hands off their you know whats...who cares if historically incorrect weapons were used or what exact year the old Britons got their sorry arses kicked by invading hordes? That's what books and documentaries are for you nerds, and even the best history books and documentaries in the world are about interpretation and educated guessing as much as research.I think many people expect 'Big Hollywood'films(read: Bruckheimer)to have a lot of charming characters, but I don't think Will Smith and Martin Lawrence could have played Arthur and Lancelot. (Bad Knights, Bad Knights, whatchya gonna do when they come for you?) King Arthur and his knights lack charm because, duh, life is hard for them. So viewers get formal dialogue and gritty circumstances largely unleavened by quips. I am not saying this is a great film but it is not as awful as the nerd-fuhrers make it out to be. And I still love the guy who played Tristan. Very Cool!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good attempt, now a new standard for better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read other commentary on this movie, and either read plagiarized reviews or Danish nationalism. I thought this was a good attempt to legitimize a very shadowy character. It was a good job by Clive Owen, and de-mystifying it was necessary, even if it was slightly de-romanticized. It was based on theory, if not a little far-fetched, but a good try. Yes, the Romans were long gone by the time of this movie Pelagianism, to correct another commentator, was not all that widely embraced, after all Vortigern was a follower of Pelagius before being overthrown by Ambrosius, who supposedly handed command over to Arthur much later than this film suggests. Now, if you read Geofforey Ashe (not that idiot Monmouth) Arthur's character himself falls in line with the Riothamus (High King) theory in description and time period. I recommend, however, if you'd like to pursue the theory of a real Arthur, look up "King Arthur-The True Story" by Graham Phillips and Martin Keatman. In short, I am a huge fan of Arthuriana, and was happy with the film. Long live Artorius Rex!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good concept gone awry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading the synopsis, you'd think this movie was an innovative and exciting take on the Arthurian legend. Unfortunately, this is not the case. In reality, the concept is not at all backed up by the absolutely empty script and weak directing. No where is Fuqua's edgy directorial style present. The actors are left to struggle with a script that is weak and lifeless. The legend itself isn't "reinterpreted" but completely discarded. Any resemblance to the original legend seems to be just for name recognition. (Dude, that guy's name is Merlin!) Themes are left on the cutting room floor and forget any deep characterization. But the ultimate insult is the action. There are a few memorable battle scenes. But the violence is kept to a bare minimum, and the pace is rarely driving. Anyone with any reverence for the Arthurian legend or high quality action films should pass this one up. (Kyra as Guinevere does an okay job,but is more fondly remembered for her final battlescene outfit and body paint. So, perhaps that is worth 7 bucks)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still not its caricature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>?There will always be a batter field. ? The Rome you talk of doesn't exist, except in your dreams."The epic movie of King Arthur is in the first plan about the clash of ideals and the reality, if it has to be the clash. The diverse approaches to the world are personified by two principal characters both of them are on the other side but they are the best friends at the same time, which is more than apposite. This is about what the various characters of human diversity can achieve if they would be able to cooperate. It is also about how it is felicitous to follow own ideals and how much it can create. There is no historical proof for the story as it is presented in the movie, anyway, some basic points are real. Among others it is in particular Roman exploiting approach to its colonies, Saxon attitude to the subjugated people (including no breeding strategy) and the battle on frozen river, which reflects borrowed archaeological evidence from more historical issues. This scene is a real masterpiece. Unfortunately, no battle of Badon ensured the flourishing peace and repose for next generations of Picts or Britons in general. They were not wiped out by Saxons, on the contrary, the majority of population of England today is their descendants (see the Origins of the British by S. Oppenheimer), but furious ages of wars and hunger amplified by next invasions continued in the worst till the reign of Eduard I. Harsh time required harsh people. Or is it vice versa? :) I got to used to like the performance of Clive Owen in this movie, even his acting is a bit unusual and some would be not far from truth saying he is stiff and always the same. But he is a master in choosing the roles where such an attitude is actually a benefit. I really admired the character embodied by Stellan Skarsgard. So straight, so rough, so Nordic, well presented. What I didn't like, it was the playing by Keira Kneightly. Guenievre in myths is much closer to Boudica than to an immature blathering child as Keira was at her age. Despite the funny dialogs of Arthur's colleagues which imparted the relief and the spice, many scenes in the movie were rigid and too spectacular. Nevertheless, as a whole, this movie is a brilliant demonstration of possible way how to dispose of historical theme. It still didn't cross the line where it begins to be its caricature, and it always serves as a good subject to human reflection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What did Antoine Fuqua learn in history class?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"King Arthur", I base this movie not on the history, since obviously it doesn't have any, but only the movie. If we all based movies on how accurate they are to history or books, almost every movie would have a low rating on IMDb. "King Arthur" starts off really great. The action sequences were a lot of fun to watch, it kind of brought me back to "Braveheart". The plot itself isn't bad. I have a major issue though with a certain actress whose name shall remain nameless, we'll just call her Teira Tnightley, was complete B.S. I understood she gave the director of "Pirates of the Carabean" a hard time because she couldn't fight with her role and that's why she got her way in this movie. I'm sorry, but women did not fight back then, it was impossible. I'm not being sexist by the way, I'm a woman! That's what made this movie beyond unbelievable. But other than that, the rest of the movie is pretty decent.4/10(well done Teira!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>KING ARTHUR (2004) ** Clive Owen, Ioan Gruffudd, Keira Knightley, Ray Winstone, Stephen Dillane, Stellan Skarsgard, Til Schweiger, Hugh Dancy, Mad Mikkelsen, Joel Edgerton, Ken Stott.Dismal and lethargic re-imagining of the mythic legend of Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table that eschews the classic storytelling for more 'historically accuracies' (read: dull and numbingly harder to follow thanks to a leaden screenplay by David Fanzoni) despite a gloweringly good Owen and a revisionistic Knightley as the sexy Guinevere depicted here as a girl-power warrior princess. Director Antoine Fuqua uses some interesting looks for the action adventure with the battle sequences (best bit: Saxons vs. Arthur's buds on an icy lake) with a decidedly dank boggy palette yet ultimately imploding on impact for the skeptical swashbuckler in all of us. Uber producer Jerry Buckheimer makes one uncharacteristic production blunder: boring the audience; go figure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At least they spelt 'Arthur' right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a medieval enthusiast and an aspiring historian, this version of a classic tale was utterly repulsive. I had several prominent problems with this retelling.The first, The time period: In this version Arthur is fighting for Rome, the Western half in particular. Historians place Arthur around 450, to 500 A.D. 50 to 90 years, after the Western half of Rome fell. If Arthur did live, (Which there is significant evidence saying that he did.) He would have been born to Uther and Igraine years after Rome was taken over by the Goths. Second: Morgan Le Fay vs. Guinevere. A more appropriate name for Guinevere in this version would have been "Morgan Le Fay," "Morgaine," or "Morgana." Guinevere was a blond, dainty, Christian woman who married Arthur only because her father forced her too. Morgan Le Fay was a pagan priestess and enemy to the throne of Arthur. Morgan was Arthurs sister, and she and Guinevere hated each other. It didn't help that Guinevere thought Morgan, and everyone like her, was a walking sin that should be killed on sight. (And historically, they were.) Third:Merlin Merlin was not someones name. LIke Morgan, it is a title meaning "lord." Arthur went through to Merlins during his rule, Taliesin (The stereotypical wise old man.) and Kevin. (The prisoner in the oak.)"King Arthur" was a big let down of a movie. The facts were off and the plot weak. A disappointment in Arthurian film.</fullReview>
