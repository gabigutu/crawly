		<shortDescription>Disappointing Treatment of Much-Praised Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not every comedy is for everyone (at least I think this was supposed to be a comedy). Last week I saw The Big Lebowski (1998) at the local movie theater. Packed. People in Lebowski t-shirts, people who raised hands to show they'd seen the movie five, ten, twenty times, people anticipating the laugh lines. Eighteen years from now, nothing like that will happen with this film from German director Tom Twyker. Tom Hanks is American businessman Alan Clay, whose marriage is over and whose career as a salesman is on the skids. In what appears to be a last chance at success, he's sent to Saudi Arabia to sell the king on a costly holographic teleconferencing system for a new city being built in the desert. He encounters bureaucratic delays, clandestine alcohol consumption, confounding cultural gaps, and unexpected romance. Where I messed up was in thinking, "Oh, Tom Hanks. He's always great." Someone so talented just wouldn't be in a mediocre film. Why would he? And, I thought, "Oh, Dave Eggers wrote the book it's based on. Got lots of praise for it too." For example, New York Times reviewer Pico Iyer called the book "an anguished investigation into how and where American self-confidence got lost and ? in the central word another lonely expat uses for Alan? 'defeated.'" And the Boston Globe: "True genius." Someplace along the way, the promise of the book and Hanks got lost, and a more disjointed and implausible narrative is hard to imagine. When we're told that the crowds Hanks saw at a mosque were there because "that's where the executions are," it's hard to believe that a Saudi woman would take the very great risk of being alone with him, an American infidel. Hanks does get to drive a very sexy 2015 Audi R8, briefly. But even that isn't worth the ticket price.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow but watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>29 May 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Hologram for the King. This film was a little surreal, I was never quite sure if the main character was dreaming the whole thing or not, this was not helped by a series of flashbacks that kept appearing throughout. However Tom Hanks was his usual sturdy unflappable self playing Alan a man who had failed in business and was now trying to succeed in a new career by selling an IT invention to an Arab King in Saudi Arabia. Failing in his marriage also and undergoing a bitter divorce, Alan is a bit lost when he arrives in Saudi and assumes the persona of a very beige type of man fighting his way through a very large sandstorm. However sparks of a more assertive person struggle through and we follow him on a journey of discovery. Not a huge raging river of a film, more a gentle stream meandering around and in danger of drying up in the Saudi desert. It doesn't dry up though and I found myself enjoying the tale immensely. Not everyone's cup of tea but worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>H is for Hologram. I is for Inconsistent. J is for Jumble. K is for King.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In terms of bankable movie experiences, you can seldom go wrong with a Tom Hanks movie can you? While there are a few pages in his portfolio he might prefer to forget ("The Bonfire of the Vanities" anyone?) his movies are nearly all eminently watchable. And "A Hologram for the King" puts him into what might be deemed a 'preferred' character role for his acting style ? an every-man in a strange land facing trials and tribulations with hearty American bonhomie.But here it doesn't really work, and it's not even Hanks' fault.Hanks plays struggling salesman Alan who is given a do-or-die mission to sell one of his company's holographic videoconferencing systems to the King of Saudi Arabia as a way into winning a big IT supply contract for a new desert city being constructed. Promising his bosses success, he arrives to find a deflated demonstration team struggling to put on a show with the lack of the basic essentials: wi-fi; air-con; food! Alan has to battle with both local custom and obstructive secretaries to try to save the day, helped by his driver Yousef (newcomer Alexander Black). Adding extra pressure to the mix is his marital status - Alan is recently divorced, and needing to financially support his daughter Kit (Tracey Fairaway) through college - and an alarming cyst that has suddenly appeared on his back. The latter requires the tender care of local doctor Zara (Sarita Choudhury, possibly best known as Saul's wife from "Homeland") and an unlikely cross-cultural friendship is struck up.I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, partly because I like Tom Hanks and partly because of the quirky Talking Heads "Once in a Lifetime" rendition in the trailer (which actually opens the film, and is great ? I loved it). There are also a host of enjoyable episodic plot elements set against spectacular Arabian vistas that are memorable. However, that is all they are ? episodes. Unfortunately, the whole film is a jumble of tidbits that never gel into any sort of satisfactory story arc: We have an "infidel in the middle of Mecca" scene, that suddenly ends without event or note; We head off on a wolf hunt that subsides into? well, I have no idea what: perhaps the denouement was supposed to mean something deep and meaningful, but it meant nothing to me; Even the main storyline tends to fizzle out to be replaced with an aquatic-based sub-story of inter-racial love. True that this romance is both touching and well done, but it feels entirely bolted on at the point you expect the film to end - it really doesn't integrate well. Blame for this must rest with writer/director Tom Twyker ("Run Lola Run" and the almost impenetrable Hanks movie "Cloud Atlas", which I must admit I never got to the end of on a plane!) I think Hanks should consider playing the "two strikes and you're out" card with this director. Hanks and Choudrey are fine in their leading roles, and the film really comes alive in the scenes between Hanks and Alexander Black as Yousef - his "driver, guide, hero!". There is really good chemistry between them, and although Black is a little too American- looking to genuinely pass as an Arab, he is effective and is probably the 'find' of the film.Sidse Babett Knudsen (from TV's "Borgen") is also very attractive and personable as the sex-starved Danish contractor Hanne. Also watch out for cameo's from Tom Skeritt and Ben Wishaw.But the acting talent - however hard they try - and the glorious cinematography (by Twyker regular Frank Griebe) can't make up for the erratic screenplay. This is a real shame, since the storyline around battling the adverse conditions of software demonstration abroad is a good one. As someone who used to work for IBM and did many demonstrations of this type in trade shows in far flung places in the Middle East, the Far East, Africa and South America, I have shared their pain, and it is enough to drive you to despair and madness. An opportunity squandered. (Please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review, and to provide your feedback. Comments welcome!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American salesman negotiates strange Saudi culture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This might have been titled Rebirth of a Salesman. The new Willy Low-man is Alan Clay, i.e. the quintessential man. Tom Hanks as the current representative American doesn't just have feet of clay; he is entirely vulnerable and crumbling. Alan was reduced back to sales after his management ruined his old bike-making company. When he shifted his manufacturing to cheaper China they stole his models and began making their own bikes ? but better and cheaper ? and stole the industry. He still flashes back to having to announce his US factory's closure, for which his father has still not forgiven him. A camping story recalls the father's lesson in self-reliance. By outsourcing its manufacturing Alan/America lost that essential value. No longer independent the once-powerful Alan/America suffers indignities and frustrations by having to go cap in hand to try to salvage a future by submission to an alien and antipathetic culture, i.e. Saudi Arabia.The failed businessman also failed domestically, of course. His wife divorced him (for "not seeing the big picture"). He still has a tenuous relationship with his 20ish daughter ? but he feels guilty for not being able to support her, to pay for her college, to provide for her future.As befits a psychological analysis of America, the opening scene is Alan's dream. While he glibly offers a hearty pitch (product indeterminate so irrelevant), the key elements of his life explode in puffs of pink smoke behind him: his house, his wife, etc. He's flying to the Saudis where his new company depends on his selling the king on their new IT program for their plan to urbanize a desert. The ensuing comedy derives from the fumblings of a stranger in a strange land. He can't adjust to the culture any more than to the time-lag. So he sleeps through his appointment times, only to find it doesn't matter. He was stood up anyway. He stumbles into meeting his elusive contact only to be dumped by him again. The guy lets him drive his flashy Audi but only because the American is no longer in the global driver's seat. The privilege is a taunt.Obviously the key metaphor is the hologram of the title. Alan finally manages to show the king his company's impressive holography, where a "real" character interacts with a virtual figure. He creates the continuum between reality and illusion, substance and image, power and pretence. Despite the perfect presentation the Chinese beat Alan out again.Though holography is the new, ultimate force of image-making, America has always defined itself by fabricated images. That's how Arthur Miller characterized his Loman, who taught his son the false importance of being "well-liked" and soared into failure with his suitcase and a smile. Falling for the image is the real failure to see the big picture.Here the past image, the lost glory, is the Schwann bike, Alan's old company. The bike evokes America's lost station in the world, its mythic past of innocence, optimism, when it was a world power with clean hands and an unlimited future. Of course that was as illusory as the hologram. The Danish Embassy party is an orgiastic release from the Saudi restrictions. Yet Alan is as out of his element there as in the Saudi culture. Its noise, fever and license seem like another dream. He declines the woman's offer of sex out of an uncertain mix of his purity and impotence. Alan tries to negotiate the mysteries of the foreign culture. He's thrown by his driver's command of US pop music. He misses the banned booze ? and suffers even more when he gets some. He's especially at sea with the differences in gender issues. In a climactic paradox the woman doctor swims topless with him ? in order to divert suspicion! From behind, a topless woman and a man look the same, you see. The underwater frolic seems another dream, the positive replacement of the first. In a side episode Alan has to deal with a growth on his back. It's an image of a burden, a threat that proves benign. In a drunken initiative he tries to cut it out himself, another failed self-reliance. He finally has it removed by his woman doctor, who returns to lance his malignant love-life as well. If the romantic happy ending seems a bit forced and implausible ? that's because it is. This cross-cultural relationship is our anodyne, our relief from reality, another version of the false image of domestic bliss Alan will be offering his clients when he sells them the new apartments yet to be built on the Saudi sands. In that respect the entire film is a carefully selected image of Saudi Arabia. It's defined by its massive population, its alien dress and manners, its fervid religiosity, and its striking power. When someone decides to help Alan all his problems are immediately addressed. The huge and opulent buildings flash the new Muslim power, which dwarfs the American and leaves him helplessly dependent. The film frames out any suggestion of the Saudis' support of terrorism, especially 9/11, and its current political play as a counterforce to the even more disruptive Iran. But that's fine. The connotations remain, especially as we see how the Saudi businessman plays his American partner. Spelling out that political reality would probably have been too big a boil for the back of this satiric and pointed comedy to bear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does this title draw you in?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks plays a fish out water unless it's bottled. It's a clash of cultures movie that is mildly entertaining. There are some humorous moments that make you wish it was more of a comedy and less of a drama.It's hard to believe this movie would have been made if they didn't have Tom Hanks. He drags this through the dessert on his shoulders. There's an awkward series of scenes at a party and plenty of redundant scenes about the daily grind of doing business in Saudi Arabia while waiting for the King.The back story of the karma of Hanks selling out Schwinn bikes to China comes back to haunt him. The love story feels forced and it seemed as Rita Wilson had approval of the female lead.The good news is this movie is short. It is also very forgettable. No need to track it down on it's limited run, as it will be a bit more enjoyable for a quiet evening at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painfully Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just an awful film and very disappointing for me because I love Tom Hank's films. But he doesn't even look like he wants to be here. He supposedly goes to SA to save a deal with the Saudi gov't. but spends about 5 minutes doing what he was theoretically there for. Mostly he drinks a LOT and repeatedly wakes up late in the hotel (what, this businessman doesn't know to ask the front desk for a wake-up call!?). Aside from the "business" aspects of this movie, i.e., why his character is in Saudi Arabia to begin with (takes up about 10 minutes total in the movie), there is a romantic encounter with a (MARRIED) Saudi woman.Let me be real clear here. I worked for a year in SA (and my oldest son was actually born there which is another story and a half in itself) and this "romance" would NEVER happen. These folks have known each other for like 2 weeks (timeline is non-existent in this movie) and she goes topless swimming with him? But what is really unbelievable here is that a married Saudi woman (or any Saudi woman) would be alone with him in the first place (forget the driver, they would be Korean, Pakistani, Chinese, etc., i.e, non-persons as far as the Saudis are concerned). She would be completely compromised no matter how innocent she was! I understand she is getting a divorce from her husband but here she is sill married. What would happen in SA if her husband found out about this behavior is very simple - he had the right and he probably would kill her as a matter of honor or, at a minimum, beat her into a coma, and he would never, ever be charged or prosecuted. And even if Hank's character didn't know this, she would, and would never put the two of them in such a dangerously compromising situation.Save yourself the misery and give this clunker a wide berth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Terrible Script Written by Someone Watching CNN Growing Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the plot being ridiculously unrealistic and white/America supremacist--yes, in the scriptwriters' opinion a married (you heard right, there is no mention in the film that she actually got the divorce) Saudi woman with two kids living with her can have an affair with a white guy from the U.S. without any problems because no one is going to find out, nor her kids or her husband--the stereotype of Saudi people, the Philipines and the Chinese in this film is just so cringe-worthy that made it too laughable for people from these cultures to be offended. I mean, seriously? You can't keep your company running and it's all the Chinese's fault? And the Chinese doctors who are obviously qualified to work in a Saudi hospital can't speak English? And your hologram project wasn't accepted because the Chinese stole the opportunities from you? Like really? Whose fault is it that your company's hologram equipment is so much slower and way more expensive? Oh yes, it's of course the Chinese's fault. Went to see the film on the premiere night at a screening event. Heard someone said "It's just a terribly written script to start with," on his way out. Way to go pathetic film scriptwriters who are too biased to see they are biased.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A big disappointment!! I decided to watch the movie because of Tom Hanks, and I still can't understand how actors like him accept to participate in this type of movie. Initially we all think it's about a business with the SA king, but it's about everything in the world except that... He has problems with his daughter: 5 minutes of the film He likes his doctor: 20 minutes of the film. He is drunk: 10 minutes. He goes with his driver to nowhere: 15min I mean.. I ended knowing nothing about anyone, because the movie is definitely not deep... In the end, I just felt sad about the way women are treated in those countries... I already knew it, but it is different to watch it in front of us. And in the movie, it probably was a soft vision of SA society. Resume: I wouldn't watch this not even in my Friday afternoon... Totally waste of money</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good film about being 60, being alone, being abroad and being open-minded.Tom Hanks is a troubled man sent to KSA to sell something on behalf of a big American Corporate. And there he clashes with Arabic Culture in his usual thoughtful and suspended-judgment way.I won't tell you what happens, of course, but after a quick look to the other reviews (someone even claims to have even fallen asleep) I understood that not everyone have liked it. And I'm surprised but I won't comment. I would just say, for those who could possibly share my feelings, that this was a good film: interesting, clever and not slow at all. Just, maybe, a little different. Images are great and the story depicts nicely our difficult times. Besides: is there a such thing as a bad Tom Hanks' film?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A below average attempt at a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All I knew about this film was that it had tom hanks in it and because he is easily one of the best actors around I would give it a watch. The premise of the film sees hanks who is a businessman trying to sort out a deal in Saudi Arabia while trying to get his life back together. Now tom hanks is great in this film as you would expect, he just has that likability factor to him that makes you want to see him succeed. He deals with all the situations in a fun but relatable way that makes him a likable protagonist. I also quite like the character of yousef his driver. I felt like they had good chemistry together and their interactions were easily the funniest part of this film. However, I didn't really care about anybody else in this film. Whether it was the doctor who looks after him or his daughter I just didn't have a connection with either characters and maybe could have done without it. The story has a good journey of discovery for hanks as you see his character growing throughout the film. However, there is so much going on in this film that it is hard to focus on all the story arcs and it becomes a bit of a narrative mess. The script doesn't have enough funny moments in it to justify a decent script and most of the drama comes across as forced unless hanks is performing it well. The style is also a bit of a mess with the pacing being all over the place and making this film feel incredibly long when in reality it wasn't. Overall this is a very forgettable film that isn't really worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read a review of this film that said something like "Tom Hanks at his best...", and all I thought was, "Did we see the same film?". Because after watching this, my first thought was, "Why did Tom Hanks want to do this? Anyone could have played that role. It's not a star vehicle and it's just not all that interesting."I understand that this film was adapted from a novel. Now that I've seen this, I imagine the book must have been pretty interesting, but this just doesn't work for me as a film. It actually reminded me of the TV movies that were popular on network TV in the 70s and 80s. As a feature, I found it... slow. Meandering. Ultimately pointless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This isn't bad but the caliber of Hanks really adds depth and emotion to this character and makes the movie worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I think we should expect the unexpected." Alan (Hanks) is a businessman who is struggling and who's life is falling apart. He is sent to Saudi Arabia in order to convince the king to use his company's technology. When he gets there it is not at all what he expected, and in the middle of the desert Alan begins to really discover who he is. This is a movie that isn't bad but really comes down to the fact that Tom Hanks is such a great actor that he carries the movie on his own. By that I mean that this movie isn't all that exciting and may not have been made if not for Hanks. He can turn a barely watchable movie into something much better than it should be just by his skills alone. Essentially his character spends his time waking up late and riding in a taxi only to be told that the king isn't here today. Over and over. The caliber of Hanks really adds depth and emotion to this character and makes the movie worth seeing. Very few actors can do that. Overall, an OK movie at best but Hanks makes this watchable and he is the real reason to watch this. I give it a B-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film Out of Our Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of this movie didn't help market itself unless one had already seen the movie. That's a big problem, a movie title. Subsequently though this more substantive version of Lost in Translation (2003) that includes much more of a relational component offers up a pungent and enlightening as well as dramatic collision of two cultures. Along with a nice comedic tone with dramatic and sometimes fearful moments, Holograph does nicely with sustaining the audience's interest and revealing an entertaining, intriguing storyline about a wonderful but frustrating business opportunity in Saudi Arabia. This perhaps fictional behind the scenes look at Saudi culture is fascinating and the relational story lines are also quite compelling, if not perhaps completely believable.Unlike Slumdog Millionaire (2008), Holograph offers a duality between strikingly different cultures. Unlike Roman Holiday (1953), Holograph offers a more equitable status between characters who are more identifiable to a average American audience while at the same time highlighting the delicate and sometimes comical and serious cultural barriers. Another culture clash movie, Fear and Trembling (2003) perhaps comes closest to the revelation and exposure of the intimate dynamics of the differences in ethnic behavior and attitudes. Fear and Trembling however is much more focused as a serious cultural study whereas Holograph is more fluid and mainstream Hollywood in its presentation but in a good way.In sum, Holograph is an insightful and delightful look into the interactions between the personal cultural differences along with a basic meaningful human sameness undertone of invaluable importance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unexpected Saudi Arabia with skinny dipping women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Attracted by the filming locations in Morroco and Egypt, which I both visited, and not having seen a Tom Hanks movie in a long time, I was ready to be charmed Well, we all age and the Tom Hanks on this screen is a long cry from 'Big' or 'Joe versus the Volcano'.but he pretty much got the ugly American business man right, though billing him as middle-aged at age sixty is stretching it. I doubt he will reach the ripe age of 120. As the story goes the movie "Lost in Translation" and the acting of Bill Murray did a much better job to portray the alienation a short time visitor feels in a different culture. I have not read the book this story is based on and after watching the movie I have very little desire to do so, but I hope that the book has a little more depth than what we see on screen. The author, the screen writer and the director are all males and consequently this unattractive, failing elderly business man still has all the women he meets falling all over him. At least the women are not twenty or thirty years younger, but only ten or twelve, the reason for that maybe because the director is European where age discrimination against women is not so bad as in the States. Nevertheless I doubt that a fifty year old Saudi Arabian woman goes skinny dipping on her first date, this is pure male fantasy as well as being assaulted by a middle aged woman at a party. I always enjoy watching Sarita Chowdbury though, naked or not. The happy ending seems as improbable as the guy with his driver accidentally ending up in Mecca. The idea behind the movie is interesting, the execution missed the mark. Again Sophia Coppola has done it much better, though I sometimes think she is a one trick pony because I have never seen a movie from her again which captivated me.. .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is of the sort that is very rare in modern cinema (or the cinema of any period, really): a thoughtful, compelling story for adults in which the life of the protagonist gets better, not worse. A bombastic, jarring, and hilarious opening sequence fills us in on everything that's gone wrong in Alan Clay's (Tom Hanks) life- he's lost his house, his fancy car, his wife, and he's about to go to Saudi Arabia on business. He attributes all of his other problems (lack of energy, poor job performance, sexual impotence) to a benign tumor on his back. He struggles with a lack of Wi-Fi and air conditioning, a business "contact" that always seems to be out of town, indefinite delays, and the innumerable laws and customs of a foreign land. These Kafkaesque elements and director Tom Tykwer's touches of magical realism seem at first to shape A Hologram for the King into a surreal black comedy, the sort of story where the failed businessman is battered down by the inhumanity of capitalism and decides to kill himself rather than face the pathetic reality of his life. But Clay's Middle Eastern odyssey becomes strangely uplifting as he alternately battles and bumbles his way through all his woes. Hologram is never as single-faceted as the moral fable, financial drama, or culture-clash comedy it could have been; instead, it is a subtly heartfelt and frequently hilarious film that shows us that the human experience may not be as hopeless as most other "serious" movies would have you believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad. Sad. Sad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently divorced Alan Clay (Tom Hanks) is a struggling salesman who is sent to Saudi Arabia to get the king to purchase an I.T. program that uses holograms. He is on a tentative basis with his daughter Kit (Tracey Fairway) and is afraid he won't be able to pay for her college. Still she is supportive of him. Sometimes I wonder why some movies are made in the first place as nothing really happens although we are kept waiting for something to happen. Sad. Alan undergoes a mild culture shock and one would think anyone going to a new country with far different cultural mores would - at the very least - learn some basic language greetings, and of course, his "howdy" doesn't do it. He asks for a beer in the hotel and is told it is not allowed. He meets a Saudi woman doctor Zahra (Sarita Choudhury) who is in the process of getting a divorce and he falls for her. At times they are both alone (Whaaaat?) Zahra does treat him for a cyst on his back. It is my understanding that woman doctors in Saudi Arabia only treat women. He experiences numerous delays that hinder meetings to get his company's product presented.Alan does have a good relationship with his driver, Yousef (Alexander Black) but Yousef always has to check to see that his car won't be blown up by the husband of the wife he is sleeping with. Their banter in the car is pretty good, but the problem is this: Alan's driver would be a nationality other than a Saudi and not a Saudi. Alan sees mannequins in a store window that sport bikinis. Why the Director allows something like this that would never be allowed in this country is beyond me. Yousef brings Alan to his family who live in the mountains and he asks Alan if he would fight for him should Yousef decide to join a revolution. It is here we think the main plot will take form, but it seems those script pages were lost in the desert winds and this goes nowhere. When will something happen? We are besides ourselves. Wait. Wait. Alan has a date with Zahra the woman doctor who takes him to her home and they go snorkeling and we see her topless in the water with Alan. (Whaaaaat??) Is this it? The main plot? Sadly, no. Sad. I don't know what city he is in, but the first time he enters the hotel he is greeted by the desk clerk with, "Welcome to the Hyatt Hotel, Jeddah." This is very strange as Alan is told the person he was to meet was not there and is in Jeddah. (Say what?) Maybe I heard it wrong. The clerk says this every other time Alan enters the hotel. Apparently, Tom Hanks is miscast in this. His facial expressions to indicate humor fail. Not good. There is nothing funny in here. The banter in the car with Yousef almost serves as comic relief, but again those script pages were eaten by camels and although the banter is good, it is not ha ha funny, and a far cry from a LOL funny. Apart from uncomfortable scenes within the Denmark Embassy with an aggressive Hanne (Sidse Babett Knudsen) nothing happens and we are lost. In this Embassy we see suggestive dances, make-out sessions, drug and alcohol use. Again, we wonder why some movies are made and why some A-List stars bother to be in them. Nothing happens to pique our interest. Nothing. Sad. Very sad. (4/10)Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes, the snorkeling scenes. Language: No</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hanks scores again with" King" film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hologram for a King *** (2016) 1hr. 37 min.Tom Hanks is one of the most versatile and gifted of the past 30 or so years. He has consistently made thought provoking movies of great intellect, some humorous some uplifting most of the time of great quality. I recently saw him at the College that I currently attend at Wright State University. He was very funny, talkative and a very engaging man who captivated the students of his Hanks ambiance and humor. I easily saw a man who loves his job and has great energy about him that is enlightening and entertaining. His current film "Hologram of a King" is a simple but interesting film about Hanks playing businessman down on his luck. So much so that his ex-wife gives him a hard time for not paying for their daughter senior year at college. The daughter is understanding, they have a good relationship, but Alan (Hanks) feels like a failure and has an interesting job opportunity is Saudi Arabia to present the King of that country a Hologram for his new resort that is still only in the planning stages. Things get off to a rocky start when the King constantly postpones their meetings and Alan keeps forgetting to get up early enough to go to his meetings with the King's associates and accepts a cab that is depleted but meets the driver of the cab Yousef (Alexander Black) they strike up a friendship as Alan tries to adjust to the very conservative values of Middle Eastern life. Alan is also dealing with a huge bump on his back and is very annoyed by it and seeks help from a female doctor Zahara (Sarita Choudhry) there is chemistry between them abut they have very guarded by curious language as they converse with not being too telling of their feelings for each other.Scenes that made the greatest impression on me is when Alan makes a joke to a Arabic man while walking on a long stretch a highway that is surrounded by sand and dust., and that joke gets him in great trouble. Another scene where Alan has the opportunity to kill a wolf in clear view and questions whether to shoot or not is something that he struggles with. And scenes where Alan takes matters into his own hands but trying to cut way that mysterious large bump on his back; leads to disastrous results. There also a scene late in the film where Alan and Zahra and goes on a memorable swim in the ocean that leaves and indelible mark with the couple.The film is a good movie about love of and mature couple that is sincere and romantic and the scenes of the culture clash between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia are effective and telling of how what you can and can't (mostly can't do) is a Muslim environment filled rules and regulations of how to behave in the Muslim World. It 'not a great movie but it is interesting and proves that Hanks is one of the most likable stars that we root for in the movies. To find whatever he wants and needs in his life in this film and on the basis of this film we appreciate Hanks' genuine sincerity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First Hanks flick I haven't liked since I don't know when.Kept waiting for the story to develop or for something humorous to happen. No such luck. When you find out it isn't some trippy dream he's having is when you really start to wonder what this movie is supposed to be about.Maybe he was miscast. I didn't read the book, but I just checked out the Amazon reviews. Sounds like maybe this would have been better suited to a William H. Macy type.Could have sworn this movie was over 2 hours long. Cannot think of anything redeeming about this movie unless you enjoy the feeling of being perplexed for 90 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A Hologram for the King" is a two-dimensional imitation of Tom Hanks' normally multi-dimensional movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He is one of the most popular ? and simply one of the best ever in his profession. Statistics prove it and he has the accolades to back it up. He has more hits and a higher percentage of hits than most in his profession could ever dream of. His successes also helped many others in their careers. Whether he walked or was running, he was rarely off base. In fact, he has the best on-base percentage in baseball history. I'm talking, of course, about Ted Williams, Boston Red Sox slugger, 1939-1942 and 1946-1960 (his career interrupted by World War II). Williams is close behind Babe Ruth in career home runs, slugging percentage and walks, has the highest career batting average in the past 100 years, the highest on-base percentage ever and his impressive RBI totals helped add to the run stats of many other players.Who did you think I was talking about? Well, yeah, I guess that most of what I just said about Ted Williams is true about Oscar-winning actor-producer Tom Hanks as well. Hanks also has a remarkably high career batting average ? at the box office, but even the best don't get a hit every single time. The comedy-drama "A Hologram for the King" (R, 1:37) is a rare whiff for one of our most popular actors.Hanks is Alan Clay, a washed-up, put-upon Boston corporate salesman on a business trip to Saudi Arabia. Alan's father (Tom Skeritt) criticizes him, his ex-wife (Jane Perry) hounds him and his college-aged daughter (Tracey Fairaway) is caught in the middle. Alan's boss (Eric Myers) belittles him and makes unreasonable demands, like the exact time when the ruler of a Muslim country will sit down for a tech presentation.Alan is in Saudi Arabia with a 3-person tech team from his company, hoping to sell the king a video teleconferencing system which features a hologram of the person on the other end of the call. The king is building a new business center out in the desert and Alan's team is in the exhibition hall waiting to hear when the king will stop by. The exhibition hall is a nearby tent where the air conditioning only works some of the time, the wi-fi doesn't work at all and there is no food. Alan's repeated trips over to the business center to find solutions are met with indifference and Alan grows increasingly frustrated.Personally, Alan is having a hard time adjusting to his new surroundings ? in every way imaginable. He gets some help with the obvious culture shock from his driver, Yousef (Alexander Black), a Saudi national who once lived in the U.S., orients Alan to the culture and provides the film's comic relief. Alan also has problems with oversleeping, finding a drink in a country where alcohol is officially banned and is occupied with concern about a mysterious new growth in the middle of his back. For that first one, he has Yousef, for the second, a very friendly Danish businesswoman (Sidse Babett Knudsen) and for the third, a female doctor (Indian actress Sarita Choudhury), with whom he would like to become friendlier."A Hologram for the King" may not sound like a lot of fun, but? it's even less fun that it sounds. Hanks is game, but after the movie's bizarre narrative opening (set to "Once in a Lifetime" by The Talking Heads) and a long period in which Hanks does little more than scowl, complain and look surprised and/or distressed, even watching Tom Hanks becomes tiresome. His signature charm doesn't show up until late in the film and by then it is too little too late. The supporting cast is solid, but not enough to adequately support Hanks, who gets walked at the plate, then appears winded as he rounds the cinematic bases.Of course, it would help if the story were better. The film is based on Dave Eggers' 2012 novel (a National Book Award finalist) and was adapted by German writer-director Tom Tykwer, who also directs this film and previously collaborated with Hanks on 2012's disappointing "Cloud Atlas". This fish-out-of-water (and-in-the-desert) story follows a template similar to Bill Murray's 2015 "Rock the Kasbah" (which was more fun) and Tina Fey's 2016 "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot" (which was funnier). Those movies were marginally enjoyable, but this one is less so. It also has elements similar to Hanks' "Cast Away" (2000), but is not as interesting. The climactic scene referred to in the title film's title is decidedly anti-climactic and the rest of the plot points are well-meaning but uninspiring. Of course, like baseball great Ted Williams, Hanks' reputation as one of the all-time greats in his field is well-deserved and secure, but I have to say that it feels like he struck out in his latest plate appearance.

		<shortDescription>A beautiful movie. But the topic destroyed everything.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically it's a wonderful movie. It's creating a wonderful atmosphere. The characters perform beautifully. The wonderful soundtrack accompanies the whole movie perfectly. The script and story are solid. One may ask, how could this movie fail?The answer is simple. It's not a movie for the international audience. Basically this movie was made and produced by Germans. When I lived in Germany, one thing came to my attention: Germans have a much more different view of political correctness as Americans have. If you have never lived in the US or experienced the point of view towards political correctness in the US, you will have troubles to access the US standpoint and market.Now, let's see what this movie deals with. It's a very sensitive topic, when your protagonist is an American and travels to Saudi Arabia and falls in love to a married Saudi woman and decides to live there. Guys, I admire your courage to try this. But I would have said the moment I saw the script, this is going to be hell of a challenge for the US market! To find the right finesse to make this movie great is one of the greatest challenges, because you have to deal with the most sensitive topics in the world at this moment.However, the producers played around with clichés way too much and had not enough respect for the sensitivity of the matter. Usually playing with clichés works perfectly in an action movie when your target audience consists of people just looking for entertainment and accept clichés. However, addressing a much higher educated target audience with this movie, you can't effort to mess around with clichés like this.So dear Germans: I know you did a wonderful movie. But you can't just focus on technique, camera, music and script - Making a movie is more than just technique. You have to understand your target audience first. You really have to get some advice from people and do your research. I believe you have been putting too much effort into the beauty of movie- making, but you have failed to understand the audience. However, it was a very enjoyable setting in overall. I'm sorry for you guys that you missed an important opportunity to address the audience. And that's a fail. A financial fail and fail in success.To be honest, I would have chosen another topic. With your movie- making power, you could have done a tremendous movie if it wasn't for such a sensitive topic. You basically were doomed to fail the moment you chose a topic like this. Very bold, but naive.</fullReview>

Hanks' performance was very good, as he managed to make us both laugh and sad at moments, perfectly getting across the worried character that he is and helping us feel how he feels. The others did well, too, and I liked the funny taxi driver and his wisecracking attitude made me laugh.

It all started fine with the Talking Heads intro, but it soon tried to copy parts of Lost in Translation, a mid-life crisis, fear for the need to perform and a lot of stories on it's own that didn't get explained at all. So, you have this guy (Tom Hanks) who is send to Saudi Arabia, with an unclear assignment, always being late on work, and therefor meeting some paranoid guy with an ipod in his car. For some reason these 2 guys get in a very shallow relation, based on Tom Hanks being driven to some near-future project that has no foundation at all. He meets a doctor, because of a big lump on his back, he meets strange people who seem to live in luxury appartements without any connection to the outside world, he gets involved with the driver, who wants to escape from an alleged adultery, being driven to a distant village, where they are to shoot a wolf, and he finally gets in a relationship with the doctor that treated his lump.

		<fullReview>I kind of like it but I don't think i don't think it's acceptable as a mainstream movie. I don't even know the other people in this movie. They all seem to be indie actor. Or so I think. The only think I like about this movie is when they snorkel in the sea. I enjoyed the scenery that they depicted here. I love the shot. It was so picturesque. However, I couldn't really understand why the woman had to snorkel bra-less. I mean, she could have dived in wearing her two-piece. And Man, she is a Muslim in a Muslim country. How come the director allowed people to think that it's okay for a divorcée like her to go on a secret rendezvous with a non-Muslim? That's insane. Anyway, it's not even worth wait for DVD release. They could have cast someone for this movie, not Tom Hanks. I'm not a huge fan of Tom Hanks, but I do think this movie doesn't suit his appearance. Oh well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As with so many of the reviews I've read, I went into this, skeptical of the movie itself, but fully expecting the extraordinary talent of Tom Hanks to completely make it. And as with so many other reviewers, I was disappointed, though not by Hanks himself.The movie lacked a sense of self. I think that Tom Tykwer was attempting to establish some sort of whimsical rhythm to the story, to draw humor out of the monotonous, and to utilize Hanks' acting chops in a manner similar to Wes Anderson's Grand Budapest Hotel with Ralphe Fiennes. However where as Wes Anderson handles such a movie with the delicate and meticulous approach of a true artist, Tykwer missed his mark entirely, and the whole movie played with a sense of directorial and writing laziness. The formulaic elements of this movie were evident throughout. 1) Pressure at work for Hanks' character so we feel some sort of deadline. 2) Daughter's tuition bills (because apparently the only way she can go to college is if he pays out of pocket) so we know the stakes are high. 3) Health concerns for Hanks, which I initially thought would be some sort of personal dilemma situation, but turned out to just be a device to get him to meet the love interest. 4) unlikely cross-cultural romance develops. 5) The actual titular "hologram" turns out to not even be important, is really only one scene of the movie, and even after the big IT pitch ultimately fails, we see that nothing particularly (or remotely) bad happens. The movie was really a series of scenes, that were as predictable as they were disappointing. The repeated waking up late, showering, and getting in the old car with his driver (Alexander Black, who is the movie's only truly compelling character, and extremely well acted), and ultimately achieving nothing at the presentation site - became very taxing. There was no element of "can you believe this is happening again" instead, as Hanks' character goes out and parties the night before, I just began to roll my eyes as the inevitability of this time filling sequence looms. Hanks himself did very well with what he was given, and I the only marks I hold against him are for taking a movie with the potential to go so wrong given the generally uninteresting script. Even still, I think, as I said before, in the hands of a different director, we could have had a much more enjoyable movie on our hands.I feel like I'm all over the place here. Ultimately I think the entire directorial approach was rather vapid and uninspired.</fullReview>

Because it means he can choose simply the best scripts available. This movie is no different. Slow? Perhaps at times, but not dull.

		<shortDescription>A definitively quirky indie film made exponentially better by Hanks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a lot of favourite actors. Tom Hanks has always been one of them. But if someone held a gun to my head and asked me who the greatest actor of this generation is...I could caught saying Tom Hanks. I won't get into why but as he gets older and more involved in producing we don't get as much from him lately. This is definitely outside his comfort zone as a quirky very dark comedy with not a lot of purpose and you will sort of be confused as to what this is saying and what it is and I'm not sure there is an answer for that. It's a mid-life crisis set in the middle east mixed with a man finding himself and just sort of a story about a man discovering more to his life than just sales and family. It has romance and chuckles and some really great perspective into Saudi Arabian culture. The bizarre twist of a romance more than mid-way through the film is sort of welcomed and done in a very unique and realistic way. Indie lovers will likely be charmed by it but the truth of the matter is Tom Hanks makes this movie watchable.Hanks gives a solid performance and some serious depth to this man caught up in his career and his distant family and he finds himself leaving again when he has a health scare and falling in love with a woman different than anyone he has ever met. Hanks looks fantastic and he just gives a very subtle and real performance like he does best. Sarita Choudhury plays his doctor and love interest and she is very good. She has a certain mysterious quality to her and her and Hanks have very good chemistry. Supporting cast includes Alexander Black in a wonderfully comedic sidekick role (I could have watched a whole film with Black and Hanks together), Tracey Fairaway, David Menkin and Christy Meyer although they really don't get much screen time and their characters are strictly there for Hanks' development.Co-writer and director Tom Tykwer is a desired taste. He co-directed the bizarre Cloud Atlas, Perfume and others I hadn't seen. This is a little more down to earth for him and it's a good story but it rests on the back of Hanks and Tykwer should be grateful for that. Without him the story is weak and slow and muddled but because you get to watch Tom Hanks play this role it makes it that much better. So worth seeing but definitely an acquired taste and only for the indie lovers. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The vagaries of doing business in Saudi Arabia.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We watched this at home on DVD from our public library. It has a couple of interesting "making of" extras.I wanted to see this for two reasons, I generally like Hanks' movies and back in the 1990s I had the opportunity to travel to Saudi Arabia for a week of work as an auditor. So I enjoyed seeing this which brought back fond memories of my visit there.The basic story involves Tom Hanks as Alan, who at middle age was forced into a sales job after China caused the USA bicycle business to crater. Alan works for an IT company, they are bidding for a large Saudi Arabian project, IT for a city being built from scratch in the desert near the sea. He doesn't necessarily relish this assignment but he has to work.Naturally he encounters many issues, some because of the differences in customs, some because Saudi notions of keeping appointments differ quite a lot from his. While this is a drama of sorts they actually play it more as a comedy, and a key role is American actor Alexander Black as Yousef, a driver that ends up bringing Alan a number of places.Alan has a large lump on his back and one night in his hotel room decides to explore it with the help of a steak knife. The next day, bleeding, he goes to a clinic and is treated by pretty Indian actress Sarita Choudhury as the doctor, Zahra. They end up making a deeper connection, as it turns out both of them are getting out of marriages, so their coupling is the added love interest here.Looking at the cost of making the movie and the paltry box office it seems this movie has not been a success. To me it is a minor movie but it is entertaining and I enjoyed it for the reasons I state upfront. It was filmed mostly in Morocco, doing so in Saudi Arabia would have been too difficult.SPOILERS: In the end, after the Saudis gave Alan the runaround for a while, they announced they were giving the contract to a Chinese group, they could deliver the technology in half the time and at half the cost. But Alan got himself the doctor! And he quit his USA based sales job and took a job as a coordinator with the Saudis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From realistic to the surreal (slightly)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is nothing that you have not seen in this movie and yet it manages to give you a small sense of surreal. The exotic (a dwindling concept as the world is so much smaller these days) setting in the Middle East may be a reason. However, the opulent familiarity of Dubai cannot do that. But then, this movie is not set in Dubai. Rather, it is some desert coast of Saudi Arabia in the middle of nowhere. This land is going to become an entirely designed city with an ideal population of 1.5 million. But it has to be built first and part of the infrastructure is, it goes without saying, IT. The protagonist, sort of an American Everyman called Alan, (Tom Hanks) is there with his company's sales pitch, to be highlighted in a presentation of a hologram tele-conference, hence the title. While the "KMET" (King's Metropolis of Economy and Trade) that spearheads this new development is a modern, if not completely state-of-the-art office complex, the "office" Alan and his three staff has been given is a sloppy tent "temporarily" without air-condition and Wifi. The King who is the target audience is more elusive that Godot. Even his minion designated to liaise with Alan is an expert in playing hide-and-seek.Recalling a little of Bill Murray's character in "Lost in translation" (but with less depth), Alan's sojourning in Saudi Arabia, stranger-in-a-strange-land fashion, does capture the audience's interest because of two interesting encounters. The first is the daily rides in a rented automobile Alan refers to as "this thing" owned and driven by Yousef (an excellent Alexander Black) who is quite comfortable with American culture, even goofily so. The bantering of the duo is familiar and enjoyable comedy. This culminated into Alan being invited to Yousef's home village, with a night adventure of hunting wolves to boot. Nothing much really happened but you may recall with a smile Humphry Bogart's immortal concluding line in "Casablanca": I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship".The other fills in the romantic content, not absolutely mandatory in every movie, but usually good-to-have. It starts as a purely professional encounter in which Doctor Zahra (a very good Sarita Choudhury) operates on a benign (but threatening to turn malignant if ignored) lump of Alan's back. As these are two people both suffering from a failed marriage, there is really nothing unusual about the ensuing romantic turn of events. Some elaboration on my summary line and I am done. I shall illustrate this with two separate scenes.During the visit to Yousef's village, Alan wanders off to capture the scenery with a camera, comes across a chatty local who speaks English, carries on a friendly conversation with him and end up doing the wrong thing. When asked if he is CIA, Alan attempts a wise crack, something like "Not full time, just moonlighting". Word spreads around like wildfire and Alan finds himself confronted by a hostile gathering of villagers. Movie makers may be tempted to devise an outlandish way for Alan to get out of this mess. Not these ones making "Hologram". Alan simply asks Yousef to appeal to the common sense of the people, asking them if a CIA agent would walk around admitting that to everybody. That works; bomb diffused, so to speak. How realistic can you get?As to the surreal, I have said that the romance is quite ordinary. The flirting via email, a post-script to the doctor-patient relationship, is quite nicely done but has nothing surrealistic about it. The consummation, however, is arrived at through a somewhat surreal sequence. At Zahra's luxury seaside resident to which Alan has been invited, after some small talks over nice drinks, the charming host suddenly declares "It's swim time". In borrowed trunks and goggles, Alan is ushered into an underwater paradise by his host, who says "I'll join you soon". When she appears later behind him, she cautions "I am dressed exactly like you, so that if neighbors spot us at a distance, they will think that it is two men swimming". In the ensuing mesmerizing, surrealistic underwater shots, she is anything but "exactly like him".</fullReview>

I haven't read the book, so I had nothing to compare it too. Before, I could trust Tom Hanks movies as being good, but after this one, I have to question his movies from now on, whether I will see them or not. You aren't missing anything if you skip this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a gentle dream ride of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MILD SPOILERS AHEAD IN THIS REVIEW, PROCEED WITH THAT WARNING IN MIND. I confess I have not read the novel by Eggers. When I first considered renting this film, the title put me off. Something about "hologram" made me wary. But I put my trust in the artistic judgment of Tom Hanks. I know only a little about life in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. A few glimpses of stories of the restrictions and the executions. I was able to comfortably identify with the Clay character (Hanks) as he struggled to move forward in the foreign culture. I understood his flashback recall of his life back in the States. I think they perhaps might have let him more deeply feel and show his fear about his medical concern. But as the story moves forward to the unexpected romance it turns a corner and pays off. The swim is for me one of the greatest movie scenes in my adult life. I will never forget it. Please do choose to watch this film. You will enjoy the dream ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and hearty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although many may argue that this film is one of Hanks' worst ones, I for one found it beautiful. Im not talking just about the visuals. The film overall is beautiful with its overall feel-good approach (which is more highlighted towards the second half). Great acting by Hanks and Sarita Choudhary. Stunning visuals by Frank Griebe. Great direction by Tykwer. I did not expect the director of Perfume and Run Lola Run to make such a film. Genre changing music direction by Johnny Klimmek. I found the second half better than the first whereas most found it the opposite. The ending is on a positive note which gives us a refreshing feel. Overall, an entertaining, fun movie, if you're in the mood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underlying meanings even in the title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the movie was more about Alan falling in love and finding some happiness in an unlikely place, Saudia Arabia. The title is misleading and probably does not ring true to the book. As I have not read the book that did not bother me. I was not expecting much after reading some of the reviews. I know little of Saudia Arabia so whether it was culturally accurate or not was not an issue for me. There were some beautiful scenes like the one when Alan is swimming in the ocean. Another place where the scenery was highlighted was when Alan described the desert as beautiful and walked around like he was in a magical place. There is humour and pain. I think people have not looked deeply enough at the theme of this movie. Pain can be physical but also emotional. Is he a failure? Can he feel better about himself? Is he searching for something? What can he find in Saudia Arabia? What is a hologram? It exceeded my expectations and the more I think about it the more I understand it has depth and people should look for meaning beyond a man trying to sell a hologram to a King because that took up a few minutes of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It does move slow at times. But that is forgotten as you are taken in by the cast and culture. Tom Hanks of course adds his strength to the film, but Alexander Black as Yousef added humor to a story that might otherwise have been too dark. Sarita Choudhury, a talent that has been around for years since she played opposite a very young Denzel Washington in Mississippi Masala, played a wonderful character as a smart, beautiful Saudi doctor in a very challenging culture. The background of Saudi Arabia adds the spice that brings it together. I had just visited Oman a few months ago and this movie brought me back to the warmth of people I had worked with in Muscat. If you like unique movies, with great actors and a story that enlightens, take the time to watch. After all that, it has a very fine ending.</fullReview>

This movie lacked the traditional intensity that a Tom Hanks film usually delivers. I can't put my finger on just what I didn't like about the film. Was it the fact that this movie couldn't decide if it was a love story, or a comedy? Or that the underdevelopment of the characters left me scratching my head. Or that the storytelling seemed rushed in slow moving manner. In any case, I was disappointed in this movie when I walked out of the theater. I was a little surprised that Hanks even took this role after reading the script. This movie was beneath his talent. Anybody could have played the part and done just as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Globalization Comes to the Screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the bonus segment of the DVD of "Hologram for the King," the screenwriter-director Tom Tykwer stated that his intention was to adapt the Dave Eggers novel to the screen as a comedy. In fact, the film was much more complex as a drama, romance, and comedy, with some interesting insights into the contemporary global economy.Tom Hanks brings depth to the protagonist Alan Clay, a failed business executive who travels to Saudi Arabia to attempt to sell to the king a state-of-the-art hologram system for international conferencing. While the story focuses on the frustration of Clay's attempts to deliver his sales pitch, the more interesting aspects of the film are in Clay's character.To put it mildly, Clay has some baggage from a failed marriage and a checkered business career in which he stumbled in attempting to sell the rights to the Schwinn bicycle organization to a Chinese conglomerate. Clay's decision-making led to the loss of American jobs and to the demise of the Schwinn bike itself. Now, he is attempting to redeem himself with a make-or-break deal with the hologram.There was some spectacular cinematography in the Saudi desert, and some good supporting performances from Alexander Black as Clay's fun-loving driver and the kind doctor played convincingly by Sarita Choudhury. But the film really belongs to Hanks, who elicits empathy as a beleaguered and likable loser.A weakness of the film was its overall credibility. It seemed as though the filmmakers wanted to evoke the old-style screwball comedy style of a film with Cary Grant or Jimmy Stewart. Yet at the same time, the film had pretensions of depicting complicated economic transactions in our contemporary era of globalization. There even seemed to be a social commentary about China's ability to out-hustle Americans in big deals throughout the planet. In the end, the never succeeded completely either as a drama, a comedy, or as social satire, which might explain the substandard box office results for a Tom Hanks film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had everything to be interesting but it failed big time. The plot is not convincing, it is really hard to connect emotionally or feel emphatic for the main character - Tom Hanks. The characters per se in the movie are not well 'studied', meaning, we know very little about them, they do things that are so cliché that are almost meaningless and the big 'challenge' of the movie is barely reminded at all. I know that the motif of the film is left behind because the character seeks and finds something else (love... for that matter), but still I don't think anyone could possibly feel anything for Tom Hank's relationship with his daughter, ex-wife, new lover, employees, annoying boss, etc. It is all very subtle and it doesn't have any depth. The only character that is a bit interesting is the local driver, also someone that becomes his companion. Although this driver is portrayed in a stereotype that is the classic point of view from a foreigner who has no clue what another culture looks like., The driver is also a badly explored character. Having weak characters and badly explored relationships, the movie counts with the scenarios and landscapes, which are cool and dreamy but at the same time, stereotypes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic tale of midlife crisis in an American salesman's life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Culture clash is an understatement in this beautiful comedy about an American sales rep who's trying to sell a piece of high end digital equipment to the Saudi King. The fact that the King is mostly absent from the drama gives a sense of a money fueled arrogance and the purposeful dilly dally of monarchs. Partly the reason why most modern countries throughout the world have opted for more democratic forms of governments over dynastic leaders. Tom Hank's character Alan almost pops out of the "Death of a salesman", except that he's willing to mend his ways and is trying to be the backbone for his family for which he might be a bit late. Still, he can't walk out of this. It screams of a mid-life crisis. His obvious foil is an attractive Danish woman, who is also here on business and is similarly stuck in the middle of a desert. His only support group consists of a local cab driver Yousef who dreams of bringing about a democratic revolution and a Hijab wearing doctor, Zahra who is going through a divorce herself. The story is a bit fast paced to refine the characters but it evokes the sense of chaos in Alan's life. The confusion led tension is epitomized when Yousef mistakenly drives Alan through the holy city of Mecca; where non-Muslim's are strictly not allowed. There are moments of calm actualization too but not without the awkwardness. A forbidden romance with Zahra and settling for a job in Saudi in an attempt to make more money could qualify as a clear symptom of the ongoing crisis. I felt the movie ended on a cliffhanger leaving everyone's fate unknown. Surely, Alan can't possibly imagine to continue on like this for long. There are few deliberate jibes at China for taking US jobs in manufacturing. All a part of Alan's supposed missteps but as he justifies "..it was complicated". Well, do we really care? Although, this story could be serialized as a TV show. Who wouldn't want to see a show set in middle east about an American salesman?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I simply loved this movie, I did not know what to expect and it ended up to be a nice surprise, Tom Hanks delivers a beautiful performance as you would expect Mr. Hanks to do, but the bonus reward was the performance of Alexander Black (in the role of Yousef), the pleasant screen chemistry both actors delivered with their performances was quite delightful to watch. This is not a movie for everyone, this is an enjoyable light comedy-drama about humans relations originating out of two "really different" cultures and I assume unless the viewer had at a certain time interacted with both of them, by that I mean the western and the middle eastern (mainly the Gulf region) cultures, one would not enjoy it as such, as you could tell from some of the negative reviews mentioned earlier.Tom Tykwer the director whom I enjoyed previous work as Run Lola Run 1998, Perfume 2006, The International 2009 and Cloud Atlas 2012, managed to display on the screen the culture shock of a westerner in Saudi Arabia, avoiding the usual negative stereotyping assumption that we would expect from a Hollywood movie when the subject involves the middle east region in general.I didn't have a chance to read the book but definitely I enjoyed the movie and wanted more when it ended, as mentioned earlier this is not a movie for everyone, if you enjoyed movies like "Lost in translation", "The best exotic marigold hotel" or even "The way way back", movies about regular people out of their usual environment then I surely recommend this one for you.</fullReview>

He goes to Saudi Arabia to sell his newest project, an interactive hologram presentation technology, to the King of Saudi Arabia.The first half of "A Hologram for the King" is interesting and entertaining, as it documents the mysterious life of an expat in Saudi Arabia. The main character deals with bureaucracy, the heat and the immense difference in culture. This half is funny, but the second half I do not quite like. The love story is just too unbelievable and contrived. I certainly do not believe that a Saudi woman would risk breaking the strict societal rules and go diving like that! If the plot is changed and concentrated on the events before and during the business meeting, then I would have liked it better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>different styles that do not mix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>as always, **SPOILERS**Hologram is the story of a big-kahuna salesman, now in Saudi Arabia to make the big sale to the elusive King; elusive, because as kings do, he rarely if ever shows up, leaving poor Tom Hanks in a tent in the desert, with his sales team waiting to set up a presentation for a IT product they want to sell.Caught in this boring situation, Hanks goes walkabout through Saudi, accompanies by a comedy character, his driver. Now, this comedy is perhaps the best of the film; the two actors do well with the material, and the sets support them to create some pretty good film moments. The director tries to sneak in some culture-clash bits, and does so quite heavy handedly, with Hanks risking death more than once .. the first sign that something is going wrong with the film.There is also a couple of flashbacks interspersed through the film, to tell how Hanks is going through a divorce and needs money, initially as a setup for his Saudi adventures, but as the film progresses, more as a negative force driving the character.And finally, halfway through what essentially seems like a comedy, the film completely switches over to Romance.Going as far as to completely disappear the main supporting character, Hologram completely switches both tone and pace, going from awkward comedy to existential romance.Tom Hanks is sure a fine actor, but i find it hard to believe he did not notice filming two entire different tones; maybe he just had divine faith in the editor.Hologram is a film that does not know what it wants to be, changing for the worse more than once, and becoming three entirely different films that demand three entirely different audiences.I would not recommend this film, if some of it will amuse you, for sure the other two-thirds will bore you, annoy you, or just plain shock you.My vote: 6/10 barely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hologram for the King (2016)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just got back from a showing for A Hologram for the King. These days it is rare to see Tom Hanks headlining a low-key film, which was the first thing that caught my interest. Usually this isn't the kind of film I'd rush out to see in a theater, but it wasn't really my first choice. Anyway I think it paid off. I almost cannot go wrong with independent films. I knew a bit of the summary before going in. I had seen the trailer beforehand. Generally, I like to keep an open mind before I see the movie. I feel there isn't much point going into a plot synopsis since you pretty much have it put on view. It is based on a Dave Eggers novel of the same name, although I haven't read it. I have heard of him because of an earlier book that was a recommendation called A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius.I like the visuals. It did not have a conventional look or way of narrative. After all, it is directed by the same guy who did Run Lola Run back in the late nineties. I am not in agreement to the seemingly popular opinion (by this site, at least) that this film is reminiscent to Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation. It's pretty surprising actually, that this film isn't liked by many, according to this site.Tom Hanks is regularly likable and reliable in his films although it has been a while since I last him in anything. While it seems he is ubiquitous, I had to wonder what was the last thing I saw him in after the film. He does have quite an extensive filmography.I thought the film was mostly strange but charming at the same time. It does get serious at points such as when his character Alan suffers from an anxiety attack and there is another physical weakness as well, but I think overall it ended on a good note. It seems strange because while watching, it didn't seem to have a clear-cut narrative the way a lot of movies usually are; i.e., like when Alan, who is constantly disappointed by the initial setup of his IT crew in a tent in Saudi Arabia especially on the third day; I wondered where they would go from there but it's the journey that makes it worthwhile even though it meanders a little bit. When he finally meets up with Karim Al-Ahmad, who is his contact, about their conditions of the arrangement, there are a few turns from that, but it doesn't stray too far. It is a pleasing and feel-good film. My grade: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so impressive at all, Tom Hanks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw that someone else doing a review compared it to Bill Murray's failed attempt to go to the Middle-East in Rock the Kasbah. A Hologram for the King is not nearly that bad. It did have me yawning and trying to keep awake, which is a bad thing.It has it's entertaining moments but it drags far too much.I've seen Tom Hanks in similar movies like this, were he gives us the whole Average Joe bit, but his leading man skills on this film do nothing for me, I did not feel the Hanks magic this time. I did not care for Tom's character's situation like I should.Hanks plays a businessman who was once on top of the game, but made a choice that cost him greatly. Trying to pick himself back up, he gets a job that lands him in Saudi Arabia trying to sell new technology to a Monarch. The Idea of Hanks going to Saudi Arabia to find himself seems to be the emotional plot, but I myself was very uninterested in the man he was when he came there and whoever he became afterwords.The only part of his journey that was at all interesting was his romantic relationship with his doctor, played by Sarita Choudhury. This was a great story of seasoned romance between people from two different cultures.I also like the comedic relationship that Tom Hanks had with a driver named Yousef, who help him get around the area, but this bond was no where near as gripping.So, over all A Hologram for the King, was not a bad film altogether, but I expected more from a movie driven by Tom Hanks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Preposterous, wholly unbelievable story of American businessman, on a ridiculous assignment in ultra conservative Saudi Arabia, who forms an extremely improbable alliance with a female doctor (with whom he appears to have absolutely zero chemistry) and ultimately decides to stay there to be with her, and as a result, probably never see his college-aged daughter again. There's the "happy" ending for you. There were at least three times when it seemed like an entire scene (possibly an entire reel) was missing, completely edited from the final cut, which gave the film a choppy feeling, like the studio had heavilly (and poorly) edited the film prior to release.Why was Hanne even there, as a potential love interest for Hanks, but he keeps turning her down? She disappears for a considerable amount of time, only to reappear, just to be turned down again by Hanks. Again, why?Hanks' driver was mildly amusing, but even he disappears midway through. Film can't decide if it wants to be a fish-out-of-water comedy, a love story, or a message movie, and ends up just being mostly pointless, completely unbelievable, entirely forgettable, also blandly acted (even by Hanks) , with only some impressive on-location photography in North Africa to recommend. I spent a lot of the film's runtime trying to figure if Tom Hanks had a hair transplant? I think he did.(It was only me, and exactly four others in the cinema during the advance screening, and two of them walked out two thirds into the film)Filmed from 6 March 2014 to June 2014, but not released until April 2016.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Hanks in Saudi Arabia: a 'fish out of water' experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Hologram For the King" (2016 release; 97 min.) brings the story of Alan Clay (played by Tom Hanks). As the movie opens, we see Alan sing the Talking Heads song "Once In A Lifetime" (...with a beautiful house, and a beautiful life... how did I get here?). Turns out Alan was dreaming as he's really on a plane headed to Saudi Arabia, where he and his sales team are to pitch a major IT sale to the King himself. (Only later do we understand what connection Alan has to the King.) Alan is not adjusting well upon his arrival, and in fact oversleeps the next morning. In a panic, Alan hires a car and driver to take him to the King's Metropolis of Economy &amp; Trade, site of the new project. At this point we're less than 10 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more might spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the big screen adaptation of Daved Eggert's bet-selling (and critically acclaimed) book of the same name. I have not read the book, so I cannot comment how closely (or not) the movie sticks to the book. The movie is written and directed by Tom Tykwer, the German director best known for Run Lola Run, and some years ago The International. Here he tackles the familiar "fish out of water" theme of an American being in unfamiliar territory and culture. When I saw the opening scene with the Talking Heads song, and we then dive straight into Saudi Arabia, the question of course is how the Tom Hanks character got to that particular point in his life (we later learn in flashback glimpses). I thought the first hour of the movie worked really well, and reminded me somehow in a general of Sofia Coppola's "Lost in Translation". The movie falters when the (inevitable?) potential romantic interest develops between the Tom Hanks character and his doctor (yes, a female doctor in Saudi Arabia!). when he develops a bad cyst on his back. Tom Hanks remains an enjoyable actor to watch, and develops a great chemistry with Alexander Black (in the role of the driver/guide). The movie is shot beautifully (Morocco and Egypt stand in for Saudi, although there is some very interesting footage from Mecca as well)."A Hologram for the King" opens this weekend, but my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati had a preview screening tonight (yes, Thursday is the new Friday). The screening was reasonably well attended, and judging from the crowd's reaction, most of them really enjoyed the movie. This looks like it could have some legs in the theater, assuming word-of-mouth builds. If you are interested in foreign cultures, I'd suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Tom Tykwer (Cloud Atlas, 3, Run Lola Run) adapted Dave Eggers popular novel A HOLOGRAM FOR THE KING for the screen and proceeded to direct it with a fine cast who try to hold together a story that is for the most part uninteresting. It does, however, give us some insights into life in Saudi Arabia, Muslim traditions, and the influence of China taking over most global projects from the rest of the entrepreneurial world.Since there is not much story, it is summarized as a failed American sales rep Alan (Tom Hanks) looks to recoup his losses (form the collapse of Schwinn begin taken over by the Chinese after a concept to make more money by outsourcing the bicycle manufacturing) by traveling to Saudi Arabia and selling his company's product ? holograms as an entrepreneurial concept to build influence and income - to the wealthy King of Arabia. Most of the film is Alan's frustration with the politics of Arabia (no one is ever where they promise to be), missing shuttles out to the middle of the desert where his company's plan is to be utilized in building a megapolis and using the same Uber driver Yousef (Alexander Black) to provide his tangled transportation. His company's presentation space is a makeshift tent (where his crew await Alan's arrival ? David Menkin, Christy Meyer, Megan Maczko) about which Alan is frustrated yet unable to change things. Alan notices a lump on his back, seeks the attention of a doctor (Sarita Choudhury) who treats him well and eventually forms a shrouded affair with Alan, ultimately presents his hologram (Ben Wishaw ? in a 30 second appearance) to the king's rep Karim Al-Amad (Khalid Laith) and ultimately to the king ? but of course it all is for naught because the Chinese underbid the project and promise faster results.Too many sidebars, a little sex, a nice view of deserts if that is your choice of landscapes, and in many ways a waste of talent, A HOLOGRAM FOR THE KING slipped out the short theater run for a good reason. Strictly for Tom Hanks devotees.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent movie(Spoiler alert)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Be careful, spoiler alert. Well, I just finished watching this movie, the only reason I watched it is because of Tom Hanks, and frankly speaking, it did not let me down. After watching it, I was surprised that it is labelled as a Comedy, to me, it was not a comedy at all. It is movie talks about cultural clash between US and mid-east, through things like marriage, dating, and business dealing. And the position US is in the world right now. Tom Hanks acted a mid-aged American manager from his firm to sell a product to the King, but King was not there as planned, so this incidence sets up a lot of things happened to him. Below is the plot I found quite interesting to me as a Chinese. There was a scene Tom's mid-east friend invited him to go for a hunt a wolf which was killing their sheep. Before the hunting actually began, the friend asked Tom whether or not this American friend of him would help if he personally started a revolution, Tom answered him with quite normal talking, "US loves to help people to fight for the freedom." But the most interesting part is that after this chat, his mid-east friend went to pray with his family while Tom alone was watching the sheep herd, he saw the wolf was coming, he can just kill the wolf, but he did not pull the trigger and did not tell his friend about this wolf. Maybe he was thinking:" it's not my war." Another thing is the position of US in the world, to showcase this, China was brought up several times in the movie, China was stealing Tom's former employer's techniques, so his former employer went down, his father was bashing China for constructing US's bridge, his major competitor is a Chinese company offers higher the quality but at half the price, which made his present company failed to make the deal (And from Tom's boss's talking, they might not even realize this competitor was even existed). And while he was undergoing a medical operation, two Chinese operation assistants was there to facilitate the procedure. The ever-presenting imagine of China is one of the many massages director try to deliver. It reveals the changing landscape of international dynamics. To wrap up, it is not a comedy, but an excellent movie. The only problem is the director may try too hard on sending too many message in a short period of time, which can be quite confusing sometimes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a wonderful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a wonderful movie. A simple movie about one's experience of life. I think Tom Hanks did a great job in the film. It definitely won't be everyone's cup of tea, as I can see on lots of the reviews. But the movie kept me engaged and I was sorry to see the movie end. It was a nice peek in to someone's life and their experience. I give the movie two thumbs up. There was a bit of added romance with an Arabian Zhara(Sarita Choudhury) woman which added a bit of suspense into the film. I thought the connection they had made in the movie even more lovely. But as I said earlier it's not everyone's type of movie. If your looking for something that stands out with a bang...this might not be it. The currents in this movie are subtle but most enjoyable. You'll either like the movie or kinda go..uh..what was that all about. But there's definitely people out there who will enjoy this movie as much as I did. Well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good film with fantastic performances all through the film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film with a good friend and we both really liked it. The plot seemed to meander from the main story at times but quickly returned to the main story of Alan's (Tom Hanks) quest to get a presentation up and running for the King. One scene takes place at a party with illegal alcohol being served with Alan getting completely drunk. Alan also discovers a lump on his back which quite stupidly, he tries to remove. His driver Yousef notices blood seeping through Alan's white shirt and forces him to visit a local hospital. It would be a spoiler to tell what happens with this plot line but I will say it is a very thoughtful diversion from the main story. When Alan and his team are finally able to get their presentation running for the King, the sequence is very stunning. All told, this is a great film with great performances by Tom Hanks, Alexander Black and Sarita Choudhry. The script is very well written and the opening 5 minutes are beautifully done. I highly recommend this great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'A HOLOGRAM FOR THE KING': Three Stars (Out of Five)The new quirky (and very bizarre) comedy-drama flick, from writer/director Tom Tykwer (who also wrote and directed the indie cult classic 'RUN LOLA RUN', and co-wrote and co-directed 'CLOUD ATLAS'). The lead of 'CLOUD ATLAS', Tom Hanks, stars in this movie as well. He plays a down on his luck American businessman, that travels to Saudi Arabia; to try and sell an idea of his to the government there. The movie co-stars Alexander Black, Sarita Choudhury, Sidse Babett Knudsen and Tom Skerritt. It's based on the book, of the same name, by Dave Eggers. I really wanted to like this movie, but it's way too slow- paced and uninvolving.The story is set in 2010 Saudi Arabia. A failed American businessman, named Alan Clay (Hanks), has traveled there, to try and make a business deal with a rich monarch. He's heartbroken, over a recent divorce with his wife, and thinks about his daughter constantly. Alan develops new relationships, during his business trip, as he desperately struggles to sell his product.The movie is definitely very quirky and strange, and I love quirky and strange. It's also very slow-paced, meandering and uninvolving though. Hanks does his best in the lead, and the supporting cast is all good as well, but the film is just plain boring (it's hard to sit through). I like Tykwer's other work, especially 'CLOUD ATLAS' and 'RUN LOLA RUN', so I hope his next movie is a big improvement over this.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuGIEoCGrtw</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Tom Hanks movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Tom Hanks. I went to see this movie because of Tom Hanks. Unfortunately, I have seldom seen a movie as pointless as this one. In fact, I signed up to IMDb just to write this review: do not waste your time or money to see this one. It has a none existent plot, weak characters all around, a dialog that seems made up as they were filming, and worst of all, there is no point or reason to watch this movie. Is it about Saudi Arabia? Maybe, but if it is, we should boycott the country not make a movie about it. Is it about a bunch of real characters lost in Saudi Arabia? No. It's about a bunch of characters whose fate you don't give a damn about whether they live in SA or USA. Is there any conclusion, closure, opinion that you can form about the plot, or characters, or the reason this movie was made? None. Zero. Zip. I'm tempted to write to Tom Hanks and ask for my money back, or at least, ask for an explanation for making this god-awful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tender drama with great performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Expecting a middle of the road comedy but it turned out to be almost an coming of age drama, for 50 something's. Hanks is formidable as a man who failed against his will. Only at the end I found out this to be a Tom Tykwer movie and I have been a follower ofhis work since Lola Rennt. The story moves slowly but steadily zeroing in on Hanks as a burned out salesman but more so as a lovable endearing character finding a new purpose in an unfamiliar place.It has a lot more layers than appears at first and I might watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some thoughts about this movie (spoilers alert)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-The name Alan reminded me of his character in Splash, who was called Allen.-When a younger Alan appeared on the screen, the 1st thing that came to my mind was "Why didn't Colin Hanks play that part?". Taking into account that he kinda looks like his father, it would have been more believable.-The sex scene made me uncomfortable. Not because of the sex per se (I'm from Europe, so it's nothing I haven't seen already) but the thought of watching Tom Hanks having sex is like witnessing your old dear uncle doing the same. Perhaps it's the fact that I've grown up watching his films that makes me feel like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Much a hologram of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Tykwer unites with Cloud Atlas star Tom Hanks for this less confusing film about a salesman pitching some revolutionary holographic technology to the King of Saudi Arabia for the new metropolis they're supposedly building in the desert. But actually, it's all about Tom Hanks character, the salesman Alan Clay who appears to be having a midlife crisis and the desert being the best place for him to get lost. Opening with the awesome Hanks rendition of 'Once In A Lifetime' by Talking Heads, it's pretty much one of the trailers. He's rushed to the Middle East in artistic fashion with snippets along the way showing the typical strives of western life he's currently baring. Divorce, finance and supportive daughter's education. Adding jet lag, sandy heat and a golfball sized growth on his back doesn't make things any better. We discover that tomorrow rarely comes in Saudi Arabia and we share Clay's frustration as his team and himself are plonked in a fancy black tent with no food, no AC and no WiFi and no one seems to be where they're suppose to be or say they are with empty promises of meetings apart from two people... Yousef, Clay's appointed driver and guide who's always there at Clay's request. He's a lovable character providing comedy and a superb eighties in-car soundtrack played from a dated, gold plated iPod in his deep blue '87 Chevy Caprice. Not sure if this is an example of Hollywood's whitewashing but Yousef is played by the incredibly talented and ambitious Alexander Black, who goes to great lengths to play his parts. He's certainly someone to watch out for. (Check out his directorial debut, starring himself in this year's 'Tim') The other character who is fairly reliable is Clay's doctor and eventual love interest, Hunger Games' Egeria, Sarita Choudhury. This quickly turns into 'You've Got Mail' and Alan and Dr. Zahra are exchanging emails which leads them into an Arabian love story. Not having read Dave Eggers novel it's hard to judge. (Writer of 2009's Away We Go and Where The Wild Things Are.) But does make an interesting story of what might seems non quintessential about someone's life. Everyone has a story containing interesting characters like Yousef. There's a lot left unexplained, or lacks detail and becomes anticlimactic. Nevertheless, the pace is fast but feels very long for only 98mins. Good performances and above average, but there's nothing really outstanding about this film, probably one for the smaller screen.

		<shortDescription>&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; - Hanks is the real king</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Hologram For The King is a fairly simple story - a salesman heads out to Saudi Arabia to sell an IT system to the king. The real story is much deeper than that though. Tom Hanks plays Alan, a recently divorced parent whose job is unstable and health uncertain. It's more a story about his struggle with solitude in a foreign land with culture and customs he's unfamiliar with, and that part of the movie is done really well, mostly because Hanks is one of the greatest movie actors of all time! He's totally sympathetic, funny, charming and likable.The other characters are much less interesting. Alexander Black has a nice smile and a few funny lines, but otherwise plays like a caricature, and most of the cast aren't given the space to develop their roles. Much of the natural dialogue is quite poorly delivered, which is uncomfortable with the fairly down-to-earth and realistic approach by Tykwer and Griebe.On a visual and atmospheric level, the movie is impressive - the locations and sets used feel like genuine places and Tykwer did a great job of helping the audience understand Hanks's discomfort and frustrations. Berner's editing is spot on too, particularly during the moments of exasperation and ill-health that strike Alan.The question is though, was the movie enjoyable? It's relatively light and fun, with the occasional moment of reflection, but ultimately ends up being a little forgettable (especially the romantic drive towards the end, which just felt like a different movie). Worth watching for Hanks alone, though.3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyed this one...worth the $11.00, 1 hr 38 min</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very watchable,quirky movie. Yes,it helps to be a Hanks fan to overlook his satisfactory but decent performance for a role seemed made for him -nobody plays an "everyman" better. Nonetheless, this was well cast with nice mix of interesting characters, unique setting, cinematography, and recurring humor with his appointed "Limo" driver, deftly played by Alexander Black, which was best part of movie. Realistic performance by Sarita Choudhury as Saudi doctor(those captivating eyes). Can't criticize too much, it did not pretend or try to be anything more than an entertaining dinner and movie flick, worth the admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loved it! The movie carefully revealed a different side of the Middle East most people are unaware of. I personally enjoyed learning about the culture of the KSA and viewing the excitement and laughing at the humor which comes while traveling and keeping an open mind and willingness to listen and learn. A fantastic breakaway from another war movie. There were no bombs, no kidnappings, no Rambo soldiers and hate was replaced with love. As for the acting, well, Tom Hanks has again done a great job and that's what viewers expect when they pay to see TOM Hanks in a starring role. But good acting alone was not limited to Hanks; Sarita Choudhury and Alexander Black were especially excellent in their roles. I expect that viewers who wanted to see another movie about an American travelling thousands of miles away to save the screen-typical ignorant native and rescue the world from mean people will not have enjoyed this film in the least bit; it's none of that insulting genre. And, I expect to have staunch critics of my assessment but even opposing critics will agree what's undeniable is the subtle humor and fun.</fullReview>

I swear Tom Hanks was cast because... well... its Tom. We give a damn what happens to Tom right?Well no.. Not in this movie. Couldn't care less. I was too overwhelmed by the ignorance of the writer.Dude. There is no such thing as an international drivers licence. All it is... is a document that certifies your licence is not fake.
