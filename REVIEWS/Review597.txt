		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. From rags to riches ? a common expression that often leads to a paint-by-numbers movie. Co-directors Jeff Zimbalist and Michael Zimbalist are fortunate in that their "coming of age" subject is the globally famous Pele' ? often considered the greatest soccer/futbol player of all-time.Rather than revisit the career of the transcendent player who later dedicated his life to humanitarian causes, the film kicks off with a 17 year old Pele trotting out onto the pitch at the 1958 World Cup. It then flashes back 8 years to when 9 year old "Dico" was growing up in the slums of Sao Paulo. We get to see his relationship with his family ? his dad taught him to play, and his friends were loyal to him and encouraged him to pursue his dream.There are some similarities to "The Sandlot" as we watch the joy these boys have in playing the sport whenever and wherever they can ? plus the origin of the somewhat derogatory and now immortal nickname. It seemed that Pele' was able to carry this love of the game throughout his career. We see boys huddled around a radio listening to the 1950 World Cup as Brazil's team was humiliated ? an event that played a role in Pele' returning pride to a bruised country.Kevin de Paula plays Pele' as he works his way up through the age groups and national teams. Often the youngest and shortest player, the film depicts him as a shy kid often out of his element ? the polar opposite to the beaming superstar we so often saw later in his career. There is an explanation of the roots of the "Ginga" style and its ties to the Brazilian culture and martial arts.For some reason, Vincent D'Onofrio is cast as Brazil's Coach Feola and we are forced to endure a tortuous accent that is basically inexcusable these days. There are also some exaggerations in the crowd scenes and shots of the press, though young de Paula underplays the lead. Colm Meaney plays George Raynor, the coach of Sweden in that infamous 1958 World Cup, and we do get a cute little cameo from Pele' himself.The film does a nice job with the young man's childhood and progression towards superstar (the IOC named him the athlete of the century). He is presented as close to his family, and inherently quiet and calm. The match clips of Pele' that play over the closing credits are proof that a movie just can't capture the transcendence of his talent. Pele' is truly the reason it's "the beautiful game".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was invited to the world premier of this film at the TriBeCa Film Festival, in New York. I say invited, as if my life is some sort of glamorous affair. In reality, a mate at work couldn't make it, and he knew I'd have no actual plans, so I eagerly obliged.Just before the movie started, the 350 or so people in the audience got what they wanted, as the man himself stood up and raised his hand to the instagram happy crowd. Just knowing Pele was in the audience gave the room a little extra energy.Perhaps a little naive, I knew a little about Pele's playing career but little of the man and, the journey to what he became. The film follows his early years with friends at home, up until he becomes 17 and plays for Brazil in the 1958 World Cup in Sweden. There's enough humour, big laughs, drama, and passion in the film that will translate to fans familiar with the legend and those who may have only heard of him.The real treat, were the applause, and cheering from the audience when the on-screen Pele scored. His hand went up in recognition and the cheers got louder. I was pleased that despite the film keeping my attention he may have nodded off, he's knocking on a bit.I waited outside afterward and managed to get a signed Santos shirt from him, which kinda gave me goose pimples, and rammed home the magnitude of who this man was, and what he had done for the game. My dad would have been proud. Sadly the shirt is the guys from work, so I'm currently deciding whether to buy a replica shirt and say I didn't get it, or beginning to practice the man's signature! That's okay, isn't it...I did snap a selfie. Insta - Jamesbydesign</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pele is one of the most spiritual sports movies I've ever seen and is more heart than anything else. It's more about the pride of Brazil and Edson Arantes do Nascimento being a beautiful symbol of it. Pele is a poor kid form a poor part of Brazil who was good enough to use football to start building a better life by being a part of the 1958 Olympic team. More to the story, is that from the place he is from , his father taught him the ginga, for the purpose of the movie, the ginga is a celebration of Brazil's African heritage focus through football, a system that most of Brazil feels lost them the last two Olympic games, but Pele realized they were not doing it right and shows them the path that leads to the gold and Brazilian pride.The acting itself did not bring on this spirit, but I did like the acting. From the trailer, I was not sure if Vincent D'Onofrio could pull off the role as the team's coach, but indeed he does a find job. It's one of the few sports movies in which the coach's inspiration is a very small part of the movie, but D'Onofrio does well with the little he's got.The spirit comes more in the film making itself , as they use small special effects like slow motion to make Pele look divine every time he gets the ball, inter cut with scenes of people watching in total ah of what he can do. At first it seems cheesy when they first start doing it, but after a while it gets into a rhythm that gets you into it, and you can't help but to let it touch your soul. I don't think it's better or worse than any other sports movie. What makes it unique is that they're are very few of these about Soccer (and so many about American Football), but it does the trick of inspiring you and having you cheer for the underdog, though I feel I did not really learn much about Pele in the process.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is more than just a mere football movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PELE is probably the biggest name in the soccer history that has shaped &amp; shifted the current playing style of modern day game. The extravagant career speaks for itself. The movie shows us the making &amp; coming to be of PELE.I see a lot pf people saying this movie is predictable, not so good &amp; what not. to all of them &amp; most importantly to all of u i say, this movie is more than just a football movie. Not every movie is supposed to be a thriller or an Avenger movie. simple things in life have a way of getting to us.This movie is about small &amp; humble beginnings, its about friendship , its about believing in one self, taking the risk. Movie shows us that is does not matter if u have all the resources or opportunities in the world. if u keep at it, if u find something that you are passionate about &amp; stick to it, day by day, night after night, the results speak for itself. Movie has amazing moments, really great camera work. one of the best for all the soccer movies out there. Even if one know nothing about the legend that PELE is, once you are into the movie, you cant resist to feel the journey he is going to make in life. I was finding myself constantly tears of joy rolling down my cheek coz i was hooked into the movie. had soo many of those watering your eyes moments that once the movie was over, i was filled with joy and happiness to have witness such a good work of art.Acting &amp; direction is simple &amp; stunning. camera-work is amazing , specially in those moments you want to fell the greatness of the legend, the movie gives you that.I'll keep going back to watching this movie , just to feel that joy of watching something beautiful in the making again &amp; again.</fullReview>

It is emotional and motivational.Didn't know about Pele so much before .Too good I am going to watch this movie whenever i fell down ..Thanks a lot.the movie was so emotional at times made me cry.The whole movie moves in a flow and you feel how much pain he has to take to get there.The movie also shows the situation of Brazil during 1950's.Music by A.R.Rahman was magical it blended so well with the theme.My respect for Pele has grown too much.The world cup scenes are accurate comparing with the score board of 1958 world cup.Hope to see more such movies .The movie is little bit similar to "Bhaag Milkha Bhaag" if anybody of you have seen it.I recommend you to watch the trailer first and then the movie "Pele"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nearly Cinematic Perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Consider - how interesting can a movie be about the success of a sporting legend? Obviously the material is begging for some musical montages, and it does not disappoint. I mean, we're talking a powerful cultural legacy here - football and Brazilian culture and music This movie serves up a full platter of sentimentality and showmanship, not to mention an army of condescending Swedes. Simply put, some of these scenes are majestic in their color and rhythm, and there is a palpable feeling that the creators of this felt passionately about the subject matter. The simple themes of transcendence, struggle, and family (topos?) often fade behind the theme of simple, graceful, perfect movement. How many movies about sports movies have succeeded with such a simple, yet grand, exposition of the sport itself?I watched it in dubbed English I wonder what was lost in translation? I may watch it again in Portuguese. To be fair I'm an American who has recently been bitten by the soccer bug, so I have a profound appreciation for the elegance of the sport. I found that some scenes motivated this feeling as well, with a sense of sublime cinematic portrayals of the beautiful game. Surely this movie is marketing for the Rio Olympics. It doesn't matter. This is a very beautiful movie, and I hope that many Americans watch it, as this younger generation has probably not even heard of Pele, let along seen him play (or is it dance?).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This PG rated movie is about the greatest futbol (soccer in USA) player that ever lived. Pele. It covers his youth, in the slums, learning to play futbol in the streets using socks and other clothing stuffed together to make a futbol so they could play. Then progresses through hardships encountered on his way to playing for one of the many futbol teams.What most Americans won't know is that in Brazil (as with all futbol countries) there are massive leagues on multiple levels of the society. They all play against each other or against other Latin American teams for various awards and cups. Pele played for a team called Santos.From Santos he was picked, like other great players from other teams, to play on the National Team. I don't like that they don't show this process in the movie because it shows the level of competition. We are talking thousands of players rather than a few dozen which they show in the movie.The movie doesn't show any love interests. This biopic covers only his youth and his journey to play in the 1958 World Cup. Then the movie ends and gives short mentions to the what he did afterwards. Then there is a collection of his game skills shown in a small window as the credits roll.Overall it was pleasurable to watch and I knew that he would have a small cameo in the movie. Did you see him?8/10 stars for good clean entertainment</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like the excellent Kevin Costner film: "McFarland USA" this movie sensitively shows how sport can significantly alter a people's identity (in this case the entire nation of Brazil was uplifted from a sense of inferiority within the world community, to a pride in their own uniqueness). The acting is good. The sports action scenes are remarkable (how did they get an actor with such great soccer skills?) and the music is by the great A.R. Raman. A lot of care was put into the making of this film, but a lot was lost, I feel, by having the actors speak mostly in English. And it wasn't dubbed English, it was the Brazilian actors trotting out their heavily accented English. That had the effect of taking away much of the authenticity the film had worked so hard to achieve. (That the real-life Pelé has a cameo appearance - and thus takes the viewer out of the scene's intended verisimilitude - is, perhaps, excusable - I can cut it that slack). One more grumble: the movie trailers announced: "With Rodrigo Santoro". I will see anything with him in it - he is a terrific actor. But he appears for LITERALLY FIVE SECONDS! Really! That is unacceptable marketing...'bait and switch', actually. But see the movie anyway. (BTW, I met Pelé in 1984. We talked for about ten minutes, and at one point, after we had been briefly interrupted, he put his arm around me and said: "So, my Brazilian-American friend, where were we?" He had a golden air about him, and yet was completely down-to-earth even though we talked about cosmic reality. To listen to my five minute audio recording about meeting Pelé, search for "Pelé And His Brazilian- American Friend".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pelé: Birth of a Legend has the heart to inspire, nothing more is needed to make you watch the film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pelé: Birth of a Legend follows the life of Pelé's meteoric rise from the slums of Sao Paulo to leading Brazil to its first World Cup victory at the age of 17.Needless to say this film is same like any other biographical drama that focus on the star's raise from bottom to top made with the intention only to inspire you. The director tries nothing hard to focus anything but a biographical drama.The story inspires you every bit like any other inspirational film would, From the childhood to winning the 1958 world cup the wish to succeed the struggles, the leap of faith, the support and love from your parents, the difference we have from the others which should be accepted to make it best, the final winning smile. These clinched moments keep you entertained throughout the film and 1 hour 47 minutes is worth spending.Unlike the usual sports films the film focuses on something that is different from others 'The Heritage', The need to keep us in the space we are comfortable to and the adaptation from others which aren't comfortable of is itself a good small message that can be conveyed.Background score by A.R Rahman feels a little bit underplayed, scoring music for an Hollywood film ARR has set a benchmark with Slumdog millionaire but the expectation is too high for him to satisfy our greed. One of my favorite themes from the film 'Oh Ginga' comes only at the end of the film and with the way it escalates the theme could have been used in the other parts too.Concluding it, Not calling is better or worse than any other sport film, Pelé: Birth of a Legend is an yet an another clinched sport film that is made to inspire us and does as promised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I am a Football fan! Football is the greatest show on earth! More people watch football world cup than any other event in the world. But to capture the magic for a movie is tricky business.Pele is as good as it gets when one makes a movie about football. I feel the movie did not do enough to do justice to "The Man". It also had a "dubbed" movie feel.It was a good movie with some great moments capturing some of the magic of Pele's rise to stardom.The movie was overall good, although it had the potential to be great. It was enjoyable and emotive at some points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very light sports entertainer that fails to capture the game in its truest form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not a good sports movie, but it is definitely a great entertainer if you are looking for something really frivolous to go with your frolic mood. It seems to have been helmed for those who aren't really big fans of the game.PELE: BIRTH OF A LEGEND IS BASED ON PELE'S LIFE Pele: Birth of a Legend will let you have a glimpse into the life of Pele the true legendary footballer and throw some light towards his madding fad. Things that were pulling him down were all around him, and despite all the odds he shone through.The movie tries to capture his street football shenanigans, adds in some humour, a pinch of dramatic spices and tries to bring in the forefront the popular Brazilian Ginga style that was Pele's USP.DOWNSIDES OF THE MOVIE Despite how Pele: Birth of a Legend lodges in you some good vibes, it falls flat owing to its pathetic depiction. You constantly see drops of frustration on Pele's brows, which really takes a toll on your spirits. If you are really looking for something extraordinary to happen given the mammoth sports figure he is, the movie lets you down so many times, you constantly wonder if something out of the box is going to happen. Even though it does, it is nothing akin what happens in a gut-wrenching live sports match.Leonardo Lima Carvalho was a pleasant find. He made young Pele really endearing. His group shenanigans were a delight to watch. The starting bits of the movie were the best moments I would say. Even Seu Jorge who played Dondinho was great. Vincent D'Onofrio unfortunately had very little to play with in his baggage, but he performed his bits nicely.SPOILERS DRIBBLING AHEAD Melodrama has been deliberately pushed in its frames and there is so much of it that it becomes really exhausting at times. When in the middle of the game players go in bullet mode to have a look at each other, you can almost imagine how implausible its dramatic elements must be.THE LOST PELE CAMEO There is a guest appearance by the legend himself at one point, which will bring a smile to your face. But that's about it. Eventually you get to see one game in Pele: Birth of a Legend, but then it is smitten with so much melodrama that sports simply gets lost in those pointless close-up frames. Nothing wrong with watching it once though.Read all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com</fullReview>

It's remarkable really.All the tropes, clichés and tragedies are there. From rags to riches. Skipping the football shoes in a pivotal moment to play bare feet. Getting ridiculed for that. Somber music in notable beats. Beating the over class. Getting ridiculed for that before that. Friends that lose their lives. Promises. Full Metal Jacket style training. Losing faith, only to regain it.. Christ almighty. Why do people like this movie?I need to read the other reviews.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Pelé: Birth of a Legend" is a flawed, but inspiring film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brazilian teams play a style of soccer all their own. (Yeah, I called it soccer. Gimmie a break. I'm an American.) They call that style "ginga". It's a very fluid kind of play that emphasizes creative ball control. Some call this style of play "flamboyant". Others dismiss it as "trick plays". Brazilians simply think of it as? their heritage. The Urban Dictionary's definition of ginga states, in part, "Ginga is creativity... the opposite of mechanical soccer. It is having fun with the ball. It is grace. It is being fluid and coordinated. IT IS SOUL. IT IS DANCE." A June 15, 2014 "New York Times" article explains the development of ginga this way: "?an imaginative style of play that made competition and gratifying playfulness inseparable, with blacks and people of mixed race rising from exclusion and becoming its main protagonists." Ginga is a unique mixing of the skills of samba dancers with Brazilian martial arts fighters, all applied to the game of soccer, turning it into, as the Brazilians call it, "the beautiful game", while also celebrating Brazil's different races and cultures. The focus on ginga in the biopic "Pelé: Birth of a Legend" (PG, 1:47) educates its audience, celebrates that style of soccer and captivates Movie Fans with the true rags-to-riches story of the greatest soccer player ever, a man known all around the world simply as? Pelé.As the film opens, the nearly 10-year-old Pelé (born Edson Arantes do Nascimento, and called "Dico" by his family and friends) is watching a television broadcast as his native Brazil loses the 1950 World Cup to Uruguay. Brazil's loss was a huge upset, a phrase which also describes the emotions of Brazil's soccer fans (which was basically everybody). The entire country was shocked, humiliated and demoralized. Dico (Leonardo Lima Carvalho) promises his father, a former soccer player known as Dondinho (played by Brazilian musician/actor Seu Jorge), that he, Dico, will one day bring Brazil a World Cup Championship.Dico's family is so poor that Dico doesn't even own a soccer ball ? or even a pair of shoes, but the kid manages to develop his natural talent anyway. Under his father's tutelage, he learns ball-handling by juggling and kicking grapefruits and he plays on a local team with his friends. Their team is literally called "The Shoeless Ones" and is mercilessly mocked by the town's rich kids, who single out Dico for a special measure of abuse and start calling him "Pelé". It's a made-up name which is meant to be an insult, and Dico hates the name, but as he works through his anger by helping his team play better than expected on the soccer field, the name sticks, and "Pelé" becomes synonymous with Dico and his amazing talent.Continuing to hone his skills on his own time and play brilliantly on the field in spite of having to endure prejudice and personal tragedy, Pelé (played as a teenager by Kevin de Paula) is recruited and mentored by former player Waldemar De Brito (Milton Gonçalves). Pelé's talent gets him a spot on a professional soccer club, Santos FC, and then on Brazil's national team, all before he reached the age of 17. On the national team, Pelé's coach is Vicente Feola (Vincent D'Onofrio), the latest in a series of coaches who tries to beat Pelé's individuality out of him and force him to play a more traditional and "sophisticated" European style. Many Brazilians blamed the ginga style of play for the 1950 World Cup loss, but ginga is Pelé's strength. Pelé finds himself struggling with his coach's instruction, and an old adversary turned teammate, plus a significant knee injury, all while the national team prepares for the 1958 World Cup tournament and a possible championship matchup against the heavily-favored team representing the host country of Sweden, coached by the arrogant and condescending George Raynor (Colm Meaney)."Pelé: Birth of a Legend" represents formulaic and unrefined filmmaking, but still manages to inspire on multiple levels. Co-written and co-directed by brothers Jeff and Michael Zimbalist (both working on their first feature film), the movie follows the tried-and-true pattern of most sports movies, but suffers from some minor issues of technique. The script sometimes stops short of completing its thoughts and the film is a bit over-edited, making the viewer feel like something is missing in a few of the scenes. Some characters are underdeveloped and some of the acting is shaky, but the main characters (especially D'Onofrio, Jorge and de Paula) all give strong performances. The film spends too much time on Pelé's childhood and not enough time on his rise through the ranks of Brazilian soccer, but does convey why Pelé was so good and wisely culminates with the '58 World Cup, at which point it's clear that all the pieces are finally in place for Pelé's eventual worldwide fame and unparalleled success. In spite of the film's lack of originality and other relatively minor problems, the Zimbalist brothers and their cast and crew give us plenty to shout about during the film's third act and leaves us with important lessons about determination, resilience and playing to our strengths, as well as the importance and strength of diversity. As much as I enjoyed "Pelé: Birth of a Legend" (especially its emotional ending), after fairly weighing all of its strengths and weaknesses, the most I can give it is a mild recommendation: "B"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film (or at least as much as I could take) on a plane journey today, and was appalled how what was clearly an amazing story of (literally) rags to riches was given a total Hollywood make-over, for example, the bullying, much older rich kids making fun of the poor kids and (almost) getting their comeuppance as soon as the poor kids took off their football boots (OK, Pele did start playing barefoot, but why overdramatise it? Oh, let's not forget the inevitable fat boy and the compulsory short-sighted kid. And it was full of anachronism - I mean, Brazilian kids in the 1940's getting together for pre-game American- sports-type huddles?

		<fullReview>The worst is that Pelé is the executive producer of this thing. I think he is totally delusional. How can this be a biographical movie? I didn't know if I was watching Matrix, Schlinder's List, Ip Man or Ben-Hur. This movie is Hollywood to the extreme. Or maybe Bollywood to the extreme. I can't really think straight after watching the most of this movie last night, I just had lots of nightmares with Pelé Potter, Pelé Wallace, Pelé Balboa...all of them showing me all theirs skills and magic... I wonder, if this is the biography of Pelé, would Messi be capable of destroying planets when he dry heaves in his own movie? I couldn't finish this masterpiece (of sh..) but probably before the end of the movie you'll find that Pelé saves the world flying Air Force One over the Kremlin while throwing Amazon t-shirts of the wolves howling at the moon on top of the Russian's missiles. I totally recommend watching this movie. Especially if you are fan of Will Ferrel, Donald Trump, Patrick Star, Bruce Lee's movies, banana skin sandwiches, pulling out your own nails, nails on a chalk board... Best movie ever.</fullReview>
