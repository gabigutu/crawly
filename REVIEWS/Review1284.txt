		<shortDescription>Flawed movie, but nevertheless breathtaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw a sold-out opening night screening of "Across the Universe" last night with a group of my friends who had really been looking forward to it. Many of them were extremely disappointed, while in the critical world, Roger Ebert and the New York Times loved it. Because the film was so highly anticipated, and a number of people have asked me how I liked it, I'm writing this review in an attempt to express why the movie is so divisive. I'm not going to talk about plot, or describe any of the numbers. If you're interested in seeing the movie, they'll be more enjoyable if they're unexpected.It's a bizarre and beautiful movie musical, almost a music video at times, that uses thirty- three of The Beatles' songs and director Julie Taymor's unique visual style to illustrate both a personal love story and the overall conflict in the sixties. The movie is incredibly original and ambitious, and therefore its failings are as dramatic as its successes. Both stem from the same source: Julie Taymor's self-indulgence. That's nothing new to her movies, "Frida" and "Titus" have the same problem, but in a movie stripped of traditional narrative, it's glaringly obvious. Some songs are impeccably chosen and staged with great creativity, but others are too obvious, or thematically forced so Taymor can cram in another song and stunning visual sequence.For the first half of the movie, I was frequently divided. One innovative sequence would really pull me into the style, then a forced number or awkward staging would distance me again. When an obvious, recognizable number began, I was torn between a cynical impulse to roll my eyes and an almost exhilarated impulse to laugh and applaud."Across the Universe" is a mess. There's no denying that. It is poorly paced and badly structured, and at times its feather-light plot and contrived or obligatory numbers become tedious. But at one point, about halfway through, I decided just to go along for the ride. I delighted in every brash, bold choice, whether it worked or not. I let the poignant moments move me, whether or not I intellectually felt that they were contrived.The Beatles' music had a huge effect on me; from the fateful day that my friend accidentally copied the first three tracks of "Revolver" onto my computer, a love affair was born. Their songs are inexorably tied to memories beautiful and horrible scattered all over my life, and as I grow older, I'm constantly discovering new, deeper resonances in their familiar refrains. Even when the context was vague or stretched, the film's reinterpreting and revealing new facets of these songs seemed to serve as a tribute to their breadth and greatness. Taymor's damning depiction of the horrors of war, and lyrical portrait of young, idealistic love are both painfully expressive and unique, and simply took my breath away. By the film's shamelessly corny close, I realized that I had just had a genuine cinematic experience. For all the movies that I watch, that's incredibly rare.In his review in the New York Times, Stephen Holden writes, "I realized that falling in love with a movie is like falling in love with another person. Imperfections, however glaring, become endearing quirks once you've tumbled." I could laughingly list this movie's flaws from now till next week, but I sort of fell in love with its sheer audacity. You might not. It's extremely na?ve, and thematically simple, and you could find that endearing or irritating. You may love it, or you may hate it, but you're going to feel something. This movie will not change your life; don't expect it to. But if you let your criticism fade to the background, and abandon yourself to Taymor's passionate fervor, you may have a pretty amazing experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's say Hair and Moulin Rouge had a baby...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... and it's nanny was Julie Taymor ...This probably sounds like I hated the film, but I actually loved it. It has the time line and self-consciously-culture-smart soundtrack of Hair, yet the campy fun and karaoke stylings of Moulin Rouge. Julie Taymor takes this combination and makes it fun, instead of extra cheesy, and it is visually fascinating instead of the obnoxious MTV-video nightmare it could have been.I cared about the characters - and the cast of 'unknowns' have great star power and voices. Even though I knew exactly what would happen, the journey there was great. The cameos were fun. The lead was sufficiently hot. The soundtrack is stuck in my head as I write this (the new versions, not even the original songs) All corny jokes and references, and lapses in plot are forgiven, because Ms. Taymor manages to take a movie chock full of things that have been done a million times before and makes it as fresh and exciting as if it were all done for the first time. You may know exactly what's going to happen but you never know how. This is the director's movie!Definitely a movie journey worth taking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... to have been able to see this film in the beautiful Elgin Theatre with Julie Taymor there to answer questions / talk about the film afterwards (at the Toronto International Film Festival).Wow!!!I was carried away, I was moved to tears, I stood up and cheered.For those who commented about the singing - the actors sang all the songs themselves. What's more, though they did record the songs in studio first as part of the rehearsal process, most of the song performances used in the film were recorded live as they played out the scenes. Perhaps that's why - for me - the songs worked so well; it actually felt like the characters were just moved to sing. Amazing performances from - mainly - unknown actors.And I felt the story had a strong narrative line, aided / supported by the songs. It used the background of history, not just as a painted backdrop, but to add meaning and depth to the characters and the story they were living. Made me wish I'd been there (born in '65, too young to remember the 60's); I'll have to content myself with living vicariously through Jude and Lucy and the others.Add to everything else Julie Taymor's glorious visuals, and I was truly swept away. I saw 36 films at the festival, but this was head and shoulders my favourite.I fell in love with this film, and look forward to sharing it with friends and family who didn't have the luck to see it as I did. It's a film that will, I'm sure, reward repeated viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of video art,, design, music and dance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After an intensely screened screening featuring nervous suits delivered in limousines and gentle but firm gentlemen controlling the ticket flow to assure a certain target group would be tested for their age, predilections, and proclivities, and wand wielding security guards frisking patrons for any signs of recording devices - including cellphones - I entered what we were told was the first-ever-in the-world test market screening of the Taymor/Beatles extravaganza "Across the Universe".Thoughts of Peter Frampton in Sergeant Peppers' haunted me, but my admiration of Taymor, and, well, I was actually a kid IN the audience of the Sullivan Show on February 9, 1964. I was even in a band that appeared on MTV in their first hour (Robin Lane &amp; the Chartbusters)! Iattended my share of protests, worked with Reverend Daniel Berrigan, got psychedelic and ... well... enough about my qualifications to review the movie - it seems I still don't fit the intended demographic - it's the first time I ever lied my age downward! So despite that the studio may change some things - here's what I saw at this stage of tweaking the film.Without quibbling over loose plot points and misguided scenes as they seem to be still tinkering with those things (and there are there are several out of place and unexplained scenes) - I've rarely seen such a feverish work of persistent video art in the service of great music. These are NOT small music videos wrapped around a questionable plot. Taymor's vision as a director seems to borrow from everything. Her story ideally wants to conjure up the not just the frolic, but the frenzy and passion of the 60's. There is what looks like Jan Svankmajer in a stunning industrial dance scene in a draft board as civilians are turned into soldiers. Another scene has giant puppet pageantry straight out of Peter Schumman's Bread and Puppet Theater and Resurrection Circus. There are joyous location street dancing scenes, and breathtaking Technicolor composites. One such scene is a dreamlike vision done entirely in the psychedelic solarised colors of Richard Avedon's Beatle portraits. Her set designs are at times so clever and colorful, you laugh at the unrestrained joy and daring. She begins with a glorious reinvention of the fifties musical, and careens into pure psychedelic delirium. The cinematography is rich and varied to the purpose of each scene, and dance sequences explode into place. The film moves from the innocence of small town upper-middle class America, to the nascent hippy scene in the village, to a sort of hallucinatory Garden of Eden (with too much but amusing Bono as a Ken Kesey Merry Prankster guru type). It moves to romance, and onto the dangers and volatility of the anti war 60's. All this is rendered through a constant flow Beatles songs delivered amidst magnificent set designs and video composites.For the most part the music is respectfully and tastefully rearranged. (and without the Pavlovian shamelessness of the Beatles as they were used in "I Am Sam") A ballad version of "I Want to Hold Your Hand" movingly reinvents the song. I don't know if the actors actually sing but you could have fooled me. It is all carefully synched up. Even the drummers and strummers are always in synch. The actors are charming, but once again, as she has done in "Digging To China" to "Down In the Valley", Evan Rachael Wood rivets the film. It would too much to believe she could also sing like the angel - but darn if her throat isn't in sych! The voice is beautiful. At times songs and sounds collide like the Beatles in "Number Nine". The collision of a war protest at Columbia University with Helter Skelter over Dear Prudence is brilliant. Taymor has edginess that matches the sixties zeitgeist, and avoids the vacuous cotton candy fluff of Luhrmann's "Moulin Rouge".I think it would be wise to address Taymor's strength, which is the darker political vision. The film's intented audience ought to be as angry as they were in the 60s, marching in the streets and standing up to an arrogant and corrupt administration with their trillion dollar war. The parallels to today are obvious. The time is right for such a film with such politics. It shouldn't get comprised by too much gooey and gratuitous romance.I overheard two young girls afterward say; "I don't know why they have to redo those great songs?" - whereas a much older couple were saying; "This was great ? very artistic, fun - it really caught the feeling of the era." I hope the handlers in their infinite wisdom don't sell out the ability of this film to be politically relevant as well as beautiful.Characters and situations that obviously echo Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix, the Weathermen, the Weather Underground, Abbie Hoffmann, Ken Kesey, draft card burning, 60's clubs in the East Village (Café Wha? becomes Café Huh?), and other sly references are fun to pick out, though I assume details are undergoing revision for clarity. I don't think this is just a film for 20 somethings. The kids I sat with remarked; "This is important stuff for our generation to remember." Taymor's darker sensibilities are what the film really needs to keep it from being perceived as so much razzle dazzle and romance. There's a subversive edge to this story.Visually, it is unquestionably a masterpiece of video art. Its final judgment may be that it can speak across generations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredible experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pure emotion. No one can mix theater with film like Julie Taymor. From beginning to end the film takes you on a psychedelic beatle ride that grips you by the ears, the heart and the soul and never lets go. Even now. Hours after the projector was shut off. Every song adaptation interpretation and setting is spot on, fans of the Beatles will recognize that every detail in Taymor's images recall an instance, a photograph, a line or a quote from the band. Even the girl that comes in through the bathroom window. Nothing is left to chance, everything is on purpose. Amazing. Easily the best film of the year. And in regards to people saying it's a two hour music video.. well... yeah, what the heck were you expecting???</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been anticipating this movie ever since I saw the trailer on IMDb like everyone else. When I first saw the trailer, I said to myself, I'm either going to consider this my favorite movies of all-time, or it's going to be trash. Being a huge Beatles fan and owning all their albums on CD, I had huge expectations about the covers of the songs. I saw it with my friend, who is also a huge Beatles fan but not a huge musical fan. Both of us saw it on opening night to the public and to our surprise it was really good! The covers of the songs were actually really good! Now don't get me wrong, the original Beatles songs will always be the best versions but for what they did, they did a pretty decent job. One of my favorite scenes was the "I've Just Seen a Face" bowling alley scene. So creative and fun! Also the "I Want You (She So Heavy) scene was?interesting?but fun to watch. Eddie Izzard's scene as Mr. Kite was hilarious! Both me and my friend where on the floor laughing. Also Bono's scene singing "I Am the Walrus" was great. Don't listen to the critics that say that "it doesn't do the Beatles justice". Actually, it's the opposite. Any hardcore Beatles fan will appreciate all the jokes that were thrown in there. Even if you're not a hardcore Beatles fan, you will appreciate the fantastic love story.Just one word of advice, go to this with an open mind. Don't expect Oscar-worthy script and dialogue, expect clichés, not a whole lot of character development from the supporting cast but don't let that ruin the movie for you. Appreciate the artistic mind of the director. I mean who cares if they threw in a character like Prudence just to sing Dear Prudence? It's a great song! For all you "I hate every movie that comes out" critics don't see this. It's too artsy for you. Go see this with an open mind not expecting it to win Best Picture for the Oscar. This is one of the best experiences you will have watching a movie. I'm buying the DVD as soon as it comes out. See this movie Beatles fans!!! It does them justice!!! Please email me with any comments you have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taymor does it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved it.It's very hard to describe, because I wouldn't classify it as a traditional musical. It's not set up so that there's a scene, then a song, then a scene again; everything just flows seamlessly. Wonderful acting from all of the cast,with some great improv from Bono and Eddie Izzard. Definitely standout performances from Dana Fuchs (who has the most AMAZING voice), Martin Luther, and TV Carpio. Also a nice cameo by Salma Hayek, who apparently asked Julie Taymor if there was a part for her in the movie, and when Julie told her that she could be one of the nurses, Salma replied "ONE of the nurses, Julie?" Overall an excellent film. Taymor fans will definitely appreciate it (it has a lot of her traditional colorful imagery, masks, and puppets). I'm planning on seeing it a few more times just to take it all in. It's certainly going to be a film you have to see more than once to really appreciate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 1960's Counterculture In All Its Glory!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who was literally a child of the mid - late 60's &amp; and a student of the time period, I first want to thank everyone who had anything to do with the making of this film! Your timing could not of been better! You helped me to remember the fervor, passion and idealism that made up the mid-late 60's. It's been many years since I have burst out sobbing in a movie theater! Thanks for helping to lift the fog a bit! As an activist, you have collectively given me some badly needed renewed vigor! I also feel so very, very sorry for all the critics of this movie who don't have a clue about what it all this means, or whose hearts have grown so hard with such bitterness, cynicism or despair; or have just simply sold-out; or plain no longer care! All your ranting and raving and nay saying won't do a thing to take away one moment of the adventure, creativity, experimentation, excitement or passion that made this time in history so great!I also what to thank the brilliant filmmakers for paying homage to so many great cultural icons, organizations and events of the period: Walter Cronkite, the greatest broadcaster of the 20th century. Baba Olatunji, the Nigerian Drummer and social activist, his double looked like he came right off the Drums of Passion album cover! I can now see him smiling from heaven! The tremendous scene with Bread and Puppets, a living, breathing, direct link to 1960's radicalism, warmed my heart! You even went up to their stronghold in Glover, Vermont, to film part of the scene! Bravo! The SDS (Students for a Democratic Society), which did not advocate violence, and the much smaller splinter-group that morphed into an organization advocating extreme measures, called the Weather Underground. The brave Martin Luther King, Jr. and his intervention in a labor dispute, which cost him his life. The historic occupation of the Ivy League, Columbia University by its students protesting both the Vietnam war and the intense poverty that surrounded the school. Ken Kesey and his legendary bus. The Jimi Hendrix &amp; Janice Jopplin characters who show such dignity, and a passion for music. And, of course, the Beatles! Their music reaches deep into my soul. You gave me insights into the meaning of their tunes that after all these years never crossed my mind! I also enjoyed being bathed in all the very colorful special affects. The 60's and early 70's were a time of outrageously bold colors and design. Something brilliantly portrayed in Across the Universe! The only film I intend to purchase on DVD that has been released this year!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 'Must See' Film Experience!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Across the Universe is a love story and musical with creative interpretations of Beatles classics. Critics looker for deeper meaning seem to forget this simple fact. Incredible cameos by Joe Cocker, Bono, and an earth-shattering Gospel version of 'Let it Be', are all in themselves reason enough to see the film. I was lucky enough to see this recently at the historic Elgin theater in Toronto. Julie Taymor is one of the most eloquent directors I've heard to date. Not only has this film advanced the art of film-based musicals, it will most certainly get the Oscar nod and introduce a legion of new young fans to the Beatles. I for one can't wait to see and experience it again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I adored the movie, it was so good. Very imaginative and psychedelic in a sense if you like that sort of thing. Although the movie is really long, it was so worth watching. The trailers do not do it justice. I would compare it too Moulin Rouge or any Baz Lurhman movie. The soundtrack was awesome too. Really great renditions of Beatles songs,.. and and all star cast, outstanding. The sixties vibe was well pronounced throughout, not only in the characters but also as a time line of changes in music produced from the Beatles. It went above and beyond all of my expectations. There are many Beatle references within the movie without having the story line be about the Beatles themselves. Each scene is extremely different,...Some scenes are more dark and weary and then liven up in the following scene with bright colors and extravagant dancing. Also references to other popular musicians from the sixties like Jimmy Hendrix and Janis Joplin are somewhat "represented" within the cast but not playing that particular person in the film. A really great time period flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply dreadful. Don't waste your time or money.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was, by far, one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. *Also, I discuss the ending, but it is not a spoiler, since it's a completely obvious and predictable finish to the film.*The characters were shallow, the plot was disjointed, the visuals were over-stimulating, the actors were wooden, and there seemed to be a heavy dependence on subtle Beatles in-jokes. Case in point: The character of "Prudence" seems to exist for no other reason than as an excuse for the other characters to sing "Dear Prudence." She's introduced in a visually silly scene with the football players, the leads sing her out of the closet, and then she disappears. It seems to me that this movie's facile, clichéd love-story plot was written around the need for Julie Taymor to jam THIRTY ONE Beatles tunes in a movie, instead of writing the story and adding songs later. Many of the songs seemed superfluous, adding nothing to the story or character development, such as "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite" and "Because." I especially have problems with Evan Rachel Wood, whose lovely voice was completely overshadowed by her total lack of acting ability. Because of it's lack of substance, the film actually conveyed the feeling of the Vietnam War very well: I thought we'd never get out of the theatre it was so long. Finally, the movie ended in the sappiest, kitschiest way possible, with the police stopping through the power of love, and Jude and Lucy finding each other again and falling head over heels in blissful ecstasy. If Taymor had really wanted to capture the essence of the sixties, the ending would have been somber. There was nothing happy about the way that decade ended, with our country still embroiled in war, our President assassinated, and the death of the Flower Generation. This film was very ambitious, but a film can't get by on ambition alone. The only song I thought was perfectly executed was the surreal and terrifying draft scene, brilliantly set to "I Want You (She's So Heavy)." Other than that, the treatment of the source material was magnificently disappointing. It also loses points for include such a self- righteous, pompous ass as Bono (Who for some reason, all of my friends agreed, looked strangely like Robin Williams). All in all, I'd say this movie made a much better trailer than an actual film. I'd recommend that the twelve dollars of ticket money that would be wasted on this movie be put to good use by being used to purchase "Abbey Road", "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", or the "White Album" (actually titled "The Beatles"), and really enjoying the music of the The Beatles like they intended, on an album, not in some ridiculous parody of the Sixties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All We Needed Was Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A phenomenal feature length video clip with the Beatles songs and Julie Taymor's eye at the helm. The story, of course, is wafer thin but who cares, right? We're not here for intellectual enlightenment but for the forceful, visionary, smart ass style of one of the female filmmakers that has already revolutionize the Broadway stage without, really, changing anything. I believe that's the kind of revolution that leaves a sign. The kind that reassures rather than confuse and "Accross the Universe" does just that. The Beatles are reassuring their message is reassuring. Little did that generation know that things were going to take a terrifying turn. Love! Love! Love! All You need is love. Still true but we've never been, as a society, so far apart. It was great to see teen agers humming the Beatles tunes coming out of the theater. The lyrics are like Gospel or lullabies. Was it only yesterday? It feels like centuries ago. The innocence seems foreign and at the same time so real. It will be nice to go back with the experience of hindsight. It doesn't work like that, does it? No, I'm afraid not. In the meantime the great Julie Taymor gives as a beautiful reminder. And a lovely evening out at the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful. Awful. Awful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been no greater disservice to the music and spirit of the Beatles than 'Across the Universe': an over-emotive, glitz-laden, ham fisted vehicle for a talentless group of unknown 'actors' which should only be viewed by film students as cautionary tale of what can happen when ego thinks it can adapt and improve things that that are already perfect. I wonder what on earth was going through the head of Ms. Taymor - a normally talented director of stage and screen and the mastermind behind the overlooked film adaptation of Shakespeare's 'Titus Andronicus' starring Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange.'Across the Universe' fails on so many levels as a film that in all honesty it's impossible to list every single that's wrong whether it be a frat-boy singalong of 'A Little Help from My Friends'; an out-of-place cheerleader's lament summed up by 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand' (and as an aside, the time/place faction for this young lady's scene made zero sense); a moronic narrative involving every plot cliché yanked from network television mini-series including some father/son silliness and some seemingly-solid-yet-ideologically-different relationship silliness; cheesy character names that serve as excuses to break into songs containing said names; all this topped off by performances so ludicrous, that in comparison, they make Tor Johnson's role in 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' appear Oscar-worthy.As for the songs, I used to think that it would be close to impossible for anyone to miss the irony, wit, or humor of any song by the Beatles. I also was of the feeling that it would be quite a stretch for any performer to make a Beatles sound bad. Heck, I didn't think the 'I am Sam' soundtrack was that bad, and I kind of dig the Fiona Apple version of 'ATU'. I don't even mind 'Hello/Goodbye' featured on the Target commercials. But the renditions of the songs in this film were so terrible, I wanted to call Sir Paul and Ringo to apologize profusely for my girlfriend and I spending money to watch as people who should know better slowly killed their songs.I never thought I'd write this, but, if you're thinking about going to see 'Across the Universe', don't. Just go out and rent 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band'. As bad as that picture is, it's ten times the movie 'Across the Universe'.Ugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragical Misery Tour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh, have you seen "Across the Universe"? (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0445922/) Are we the only ones to find it bad, bad, REALLY bad? I think there's an odd syndrome--I've seen it before, can't remember where--of 60s-and-Beatles-infatuation among people who were born post-60s-and-Beatles, and they seem to take ownership of the 60s and Beatles music in a way that is often extremely distasteful to me. Besides the codification of the 60s into convenient chewy clusters (one character drafted, another one black, a girl "too" involved in the anti-war protest movement , another in the club scene trying to sing like Janis Joplin...), in this movie, it appears they tried to build an entire plot around the 60s and most of the dialog out of (sung) Beatles songs. To me, as soon as you start naming characters "Jude," "Max(well)," "Prudence," "Sadie," "Lucy," you're already losin' me, kid. When half of those characters are ONLY there to support an occurrence of one person or another breaking into song (i.e. "Prudence's" whole raisin-bran d'etre in the ENTIRE movie was to have a scene where she's shut herself in a closet pouting and everyone outside the closet sings "Dear Prudence," now THAT's just stupid. They shoehorned songs into the plot, and plot lines into song-ops. The one English guy always sings with a smile on his face and everyone has these pure, clear (let's call it "plear") voices fresh out of "Fame" (they were born after THAT, too, I think). WAY too many telegraphed references to well-known Beatles and 60s trivia, like the use of apples and strawberries and the comment to Max about killing grandma with a hammer. There are a few cool animation bits (well, one, really), but ALL of that might not be too bad, but they ALSO had to bring my man Jimi into it! Now they're making me mad. The characters are zero-dimensional. The acting is out of Junior High, rising only occasionally to Sophomore level. The writing is just execrable. I had to watch it through because these are my heroes from, and this is the soundtrack of, my youth, and frankly I couldn't tear myself away, just like that reporter and the Hindenberg--"Oh the humanity!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>two scoops of pretentious, a cup of mediocre and a dollop of crap.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never wanted 2+ hours of my life back more than I did when I saw this movie. Everyone I know saw it before me and, after all the hype, I couldn't wait. I'm a huge Beatles fan and thought the idea of a Beatles musical would be awesome. I mean, hey, Cirque did it with Love, and they succeeded. The movie had to be good, right? Wrong. I wanted so badly to give it a chance, but within the first half hour I could tell that the plot was severely lacking. Characters like Prudence were horribly underdeveloped; you could've taken her out altogether, and the only thing that would have REALLY changed would that you couldn't include "I Want to Hold Your Hand" or "Dear Prudence," and speaking of the former, that number was just one of the many examples where in the movie, you'd think they were trying to lead up to something, and then they'd drop it altogether. They included random and stupid things just so they could use a few more songs, and why do people buy into this crap? Because they're too distracted by the music to care.The "cutting edge graphics" as Ebert called them were among some of the worst I've seen in years. They were quite obviously fake and cheesy, and you could argue that it's meant to be as such because it's a hallucination or whatever BS you want to throw at me, but if it really was a hallucination, it should at least be believable! After a while all of the garish colors and pompous, "pseudo-artsy" camera angles made me nauseous.That's not even half of it, and I haven't even gotten to the music yet. I know nothing compares to the Beatles, but they didn't even TRY - the music was so halfhearted, and some of the "spins" they put on them? Just back off! "Helter Skelter" was ridiculous, and I wanted to slap that actor for ruining "Revolution." There isn't a single song I enjoyed.In all, I wish I had never gone to see it. Don't waste your time or your money on this pretentious bull.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good God.... I'm a teacher and some of my students ( knowing that I'm a huge Beatles fan ) told me I HAD TO SEE THIS MOVIE .... I resisted, until my parents ( who usually have decent taste in films ) said IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES THAT THEY EVER SAW IN THEIR LIVES!!!!! "Visually, the most creative movie I have ever seen," said my dad. So I went ... Ten minutes into the movie I knew I was a goner. As soon as I saw them singing and dancing like goofy Gene Kellys around the good ol college campus like Fame rejects, I began to groan. Loudly. "Where was the amazing creativity?" I asked myself. "Maybe it'll kick in later...."It never did. ( You want amazing creativity? See "Yellow Submarine"). This movie, instead, was flat out horrendous. I cringed every time they blasphemed another Beatle song with Taymore's insipidly sophomoric MTV vision of the sixties. Strawberry Fields and Happiness is a Warm Gun were two segments, particularly, that made me wanna barf in my popcorn bag...It was awful. Just awful. Some clapped at the end. I booed....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is abuse of music. If you want to see a socio-political musical watch "WestSide Story-1961" .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I watched Across The Universe, was in Toronto International Film Festival. It had emphasized the effectiveness of music at the times of political wilderness and hotchpotch of ideologies through a teenage view. Yes, the use of music was mind-blowing; though in a radical -and so wrong- way.It is the same idea of a serial killer killing his victims by playing classical music, that a teenager group rises in rebellion against government by singing. And I just can't believe how people abuse the meaning of music. I mean neither Tchaikovsky composed his opera suites to turn someone into a serial killer, nor Paul McCartney wrote his lyrics to make adolescents rebels. Being radical-minded never corrects a mistake, nor arranges disorder. The story is based on a love story got through a strawberry crucified on an artist's drafting board. Yet, we only get melodrama when we're looking to find a story of love. Actors are somewhat harmonic among each other and are related within the screenplay, though sadly none really can portray a character at all. Moreover, there is not an adequate bearing between the screenplay and the story line, which is a true matter of directing. No bearings between the subject(happenings) and the object(consigning messages), either. Optimistically, it's a pretty good movie for relaxing and forgetting about the issues of life, as long as you don't focus into it. &gt;:-(( 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ham-handed and vapid.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm tempted to spill my credentials when it comes to Beatles music, but it's not exactly material in reviewing this movie purely on its own merits, so I'll resist.There's good and there's bad, but if my score is any indication, the bad greatly outweighs the good.The good: Some decent song renditions, and a misplaced Joe Cocker. If this movie wasn't attempting to have a consistent plot, it'd be a fun collection of mediocre music videos, and I'd be less strict about judging it, but alas...The bad: ...there is an attempt to portray a story. It's vapid to say the least, and inexistent if you're truly critical. As a result, the characters are two-dimensional and uninteresting. The movie flows along at an astoundingly disjointed pace, creating any and every excuse to have a musical segment possible - usually falling flat on its face in the process - with the most literal interpretations of the songs possible and some truly poor imagery and symbolism.As if the audience didn't have enough of being slapped in the face with giant Uncle Sam poster singing "I want you," the movie depicts just about every 60's cliché you can imagine. There's a clone for Janis and a clone for Jimi, a naked, scant Vietnam War subplot, Timothy Leary and Ken Kesey (Bono is just a giant turd after all) references, Greenwich Village; it's as if they just stuck as many 60's events as they could into a bowl, randomly arranged them in a line, and decided to order the movie as such. The whole affair is a mess, but in the end the events just resolve themselves with no real actions taken by the characters.The worst part about this movie is that there will be people that absolutely love it. They'll call it "sweet," or "pretty," or "fun." It's safe to say that, if they do, you can go ahead and null their opinion on movies from here on out, because this overlong, self-righteous, 60's-for-the-cell-phone-generation trash heap is none of the above.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. My teen-aged son recommended this movie to me. I expected crap, but this went far beyond my expectation. The oh-so-pitiful storyline. How to tell you? Trying to tie Beatles lyrics together, like a concept album, with some clown who looks like Paul McCartney...and the most ludicrous symbolism I've ever seen. "She's So Heavy/Carry That Weight"... astounding. See, a team of US soldiers walks the jungles of Viet Nam carrying The Statue of Liberty. The soldiers reminded me of Egyptian slaves, building the pyramids (in Hollywood movies, anyway), which my mind received as The United Slaves of America. Surely, that's not what the film-maker intended. Surely, we were being prompted to remember that 'Freedom isn't free'.Anyway, Princeton is a shot location...a student drops out and is drafted. A rich kid gets drafted. Yeah, right. Anyway, an English kid is in the movie. So is a blonde American girl. And an Asian girl who is, by musical necessity, a lesbian? Her name's Prudence, and she locks herself in the closet (get it??), and is chided by her friends to 'Come out and play".There's also a Peggy Lee-type aging rock singer who tries to belt out songs big, a la Janis Joplin...but she's run-of-the-mill American Idol material, at best...but with a LOT of hair. That's all there is. Somehow, the black guy goes from Otis Redding to Jimi Hendrix. Shrug. He's not the only token here, This cliché-fest is loaded with tokens. Nothing is real.People get stoned. People get laid. People go to war (some return after pleasant musical run-ins with sexy nurses - wink!). Predictably, our English hero emigrates to the USA. I am at a loss to explain why the director didn't close the film with him standing next to the Statue of Liberty flashing a peace sign.Images fall out like endless koolaid in a paper-cup.Excuse me, I have work to do. I have to rescue my teenager from saccharine mediocrity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't better Philip French's dismissal (above) of this film (from his 'Observer' column). I am embarrassed for Ms Taymor, who - on the evidence of 'Titus' and 'Frida' - is a hugely talented filmmaker.But here the director's talents are only intermittently diverting, and cannot save what is an utterly pointless project.As 'versions' of the originals the songs are often attractively delivered, though too often with a bland professionalism that entirely lacks any edge. The Gospel choir, and perhaps some of 'Sadie''s numbers, are quite powerful in themselves, but even these positive examples hardly rate a notice in the context of what heights cinema musicals have already hit. The song-and-dance routines - though fanatically well disciplined (as if that would subdue all opposition!) - are uniformly appalling, and would have instantly bombed on the stage of any professional theatre. They are all manic energy without real engagement.It does not help that all the characters are annoyingly and rather dishonestly tangential to historical reality - like a reminiscence of the great originals ('Jude' = 'Paul Macartney', 'Sadie' = 'Janis Joplin' for instance), or merely inserted as an incarnation of a song (the otherwise pointless 'Prudence'), or of something wildly trippy in a cartoonish way (a brilliant Eddie Izzard completely wasted in a misfiring farrago entirely bereft of any identification with the hippy ethos - to call it 'pastiche' would be to wildly over-praise it).Even the more 'down-to-earth' scenes back in Liverpool lack any substance at all: Even the Albert Docks location looks as gentrified here as it has become in reality, at the hands of the property developers. (One would have expected the well-known team of British writers to have got this right, at least.) In fact the whole picture suffers from a total failure to identify with the time and culture it is feverishly and showily pursuing.And the more it pursues, the further off is that authentic psychedelic rainbow.Perhaps Julie Taymor is in pursuit of her own lost girlhood, which would explain the self-indulgence in the unspeakably trite American family clichés ... But surely better, in such a case, that she should have created or commissioned a more focused screenplay: This one seems hopelessly hung-up on squeezing in the absolute max. of Beatles songs.And we don't even get a decent pastiche of Dick Lester's witty style of early Beatles' music-video, for God's sake! Humour is indeed direly lacking - how the team of Clement and la Frenais, the writers of the gloriously funny and characterful 'Auf Wiedersehen, Pet' saga, could ever agree to pen this flat, bland, po-faced, Americanisation of a major part of their own popular cultural heritage from the industrial North of England is beyond me! And the hyper-Hollywood style of 'musical number' sits very ill with the naivety at the heart of the subject. The truth is, I am afraid, that the film is ludicrously over-ambitious in terms of mere personal grandstanding by the director at her most showy: 'Look at me, isn't this brilliant?' Actually, 'No, Ms Taymor.' As director she neither reveals nor evokes any love for her subject. It is indeed a really stupid movie, whose ambition is all for the perfection of the surfaces, but which possesses not one spark of inspiration whatsoever.But the biggest mistake of all was to portray the whole era as some kind of alternative reality, existing 'Across the Universe,' which actually lacks inspiration and magic in direct proportion to its distance from the original milieu that inspired the songs (a kind of Anti-Oz one might say). Crucially, since the film's entire mise en scene is set neither in any convincing 'then' nor in any engaging 'now' it is difficult to see what possible relevance or attraction it possesses for any audience.Taymor has been lost in this No-Man's-Land, which is the result of exposing the inadequate simplicities of the sketchy plot to the whole industrial panoply of Hollywood: She wanders through a scene of artistic devastation, amongst groves of burnt-out and songless trees. And were that (or something like) a defining image of her own creation, we might at least have had a half-decent anti-war movie! As it is, even Cliff Richard's safe old 'Summer Holiday' vehicle seems more relevant and punchy.And what sublime madness could a Ken Russell in his reprobate heyday have wrought with such a subject ....! But we torment ourselves with such 'might-have-beens.' Or rather, these things have been before, and far better done, and there was absolutely no reason for this film to exist in the first place. It is a completely misbegotten enterprise and will be utterly forgotten by next week, if not sooner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A melodramatic sad excuse for a musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had little to no transitions, was extremely melodramatic, contained mediocre at best Beatles covers that sound like they should be on a two dollar Christmas album at Wal-Mart. Save your time, people are raving how great this movie is but the funny thing happens to be that all the people that are so in love with it are also billionaires that can waste money on a daily basis. In most films fake British accents don't bother me all that much but after twenty minutes of "Across The Universe" I was ready to burst into tears. I think it was best put by a simple man of our time and he says that "People today are still living off the table scraps of the sixties. They are still being passed around- the music and the ideas." Bob Dylan (1992)It's far too true, everyday I see a teenager wearing an already faded Abbey Road shirt, America is dying due to the fact that every child claims that classic rock bands like The Beatles are the ultimatum to music and that they are individual because they listen to a band as complex as The Beatles this anticipated release of "Across The Universe" was merely a trip across your dad's LP collection except with bad vocal talent and little pictures to look at, if you're really in the mood for "The Beatles" go get an actual Beatles album and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this film. I love Julie Taymor's work--Frida is great, Titus is simply magnificent. Across the Universe, however, is simply one of the worst films I have ever seen. The reworked Beatles tunes are bad. Just bad. I cringed every time a song started. Their use does not translate as clever to any degree. Instead, the application of the songs feels terribly contrived. The plot is utterly uninteresting. I felt in now way personally invested. Perhaps because the characters are not well written. Perhaps because they are empty clichés, testament to a watered-down, unimaginative impression of the time--an endless stream of iconic clowns. There were two good scenes, the draft scene and the trip scene. These were classic Taymor moments, beautifully and grotesquely designed. Unfortunately, five minutes of excellence do not make up for the painful experience of sitting through the rest of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't gone back to pay for and see a movie two times in one week since I was a kid...which is close to fifty years ago. I was definitely a part of the sixties and perhaps that had a lot to do with why this movie had so much appeal. I also used to write for television and I must say that what these people (Revolution studios) put together was sheer genius. The way they told this story falls right into what is most important to me when I go to the movies nowadays...SHOW ME SOMETHING NEW!!! This piece was such a breath of fresh air, so brilliantly done by so many people that I'm thinking about going back yet again with my daughter. If you were a part of the 60's, loved the Beatles or were influenced by their music, or if you just want to see some phenomenal performances in a beautifully told story...Do not miss this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Loved It! :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an American, I came of age in the late 60's, and when it comes to this film, I will cut to the chase: It was a touching, beautiful film. Of all the films that I have ever seen, and I have seen thousands, this one went by the fastest. Toward the very end, I looked at my watch and thought, "Yikes!" this will end any minute, and 3 minutes later it was over. It left me wanting more.......a lot more. I wanted to see more sequences, about the horror that was Vietnam, and more about the raw, confusing, and slightly naive politics of the young people who thought that they could change the world. Those two issues are very complex, but this film was much more about the love affair between it's two lead characters. I honestly think that if it was thirty minutes longer, with about 15 minutes devoted to each of those topics, and with a few seconds devoted to man's first walk on the moon, (I can't believe they left that out.) it would have been a masterpiece. Obviously, that is not what Julie Tamor, or the writers had in mind.In most films when they re-do famous songs it always leaves me cold. Not with this film. I am trying to find out who sang for the actors during the dance numbers. (Was it the actors themselves?) If not, there were some truly superb, powerful, clear, honest, on key, melisma free singers who sang for some of the cast. (I kept thinking how they sounded like Ewan McGregor, and Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge - they shocked the producers, who let them try their own singing in that film.) I thought the re-do of the Beetles songs sounded fantastic, except for "Mr. Kite" which I hated. Also the way they synched the songs with what was going on in the story, and the way they synched certain lyrics with a few things on screen here and there was very clever, and refreshing.I have always remembered the 60's with the Dickens quote from A Tale Of Two Cities "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times......." If you are too young to have lived the 60's, look that entire opening sentence up, and see this film, because it so perfectly captures the awe and turbulence, the artistry and combustion, and more than anything the wonderment and beauty of that controversial time in American history.</fullReview>

If you have no sense of over laying, or collage, or recognizing parallel stories from history repeating themselves, you may not connect with it. But I found this film to be over the top creative and entertaining. Since I grew up in the 60's, and I appreciate the music of the Beatles, there was a personal connection to all of it. A lot of fun yet deep emotions were brought to the surface. I know a creative mind when I see one and Taymor and her collaborators are a "10" in this regard. I will see it again.</fullReview>

There are characters that exist purely as an excuse to sing certain songs.

		<shortDescription>Across the Universe should be seen and seen again across the universe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The response to this movie is a clear evidence that people have a stupid low tolerance level for musicals. Across the Universe works amazingly, and surprisingly as a great musical, it has some of the most the daring, balls out attitudes towards the genre, that we have not seen since probably Fosse's revolution of the musical back in the 70s with Cabaret and All that Jazz. And even though most of what you hear people praising is the production values of the movie, like cinematography, production design, costume design, I think that Julie Taymor is underrated in a very unfair manner. The movie is fantastic, it was such a pleasing film experience.Julie Taymor has always been a very visual director, since Titus, I praised her as a director with extremely rich visual ideas, and compared her to the likes of Baz Luhrmann, which is funny now, cause when the film started, I realize Julie Taymor had a very similar intention with Across the Universe, to that of Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge!, however, I'm of the opinion that Luhrmann was modestly effective, while Taymor hits the nail with absolute precision and perfection.Even though I was a Musical Lover Freak, that I'll admit to, I had a hard time accepting Moulin Rouge!, I enjoyed it visually, as well as the performances, but I don't know, I was sort of a put off with the messy use of music, which really distracted me from the movie, which was supposed to take place in Pre WW1 Paris, but felt like some weird, annoying place, a musical version of a bad Three Stooges Episode, which I know sounds a little too tough on the film, but that's what I though. It was off putting seeing such a comedic portrayal of Toulouse Lautrec, pretending to co-write the score of The Sound of Music with a clumsy 21st Century version of Michael York, only in 1900s Paris.I'm dwelling over Moulin Rouge! a little too much, I know, but it's just that people have complained in a similar way about this particular film. Beatles fans are put off by the almost exclusive use of Beatles songs in the soundtrack. I'm not a die hard Beatles fan, but I certainly like them, as pretty much most people, and I though that Julie Taymor's concept was amazing. Across the Universe is a Roseate Stone of the 60s, and because it is from the 60s, takes place in the 60s, and is all about the 60s, the Beatles soundtrack is a match made in heaven. The opening scene, is a perfect example of just how effective the use of the Beatles was, the comparison of late 50s, early 60s Americana Life Style, with a very industrial and rough Liverpool Life Style, from there on, the movie becomes a fantastic musical in all the classical sense, it's so classic that the film could be easily translated to Broadway.People have said the most inane things like "the film has no plot"...no plot? Are you kidding me, the film not only has a wonderful array of characters that not only represent some of the most iconic figures of music in the 60s, but all of those characters are explored, developed, some to a larger extent than others, just like any movie, and on top of that, most of the characters are resonant in today's society with today's socio-political situation.That is the other interesting element of the film, not only is it a good story, but it is also a politically conscious movie with extremely poignant images about the 60s and today. Not only does it have poignant images, but also, most of the songs have highly imaginative numbers, that are very technically proficient, in the classic sprawling Broadway musical tradition. And regarding the visual and special effects, I think Taymor was a bit gratuitous with the effects back in Frida, but here, they are all in service of the plot, even if some of the scenes seem like scenes that would go great with a little LSD, they are all used for the effect of creating that 60s feel and look in which the movie moves about with a delicious comedic overtone.All of these praises go to the master behind the film, Julie Taymor, she deserves more credit than what she has been getting, the incredibly imaginative and exciting musical sequences are excellent. Who cares if it's music from the Beatles, the Beatles are pretty much the official soundtrack of the 60s, and it's not like the film is just a big bloated Beatles tribute, it's a tribute to the decade, and the whole music scene of the decade, aside from the numerous Beatles references, there are references to Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Morrison.I wanted to focus my review on Julie Taymor's work, but, the whole film is amazing, the cinematography, the production design , Albert Wolsky proves he is still champ of the musical genre. And the cast, aside from Evan Rachel Wood, most of them are young, fresh faces, which works wonders, since you are not ever wondering about who dubbed that song, you take all the stuff in, without having second thoughts or reservations.I recommend you see the film, it's great, and if you have a beef about it using Beatles music, well, I only have one thing to say, DEAL WITH IT, it's not like the film is abusing the Beatles legacy, if anything, it's giving it a standing ovation, and it's fitting for the period, and the tone of the picture, so...that's pretty much it, just..."let it be, let it be, let it be".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, for one, am a Beatle-head. They are one of the best bands out there, hands down. I own all the albums and have seen all the movies. I am also a pure 100% thespian- I'm a huge fan of musical theatre and have taken part in several productions, the most fond experience to me being Pippin.When I heard that there was a going to be a Beatle musical, I was excited. Sturgess, Wood, Plenty of Beatles music, I was sold before I saw anything. And then I saw the trailer... the moment Sturgess sung the opening line of "Girl", my jaw dropped. Then I saw it down in Ontario...Not good.This movie had TONS of potential. I really do think so. I mean, it has gorgeous and arty visuals. It has a hella talented cast behind it (to an extent), music by one of the best rock bands ever, and an amazing concept to boot.Now, I can go on all day about how amazing the visuals and concept. But simply, what a bad movie.The plot is very juvenile. I dunno what the hell was going on- I know this movie is supposed to be artistic, and I applaud that. But the plot basically went nowhere. If you rely on a bunch of Beatles songs to create a good story, that's not good. The Beatles rock, indeed. But The Beatles wrote songs with their own meanings, not to comprise a story of a certain kind. The plot seems to plod its way through without much of a clue as to what it wants to do- Musical-Rom-Com? War Movie? Music Drama? Romance? Another thing wrong is that the movie is simply way too long. I mean, at least 20 minutes could have been cut from the movie, it simply dragged. Real pacing issues ensue, with the amount of material in it- this is one strangely paced movie. It's too long, but yet too short for what's in it. Scenes end before they begin a lot of the time- that really grates on my nerves. As for length, it seems as if the director was too lazy to choose scenes to be edited out so he just said "Hey, no need to edit things out! It's a Beatle musical, everything I touch turns to gold!".The cast is talented, undoubtedly. But the problem is though- their acting seemed to outweigh their singing talent. While My Guitar Gently Weeps made my jaw drop, it's that great. Martin Luther's voice is tearjerkingly amazing. Sturgess seems to be a rather minor praise for me though... he has a technically great voice, but that's the problem. But on a lot of the songs he seems to take you out of the whole experience. Revolution was laughably bad... he hits several foul notes during the verses then slides to correct them. He was great acting wise, but singing wise was just... bad.The songs are a really missed opportunity. It seems as if the writer took the songs too literally here. Jude looks at strawberries, and then... *dramatic music* Strawberry Fields Forever!!!! Helter Skelter, which is usually a adrenaline fueled song, is well sung but poorly composed. Because is gorgeous visually and musically, as are a few others. But most of the time my eyes were rolling. Also, there's LOTS missing here; where's songs like "You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"? Or "Another Girl"? Or "Tomorrow Never Knows"? That song would have fit the trippy mood.I'm not saying this movie sucked. It's a GORGEOUS movie. It's very trippy, it's visually amazing, it has good songs, and a good concept. But I simply couldn't enjoy it. Several flaws got into in the way of it. I enjoyed some songs, I loved Bono's clever little cameo (Bono can do no wrong), the acting was good "All you Need is Love" was the best part of it, etc. But it's not very good, and in the end, I could have used those hours to have watched something that was more suited to my liking. And I don't not like Taymor- she did a FANTASTIC rendition of Titus Andronicus, and others, but this movie disappointed me greatly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im not the kind of person that weeps at the drop of a hat. Nor am I the type of person that feels complete when watching something that has a happy ending. Just to be clear on that before we begin.I saw this trailer at a trailer preview session the cinema where I work has every month after a regulation fire drill. It was in late 2006, and as the trailer began I thought "Hmm, looks good". I then got the shock of my life when "Hey Jude" was sung acapella over a series of shots, and tears welled in my eyes. Don't ask me why, it just did. That specific moment in the trailer when Jude realises that Lucy's stuff is gone is the moment I knew this film would top my "All Time Favourite Musical Ever" list, and quite possibly my "All Time Favourite Anything Ever" list.I then saw it in the cinema, and was smart enough to take tissues in with me, on the assumption that if the trailer could make me teary, the film would have me in full on tearjerker mode. And I was right. It did.This film is a splendid visionary success, with complex dance routines, perfectly executed vocal and acting skills, and the plot is simple yet brilliant. The dialogue is hilarious one moment ("So learn french. Learn french or DIE!") and almost heartbreaking the next ("Why would you do that Jude?!" - after Jude punches Paco during "Revolution"). A love story that will live on through the immortal songs of The Beatles. There are very specific moments that I adore within this film, one of them during "Come Together", when Jojo is seen walking at a slow pace through business people who cut and change direction in front of him. A genius scene that really managed to show the differences between the two cultures of the 60's.This film appeals to any person, simply because it has the deep and profound meaning and history of the 60's, the events that happened and the metaphors concealed within that people such as myself enjoy looking for, whilst also containing massive doses of trivia, hints, nods and jibes at the life, work and style of The Beatles that other people may enjoy looking for. And yet it is still a film you can just lose your mind in and relax with on the sofa.This is the definition of a Quality Film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie starts out pretty good for the first 20 minutes or so. The first hint of strangeness is when the cheerleader begins singing I wanna hold your hand' sung from a distance where she longingly sings about the head cheerleader. From this point it's a downhill slide and basically turns into a free for all 60s movie with gratuitous drug use, sexual content, and even frontal nudity.Great music, great actors, and a ridiculous story. How this movie ever got a pg-13 is beyond me, and how anyone could give it a good review is equally baffling. I would NOT recommend this movie to anyone, and feel that this is the first time that IMDb reviewers really let me down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this movie with my boyfriend stoked after watching the previews several times thinking "wow that looks mind numbing..."Mind numbing it was...and not in a good way. The movie starts out good and don't get me wrong the songs in it were great classics. The first scene with Jude singing girl was great, good camera work, However then the scene movies on to a random Asian girl singing hold my hand, to which i start thinking "what does she have to do with this?"Furthur more the plot is almost non-existent! The characters follow the songs and thats it! talk about the plot jumping! Julie Taymore does a pitiful job of developing the characters, and adding characters to the movie at all! She did a poor job of developing the story too. Why was prudence there? why was there a Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin character? How in the heck did they get back to New York from the doctors ranch place where Bono's character left them?The list goes on but I'm not going to waste the words. The dialog was brief and UN-thought out. Im going to say about 70% of the dialog in the movie was heard in the movie preview.This movie was a joke, waste of $14, and 2 hours of my life i will never get back.I had high hopes for this movie after seeing the preview several times but i was ultimately disappointed. Taymor had a chance to do something with this movie but she wasted its potential. But hey, props to the people who edited and put together the preview...they really knew how to talk up a good game.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to see a screening of this film and it is very enjoyable, very thought provoking. I only gave it an 8/10 because I felt that it went on a little long. I looked around and saw people looking at their watches. Im also not a huge Evan Rachel Wood fan. She was fine in the movie, Im just not crazy about her acting. The gentleman who played Jude was excellent. I found him to be adorable and funny. He also had an excellent voice. I also felt it to be kind of...out there. If you watch the preview, you already have a taste of what I mean. Some of the moments in the songs were kind of abstract (personally I enjoy that in small doses but she did use it quite a lot throughout the film.) Over all, this move was good, and I think that everyone should see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Credit should be given here for Daniel Ezralow. He choreographed all the great dance sequences. The best being especially the Army "recruiting" office. Then the excellent puppets Taymor is so great at--Juan Darien--and the lion king. A great uncredited nod to Bread and Puppet theater, in the protest march. And especially on the farm in Vermont, a very direct reference. Eddie Izard and Bono lend a poignant touch in reference to the Beatles themselves. Many special details. This was a surprise when it came out for how close it stayed to the New York art scene. They maintained their artistic control overall. Really surprising to see Salma Hayak as a nurse with special drugs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Across the Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was released in 2007 and is 133 minutes. In my opinion, this is too long for a film of this nature. The movie has an extremely incoherent story, that is just an excuse to showcase some young actors singing Beatles songs. I love the Beatles, but I don't really like this movie. On the positive side, the cinematography is dazzling, and the actors can sing. The movie's main problem is lack of a story that makes sense and is easy to follow. When the movie has songs, it is entertaining, but when it goes for plot, it fails. This movie is like watching lots of music videos and watching commercials in between. Overall, this movie feels more like an experience than an actual, quality film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breakfast on Pluto</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Across the Universe" is a fairly unique, visually inventive film. Some initial thoughts...1. This film attempts to encapsulate the 60s (the Vietnam war, drugs, draftees, sexual liberation, hippies and other topical issues) by splicing karaoke versions of the Beatles songs onto a fairly clichéd love story.2. The Beatles weren't about topicality. Why use them? They were a safe band compared to many of the other musicians of the era.3. Neil Jordan's "Breakfast on Pluto", which uses pop music to interpret Irish history, did this stuff in a much more personal manner. See also Todd Haynes's "Velvet Goldmine" and Ken Russell's "Tommy".4. The film uses various codes of the 1960s - passion, activism, idealism, disenfranchisement and rebellion - as a kind of operatic Iraq War allegory, the hopelessness of the Vietnam War seeping into the Middle East four decades later, precisely because the psychedelic landscape of the film has been bulldozed and replaced with, not only disinterest and apathy, but (why not?) bubble gum pop.5. The film's cast is made up to subtly resemble famous figures of the era (Hendrix, Joplin, McCartney). Other references (the Beatles' rooftop concert, Hendrix's formation of The Experience, Joplin's break up from Big Brother and the Holding Company) are far more esoteric, and will likely go over the heads of most audience members.6. Why does a film that celebrates rebellion stick so faithfully to the standard "boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy wins girl" storyline? 7. The songs are mostly flat, lacking any sort of magic. And yet.."Across the Universe" is such a visually audacious film, director Julie Taylor (exstatic at being given this budget) treating us to an orgy of zany camera work and super choreographed sequences. Almost every shot positions our eye in an interesting place, exploiting space and architecture in a variety of clever ways. The film's love story is also fairly sweet, and a bit unorthodox in the way it focuses on the beauty of the male lead (most of these romances are directed by men).7.9/10 - Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great tribute to Beatles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in America during the Vietnam War, Across the Universe is a powerful love story set against a backdrop of political and social unrest: it's a story of soul-searching, self-doubt, and individual powerlessness cleverly conveyed through a multitude of Beatles songs. Like young adults all across America during the 1960's, Jude (Jim Sturgess), Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood), Max (Joe Anderson), Sadie (Dana Fuchs), Prudence (T.V. Carpio), and JoJo (Martin Luther) are in turmoil over the war; questioning their individual roles in the war effort and struggling to find a way to hold true to their beliefs while making a difference in the world. While love proves a powerful uniting force, its limitations become clear as relationships are strained and broken over individual perceptions of responsibility to cause and country. A fairly bizarre juxtaposition of extremely stylized, almost hallucinogenic scenes of swirling colors and reflections, highly choreographed dance segments, seemingly commonplace character interaction, and emotionally packed close-up footage of characters lost in contemplative song, this film imparts a good sense of the confusion and passion of the time and is at once powerful, invigorating, and disturbing. The film runs a bit long at 2-hours 11-minutes and several segments drag noticeably thanks to some incredibly slow song tempos. Warning: this production may change how you think about a favorite Beatles song forever.</fullReview>

It is a awesome show and remember it takes two to tango! Jim Sturgess is a great actor and fun to watch! He also has some other great movies out! Evan Rachel Wood I have really enjoyed in every movie she is in, some of my favorites are Thirteen, King of California, Down in the valley and Pretty Persuasion. She has a quality about her that is real! The movie contains some great motifs that have to do with Yokoono, Timothy Leary, the hippy bus that traveled across the united states in the 70's, hippies and the antiwar movement and a lot more!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A+ for Visual Effects and Musical Interpretation. The Rest? Eh . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This being a movie about the music of the Beatles, and me being a big Beatles fan, it's unforgettable in terms of it's music and the visual effects. One strength this movie had was it's different interpretations of Beatles songs. I especially liked Prudence's version of "I Want To Hold Your Hand" near the beginning of the movie. The set design and choreography were also very impressive.But unfortunately, for every strength this movie had, it's accurate to say that there were at least three hang-ups. This is where I'm at odds with other friends of mine who have seen the movie. It's not that I hated "Across the Universe", it's just that I didn't love it because it had some very evident flaws. And I just remember leaving the movie feeling very disappointed about the movie's weaknesses, since they were so big.For one, the movie came off to me as too preachy, especially towards the end. The characters in the film, particularly Lucy and Max Carrigan, came off less as children of the '60's, and more as people I knew from college who smoked weed all the time and said, "Man, I wished I lived in the '60's!" over and over again. I thought Jim Sturgess, who played Jude, was probably the best-developed and most believable character of everyone, but the rest of them felt like archetypes ripped and Xeroxed from Oliver Stone movies and Milos Forman's "Hair". You were supposed to feel bad for Max Carrigan (I think) for being drafted into Vietnam, but his character was such an asshole I found myself not really caring. Plus, the Vietnam scenes were so underdeveloped (Compared to other Vietnam War films such as "Platoon" and "Full Metal Jacket") and Max's character so forgotten by the end that I really felt the movie didn't have a message.Continuing on the subject of characters, I thought the characters of Jojo (played by Martin Luther McCoy) and Sadie (played by Joan Osbourne lookalike Dana Fuchs) were almost unnecessary. Even though Jojo's introduction via the very cool sequence with Joe Cocker singing "Come Together" added some real light to this movie, I still didn't see the significance of characters that echoed Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin respectively. Sure, these two singers were huge influences of the 1960's, but this is a movie about Beatles music, right? I was especially lost when the Sadie character started off with Jojo's band, then went solo and got hooked on alcohol. Her successful recovery from all this was never explained in the end, which had me feeling a bit cheated when I turned off the movie.The characters of Jojo and Sadie really show what this movie's big flaw is: the movie makers tried to cram too much into a two hour movie. Too many characters, too many subplots, too many radical messages, and (sadly) too many Beatles songs. As a result, some Beatles songs that may have been powerful in another context tended to fall flat. One such example is the section of the movie beginning with Bono singing "I Am The Walrus", and ending with Eddie Izzard's turn as Mr. Kite. That section of the movie was the exact moment where the movie lost it's message and said, "Let's demonstrate the message of the '60's by having the main characters go on an acid trip". It may have worked as a music video, but as a section of the movie it felt way too self-indulgent.Above all, the biggest problem I had with this movie was the idea that the main characters wrote the songs themselves. I would have liked to have seen even a cameo by Paul McCartney or Ringo Starr (perhaps not Yoko Ono), or even see the characters watching a live broadcast of one of their concerts. That would have made the movie feel a little more authentic to me, but of course, that is just my opinion.I reiterate when I say that this movie tried to bite off more than it could actually chew. It wasn't as bad as the Bee Gees' disastrous "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", which is why I gave this movie a 6 out of 10 after very careful consideration. I was debating whether to give this movie a 4 out of 10. I'll admit that it was a very ambitious movie, but at times it seemed so ambitious to the point of being haughty and arrogant. Like many big budget science fiction hits of the 1990's, this movie was great on visual effects, but not so great on a coherent storyline and characters you actually cared about. I'll definitely buy the soundtrack, because the different versions of the Beatles songs were indeed awe-inspiring. The rest of the movie, I'm sorry to say, just didn't do it for me. I know other people will like it, though, and I respect their decisions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie That Felt Completely Hollow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't expect much when I began to watch the movie and didn't come out with much after it was over. All this movie is is a clichéd and very dumb love story who's plot didn't take it anywhere(or at least that's how I felt). But seriously this movie really felt as though it was going nowhere. As a matter of fact the only way you know that the story is moving along is the progression from one scene to the next, and even then the movie still felt as hollow as you can get. Then there are the scenes that show that the studio, director,etc. were too cheap to pay to film at real places. The subway looked fake, the highway Jude and Max were on looked fake, and even Lucy's breast looked fake. Now the final thing is the covers. How anybody found that these covers were better than the originals completely confuses me. To begin with almost all the covers were a mere shell of the originals. "Come Together" had no bass line, "Helter Skelter" was completely screwed up by Dana Fuchs, "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" was screwed up by Bono. Almost every cover was stupid. They even managed to screw up "Flying", the most simple song in the movie. And the travesty that "Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite" was. And if it wasn't the songs it was the scenes that accompanied them that dumbed the song down(i.e. the Strawberry Feilds segment and the She's so Heavy segment). Overall, it isn't the worst movie that I've seen, but no plot and a good amount of bad covers did not help this movie either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I did see this with an open mind &amp; I expected that I would like it, but after about an hour I really just felt tired &amp; frustrated &amp; wanted to turn it off. I bravely sat through to the end... I did not think any of the performances were very good &amp; Bono's Timothy Leary caricature was the worst... There wasn't great characterization &amp; the plot was kinda silly in the parts where there was plot at all. Even the music wasn't that great &amp; I love the Beatles. A song like "I want to hold your hand" for example is a rock song but they turned it into a pop ballad, whats more it wasn't quite clear what it had to do with whats going on &amp; even then this jock that it seemed she was infatuated with only lasted one single scene so whats the point? Perhaps it was just to introduce the character of Prudence &amp; yet it provides no characterization that is relevant to any part of the film after this point... Another thing about Bono's Dr. Robert is it was clearly trying to parody a Timothy Leary type character yet there is nothing interesting about his character. From the few minutes we see of him he comes across as an unintelligent drugged-out nobody with nothing to say. There was potential for Dr. Robert to be an intelligent &amp; interesting character but instead he's really just a dumb bong-rat. In conclusion little or no characterization &amp; when it seemed like maybe there was it turned out to be completely useless information as far as things that happened to that character later. There was little or no plot &amp; what little there was were just forced opportunities for bad Beatles covers. I found this film to be songs &amp; dancing strung together with the bare minimum plot &amp; characterization... I did not feel it captured the feel of the 60's at all, maybe some people feel a small buzz of nostalgia merely because the bad covers remind them of the good originals...</fullReview>

The trailers do not do it justice. I would compare it too Moulin Rouge or any Baz Lurhman movie. The soundtrack was awesome too. Really great renditions of Beatles songs,.. and and all star cast, outstanding. The sixties vibe was well pronounced throughout, not only in the characters but also as a time line of changes in music produced from the Beatles. It went above and beyond all of my expectations. There are many Beatle references within the movie without having the story line be about the Beatles themselves. Each scene is extremely different,...Some scenes are more dark and weary and then liven up in the following scene with bright colors and extravagant dancing. Also references to other popular musicians from the sixties like Jimmy Hendrix and Janis Joplin are somewhat "represented" within the cast but not playing that particular person in the film. A really great time period flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Across the Universe (2007): Dir: Julie Taymor / Cast: Jim Sturgess, Evan Rachel Wood, Joe Anderson, Dana Fuchs, Martin Luther McCoy: Exquisite visual extravaganza set to the backdrop of Vietnam. Jude travels from London to meet his father. He befriends Max who is a free spirit threatened with the prospects of being drafted. Jude falls for Max's sister Lucy whose boyfriend dies in the war and she starts an anti-war protest. Other characters include Sadie, a promising singer who becomes involved with her guitarist. Directed by Julie Taymor and highlighted with revised Beatles songs that are given a brand new approach. These musical numbers are accompanied by striking visual images to express the emotion within each scene. A highlight regards a cheerleader walking across an aggressive football field while singing "I Wanna Hold Your Hand." Jim Sturgess as Jude is a free spirit and artist who never intended to fall in love but he does. He is illegally a citizen who fights his way back to his desired love. Evan Rachel Wood as Lucy voices her protests and political agendas before finding freedom in an artist. Joe Anderson as Max is her brother whose reckless lifestyles leads to the serious nature of war where the reality of death and violence leaves wounds, both physical and mental. Dana Fuchs as Sadie finds her place in music. The musical numbers express the era that encase our memory. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

A really good story set in the turbulent 1960's, with a satisfying romance between an American named Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) and Jude from Liverpool (Jim Sturgess). The movie also traces a small group of friends and musicians who are swept up into the emerging anti-war and counterculture movements, along with the star-crossed lovers, Jude and Lucy.Interesting versions of more than 30 Beatles songs preformed by the cast, complete with cool cameos (Bono, Joe Cocker) and musical numbers with amazingly trippy choreographed dance routines. This was just so good. A couple numbers stood out for me: "Come Together" with Joe Cocker, just wow, the business people dancing and shuffling on the busy New York street and "I want You(?)" with the brother getting inducted into the army was downright scary with a very Pink Floyd, Another Brick In The Wall feel to it.

The attention to detail is laudable, and the cinematography is so painstakingly historically accurate. The music itself is beautiful (but obviously not comparable to the original versions), and the acting is also very convincing. The dialogue falls short at some points, but is also filled with sly allusions to Beatles lyrics which makes the movie all the more enjoyable for any fan. I love the spirit captured within the film; not only the spirit of each unique and vibrant character, but the ecstatic mood of Greenwich village in the 60's. This movie is not perfect, but god, it is beautiful, and I love it unceasingly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a sucker for musicals. I grew up on the classics like Camelot and Show Boat, My Fair Lady and Oliver so the musical aspect of this film is what intrigued, despite my lack of affection for The Beatles. Across the Universe blew my mind! The way the story is woven around the themes of Beatles songs, borrowing not only lyrics for dialog but characters from the songs was pure genius.Aside from the clever and multi-layered story line, this film delivers exquisite scene after exquisite scene particularly once we head in the more psychedelic segments of the film. The cinematography impressed and enthralled me throughout - the strawberry fields sequence is particularly noteworthy! The guest stars featured in certain sequences were also a great treat and lent the film that little something extra.The performances here blew me away. I've liked Evan Rachel Wood since I saw her in Thirteen, but I never imagined she could sing and sing well. Another surprise was Joe Anderson who had little to no voice training prior to doing this film. Jim Sturgess though, steals the show as scruffy Jude. His voice is raw and honest and just right for the style of music. Sure, some of the plot was contrived and tropes abounded, but ultimately this film captured the essence of the Beatles as well as the spirit of the era in a movie that dazzles the eyes as it ensorcells the ears. This is one movie I will never get tired of watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Across the Universe is a sublime, beautiful story loosely based on Beatles songs and set against the harsh reality of the Vietnam War. The combination of timeless music with Oscar-nominated costume design yields a thematically coherent work of art that spreads its message of love and understanding to great success.The story centers around a Liverpudlian named Jude (Jim Sturgess) who joins the merchant marines and then jumps ship once he gets to the United States, ostensibly to look up his American father. He meets a wild young man named Max (Joe Anderson) who's wreaking havoc on the Harvard campus, and Max's sister Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood), a straight-arrow babe in the woods. Jude and his friends have fun and adventures and suffer the various tragedies of life from the early 1960s through to the early 1970s, pretty much aping how John Lennon spent his time during that period.Almost all of the characters in this story have some sort of Beatles connection. Jude refers to the song "Hey Jude," which itself referred to Lennon's son Julian. Lucy refers to "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds," and Max refers to "Maxwell's Silver Hammer." But that ain't all. Jude and Max eventually get an apartment together, and their landlady is named Sadie (Dana Fuchs), after "Sexy Sadie); the character herself is an homage to Janis Joplin. Sadie's musician boyfriend is Jo-Jo, from "Get Back," and he's an homage to Jimi Hendrix. There's a friend named Pru ("Dear Prudence"), too. But here's what's really neat. The songs used in the movie aren't shoehorned in there to fit with the characters' names, and vice versa. Director Julia Taymor allows the viewer to become immersed in the world of Jude and Lucy without being distracted by what's really a constant stream of Beatle references.This is not a small achievement, either. From a Cavern Club show to a rooftop performance, there are scores of people, places, and events relating the Lennon and his bandmates, and it doesn't stop there. At one point Jude and the gang get on a bus that's on its way to see Dr. Timothy Leary, just like Ken Kesey's famous transcontinental trek some fifty years ago. There's a musical number devoted to the song "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite," and if ever a song really shouted out for a musical number, that's it. Eddie Izzard, of all people, plays the titular Kite, and he's surrounded by Blue Meanies. Trust me, if you're not high when you watch that scene, you'll feel like you are anyway.But at the center of the madness is the beautiful love story of Jude and Lucy, one a struggling artist who is passionate about pacifism and one who supports more proactive protest measures. As one might expect in any time period, their love becomes strained and even vanishes for a while. After all, this isn't a musical rooted in fantasy. Kids are sent off to war in Taymor's vision, and they don't always come back.Across the Universe seems to capture the spirit, the angst, and the hope that embodied the period. It's a bit long, over two hours, but if you do make it to the end you should find the final number to be a real heart stopper. Honest, winning performances from everyone really seal the deal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful musical, one of the greats!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Across the Universe just as the DVD was released, I didn't make it to the theater. I'm a bit late for this review, but I feel this movie is a classic. There is so much to love, and so much detail in this movie that I've seen it dozens of times. My 16 year old daughter loves it too, such a great story mixed with wonderful remakes of Beatles tunes. I'm a bit surprised it wasn't a blockbuster hit, as I think most of the movie is pure genius, with an unforgettable talented young cast! There are also several notable cameos in the film, I'd also love to see a stage version of the movie, maybe Julie Taymor will work on this in the future... I re-watched the movie tonight and it has lost none of the luster that endeared me the first time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure what more I can say. I normally get annoyed when the singing starts, but this film does it so well.Very cool imagery and camera work during the singing kept me engaged. The director has a wonderful visual style, especially with scenes that feature singing in the midst of all the mayhem happening around.It gets a bit weird in the middle, but the rest of it was very well done, especially with representing the eras that the story goes through.It also doesn't hurt that it has the classic songs of the Beatles. I definitely recommend it for fans of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbearable Nostalgia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. It is an unabashed musical packed with more Beatles tunes than I remembered even existed. The singers are brilliant. The boy who plays Jude, Jim Sturgess, is spectacular. He is better than the Beatles. He gives the songs depth, meaning and emotion that they did not have in the bouncy originals. The movie is essentially an opera, with bits of dialogue to tie together the musical numbers into a clever strangely uncontrived story. Each song usually begins with a minute or two a capella, perfectly sung. There are usually about ten people in the background dancing, or doing something or just looking colourful. It is like a non-stop visual torrent washing over your eyes. The choreography is original avoiding repetition.The movie reminds me of Grease and Peter Fonda's early movie, The Trip. It also reminds of my youth. It is pretty realistic for how surreal it was.The nostalgia was so thick it made me cry a few times. At one point Sadie did a Janice Joplin impersonation. Ouch!It is not a particularly light entertainment. It is set against the brutality of the powers that be who brought you the Viet Nam War. The depiction of the violence is mostly surreal. Yet it got under my skin even more that blunt realism would. I have seen so much of that my hide is tough. There was one scene when you watch from a distance as two soldiers deliver notice the beloved son has died and the reaction of the mother and girlfriend. I have never seen that done so powerfully before.The ending was so predictable and so saccharine I felt let down, quite unlike the rest of the movie, but at least they clipped it short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think it was very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone already said, you have to see this film with an open mind. Like any musical, like "Hair", "A chorus line", "The Rocky horror picture show", or any classic musical we can see on Broadway, there is the storyline, there is the music, and there is the acting. You have to like this "genre" to fully appreciate the fantasy. Of course, the rendition of the song in an "interpretation" by the different actors of the Beatles' songs, and in no way this rendition in meant to do better that the original songs. It is just "different", and this is why you have to keep an open mind. If you want some kind of a story with the original song, go see the "Cirque du Soleil" in Las Vegas, all song are originals and they put all kinds of performance to illustrate and enrich the musical experience.On my part, I was prepared to see this film and I was told what to expect. I just went with it and I had a really GOOD TIME!. I believe this movie can become a classic as much as many of those who didn't receive good reviews a first. ANd also, you have to admit HOW good was this Evan Rachel Wood!! Damn she was good. You also have to admit that those different renditions of the song were absolutely flawless as far as "signing" was concerned. All those were extremely good signers. As I said, it is "different" than the originals, but worthy of listening nevertheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Across the Universe" is truly across the teenage-world of the United States during the Vietnam War. The idea of movie is very good and extra ordinary. When other studios make teenage movie in the twenty-first-century, however, Revolution Studios make the unique teenage-point-of-view in twentieth century. Teen is just a teen, with their labile emotion and their curiosity they can make colorful friendship or love yet ironic life of separation also disloyalty. Of course, because I watched this movie when I am a teen, I love this movie very much.It is musical and musical usually a boring genre of movie. But, with combination of teen drama, the movie actually is a great one. In other hand, just like other teen romance, this movie message is too shallow. There are few of humanity moral value and any other message. It can be a masterpiece if they give it "moral-value-seasoning", so that the movie is more meaningful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Music, Dazzling Graphics!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched this movie three times over the past few years. I enjoyed it the first time I saw it. And it keeps getting better to me. With movies based on the work of superb musicians, it's awfully hard to do the songs as well as they did. The songs in this movie never make me feel like I'd rather listen to the Beatles. The production values are great, the voices are good, textured, emotional, talented. But the songs are never upstaged.The graphics in the movie convey the full impact of the 60s mixture of free love, psychedelics, and civil unrest in some purely dazzling mixes of imagination and hard core replication of the bare gut feelings of the era, realities and emotions as spot on as any I've seen in any movie about that dreadful-wonderful moment in time. I did my share of drugs in the day, but I'd take this movie over many of those experiences. And that's High Praise, if you'll forgive the pun.Some say the story line is too naive, too simplistic. Maybe to them. But it has never seemed so to me. I watch a lot of romance movies, a lot of musicals. Boy always meets girl and loses girl and wins girl's heart in the end. Some movies make it seem more believable than others, but you know, I'm not sure those were the ones I liked best. As long as our boy and girl end up together, the romance movie has done its job. I will not fault this movie for not doing its job.The movie's depictions of the hard realities of the 60s was certainly not naive or simplistic in my mind. I lived those days, very much as they lived them in this movie. The romantic overlay onto those troubled events was a necessary device for fully utilizing the diversity of Beatles songs that spoke to our generation about life and love, joy and sorrow, despair and, always, hope.If you want to hear something bad about this movie, look elsewhere. Unlike Anthony, I DO come to praise Caesar, not to bury him.Samm</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Across the Universe will blow your mind!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Across the Universe is not your typical musical. Set to more than 25 Beatles songs, Across the Universe will blow your mind like it did mine. The songs that were sung were not done in a way that mimics the classics of the Beatles, but done in their own original way which was very cool. Each character was named after a Beatles song or song reference. (i.e Jude, Maxwell, Lucy, Prudence, Sadie, Mr. Roberts) Not to mention, the voices of some of these actors are tremendous!Across the Universe is set in the savvy 70&#x2032;s, as you can probably tell from the picture above, smack-dab in the middle of the Vietnam war. The plot involves every aspect of the 70&#x2032;s that was important; war drafts, colorful protests, sex, and of course drugs. Though some of the drug scenes are not quite realistic, I think everything else is put in to place very well.The charming Jim Sturgess plays Jude, a young man dropped on the shores of America looking to find his father, who works at Princeton. At Princeton, he meets Maxwell (or Max) played by the amazing Joe Anderson. Maxwell is a quirky, troubled college student with a sister, named Lucy, played by Evan Rachel Wood. Max makes the decision to drop out of college and move to New York with Jude. They stay with a singer, Sadie played by Dana Fuchs, and shortly after Prudence (T.V Carpio)?who I must say has an absolutely beautiful voice? and JoJo (Martin Luther McCoy) Eventually, Lucy goes to New York too, and Jude and Lucy end up falling in love.Like I said above, there are 25 Beatles hits that outline Across the Universe, but some of the best by far were Max's "Hey Jude", Prudence's "I Want to Hold Your Hand", Max's "Happiness is a Warm Gun", and Jude's "Something".If you have not seen Across the Universe yet, I highly recommend it to you. You'll fall in love with the Beatles era, the music, the actors, and the movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taymor's eye is far reaching but her voice is muffled and predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Across the Universe' is an achievement. It is hard to remember a film that looked so original. Kinetic energy bursts off the screen. Visually it beats some of the great special effects epics of recent memory. The pulse of the film is the music of the greatest poets of the twentieth century. All of these are elements for success and yet 'Across the Universe' alludes greatness. The film is a musical through and through and sadly it hurts the finished product. What we have here that hurts the film is a boring and pieced together script.Julie Taymor is a brilliant director. I love all her films if only for their visuals. She handles the camera and actors beautifully. The one problem she has is that she is a very poor writer. 'Titus' is her best film because she has the framework of Shakespeare to work around. 'Frida' works in the same way give or take but we definitely see Taymor lose stability in the plot. 'Across the Universe' is her worst picture because she is given free reign to create a world with nothing more than the Beatles songs to piece it together. The story plays like someone who has seen way too many over the top musicals. Rather than work with a story first it seems as if Taymor has a list of Beatles songs she wants and has to bend the story to fit it and thus the transitions and characters seem void of reality. The very worst musicals are the ones where the characters never explicitly break the fourth wall but acknowledge that a fourth wall exists, 'Across the Universe' sadly falls into this category. I wonder what the film would have been like had Taymor built the script upon steadier foundations. I kept asking myself "Why not do 'Romeo and Juilet' in the counter-culture sixties to Beatles songs?" She is essentially doing a lot of that already and of course the theme of the picture is young love. Taymor's brilliant understanding of Shakespeare could have done this and the story would have seemed much more real. Instead we kind of get an over the top time capsule that isn't sure where it wants to go or how it wants to get there. We get brilliant renditions of Beatles songs but the wrap around are just silly and inorganic. I have no complaints about the brilliant rendition of "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite" but the set up for it is so wrong and forced that it almost takes away. 'Across the Universe' might have worked better as a collection of music videos.That being said the narrative is completely to be damned. The performances and characters are likable enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Across the Universe is Wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Across the Universe" is a radiant, artistic, psychedelic and excellent experience that evokes a great period where peace, love, war and music walked side by side. With a story set between 1967 and 1968 and filled with musical and cultural references this is a fantastic film that really takes you back to that period, making you sing along with The Beatles classics performed by the great ensemble cast and singers like Bono and Joe Cocker. The story follows the love story between Jude (Jim Sturgess), a poor English in America and Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) an upper class American girl. We also see the circle of friends of both characters such as Lucy's brother Max (Joe Anderson), the singer Sadie (Dana Fuchs), the guitarist JoJo (Martin Luther McCoy) and Prudence (T.V.Carpio). We join their reactions towards the many turbulent events around them such as the Vietnam war, the discovery of love, rock n'roll, art and many others. And they sing The Beatles songs. I won't explain too much of the story and I'm only gonna write why it was a great film. Director Julie Taymor made a very captivating film about an era very similar like "Almost Famous" or "Hair". The way The Beatles's songs were used, or better saying, the context in which it was used was beautiful, magical, intelligent and worked very well. For instance when Jude is introduced to Max's friends and they sang "With a Little Help from My Friends" (great funny moment) or when the Max was enlisted by the Amry it starts to play "I Want You" and the Uncle Sam poster pointing at him. And of course the Beatles references (many songs couldn't been introduced here so there are cases when a character's name reminds you of a song or something said by a character like Jude's boss saying that things would look different when he was 64 years old) and rock references such as Jimi Hendrix (JoJo) and Janis Joplin (Sadie). It was a great mix of things.In the beginning I thought the movie was becoming one of those musicals where you almost laugh at it, many of the songs wasn't good performed by the actors but when Joe Cocker appeared singing "Come Together" I was really in the mood of the film, and after that it was delightful to follow and at many times sing along almost all the songs. And I changed my mind about the whole thing (except for the performance of "I Want to Hold Your Hand", that really bothers me, the girl sings too much). It is like a 2 hour video clip but it's a very good video clip. All actors are great, dramatically and performing the songs. Jim Sturgess what an inspiration...Great leading actor here and the chemistry between he and Evan Rachel Wood was amazing. There are few special appearances of Eddie Izzard (Mr. Kite), Dylan Baker, Bill Irwin, Logan Marshall-Green (unrecognizable as a protest leader) and Salma Hayek (who worked with Julie Taymor in "Frida", she plays a nurse in a musical scene). Best moments: Bono singing "I am the Walrus"; the whole cast singing "Because"; the performance on the rooftop reminder of Abbey Road; Jude throwing Strawberries on the wall and the result of one of his art works; JoJo and Sadie electrifying performances on stage; Max's jokes; anyway everything was excellent here. Definitely a memorable film. 10/10</fullReview>

The hard core politicos, the psychedelics, the art, the music: the way the Viet Nam war drove a sock hop culture firmly into the past.Very rare.

		<fullReview>'Across the Universe' is a powerful musical in which all songs are by The Beatles. Excellent singing and creative, artistic choreography and costume design make this movie definitely worth watching. 'Come Together', 'I Want to Hold Your Hand', and the wonderful yet tear-jerking 'Let it Be' are just a few of the memorable songs. 'Across the Universe' is about an illegal British immigrant (Jude) from Liverpool (hmmmm...) who comes to America in search of his father. Jude makes friends at a prestigious college, and falls in love with one of his friends sister. Jude moves to New York City where many loose ends from random musical numbers are tied up. You'll have to see the movie to find out what happens in the end.Rating: PG-13 for some drug content, nudity, sexuality, violence, and language. (CAN) 14A violence, nudity, language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>not even a movie. I have never reviewed a movie before, but when I saw this film I felt compelled to warn people (and doubly so once I found out that some people actually liked this "movie").When I watch a movie, I expect entertainment. I expect to at least be interested in some semblance of a plot, and I expect the music (especially in a movie which emphasizes music) to not only sound good, but to add to or re-enforce the plot.What I got from "Across the Universe" was not in the least bit entertaining or interesting, but rather an enormously clichéd and uninteresting story. The plot was a shameless mess of a story, which was clearly nothing but a poor excuse to play a specific list of songs. Even the praised "psychedelic" sections are simply a few minutes of horribly edited paint throwing and a "solarize" filter.The one part I could tolerate was the music. A few songs were even good covers, but most ranged from mediocre to things I could barely listen to. Even then, however, the characters inexplicably broke out into song for (often) no apparent reason.For these reasons, I do not consider "Across the Universe" a movie at all. It is, at best, an absurdly long and poorly made music video which thinks it can be a musical if it fits enough songs into one storyline.Most of the original songs were better than those in this video, and the story and visuals were a pitiful attempt. My recommendation, then, is simply to buy and listen to the original songs. It will save you time, you'll hear better music, and watching paint dry would be better than watching the video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, drug use was rampant during the time the Beatles were big, but apparently it still is, seeing as how IMDb members have currently rated this better than 7 stars out of 10. This movie was in no way a tribute to the Beatles, but an insult. It was completely disjointed, as were most of the songs. The singing was appalling and the tempo was far too slow. The pathetic attempt to piece together a plot failed miserably, as did the attempt to be cute by issuing names that reference song titles to the characters, a couple of whom had no other reason for existing. When the movie finally ended, I was shocked to see that it had only run 2 hours; it felt as if it had dragged on for 3 or 4. It was all I could do to hold back the tears and the vomit as they proceeded to murder one tune after another.As a Beatles fan, I saw "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" when it was released in the theater, and I wasn't very impressed by it at all, but at least it had a great wide cast with well-known, decent performers who did a much better job of singing Beatles songs as they were meant to be sung. Even its totally silly plot line looks like a work of Shakespeare next to "Across the Universe."I have been an IMDb member for several years, yet this is the only review I have on file. What force compelled me to take the time to sit down and write one? Despite all the thousands of other bad movies out there, I simply felt it was my civic duty to specifically warn people just how BAD this one is. I realize it isn't very detailed, but that makes it an ideal representation of the movie itself: NO SUBSTANCE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloody awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie very underwhelming. I just couldn't like it. I just watched it on DVD with my 21 year old daughter and we both just sat there like...what the hell? It seemed promising at the very beginning, but it just didn't go anywhere. It's like someone took a bunch of Beatles song titles, threw them in a hat and then randomly picked a bunch out. Then they sat and said to themselves, " Okay, let's try to make some kinda story to stick in between these songs." Sure, the visuals are stunning. But that's it. The so called plot is paper thin and there's no continuity to it really. And the character! None of them were developed in any way, shape or form. They were one dimensional and I couldn't care one little bit about any of them. The character of Prudence was completely unneeded. She added nothing to the pitiful story. Why was she even there? She disappears without explanation for a while and them just sorta shows up again. It was weird. I did enjoy some of the songs. A few were decent versions. Other songs, however, were just awful. So many of them were slowed down so much it was painful to sit through. I couldn't even be impressed with the dancing, which for the most part, I found awful. This movie seemed to take forever to be over. I'm not even sure why we continued to watch it. Perhaps it was a morbid curiosity to see how the heck the damned thing was going to finally end.I was surprised when I came on this site to see what others thought of Across the Universe. I'd been thinking...surely it's not just me and my daughter who didn't like it. Her friend raved about how great it was when he gave us the DVD to watch. So many people on here loved it. I kept reading and found the ones, who like me, didn't like it. For the most part, it seems that people either loved it or hated it. The ones who were in between seemed to enjoy the music, visuals and dance, but were unimpressed with plot and characters. For me, the visuals weren't enough to make this a good movie. I can't possibly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Across the Universe is a conventional love story linked together by Beatles songs. It's good fun but ultimately a little disappointing. The story provides a cue for a greatest hits compilation. The plot is predictable and the characters, usually named after a famous song, are underwritten. Being set in the psychedelic '60s it almost feels like you are watching an Austen Powers movie. But, if you like the Beatles there is plenty to enjoy. The Vietnam War protests and the hippie sub-culture culture provide much of the backdrop. Jude is a Liverpool dock worker and a brilliant artist who arrives in Princeton to locate his father who served with the American army during World War II. Jude befriends Max, a student from a wealthy family who subsequently drops out of college and is later drafted. Max's beautiful sister Lucy becomes Jude's girlfriend. Max and Jude live in Sadie's loft in New York with Prudence and Lucy. Boy meets girl, boy loses girl but it all ends happily. The film's writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais wrote two classic '70s British sitcoms "Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads" and "Porridge". In both shows the writing was smart and funny and featured a cynical central character. Unfortunately the quality of their writing in this film is simply adequate and the characters are bland stereotypes. The movie is lightweight and far-fetched but there is some great music to keep you entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All you need is love...... sort of.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be nice if all you needed in this world was love to make things work out, but this isn't an ideal world and other things are required (dedication, persistence, perspiration and sacrifice to name a few). About the same could be said of this film. It is more of a musical than a film. It is a filmed musical. Think of Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge, except all the music is from the Beatles.If this film came out sometime in the 70's or 80's, it may have had more relevance. As it stands it is more than 30 years removed from the end of the Vietnam War. The current political situation is obviously paralleled in the film, but in a rather tertiary way. The movie, however, seems to deal more with relationships in the backdrop of that time and one in particular (Lucy and Jude).Jude is a Liverpool welder who travels to American to find his dad. He meets Max, who leads him to Lucy and the rest of the cast through "random" chance. The progression of the story is rather predictable : move to New York, subcultural references, drugs and the psychedelic, the War, anti-War movement, music, break-ups, reconciliations,etc. Throughout all this is the music. All Beatles all the time. There's also some nice cameos by Bono, Joe Cocker, Eddie Izzard, Salma Hayek and even Cousin Brucie.The bottom line is though this film is quite flawed and the characterizations could be called paper thin, this is a stylized love story psychedelic movie musical. It would probably be better if Tommy, Jesus Christ Superstar, Hair and other psychedelic experiences didn't already exist. At the same time this film does not contribute in any way to the third wave of psychedelia. Though heavily derivate, predictable and depthless, I did not hate it, surprisingly. I found it strangely enjoyable. I can't say I recommend this movie to others, especially since a movie like Once (which was highly recommended by so many and made Devin of CHUD cry) I found quite dull, underacted and generally underwhelming. I say if you liked Moulin Rouge and you don't hate the Beatles, then you should give this a try. Maybe all we truly need is more Beatles based films?-Celluloid Rehab</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great music and great film work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you even remotely like The Beatles as a band you should have no problem enjoying this film. Some people think that Beatles music is like Holy Scripture and should not be interpreted in any way shape or form. Those types of snobs won't like this picture. I found the performances of the material great and enjoyed the way the songs were woven into the context of the motion picture. There are some gorgeous computer graphics used tastefully. I also think the film has considerable artistic merit in a film making sense. Now I don't as a general rule like musicals per se, but this was well done and the fact that the music is Beatles music put the movie over the top for me and I enjoyed it thoroughly. As always, your mileage may vary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular display of choreography, music, and art. Not only for musicals lovers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard about the premise of this movie I was very skeptical and didn't have any expectations at all. My ex-girlfriend convinced me to go to the theaters and I decided to give it a shot.I was amazed with the powerful display of choreography, catchy songs (not as good as the original Beatles songs but still), and bright charisma from the lead characters.Since the opening sequence I knew what to expect: a romantic story plagued with quality musical sequences and a bit of humor that wouldn't hurt. Also, the fact that this movie has physically attractive characters is a plus.The Beatles song selection is perfectly chosen and every single song fits perfectly with the movie's tone and scenes. The only problem I got with some scenes was their non-justified use in some songs. I mean, at some parts I wanted the movie to end because it was lasting way too much for what it was. Still, the ending was very satisfying and made me forget about the minimal flaws.A perfect love story with great musical numbers and flawless Art Direction and Cinematography. My advice is, if you are a fan of musicals you will certainly LOVE this movie and will become an instant favorite of yours. And even if you are not a fan of musicals you will have a great time experiencing with this love ride of music.Totally recommended for everyone's tastes. I hope the time will make justice to it and position it among the best musicals ever made. True, Director Amber Tamblyn made this movie oriented for a younger audience but that doesn't means it can't be enjoyed by a wider audience.CAST Evan Rachel Wood is simply amazing in her role as Lucy. She's sexy, smart, classy and has a rebel attitude that will later bring her problems but in the end, "Love" fixes it. She impressed me with her singing skills Jim Sturgess was perfect as Jude, the English artist who wanted to live the American dream. He falls in love with Lucy and later both of them had a torrid romance.Joe Anderson also delivers a fine performance although his skills were better in acting. He has a dead on resemblance to Kurt Cobain! He should play him in a biography.Dana Fuchis as Sadie delivers a sexy and powerful performance. She has a really strong voice that goes according to her character.Martin Luther also delivers a fantastic performance. His voice is really great.T.V. Carpio is just okay as Prudence.Special mention for Bono's supporting actor performance. Finally he delivers a performance without trying to be politically correct. He's great as Dr. Robert and his "I am The Walrus" performance was memorable.Give this movie a chance! It won't disappoint you. Oh and another advice: buy the double soundtrack. Excellent material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ACROSS THE UNIVERSE (Julie Taymor, 2007) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my (many) pet peeves with modern movies is their penchant for including redundant cover versions of classic rock songs by today's would-be superstars so as to make them more palatable to mainstream i.e. teenage audiences too young to remember the originals or those who performed them. Needless to say, I was very sarcastic about the potentially disastrous ? not to mention blasphemous ? idea of making a musical film with the immortal songs of The Beatles (mostly) sung by a group of anonymous young actors. Even if, in hindsight, the film is not without its flaws, I must applaud veteran screenwriters Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais and director Julie Taymor ? not just for their bravery in making this almost impossible task work but because, more often than not, the results are brilliant and occasionally dazzling.To begin with, 33 songs from The Beatles' repertoire are redressed to suit the actors who perform them and the characters they portray are also named after famous Beatles creations: the main protagonists are British dockyard-worker Jude (Jim Sturgess) who goes to America to look for his janitor father whom he has never met; along the way, he makes friends with spoiled rich kid Max (Joe Anderson) and soon falls for his sister Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood); meanwhile, their sluttish landlady Sadie (Dana Fuchs) is silently lusted after by Asian misfit Prudence (T.V. Carpio) but the former has set her own sights on colored guitarist Jo-Jo (Martin Luther McCoy) whom she engages in her own rock band. The narrative takes on some of the most important events in late-1960s American history ? the Civil Rights protests, the Vietnam War, etc. ? as Max is enrolled in the Army, Lucy becomes a political radical, Sadie's band are stopped by the police while playing a rooftop concert (recalling The Beatles' own famous farewell performance!), they all ramble through America in a bus and Prudence joins a traveling circus show... Some of the song numbers are ambitious and inventively realized: it's hard not to love seeing Joe Cocker playing a vagrant in a train station as he twitches himself into the first bars of "Come Together" or having Bono as the eccentric Dr. Robert bursting into "I Am The Walrus" during a psychedelia-tinged party sequence but it's the partly-animated "I Want You (She's So Heavy)" army-recruiting sequence which impresses the most; still, the more pastoral passages like "Because" (sung by the stoned group of friends as they lie carefree on the village green) and Evan Rachel Wood's solo "If I Fell" are quietly remarkable in their own right. However, not every song revisit is a success: circus barker Eddie Izzard's "Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite" is surprisingly dreadful, Sturgess' low-key rendition of "Revolution" is ineffective and, unfortunately, "Happiness Is A Warm Gun" (one of my favorite Beatles album tracks) is marred by some uncalled for choreographic gymnastics! Still as a cinematic collage based on The Beatles' Songbook as performed by other people, it's far more successful than it has a right to be and clearly light years ahead of the notoriously abysmal SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND (1978) and, consequently, essential viewing for long-time Beatles fans of all persuasions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why using the Beatles' mythology?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Across the Universe in not a good movie. In fact is not a movie at all. What I watched was a 2 hours spot about The Beatles, one of the greatest bands in history of rock whose legacy is reduced to a bunch of cheesy pseudo hippies singing their songs. Using Take That's legacy would have been very much appropriate.There is no such thing as story in ATU. The characters were unidimensional, naive and bad acted. At the end of the film I still didn't know whether the movie was about love, politics, music or just colors flowing in the screen. The cameos, the poor recreation of Beatle's mythology and the use of every single cliché about the 60's (Janis Joplin and Hendrix sadly included) reflect the lack of original ideas.The movie is empty and quite painful for real Beatles' fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste of Beatles songs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this film, I'm speechless. In my humblest opinion, it is one of the worst movies ever. Not only the story is unbearable, incredible and bland. It is succession of topics about the sixties, all together in 133 minutes: rock music, the Vietnam war, drugs, youth power, the fight of the rights for black people and so, badly linked together with Beatles songs. But Beatles songs are not the universal glue to stick together a bad plot. The use of some songs may be relevant in some occasions, but of others, not.In addition to all this horror, the main character (would you believe his name's "Jude", like in the song "Hey Jude"?), played by John Sturges, suspiciously resembles Paul McCartney and comes from Liverpool. There's another character who pretends to be an incarnation of the great Jimmy Hendrix. Some other characters have names of Beatles songs characters: there's a Sadie, and a Lucy, and a Prudence, and a Jo-Jo and they all have songs sang to them; The Beatles wrote them: "Sexy Sadie", "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", or "Get Back".What is worse: at the end of the film, the band, lead by Sadie, sings a song in the attic, just like The Beatles did in their last public appearance. This is nearly an insult to every Beatle fan. I highly recommend not to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film making! It's bouncing around in my Top Ten List..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's what I have to say after watching Across The Universe for the first time on DVD tonight...Growing up in the entertainment industry of Los Angeles and coming from a family involved in the entertainment biz and having been involved in the entertainment making process myself in a minor way and having not missed an Academy Awards ceremony in the last 41 years and knowing how movies are made and the intricateness of the film making process and being highly picky and critical of every piece of film editing, lighting, set decoration, set design, art direction, production design, costuming, casting, shot and blocking angles, location backgrounds, special effects times ten, 2nd unit work, dialogue, script writing and screenplay composition, music background and major score, surreal "Pony Boy" Coppola scenes and "Arty" shots, etc... I found the film Across The Universe...A Masterpiece! One of the best movies I've ever experienced and now one of my top 10 movies of all times!...bouncing between 1 and 10 all the while I think about it. Brilliant! Well crafted!... and unique.I've NEVER been a fan of movie "Musicals", although Grease is in my Top 20 list. I've never liked music, singing, and dancing mixed in with a story and dialogue. It's always been cheesy stuff for me. "I love you darling"... break into loud corny song... Sheesh! BUT...For the first time in all my life's film watching, I discovered that Across The Universe was a musical film made to be viewed in a completely different way from my normal assumptions about "Musicals".I had heard all the BUZZ about this movie so I sat down to watch the DVD at home with a new open mind. This "Musical" film set me straight in a very profound way! Some brief viewing notes...I'm suggesting a new category for an Academy Award for Best Location Scout. Watch the backgrounds of the outside scenes! Watch the set decoration and props used very carefully... The interior/studio shots are flawless in their set decoration and layout! Too much to see in one viewing so here's one of many reasons to watch this film again, or ten times more.Watching again will also sort out your feelings from seeing it the first time and all the wonderings it brings up.Don't miss what I call "The Strawberry Statement" references/visuals. Activist people from the late 60's will get this.The several scenes where the songs and themes take off in cinematic surrealism are right out of a Fellini written movie with Picasso directing. Brilliant work! The Benefit of Mister Kite and "I Want You" army scenes are beyond brilliant and are just two of the numerous musical and visually delicious chapters to not avoid, but to repeat again and again.I especially liked the voicing and appearance of Joe Cocker as the homeless man. You'll never recognize U2's Bono if you're not paying attention, even though he has a long and serious role in a masterful psychedelic chapter.... Good stuff Bono! The Beatles music of course is the subtle backbone that cements this movie's story together and I was completely refreshed by the new arrangements and new voices that were presented. When you buy the movie, buy the soundtrack as well! And don't turn the movie off after the final scene or you'll miss out on the little gem at the end of the road. As the credits roll, the bright and vivid visuals and music background are a much watched follow-up that will leave you in the dust with your ending thoughts about this movie.-END-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Beatles Collaboration on Screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will be the first to admit, as a long time fan of the Beatles, I was quite skeptical as to whether or not I would actually enjoy this movie. Considering I often critique any other artists' use of beatles music, as it pretty much isn't worthy unless it is recorded by the fab 4, it is in high esteem to say I enjoyed this. Enjoyed? I adored it. Bravo to you Across the Universe. This music is used beautifully and fits perfectly into the plot. The beatles would be proud of this film in their prime. Their very music was well understood and used to express the full gamut of emotions on screen. Jim Sturgess and Even Rachel Wood come together with amazing chemistry to draw the viewer into their relationship as well. Just another 10/10 aspect to this feature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An incredible show. Everything about it is superb--the directing, casting and production are all spot on. Came upon it by sheer accident. Why haven't we heard more about this dazzling imaginative creation? Such talent deserves recognition. Hope to see more from everyone involved in the future. The vision of the director is way beyond the ordinary. Have watched it twice so far and plan to do so again in the near future. The show brings back so many memories of the Beatles era as well as that of the Vietnam war and combines them in a way that is truly unique. Bono, Joe Cocker and Edie Izzard really put the icing on the cake and the evocations of Janis Joplin and Jimmy Hendrix were an added bonus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply breath taking. At first, I was extremely hesitant to see this movie. I'm not going to lie, I was actually kind of scared. The previews made it seem well, how can I say, aimed at hardcore hippies and drug users. The voice of young Jim Sturgess still rings in my ears throughout the day. Amazing casting for this film, each voice had its own personality that added strength and diversity to the film. Some scenes did make me question a few things, such as the 'field circus' and "I Want You" scene. A very different type of movie, but the music is phenomenal. Almost all of the songs are from the Beatles, but the new day and age technology make them sound a lot better (in my opinion at least).I give this film 9 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife really like this movie. I thought it was horrible. As you read through the comments, you'll notice most people were entertained by the cover songs and the cinematography.I too am still confused as to what this movie was about. It's not that I need a movie with a point - I've watched many without. However I think this movie was supposed to have one. I'm also confused as to whether or not this movie was supposed to be a Broadway show, a drama, a rock opera, a giant music video, a love story, or a comedy. It jumps around so much that just as you get into whatever is going on, it changes into a musical scene that tries to be like "Grease" and fails. Miserably.Admittedly, the singing is why it gets two stars from me, as most of the covers are done well. Otherwise I wouldn't have even bothered to rate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band of the new Millennium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is possibly one of the worst films I've ever seen.First, let me make this perfectly clear. I absolute love the Beatles. They're one of my favorite bands of all time. I'm also a huge movie buff. Now granted that I'm not an actor, nor do I have any ambition of being one, but I'd like to think that I can tell when an acting job is phoned in or when a script is bad, or in the case of this pile of s--t, non-existent.There absolutely is no plot! To me it seems that the writers just threw random Beatles songs and references at the wall and just picked the first thing that stuck. "Ok, a guy named Jude, meets a girl named Lucy, and it's the 60's during a revolution, and Jojo was a man whose guitar gently weeps, and there's this girl named Sadie who's sexy, and she made a fool of everyone..." It's absolutely stupid! The fact that the Beatles or their widows approved of this, not just once but twice, is also a travesty in and of itself. Another huge problem I have with this movie is the gratuitous use of Auto-Tune. If you're up on music production techniques, or at least have a good ear for music, you will be able to tell that the singing voices sound a bit robotic and stiff. Well, that's because not one actor in this movie can really sing. Like all of the other stupid pop stars of today, instead of having talent, like say... The Beatles, they just rely on pitch correction. Also, the singing voice of Sadie is so grating. If they were somehow trying to make that character similar to Janis Joplin, they've failed completely, and have single-handedly ruined any chance of a woman singer with a raspy voice to have a career ever again.And the cameos... Oh god. Everybody who appeared in this film whom I actually like have gone down a notch because of their appearance in this film. Eddie Izzard, whose stand up I thoroughly enjoy, was especially annoying. The random smattering of 60's cliché phrases and sayings into "Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite" was executed terribly. I mean I guess it was meant to be the "acid trip" sequence or something of that nature, but taking hallucinogenic drugs is more than just saying "Turn On, Tune In, &amp; Drop Out" over and over and over again. And Joe Cocker, Bono, and Salma Hayek... WHY?????? How could you have ever thought that this was going to be a good film? Didn't we already learn from the cinematic and critical failure that was "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"? At least the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton are all men enough to disown the film. I haven't seen one person do so for this film, and in my humble opinion, this film makes the "Sgt. Pepper" film look like "Gone With The Wind".And I've had enough with people telling me that I didn't "get it". What is there to get? There is nothing in this film in the way of subtlety or substance. There are no universal truths that I have learned from watching "Sgt. Pepper" or "Across The Universe". People who believe that there is anything to be gained from watching this travesty have incredibly overactive imaginations. This film, just like the "Sgt. Pepper" film, is nothing more than some hacks trying to make a quick buck off of the Beatles' legacy. If you truly love the Beatles, don't see this film. Instead, if you want something 'new' from The Beatles, go out and buy the new mono and stereo remastered albums. You will find truth in the actual Beatles recordings, not from a movie full of half-hearted rehashings of their songs sung by untalented actors. Also, this film has zero re-watch potential, unlike The Beatles recordings, which will give you a whole lifetime of enjoyment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Incarnation of a Song, a Testament of Love Surviving So Much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because this film lingered in my mind because of its brandished originality and progressive contribution to the movie-going experience, I looked through a little bit of history behind the subject matter. As nearly everyone aware of this film knows, it's a musical with a story outlined and directed by a selection of Beatles songs, one of them sharing a title with the movie. In the song, there is a lyric that expresses an overbearing accost of creativity and ideas, "words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup." It came to Lennon after the minuscule matter of hearing his wife talking up a storm. That night, he kept hearing those words over and over and took advantage of the indefinite streak of thought, developing it into something of a song. When he was done, he apparently went to bed and forgot about them and in the morning, he found them and brought them to his piano, where he began to play chords, and find pitches to match the words.This process can be assumed about the way in which this film was made, as its style, spirit, and flow all suggest. The perfect incarnation of a song, an idea very tough to execute but intensely, brilliantly, enthusiastically, very imaginatively, and boldly so by Taymor, and as anarchically as the studio's PG-13 limitations would allow her to. The idea of the premise is something that is hard to imagine sitting down and brainstorming out and rather something that accosts you at any given time, convenient or not, and you can only record what has spilled from your mind at that given moment. The film executes the concept by finding themes, subject, and feelings that match the skeleton that is the outline of all of the songs. One of the most telling keys to the aforementioned is how the story opens with the allegory of an Englishman coming to the US, then proceeding to affect and inspire the lives of a diverse range of Americans he comes into contact with.Perhaps my favorite part of the film is the Hey Jude sequence. To me, what is portrayed is all that that wonderfully uplifting and energizing song can be about, and consequently a imaginative personification of how it can make you feel.The film's story, revolving around the arching transformations of our culture throughout the 1960s seen with the focus upon a group of people who become affiliated with each other and drift in and out of each other's lives like the tempests and flights of fancy that were very much what the Beatles' music was for people's lives in that era, which is the central reason why Taymor's vision is so wonderfully ablaze with the true meaning of the word "brilliant." Not just because the premise sounds unfamiliar compared to what we normally see. To me, a director like her is yearned for in the cinema when it comes to giving tangibly emotional identity to feelings and meanings that are hardly thought to be possible to express in movies. Aside from the uniqueness in the importance of the film's axis concept, an important example is the character of Prudence being depressed because of the impulsive heterosexual attractions of Lucy, played by the stunning Evan Rachel Wood, and Jude, played by the potential rather than kinetic energy of Jim Sturgess, and of Sadie (Fuchs) and Jojo (McCoy) and how much more complicated her own sexuality is and how difficult it is to express it even in a time of such sexual freedom and change, and how painful that must be. It's a small part of the story, just like it was a small part of one's attention during that era.This film goes with its own flow with absolutely no regard for a judgmental view, thus you are forced to go with the flow, take its chances, and accept its rambling taking of license. I admire any film that does so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Julie Taymor's musical or modern Beatles music videos</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Julie Taymor intrigued me with her visceral adaption of Shakespeare's Titus (1999), dazzled me by putting Frida's canvasses to life over Salma Hayek's brilliant performance in Frida (2002), and I was hoping that her keen visual style would make this musical magical. I was hoping for Moulin Rouge! (2001); I was hoping too much.Tying this to Frida, the beautiful Hayek is back (without the unibrow) for a visual feast of a cameo in a well choreographed and edited scene. In fact, as whole, the visual aspects works very well and even if Rodrigo Prieto (one of the best cinematographers of the decade) went on to do bigger and better things after Frida, Bruno Delbonnel, which did Le fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain (2001), is a well-abled replacement. The compositions are artsy, refined, innovative and give life to the movie more than the music or the story. Unfortunately, the main problem of the movie is that beyond that visual prowess, the movie is disjointed and often feels more like a collection of successive music videos-- a sort of more refined typical Bollywood musical. The story is lacking and the adventure is not propelled in the way that say a "Big Fish (2003) was able to while remaining far-out and visually over-the-top. As such, many 'videos' are well-worth the watch ('Strawberry Fields' and 'Let it Be' to name two), but some do not really work like the rooftop finally. Musically, first off, I am not a big Beattles fan so that did not help and I much preferred the music of Rent(2005), which the rebellious mood of the story reminded me of, Chicago (2002) and Dreamgirls (2006). The other problem with using Beatles song is that they do not work as well as songs that were conceived to move the narrative along as in a real musical. Also, when i comes to musical editing there is only one song that has has a strong musical dialogue with another song. Overall, I was very disappointed with the musical aspect in terms of music and lyrics. I don't think that even using Lennon's 'Imagine'-that was not used-could have saved it in my eyes, but Beatles fan may like it more or be even more critical, I'm not sure.Still, quite a few nice directing choices and great execution can be seen. The scene where Sadie and Jojo fight on stage is great, Bono's appearance and the following funkadelic bus ride is interesting, the water sequences and the circle in the grass are memorable... A few breathtaking strokes of Taymor's artistry, but no strong backbone like the tale of Hayek's Frida. Keep at it Taymor, but I hope for a more complete piece next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film of 2007</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though still unreleased in the Netherlands, I was fortunate to see it at a special screening of Oscar nominated movies. This was the only film shown for which the audience actually applauded at the end. Yes, it's that good.Creating a story which encompasses the gamut of '60s era experiences, the film uses 32 Beatles songs to tell its story. At once a moving love story and a stunning exploration of the counter culture emerging in reaction to the Vietnam war, the film grabs from the beginning and doesn't release you until the last credits have rolled off the screen.I saw every major film last year, and was one of the few who thought 2007a weak year. So many of the film released left me both disillusioned and depressed at the state of the world. This one gave me hope....hope not only that the world can actually be a place of beauty, but also hope that film is not a dying art. I was totally engaged throughout the movie, and didn't want it to end.I am amazed that it is already out on DVD in America, and am ordering it today. I rarely buy a movie, but want this for my permanent collection, and want to support director Julie Taymor in her career. This movie is a keeper, and I hope more people see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great tribute to the Beatles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing this movie, I knew very little about it. I knew the soundtrack was comprised of only Beatles song, and that was about it. So I decided to give it a shot, and quickly fell in love with the creativity, and uniqueness this movie offered. For the first musical with an all Beatles soundtrack, this movie paid great justice to the band. The songs were not rearranged, or edited so much that the music becomes hard to recognize; rather each singer sung the song their own style, but kept the flow and rhythm the Beatles originally created.The coolest part about this movie, was the way the plot developed around the songs. For example many of the characters names were taken straight out of the Beatles songs, and then in different situations songs would be used to express emotion, or want. It was one of the most creative movies i have ever seen, and the choreography made it phenomenal. Two scenes in particular were exception, the bowling alley seen has amazing choreography, and the Benefits of Mr. Kite song display the creatively of this film. Overall I quickly appreciated the film for its distinct artistic style, and it was very easy to see how much more artistic it is from other movies.As well as being creative and artistic, the movie is driven by events happening during the era in which the Beatles lived(60s) with events such as the Vietnam war, race riots, and political problems. The movie seemed real in every event, and it was amazing to see what Beatles songs would the situation that was occurring.This movie is a must see, the characters are great, the singing is great, and the overall creativity was amazing to watch. This movie is one that I wanted to go on for a couple more hours, and was sad to see it end. In the end, a great tribute to the Beatles, and a very intriguing movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>without doubt the best movie of 2007!!!!!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>totally captivating and an enthralling experience. the only film to really move me this past year! brilliantly conceived and executed with imagination that is refreshing! it took some stones to come with this structure, re-envision the iconic characters of the 1960 and then to weave the Beatles song catalog into a vibrate narrative. that alone was impressive, but add to the some truly inspired voices and performances and it makes for a grand journey. that said it suffers slightly from the standard musical problem in that the exposition gets redundant when spoken vs. songs scenes are used. for me the musical number were far more engaging, due in no small part the genius of the Beatles. WATCH THIS FILM!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Age of Musicals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since "Dancer In The Dark" I didn't see a musical that touched me so much...In "Across The Universe", Taymor proved that her talent to mix classic songs with great direction is getting better. She developed the Baz Luhrmann's "Moulin Rouge" style of adapting popular songs, with the psychedelic direction of Rafael Fracacio's "Julia's Journal", to improve a new way of making musicals.All that magic feeling of the sixties is combined into this great masterpiece of pop culture, that, in my humble opinion, is the best picture of 2007.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, what a beautiful, beautiful motion picture this is! It didn't even start out that well. An awfully polished version of "Helter Skelter" and then some dancing and I thought this was the "Sgt. Pepper's" movie all over again. Thankfully, though, the movie got better with time. Much better.A great part of it has to do with the fact that the whole thing is built around the immortal music of The Beatles, of course. The weird thing is that none of the versions of the songs done by the actors is really any good all by itself (so DON'T get the soundtrack), but they were enhanced drastically by the beautiful and mind-blowing imagery and the charming story."Across The Universe" tells of the coming of age of a group of flower-power kids. The main storyline concerns a young couple that's torn apart by the Anti-War movement during the 70's. The whole thing is actually told very innocently. There's no explicit sex or excessive violence. The story may be a bit clichéd and not a hundred percent believable (how could it be with people starting to dance and sing all the time?). However, that's not the point, because the movie does bring across the spirit of the time period during which it is set in a fashion that reminded me a lot of "Forrest Gump"."Across The Universe" is very entertaining, appealing to the eye and the ear and it introduces a whole cast of new, talented faces. If there's one beef I have it's that my favorite Beatles song, the one I mentioned in the headline, is not used in the movie. Apart from that I can only recommend all of you - even those of you who don't like Musicals - do go see this brilliant tribute to the Fab Four and the 60's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll say up front that this film will almost certainly go on my list of films to see before you die, only one of two that I allow from each year.Let's get the problems out of the way first. The overall container of this is a date movie. Boy meets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy gets girl back by professing love in a public venue. Its about as tired a formula as there is.The songs are produced by T-Bone Burnett, a sort of reliable movieworld musical handyman. He's probably a nice man who once knew what it meant to have soul, but now he's a factory man. These songs are performed by the actors you see, and while admirable, it further diminishes the power compared to the originals. Also, I saw this in a multicinema, and they tend to turn the speakers down because of leakage into other spaces. So the songs here don't have the power we know they do.Neither does the girl. In other date movies, we are supposed to fall in love a little ourselves, or at least see why she's the object at the center of everything. This actress doesn't have what it takes, and I suppose that's a result of the filmmaker being a woman and openly against objectifying women in this way. So its a bit schizo in that the form the woman chose demands something the woman won't give.The thing gets off to a slow start. Its probably necessary for the strategy for most of the movie, which depends on growing extremes in cinematic fantasy. But you will probably go through what I did, think during the first 25-20 minutes that I had made a great mistake.Additionally, there's some bad history in here. Its probably excusable if you consider it all just a shorthand to indicate context. But if you were there and depending on that real context to enrich your experience, you'll be a bit annoyed.But with those shortcomings (and I'll mention some others), even in spite of them, you'll find this to be one of your deepest cinematic experiences.Taymor isn't quite old enough to have experienced all this first hand. But she and her team do seem to have gotten the tone right. The world was turning against its inhabitants in a way completely unknown. The youth in the US responded in a way that was deeply moral and committed in a way unknown before or sadly since. This truly was the greatest generation. Think of it: we got rid of a lying scoundrel of a president, despite his best use of unconstitutional force!Everything was up for re-examination and reinvention. Sure some of this -- most perhaps -- was stupid, opportunistic and damaging. But the imperative to re-invent wholesale was there, however colored by idealism. And this was led by the Beatles. If it hadn't been in the context of reinvention -- if religion in its old form wasn't part of what was tossed -- then surely these guys would have been the core of a new religion. One of their hangers on actually is.What Taymor is about is a similar reinvention of cinema. She's a risk-taker. She knows her stuff, and she's willing to place it right in that sweet spot between the commercially viable and the imaginatively provocative. Her tools are derived from Japanese and Indonesian masks, outsized intrusions and a notion of space that prefers enveloping. These three combine to create some amazing achievements in stagecraft. That's what this is all about, stagecraft and the yearning of characters to place themselves in context at the same time the filmmaker (and explicit external world forces) set context boundaries, mostly denoted by uniforms.The first of these is the most apparent, the first time you'll see this. There are some absolutely amazing experiences in store for you just on this score. The large and small are manipulated and bent to an extreme I have only seen in small bits of Tarkovsky. She knows how and when to combine this with confinement and openness, and often when she does you'll have play with matters of scale that are unique. And its not just one device, but many, never repeated. Its as if a whole life of imagining what to do were collected in one place.If these were songs by the Mamas and Papas, I'd still be blown away. If it were Robert Stigwood's script maybe even. But those Beatles songs....With "Rubber Soul," the Beatles started their program to actually write songs that collectively built narratives. John and Paul were obsessed with the power of words that aggregate, and some of their projects really do have a narrative coherence similar to what we can read here, but much deeper than a date movie and a sketch of oppression. So in a way, its a weakness of what she's done to mix songs before that commitment (1966) with those done within it. It fights the DNA of what they created. And some of the songs carry immediate narrative. "Sexy Sadie" was about the falsity of religion. Here, Sadie is a redheaded Janis Joplin gal. What?But still, its the stagecraft, and the cosmic placing she's found. See it and have your spatial reasoning ability either broken or enhanced.See it, and either feel bad about your life or empowered to be.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's see--I can't choose less than a 1? I don't understand why this movie was made. It's as if someone who had only the most vague idea what context some really good songs were written in decided to spend money and hire actors to re-literalize them. What an odd, odd impulse. It felt like they--she? whoever made this--had to work--expend energy--to keep this film so thin for three hours. If anyone had let up for even a second, some life might have seeped in. So bravo for that, I guess. Eddie Izzard was good; I can't believe Bono was in it; no one ever had such a simplistic view of any time period--second-graders putting on "Hair" would show more nuance. There, I'm at ten lines. If you ignore my advice, go see it, and understand why it is at all (do I have to play it backwards?), please let me know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe the big screen experience was needed, but I doubt it as I saw this loathsome waste of film on late-night television recently and was aghast. What movie exec. green-lighted this terrible, relentless onslaught of bad musical renditions of Beatle music and the eyesore ramble of images that escorted them? I'd be surprised to learn he/she is still around as the movie has only made back roughly half of its shooting budget as of this writing (going by IMDb's stats). I wouldn't know where to start in criticizing this mess- it's all that bad! And U2's Bono took an ill-advised role that's still leaving me scratching my head. I thought he was a thinking man's artist. All in all, this film makes me pine away for another viewing of 1978's Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and cry out for a remake.</fullReview>

(Who are now my favorite band) This is my favorite musical, and also one of my favorite movies. The music in this movie is absolutely fantastic, i mean obviously is great music because the songs are The Beatles songs. But Also the "Across The Universe" versions of the songs are actually really great. I love how they put The Beatles songs to life in the movie, it's a very beautiful movie.Even though there are music constantly, i feel like it doesn't get as annoying as other musicals. The "music videos" are very well portrayed, and really bring some of the Beatles spirit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie. That said, I think this movie is terrible. The plot is boring and characters are more often than not pointless. What redeems this movie, and makes it a guilty pleasure are the music scenes. They are creatively designed, and the singing is decent. When viewed as a series of unconnected music videos, this is very enjoyable. However, that doesn't make it a good movie. Without any real narrative structure, the set design is really the only shining part of this movie. I would recommend this movie to people who enjoy creativity, and fans of music, but most other people would just find it boring. So, while flawed, I can still enjoy this movie, and hope to see more like it in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are and will always be musical diehards who adamantly oppose these types of musical tributes. Who steadfastly believe in maintaining the integrity and artistry of the original Beatles. Those people are missing out on something quite wonderful (and if they listened to Joe Cocker's rendition of With a Little Help from My Friends they would be quite surprised). Across the Universe is a scrambled story, at times valuing its music ahead of its characters or its narrative, and sometimes suffering from the Glee syndrome. That is the mistake of overstuffing the screen-time with as many relevant titles as possible, or in some cases, not exactly valuing the meaning of the song. Both commit the same error with Blackbird, and there are others that seem unnecessary in ATU and hastily speed up the story; Something and Across the Universe come to mind, and Sturgess and Carpio's character names seem there for that sole purpose. But for every one of these there are three others that seem to perfectly encapsulate what our characters are thinking, and what the period is trying to force onto them. There are a few twists on the Beatles classics. Across the backdrop of towering rusty mills, a football team and cheerleader frolic on a turf that is so perfectly torched yellow it must have been Delbonnel's work in post production. Prudence sings I Want To Hold Your Hand in a wistful way, and the object of affection's gender is flipped, and it becomes tragic. Hold Me Tight switches between two aesthetics - the brightly lit and synchronised dancing of a prom, and the grungy underground den of a dance club in Liverpool. Evan Rachel Wood's version manages to capture that young love and one last night feeling much better than the original could. Julie Taymor brings along her expertise as director of the stage musical The Lion King and ATU doesn't hold back an ounce of its theatricality. I've often referred to this film as an assortment of beautiful music videos, and the costuming, production design and eye-poppingly colourful cinematography from Delbonnel certainly speak for themselves. Bono's I Am the Walrus is run through a psychedelic rainbow filter, there are hauntingly slow underwater ballets, strawberries leak red juice and crimson splashes are superimposed with the Vietnam bombings while Anderson and Sturgess harmonise tightly from afar. There are some audacious stylistic set choices. As Jojo (modelled after Jimi Hendrix) arrives in New York, the city lights turns cold and blue-green, beggars and prostitutes serenade him from the street, neon signs buzz from all directions, and hundreds of corporate suits dance rhythmically while he is left out. The group stumble upon a bizarre travelling circus whose costumes and colours pop out in the countryside background. And Max returning injured from war is subject to a dizzyingly absurd dream sequence where the hospital beds churn like a Round Up amusement ride and identical seductive nurses provide the only relief: painkillers. The narrative is one of love first and foremost, and the revolution of the 60s, the counter-culture, the protest of the Vietnam War, all secondary objectives. Taymor prefers to present this via songs rather than exposition or scenes, which is sometimes rushed due to the amount of them (34 separate musical numbers!) Yes it is a little cheesy, the hippie protest not really taken seriously, and the love story one we've seen before, but it is easy to get swept up in the journey. There are some fantastic little touches that scream Beatles love letter rather than a period piece. One is the upbeat timing on Max's frenzied Jude cry that Paul made iconic, which matches perfectly with the moment he sees his dear old friend again in America. Another is the end of Jeff Beck's A Day in the Life, where we frantically zoom in on Jude's discovery of what he thinks is Lucy's death, and the famous long note which took four pianos explodes with the newspapers scraps to reveal him sitting along on the beach, in mourning. It culminates in a roof-top rendition of the ultimate make love not war song of the 60s. Sure, it's a global message but it's much more important for the lovestruck pair than it is for the political and contextual backdrop. Flaws can be found if you are persistent. The story lines are rather shallow; Max comes and goes and never really ends up anywhere after serving, relationship dynamics see-saw in 213 minutes, it's a little sappy at times...there are other problems that could be pointed out with closer analysis. But Across the Universe is stunning to look at, and easy to sing along with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is not a perfect movie, nor a bad movie. the only thing that takes you in is the music that is already been carved in your brain by beatles. OK, this is the cliché, but what I saw in the movie was different, first I thought it was a rich girl, poor guy movie, and yes it was, however in some point it went off, since there were no family incolved in the movie like usual, and it was never be the case. Secondlu, I thought that it was a 60's war movie, but it was more of a love story than a war movie. It was critising the war in many moments, however, it was doing the same vice versa at the end, so it makes you a little conflicted in your own mind. I think that it was what I liked in the movie, it was including a lot of clichés, however it was worked out in a different way. In anycase, if you like musical movies, and psychodelic theatre, than you must watch the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thirty Covered Beatles' Songs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are no opening credits. A young man, alone at the beach in winter, laments about his lost love as he sings "Girl." Then we see a montage of late 1960s violence in the USA as Dana Fuchs ("Sadie") sings "Helter-Skelter." Next we are at a high school prom, circa 1964, where students dance to the tune of "Hold Me Tight." The boys sport the short haircuts of the time and wear white blazers. Then there is an inter-cut of British teens at what appears to be the 1960s "Cavern" night club singing the same Beatles' lyrics. The English boy (Jude = Jim Sturgess) says goodbye to his girlfriend as he sets sail to America. He wants to meet his biological father. Jude was conceived during World War II when his bio-father was a US soldier stationed in England; the father never knew that his girlfriend became pregnant. Back in the USA, at a high school football practice, an Asian cheerleader, Prudence (T.V. Carpio), sings "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" in the most deadpan manner you will ever see. Prudence grieves as she sings that she wants to be the "man" as she eyes a sexy blonde cheerleader. Yes, Prudence is a lesbian. "Across the Universe" is a simple story really, about young folks in love against the backdrop of the later sixties: the British Invasion aftermath, civil rights, the military draft and induction, Detroit riots, assassination, druggie culture, and hippies. Pretty heroine Lucy Carrigan (Evan Rachel Wood), who has lost her first love in Vietnam, has become radicalized. She spends time in New York's Greenwich Village and has fallen in love with Jude. Before leaving her comfortable home, Lucy reassures her mom that she will be good. Then she sees Sadie (Dana Fuchs), a Janis Joplin-like singer, perform "Why Don't We Do It in the Road?" After that she turns naughty and literally lets her knickers down. Subsequently she joins a radical hippie group that "progresses" from mass demonstration protests to violence to bomb-making. Ah, idealism! Meanwhile Jude finds work designing record album covers (like the psychedelic strawberry). Jude disapproves of Lucy's activist group and there's a rift. Will the former lovers ever reunite? The Beatles did sing "All you need is love," but do you believe that love alone is really enough? Think about that for a minute.The real center of the movie is the Beatle songbook with the majority from the later Beatles; all are covers. Some are done better than others. As previously described, Prudence's performance is oddly sung. In contrast, grubby Joe Cocker, bogged down by age and weight, can still belt out "Come Together" with the best of them and still find time to save a careless pedestrian from being struck by a taxi. U-2 lead Bono's interpretation of "I Am the Walrus" is very well done too. Surprisingly, female lead Evan Rachel Wood's rendition of "If I Fell" is not bad at all. She can sing. By the way, Beatles aficionados know that the movie character names come directly from their songs: Jude, Lucy, Max, Prudence, Mr. Kite, Dr. Robert, etc. Although the actors are competent they are not exceptional. The pop art creation and choreography and sets are done well enough. Check out the businessmen with their look-alike suits, hats, and briefcases (albeit the second one from the right does trip during the song). How about the "Strawberry Fields Forever" and "I Want You" sequences with the coming-alive Uncle Sam posters and induction tirades? On the other hand, the prostitutes singing "Come Together" does not exactly work at all. Unlike most musicals, this one has a song every few minutes that hampers the storyline, which runs far too long for one with just a paper-thin plot. The critics are all over the board on this movie. Dennis Schwartz (Ozus' World Movie Reviews) pans it, and Reelviews' James Berardinelli has only slightly more empathy. Leonard Maltin gives "Across the Universe" 2 ? stars, or OK. On the other hand, Roger Ebert rated it the number seven movie of 2007, and awarded 4 stars. Pick 'em anyway you want, but I find the feature colorful and entertaining, which is all you really need!"I am he as you are he as you are me And we are all together . . ."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun And Enjoyable Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen a whole lot of musicals, but obviously there are many different ways of doing it. Some include the music in a way that makes sense, some just break out into song, some are more fun while others are more serious. I think this movie is more of the fun and enjoyable type, and I like it for that. Sure, it can be cheesy, and you can nit pick little things and roll your eyes when you hear that the characters in this Beatles music themed film are named "Jude" and "Lucy", but if you just let those things slide, there's fun to be had.The film has a lot of unique visual qualities that make it fun to watch, such as the "I've Just Seen A Face" sequence or the "Strawberry Fields" sequence which both are a visual treat. Some sequences are more simple but still work well. The singing is also quite good. It gives a different and unique take on classic Beatles songs, which I enjoy even though i'm not really a big fan of the Beatles (I don't hate them, I just feel like they can be overrated. I understand their musical influence and significance, but still). There's also an interesting historical take in this film. It kind of revolves around the United States during the Vietnam war and a lot of the protests and issues involved in it. It makes for an interesting backdrop and obviously fits the music. Some may find things to disagree with politically within the film, but I personally don't think it forces any views down your throat. It shows how crappy Vietnam was, which is kind of undeniably true. Overall, it's a musical that I could recommend to fans of the Beatles and musical fans. Even people who aren't exactly into musicals can find something to enjoy within this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As probably one of the biggest Beatles fans born in the last 20 years, it is safe to say that I was more than a little excited when I heard about this film. I thought it was an original idea and was interested to see how it would be done.When I watched it I don't know what I was expecting, but it certainly wasn't the end result of this film. Don't get me wrong, you can see from my vote that I liked the film as a whole but I found it quite confusing, not plot but concept-wise. I felt as if I were watching three different films at once. It switched from the cheese and random (unnecessary) dance breaks of 'Mamma Mia' to the gritty, hard hitting emotion of 'Rent' to a seductive, psychedelic LSD trip. I understand that the point of this may have been to represent the different sides of The Beatles' music, however from a film and storyline perspective it didn't work for me. I think some of the moments in the film were phenomenal; the 'Let It Be' scene was so touching and innocent and the beginning was very gritty and intriguing, however, some scenes just did not fit/work within the film. The acting was outstanding, it was very refreshing to see such talented actors/performers doing such a credit to amazing band.Overall, I enjoyed the majority of the film as it captured an essence of The Beatles and what it was like to live in that turbulent time period of change.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Beatles was not music of my youth and I was no hippie (due to much younger age), thus I had no nostalgic feelings about the period - late 1960ies. But I like musicals - in spite of trivial plots - and I welcome when "ordinary" actors perform singing as well. The latter was in place here, but as "real" and good actors like Joe Cocker and Bono were used as well, there was a big voice-related contrast (unlike in Mamma Mia!, for example). The plot was just okay, without sudden twists, and some scenes were aridly constructed based on a song-text, there others had too many hints to psychedelic experiences arising from new drugs. The ending was also anticipated.As the plot involves both Americans and Brits, the inclusion of British actors is logical - and usually their performances tend to excel the American ones. Not here, though: American females (particularly Evan Rachel Wood as Lucy) were much stronger than British males (Jim Sturgess as Jude and Joe Anderson as Max). Luckily, there were several smaller but great performances (Dana Fuchs as Sadie, Eddie Izzard as Mr. Kite - to name a few).Therefore, Across the Universe is not bad, but I find Les Miserables or even Mamma Mia! more interesting and smooth.</fullReview>

The songs fit seamlessly into the plot and the music scenes don't seem contrived at all. The director and scriptwriter even went to the effort of weaving other Beatles references into the story, eg the characters generally have names taken from Beatles songs, and some scenes are meant to remind us of Beatles events (eg band performing on a roof). Very clever, and doesn't detract from the movie at all.The story itself is quite moving, the acting good, the direction great, the singing by the (mostly) actors surprisingly very good, but it is the music, and its perfect placement in the movie, that makes the movie.

The film here is full of flaws I normally bag in other films: it is cloying, all the sentiments are blunt, it's awash with clichés about love, some of the Beatles covers are too glossy and musical-y, the whole film feels like one long videoclip reel, and you just know that when a pimp and his whores chime in on a rendition of Come Together that the representation of New York in the throes of Vietnam is way too clean.It is far too long. Not all of the numbers were worth keeping. I think Taymor and her crew were too attached to the whole thing, and worked hard on it, that they couldn't see that leaving some pieces off would benefit the whole letting it breathe. I Am the Walrus and the circus number one after the other were overkill, and it never quite recovers after that point.And yet what cinematic voluptuousness and personality on display! Taymor must be one hell of a woman. Tumultuous, visual, feisty. I think the distinction worth making here is that yes it is superficial, the essence of the intuition that love matters is never anything less than glaringly obvious, you never have to dive in to find anything, you are never surprised. And yet the cinematic intuition of the essence is evenhanded and honest, done in a completely open and soulful way. The cinematic parts are not new: Bob Fosse, Dennis Potter, Kusturica. But it has such wonderful passion in the weaving of the material. This is visual imagination worth getting excited about.Overall, it feels for me like being close to a very vibrant person, she isn't saying deep things in the conventional sense, she isn't making us examine self, but her every inflection of speech, playful turn of the head and laughter are so infectious and hearty you just appreciate the personality itself, how it is, no less than saying deep things, a matter of intelligent disposition. You wouldn't perhaps want to be around her 24/7, but you're never less than glad to have her in your life.Get to know her folks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Musical challenging your perception and taking you into an interesting journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Musicals are always catchy. They just get you into this weird world where everybody sings their deepest thoughts. Of course, there are people who say that musicals are just about love, they are not interesting and all they can offer is a good soundtrack. I respectfully disagree.This movie is a masterpiece. It shows the essence of 70s, of how the world was changing and how people were forced to change together. It is the middle of Vietnam war. People are tired of fighting. But still - there's a war. Young people are forced into recruits (if they don't volunteer). But overall I believe it shows how people are fighting their battles - either by facing them or going around. But it's more than that - it'a how they are living their lives - you could think that they have absolutely no fear as some just dive in without even thinking.Of course, the main thing is love. All you need is love how Beatles say. It shows how powerful, how uniting it is. How it even can cross the ocean and what keeps it going.This movie is also about fantasy and imagination. It just shows how person's mind is working. When Max is going to the army, he sees Uncle Sam as a frightening person and all the soldiers as the same person multiplied.Last thing - if you ever thought that Beatles have songs just about love - this movie is a must. The soundtrack is just breathtaking and mind-blowing when you realize it's not even all of the Beatles songs.All in all, this movie is a masterpiece with wonderful music concentrating on a love story and including fantasy and imagination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, But Thoroughly Enjoyable; all Thanks to the Magic of The Beatles!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you grew you up listening to and loving Beatles' songs, you're not to miss this movie musical. Though the movie lacks enough story or depth, the brilliantly choreographed renditions of the Beatles songs against well-shot landscapes and set-pieces are enough to mesmerize you; the songs itself have such power and meaning that when they're sung in relevance with the story have a terrific impact.To be honest, its badly-structured minuscule plot is quite a distraction, but ultimately, you end up loving the movie just due to the power and essence of The Beatles.Stephen Holden from the New York Times describes the movie aptly, "I realized that falling in love with a movie is like falling in love with another person. Imperfections, however glaring, become endearing quirks once you've tumbled." So, it ultimately depends on the person whether the flaws of the movie matter or not. If you don't let them bother you, you can sit back and sing along and get lost in the trance of 60's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Use of Visual Metaphors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often, when we see a movie set in the Vietnam era, the directors and writers get lost in the atrocities of napalm and warfare. The directors of Across the Universe have imagined to illustrate the evils of war and radicalism without becoming enamored with it. Rather, these are backdrops to show us the true cost of war--the human conflicts. With visual metaphors that spend every minute showing us the human costs of war rather than telling us, this film borders on poetry rather than a movie. The balance of dramatic writing seen generally in stage productions was made much more poignant by the visual effects only possible on film. Some may wonder why I did not give the movie a 10. I was mildly disappointed by the Liverpool artist's singing or emotional output in his studio. Also, the movie focused so much on visual story telling that the plot lagged behind, especially between the Sade and her guitarist. I also never give movies a 10 unless they change my life. This was an excellent movie, but it did not change my life. Therefore, a 9.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thoroughly entertaining portrayal of 60's culture in America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, this film is NOT about The Beatles, so if that's what you're looking for look elsewhere. It is about the social/political events and structures in 1960's America regarding the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights Movement which are shown through The Beatles music. Overall I considered it thoroughly entertaining and informative. The music lifted what can be a 'heavy' subject as did the multiple romances within the film. It explored the Hippie Culture, political activists and most of the major issues of the 60's. Overall very well directed and usually straight to the point, never overly long winded. The acting was very natural, I can only think of one account that it could be described as 'wooden'. I have to give a 'shout out' to Jim Sturgess for the Character of Jude. He captured his romantic yet daring and deeply troubled personality astonishingly. Also Dana Fuchs singing gave a hole new edge to each song she took on, she was truly a pleasure to listen too.If you have an appreciation for The Beatles, know abit about the Civil Right's movement and Vietnam and also have an appreciation for history I would strongly recommend this film to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first ever review on IMDb but I had to share my sheer exhilaration after watching Across the Universe! I wasn't sure what to expect of this film but absolutely loved it! The way the music was structured into the scenes was seamless and made it feel as if the Beatles wrote their music to go with a musical like this. The meaningful true to life story around the Vietnam war and the protests in the US set in the amazing era of the 60s blew me away. And there were so many phenomenal voices from known and unknown actors. I especially loved the last scene and thought it was the perfect ending to such an epic film. The fact that Paul McCartney and Ringo Star enjoyed the film so much is credit to how well this musical has been put together. I have just spent the last hour, since I finished watching it, researching the film further and finding so many hidden lyrics from Beatles music just adds to the personality of the film. Across the Universe is the best musical since Chicago in my opinion and well worth a watch, even just to sing along!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Dazzling Intervals With The Fab Four; Mediocre Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Julie Taymor's name on the film, one expects an imaginative and colorfully individual treatment, and the Beatles songs provide just that--ranging from tender to trippy, and sometimes even to bizarre; the musical sections of this film are often an unmitigated delight, especially to anyone who grew up with The Beatles--rather refreshing to see how each familiar song is dovetailed into the plot--which, sadly, is the weak point of the film, an all-too-familiar rehash of the musical Hair in many ways, but without Hair's cutting-edge satire. One can see how the scriptwriters thought that transporting an English lad named Jude to the U.S. during the Vietnam conflict and having him meet Lucy, might make for an amusing meet-cute narrative, but in contrast to what's been done with the songs, the plot is far too predictable and unsurprising. Still, a sweet film in many ways, well worth watching as a collection of fascinating MTV-style videos</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Visual And Musical Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Across the Universe is a musical romantic drama film directed by Julie Taymor, produced by Revolution Studios, and distributed by Columbia Pictures.It stars Evan Rachel Wood, Jim Sturgess, Joe Anderson and T. V. Carpio, and introduces Dana Fuchs and Martin Luther McCoy as actors. Cameo appearances are made by Bono, Eddie Izzard, Joe Cocker, Salma Hayek amongst others.The film's plot is centered around songs by The Beatles. The script is based on an original story credited to Taymor, Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. It incorporates 34 compositions originally written by members of The Beatles.Set against the anti-war protests, rock &amp; roll revolution, and mind- expanding psychedelia of the 1960s,the hallucinogenic musical follows the arduous journey of star-crossed lovers Jude (Sturgess) and Lucy (Wood) as they and a small group of musicians are swept up in the raging waters of the volatile counterculture movement. Guided through their journey by a pair known only as Dr. Robert and Mr. Kite, Jude and Lucy are eventually forced to find their way back to one another after being split apart by powerful forces beyond their control.The film tries to tell a story of young love and 1960s war protest accompanied by the Lennon-McCartney catalog.Although the movie does great justice in the Beatles music,it fails miserably in telling the audience a great story and setting its point across due to excessive visuals.But nevertheless,anyone who isn't even a Beatles fan would great enjoy this movie and appreciate their music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beatles Song Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well movie lovers, Having lived during that era in New York &amp; attending places like shown in film, I was a bit disappointed. Someone didn't do there homework very well. The re-creation of the era was weak to poor! Environment off base, people off base too, sanitized. Music even off base. The interiors of the Fillmore East were wrong, totally. Sad view of the place. The only thing that looked correct, kind ?a was the sign, half right. In the 1960's mid to late, there were 2 to 3 cops on most corners in the east village, lots of grime. Heads, playing guitar in the park, drugs on every street. Head shops on downstairs levels on St. Marks Place. You could smell the pot inside the Fillmore. People having sex on the stairways at the Fillmore. Where was the director during the 60's?? I could go on &amp; on about the feel not being right in film.It was overall entertaining, with music and colorful scenery changes. The bus ride to upstate NY was fun to watch. As were some of the city scape. If you weren't there you might enjoy this film. Worth viewing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprise: Great in 3-D!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came of age in the '60s, so this really hit home for me. To those who resented it for its strongly theatrical treatment of the Beatles era, I suggest you'd probably have a hard time with anyone else's take on those decades except your own -- still too personal, maybe. But it's not meant to be a documentary. For me,this film advanced that reality into a mythical realm, making of it a parable; so historical license is forgivable here, if the experience for the viewer gets the essence right. Personally, I'm ready to accept that time in my life being transmuted into its cultural gifts, so I loved this one in the theaters, then on DVD ... and (after I got a 3-D HDTV) on Blu-Ray. And that was in itself a revelation. Of course, the film isn't in actual 3-D, but my Panasonic rig has a "2D-to-3D" setting which I'd not tried out much 'til now; and I have to credit the technology sector -- the result, while not flawless, is pretty impressive and totally watchable. And I was especially glad that I tried it out on Across the Universe. The faux addition of depth really enhanced this film's imagery, and enabled me to appreciate its complex, fast-moving visuals more thoroughly as layers of content got spatially sorted out for me. I saw distinctions in 3-D I'd never noticed while watching it in 2-D, even in the psychedelically colorized scenes. Considering how many scenes in it were deliberately composed with a strong eye for foreground/background interplays, and stunningly deep perspectives, this film should have been shot in 3-D (were it made today, I've no doubt it would be). I totally recommend to anyone else out there who has access to a 3-D setup, try this out -- the "long strange trip" expands your consciousness yet again, and no chemicals are needed -- just a little help from 21st-century technology. (Across the Universe is my new #1 reason I'm glad I sprang for at-home 3-D.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, no, it's not a perfect movie, not by a long stretch... but y'know, looking at it again after two years, it ain't half bad.Let's the negatives out of the way first. Eddy Izzard is downright awful, apparently ad libbing his way through Mr. Kite ? and doing a rather shoddy job of it, especially after one has to watch the two previous takes in the extras section of the DVD. Some of the messages are layered on with a one-ton version of Maxwell's silver hammer, like any of the riot scenes. The cinematography gets a bit precious at times, with some pretty dreadful filtering work that, I gather, is supposed to look like "oh man, a trip!!"Okay, that's the worst of it. Everything else? Not bad, actually. The performances are all great fun to watch, from the Janis Joplin earth mother, who seems, for a time, the core of the film's second act, to the crazy Princeton boy who winds up in Vietnam (via a fascinating production number that underlines the army's essential homoerotica with a bright, bright red line). The two leads are especially charming, if a bit thin, and the little lesbian Prue really deserved more screen time. Perhaps in Taymor's uncut version she got it.The covers of all the songs we know so well are performed pretty darn well: one converts a love song into an on-stage spat between "Janis" and her guitarist, who bears a singular resemblance to Jimi Hendrix. They intertwine with the plot as well as the four (maybe five?) story lines themselves knit together.Visually, it's stunning, with Bread and Roses puppets and walls transformed into clouds and a singularly beautiful scene right at the outset. Taymor definitely carried her stage director's eye into this project, and it served the material well.Again, not a perfect movie. Close, but not quite ? and so far from it that I had to rescind on that final star. But an enjoyable read of the Beatles' catalogue coupled with a lovely little love story ? you cant ask for much more than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If You Like The Beatles, Beautiful Visuals, Musicals, or Love Stories, Then This Is A Movie You Must See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Across the Universe" is a film I had heard of for years, but had never taken the time to sit down and watch. I knew it was a rock opera with Beatles songs, that it was a love story, and that I heard nothing bad about it. But after about three years of being in limbo on how this movie was, I decided to finally sit down and give it a watch. And I wish I had done so sooner."Across the Universe" is about Jude, a young man from Liverpool who decides to go to America to find his father. While what he finds is a disappointment, he meets his friend Max and his sister, Lucy, who Jude falls in love with. The three of them move to New York, where they meet Prudence, Satie, and JoJo, and soon they are all swept up in the 1960's world of music, war, and love. You could possibly look at this film and completely label it a hippy throwback, but while you're watching it, the word hippy never comes to mind. It's more of a story of a group of people's self-discovery and the hardships they go through.There are no big-name actors in this film, at all. It's all unknowns. I love it when big films give young actors a chance to shine, and with this film, it'll probably be the roles they're all remembered for. Jim Sturgess plays Jude. He looks like he came right out of 1960's England. If you could go back in time and put him into the Beatles, you wouldn't know a difference at all. He was the perfect person to play Jude. Not just for looks, but for his performance too. He's instantly likable, you just look at him and grin because you probably know a guy exactly like him.Evan Rachel Wood plays Lucy. She gives a good performance, and Lucy's a likable character. She's obviously a polar opposite to Jude, so it gives them a good character dynamic, but honestly, the exact same kind of dynamic was in "Grease", so it gives it a bit of a recycled feel, especially for a musical.Visually, this film will trip you out to no end. In several of the musical numbers, you'll just be wondering, "who the hell just turned the psychedelic switch to 11"? It'll be a perfectly normal scene, and then it's like you just dived head first into an acid trip. Some of the scenes are disturbing and a bit off putting, like "I Want You (She's So Heavy)", but there are others that are really beautiful like "Dear Prudence". It's a mixed bag, but you can't deny, it's a gorgeous film to look at.The songs in this film are all used to perfect effect. You'll realize it later, because you won't be able to listen to the Beatles afterwards and not think of the scenes in the film that go along with the film. Now usually, I'm completely against covers in films, but several of the songs used in the film I think are better in certain ways. "Something" is the one I think is probably used to the best effect. It seems like the song is sung in the exact situation the Beatles imagined when they wrote the song. It works so beautifully, that you might find that the original version doesn't work as good if you visualize it being played to the scene.The other musical numbers that really stand out to me in this movie are "With A Little Help from My Friends", "Hey Jude", and "All You Need is Love", which epitomizes everything the film builds up towards. Don't be surprised to find yourself singing along to these songs. Throughout the film, you've grown to love these characters, and these songs lift you up and warm your heart in a way that not a lot of films these days can do.In conclusion, "Across the Universe" is a great film. It seems the team behind this film were able to find a story that after viewing this film, you feel like it wasn't forced, but more like it was there all along. And now that you've seen it unfold, you'll never be able to forget it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Tribute to an Iconic Band</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Beatles were a cultural phenomenon whose influence and unrelenting presence has hardly been matched by any other artist since the band originally hit the scene in the early years of the '60s. At this rate, I'm surprised we haven't gotten a good biopic about the bands origins and their eventual parting (though NOWHERE BOY was a good glimpse into the formative years of John Lennon) but at least we've been given a well-done musical utilizing some of the Beatles most memorable music. For the curious, yes this is a full-blown musical. The filmmakers have even stated that there is probably little more than thirty minutes of actual dialogue and storytelling in the entire two-hour movie. The majority of the story in this film is woven from the Beatles songs and how they fit to portray the lives of a group of friends living in New York City in the '60s. The characters are an eclectic group of free-spirits caught up in the drama that raged across the country in that turbulent decade: the Civil Rights movement and its ensuing riots, the Vietnam War and the protests that flooded the streets against it, and the introduction of psychedelics and hippie counter-culture. And just to be sure that everyone is 100% aware that the movie is paying homage to the Beatles, the screenwriters saw fit to name just about every character after a Beatles' song: (Hey) Jude, Lucy (in the Sky with Diamonds), (Dear) Prudence, (Sexy) Sadie, etc. Because, you know?Beatles!I'm a Beatles fan and I never tire of their music, so this movie is an interesting experience for me. It's essentially a two-hour long greatest hits collection strung together into one giant music video with some semblance of a story woven inside. Director Julie Taymor and the screenwriters did a great job creating a story from the lyrics of the Beatles music. The majority of the movie is expressed in song and it comes together great. Many of the band's most popular songs are brought to life and used in wonderfully creative fashion. Some highlights include "I Want to Hold Your Hand" as young Prudence pines over a fellow cheerleader, subtly introducing how her character feels out of place in her small town because of her unspoken homosexual feelings, "I Want You (She's So Heavy)" when Max arrives for his appointment in the Vietnam war draft and patriotism comes alive to feed Max into it's war machine, and "All You Need is Love" as the pitch-perfect ending with a nod to the Beatles' 1969 rooftop performance on the Apple Corps building. They've even found a way to work "I am the Walrus" into the mix in what is easily my favorite part of the whole movie, as the friends experience their first psychedelic trip with Dr. Robert (another song reference), a man resembling Ken Kesey and complete with his own spiked punch, psychedelic school bus, and band of Merry Pranksters. For any of those uninitiated to the Beatles, this movie makes an excellent introduction.The movie is a great experience but I have to admit it's a bit of an endurance test at times. At little more than two hours, this movie feels overly long and could've used a few more cuts to bring it down to a shorter runtime. That's not to say that the movie wastes our time at any point, as every musical sequence is used with purpose. It's jut a lot to sit through and goes on long after I became impatient for some closure and the end credits. Its seemingly exhaustive runtime is probably my only complaint in a movie that pays great respect to the Beatles and their music. The movie is visually beautiful and every musical number is perfectly choreographed and blended with bits of special effects for an other-worldly effect to the music. The cast, primarily a bunch of then-unknowns, are perfect for their roles. They each perform their own songs and I felt they were amazing covers of the beloved songs. Jim Sturgess, Evan Rachel Wood, Joe Anderson, Dana Fuchs, Martin Luther, and TV Carpio deserve a lot of credit for excellent vocal performances. Thrown into the mix are also a series of awesome cameos for particular performances including Bono (for "I am the Walrus"), Joe Cocker (for "Come Together"), and Eddie Izzard (for "For the Benefit of Mr. Kite"). There is a lot for Beatles fans to love about this movie and I hope new generations discover this movie as a means of introduction to one of the most influential bands of our cultural history.</fullReview>

I got the movie as soon as it came out, and I was in LOVE with it. I actually love it so much, the first time I saw it, I watched it 2 times back to back!!

I love Joe Cocker's rendition of "Come Together", he really did justice to that song, and that whole scene is just a feast to the eyes. This movie had great actors and all of the actors sing very well. If you are a fan of the Beatles, ignore the bad reviews and watch this movie, I'm sure you'll love it.

		<fullReview>Despite some serious flaws, I gave this movie ten stars because the best scenes (and there are many) are the most exciting musical scenes in the 80+ year history of sound movies. A few of the most memorable examples are listed below.The intro: Jim Sturgess singing "Girl" straight into the camera, inviting us into this strange and haunting movie, and much later singing the beautiful title song in a crowded subway car.Joe Anderson singing "Happiness Is a Warm Gun" as a bedridden patient in a veterans' hospital, in the most brilliantly choreographed and produced musical scene ever filmed.Sturgess singing a joyous, exhilarating "I've Just Seen a Face" - in a bowling alley, of all places - in the second most brilliantly choreographed and produced musical scene ever filmed.Sturgess, Anderson, and a handful of playful Princeton frat brothers singing "With a Little Help from My Friends" as they tumble and leap like gazelles over the furniture, through a crowded bar, across a rooftop, down a huge marble staircase and out into the quad, in the THIRD most brilliant... etc.Joe Cocker (thank God he's still around!) singing "Come Together" as Lennon must have dreamed it could be sung: sleazy and gutsy and oiling its way under your skin, as he growls in time to the languid windshield wipers of a bus, then appears as a panhandler in a bathrobe in the bus terminal, then as a Times Square pimp driving a mile-long white 1959 Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz convertible; then the scene slides into 27 seconds of the most astonishing movie choreography ever: hundreds of dancers on a sunlit midtown sidewalk; and it finishes in the Village with Cocker again, this time as an aged hippie with long Stephen Stills blond hair. Wow.As I said, there are many great scenes; those are just the cream of the cream. BUT (and unfortunately this is a BIG but) the so-bad-you-want-to-strangle-somebody scenes abound too; fortunately, they are easy to skip over. ANYTIME you see either Eddie Izzard or Bono anywhere on screen (and you quickly learn which scenes they are in), skip to the next scene on the DVD. I don't know how to say how bad those two are - except that they are as bad as Cocker is good - and their scenes add nothing to the movie.The many great scenes make watching this movie pure delight; just keep your thumb on the remote and your eye peeled for Bono and Izzard.(PS: I never liked The Beatles until I saw this movie.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stellar performance from Julie Taymor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another star performance from Julie Taymor. It helps if you like the Beatles, since "Across the Universe" is a story connected by Beatles songs performed by the various actors, with cameos from the likes of Joe Cocker, Bono, and Eddie Izzard. Taymor is a fantastic director, and she gets fantastic performances from her cast and crew.And then there's The Beatles. I've seen and heard their songs covered by artists for lo these 40 or 50 years, and it's amazing how much can be gotten from their words and music. Taymor and her performers wring The Beatles dry in several of the sets. Pairing a dead white Vietnam vet with a Detroit ghetto kid with background vocals by a black choir was inspired. And Taymor gives us the best visualization of American foreign policy I've ever seen.Not everything worked for me, but what didn't work for me may well work for you. It's over two hours, so be prepared for a break or two, but it never dragged for me. Taymor is inspired, and she got a cast and crew that was inspired as well. Great effects, great choreography, great lighting, great performances. Be aware that the cast does not imitate The Beatles, they sing the songs within the context of what's going on in the movie. This leads to some interesting differences in what you thought the songs were about. And never fear: the songs stand up to it. The Beatles were that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beatles Music Sung Again by Young Voices</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been a huge fan of the Beatles music, ever since I first heard them on English Pirate Radio while I was living in France as an Air Force Brat dependent. There was something so fresh and true to that sound. "I Want To Hold Your Hand" still brings a thrill to me.I loved the artistry in which the all the musical productions of the Beatles tunes was carried off. The "I Want to Hold Your Hand" sequence especially caught that juvenile exuberance but in a sweeter more modest pace than the infectious but crammed to fit the radio cut length of the time.They took some chances with some of the interpretations, but, nearly all were entertaining to watch, while the music was always superb.The only caveat with this movie is it is almost 3 hours long. They choose to space out the tunes enough with story so as not be total onslaught of music. Set aside an afternoon or evening to savor this.There are tons of little details in the background that are full of Beatles trivia. I usually don't buy movies to own, but this one is a keeper as it bears multiple viewings.Watch for Joe Cocker and Selma Hayek in cameos.Highly recommended. All you need is your own central nervous system to fully experience this beautiful trip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brush up on your history and sing along</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Across the Universe is an exciting and colorful musical. This movie can easily be enjoyed by those who usually are not a fan of that type of movie. If you like the Beatles you will be singing along in no time. Taking place in New York City in the 60's, we follow the main characters Lucy played by Evan Rachel Wood and Jude played by Jim Sturgess as their love develops during these troubled times. Lucy comes to stay with Jude and her older brother Max, who is Jude's best friend, after her boyfriend is killed in the Vietnam war. Jude is from Liverpool, England and came to the United States to find his father. He meets Max and they are instantly buds and move to NYC together for an adventure. Using Beatles' music to move the plot along, you will instantly fall in love with all the characters each cleverly named after a Beatles song.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a lot to like in this film--the story, the music, the actors--the overall concept and execution is well done. It is just too long, however. Twenty minutes could have been cut from the film with no ill effect. As it is, it drags considerably about three-quarters of the way through, and some scenes and songs simply go on too long for their own good.That said, Across the Universe is a lot of fun. Even die-hard Beatles fans will enjoy the new arrangements of their songs, and if nothing else the movie demonstrates the staying power of the incredible Beatles music and its ability to be applied in new and interesting ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See this movie with your heart and not with your brain.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel very sorry for the people that gave this movie low scores and wrote bad reviews. My advice to them is that they should try to see life also with their heart and not only with the brain. The heart is what makes us human not the brain. A movie does not need to be "historicaly accurate", or perfectly narrated, or with a perfect script or music. It has to touch you inside, and touch me it did. Yea, the music is not Beatles original, is sung by the actors, but they do a pretty decent job and i enjoyed some of the changed parts of the music. There are different interpretations sung by the actors which are not so bad. In fact it's pretty awesome the way they sing as they are mostly unknown actors. No, I wasn't there to witness those times, and probably it wouldn't matter anyway because what most people here do not understand is that this is not a documentary, it is an interpretation of a historical time and events seen from director's point of view. This is his version of the reality, and it really does not matter if it was like this or not. I bet there are lots of Beatles or Vietnam documentaries out there for you to watch, but they're not touching any spot, they just present facts. So go see them if that's what you really want. In fact the interesting fact is that most reviews are marks 1-2 or 9-10. So this movie clearly is a "love it/hate it" type. Therefore if you do not like the first 10 minutes of the movie you probably will hate it entirely. I did saw some good resemblance with Forrest Gump in this movie. However the perspective is changed and this is good, or else it would've been just another re-edit of a great movie made bad. I am an architect and an artist inside, so i have appreciated very much the retro style, the crazy colors, the madness and cartoonish style mixed with dancing singing etc. I'd say that it's crazy but it is not. In fact for me it made a lot of sense and a needed change of style as today's movies tend to be all the same.A 9 from me, because i felt I should raise a bit the unfair scores from the other users. In my opinion this movie is worth a decent 6,5 or even 7, and that is because at some parts it loses focus and has some unnecessary parts just for the music's sake. Also, it is very predictable, but that is less important as this is not really an action movie. For me it felt more like a collection of music videos binded together by a story which in this context is less important. Cheers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect for a Home Theater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished installing a home theater. In particular I have an projector that casts a 13 foot wide image (older 720 model). Many friends have been over to see the installation and Across the Universe is the perfect movie to demo both the audio and video. Everyone loves the Beatles and the creativity of the visuals is exceptional. Instead of just watching a song or two, everyone winds up hanging for far longer then planned to watch song after song. It did take a few weeks before I finally found the time to actually watch the movie from start to finish, and it was surprisingly good. Perhaps the biggest surprise was that the move never seemed to have gotten the recognition that it deserves. I think only one person who came over had seen or heard of the movie!! Okay, okay the plots can be thin at points, but that is not what the movie is about, its basically a series of exceptional movie videos strung together with weak plot. Put your expectation in the right place and you will not be disappointed. If you are straight the movie is a 9 of 10, if you are under the influence it is a 15. Spread the work, this movie deserves much more recognition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard of this movie from a friend who like me is a huge beatles fan. He recommended it so I looked up the commercial. It looked like it would be an interesting portrayal of the beatles music so i rented it and carried my hopes high. The movie began strong with impressive performances from the cast. The film was very character driven as it chronicles through the war and it's impacts on the people around. It was a very entertaining movie with great performances. Now to the flaws. The flaws with the film was the fact that it left many plot holes and different things unanswered. My main problem with the film was the continuous random characters popping into the story and not even staying in but for about a minute or two. Though it has flaws I recommend it to anyone who wants a good musical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insincere shambles with some good bits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Across The Universe at my friend Steve's house last night. While there were elements I quite liked, there was a lot - an AWFUL lot - which I didn't.Taking the music first, it was interesting to see that what was presented was a mixture of note-for-note remakes and wildly different reinterpretations, and in both cases, some worked and some didn't (I thought Bono sang Walrus well, for instance, but I simply can't take those lyrics in anyone's voice other than John's). I thought all the principals sang well.Turning to the rest of the movie, it was a shambles. There was nothing wrong with the basic story (by which I mean the love story between Jude and Lucy), but it was decked out with characters and thread elements which went nowhere - Prudence, for instance, a character with no narrative value whatsoever other than to enable two non-plot relevant songs, and Jude's Dad, an interesting plot thread which rapidly became a dead end. The end result rambled, of necessity, what with being loaded down with irrelevancies.And the incessant naming of characters from Beatles songs became trite - around the 40 minutes mark I started wondering when we were going to meet Rita and Eleanor and Pam and Bungalow Bill... Not to mention the endless quotes - "How did she get here?" "Oh, she came in through the bathroom window." I would have welcomed, "Oh, she climbed in off the fire escape." Above everything, I was irritated at how damn American the whole thing was. Notwithstanding one of the main characters being Liverpudlian, and notwithstanding The Beatles reflecting their times (including the enormous global influence of the USA), they were an English group, and I felt queasy at their music being used to illuminate the USA's internal upheavals over Vietnam, not to mention dysfunctional yuppie family life (Thanksgiving? Not very Beatle-y, if you don't mind my saying). Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais deserve a clip round the ear for the screenplay - try Still Crazy for a noticeably better film from them in the world of rock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting and unique, but a little too much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After my friend just couldn't shut up about how great Across the Universe was, he just kept begging me to sit down and watch it, so I finally did. We are both Beatle fans, so I think that's why he went so crazy over it, however, I wasn't so thrilled. While this movie is very creative at taking such classic songs by the Beatles and turning it into an entire story, I felt like this film was a little over the top and wasn't exaclty well put together. I was disappointed on a few things: the story wasn't that original, the Vietnam War story has been done too many times to the point where I was able to predict the story. Second: the songs, I absolutely love the Beatles, but the some of the songs felt like the director just pushed them in at last minute because he had too. Third: the characters don't have and depth and don't really do too much for the story.Jude has come to America from Liverpool, England to see his real father, he succeeds, but both of them know it's not the right time to get to know each other. But Jude decides to stay, he meets a college student, Max, they instantly become friends. Jude meets Lucy, Max's sister, they instantly fall in love. But the Vietnam War is tearing them apart when Max is sent to fight in battle; a few friends of their's stick together and try to bring the war down and make a difference. Lucy goes so far in the peace fight that it starts to pull apart her relationship with Jude and sends him back to England when caught in the middle of a riot. But Jude wants to fight to get Lucy back through the power of song, because all you really need is love.Across the Universe is a decent film, I would never deny that it was unique and interesting to watch, but I just wasn't too moved with this film. In some strange way it reminded me of Forrest Gump, with the girl who is in the peace fight and the man who is finding himself, also the music too I think. The actors were good, but I felt like this was just a waste of their talents, I mean acting wise, their singing was fantastic, but Across the Universe just didn't do anything for me. I know there are a lot of people who are going to disagree with me on this comment, a lot of users loved this movie, but I just didn't get into it, so I suppose this is a movie that you will have to judge for yourself, but I wouldn't really recommend it if you've seen a lot of Vietnam War movies.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Rent" Meets "Mama Mia"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give an E for Effort to Julie Taymore, but the problem is she didn't know when to quit. The movie veers from the sublime to the soporific, bogged down by a banal boy-meets-girl story that should have served only as a backdrop to move the musical scenes along, since it's not an interesting or original story in itself. The characters are more generic than "Rent," and the tunes are sewn into a less coherent whole than "Mama Mia," or "Hair," but this movie offers some imaginatively staged musical scenes and special effects which are in a class of their own. The elements of 60's social history are well suited to the music which originated at the same time, but the tone of the film becomes unpleasantly heavy, given that the film doesn't really have a point of view and eventually just dissolves into the gooey love story. Well worth seeing, but don't feel bad if you can't make it all the way to the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but something was missing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only The Beatles's music could be capable of cause a musical odyssey like this. If Yellow Submarine and A Hard Day's Night were an adventure that led to reflection and especially the delight of every song, Julie Taymor gives with this film a universal, romantic, historic, epic and unique magnitude to many of the Beatles's hits.All the movie it's a journey, an adventure. Jude is looking for his father, his identity, his freedom and at the end for Lucy, she instead tries to lived, love, fight for what she believes, an find Jude at the building's upper. All reduces in the look for love, because if all you need is love it is good to go Across the universe to find it. And so the ideas makes sense, value, a universal weight where everyone are one, like Dr Robert said, and The Beatles before: I am he as you are he and we are he all together.But even after all the film's beauty, all the songs, the choreographs, the ideologies and the rhythmic edition agreement to the era's portrait both historically and culturally, something was missing. After all still a vacuum that made us feel something was missing, maybe a Lucy in the sky with diamonds more justified or an endless list of songs that were omitted by a lack of time. We were also waiting to know more about Prudence, Sadie, Jojo, more about their lives, their philosophy.Even with all this the real magic about Across the universe isn't overshadowed, these minimal details that were missing or that made fail the intentions of what was trying to show, all they are forgotten behind the beauty of their images and with every note and verse of songs. And is worth to stay mounted on the dream of love.</fullReview>

Loses 2 stars because of the horrible performance by Eddie Izzard who I believe is some sort of "alternative comedian" but any comedy in Mr Kite was done by John Lennon and doesn't need an unfunny comic to add to it. Perhaps now in the U K we'll get the Sgt Pepper movie as enough time has passed for a new generation to appreciate what to my mine was a great film. Otherwise this is a movie which only works because of its music. It doesn't have a powerful story line like I Am Sam but what it does have is what could be a series of music videos. For the collector of Beatles covers this is manna from Heaven. One thing puzzles me though-why has some person with the hideous name of Dana Fuchs not changed it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Across the Universe Evan Rachel Wood, Dana Fuchs, Jim Sturgess Too LongJude (Sturgess), a young Englishman comes to America and gets involved with Lucy (Wood) who becomes caught up in the Viet Nam War protests.Well, Beatle fans must be happy. They get to hear Beatles music thru most of the movie. Sometimes it worked with the script, sometimes it didn't. Oh, the script???wouldn't this have been better if it were produced 20-years ago or so? Right now we are dealing with a more current war (Iraq) and do we really need to go backwards in time and be reminded of more turmoil? Apparently some think so. I do believe that if the Beatles music was not used, this movie would not have been made. Like I said, sometimes the music worked with the script. The music was more than good and what made the music so was the background accompaniment - more instruments than those used by you-know-who. Made a difference with me. The singers were rather good and we were even given a little of Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix performed by others, of course. However, there were just too many songs and the story suffered because of that to the point we didn't care about the characters anymore. And, it was just toooooo loooooong. At one point everything was just a kaleidoscope of?.of??of? I am not sure what of. The bus trip and aftermath visuals were nice (read boring), but didn't need to be included here. Kind of pointless I thought and it was taking up my time, and remember, I have to get back to watch Judge Judy (TV show).Perhaps if some humor was injected in certain places, maybe, just maybe this wouldn't have seemed too long. I take that back. It still would have. The acting all around was very good when no one was singing. Told you there were too many songs. The movie was nominated for Achievement in Costume Design probably because of that bus trip they all took. Didn't win.And, with a main character (Sturgess) to have a name like Jude in a movie with Beatle songs I guessed correctly what one of last songs would be. Is there a prize for that? ............I thought not.If the truth be known, because of the title I thought I would be seeing a space adventure movie. Silly me.Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: Yes, Language: No,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Music's the only thing that makes sense anymore"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's sufficient to say that I wasn't Julie Taymor's most enthusiastic advocate when I caught word of her most recent film, a story built around an anthology of Beatles tracks. On paper, the idea sounds both brilliant and terrible: I certainly don't consider myself a Beatles aficionado, but, like most of the world, I greatly enjoy listening to their music, and a "re-imagining" of their most famous work could just as easily be interpreted as a desecration of their legacy; after all, how could we possibly envisage anybody but Paul McCartney singing "Hey Jude?" Likewise, it seems a rather odd proposition to employ distinctly-British music as an exploration of 1960s American history, but all things considered, the end result isn't all that bad. Despite superficially being an "extended music video," screenwriters Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have done a wonderful job at fitting a narrative framework around an extensive selection of songs from the band, and the resultant love story is suitably epic in scope to linger in the memory for some time afterwards.Young Liverpudlian, Jude (Jim Sturgess), has lived an uneventful childhood in the cold, dreary backdrop of Britain. After he ships off to the United States in search of his American father, he befriends a Princeton dropout named Max (Joe Anderson), subsequently falling in love with Max's younger sister, Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood). If these names are already striking you as vaguely familiar, then you wouldn't be incorrect in guessing that almost every character derived their moniker from a Beatles lyric. The three main characters are very good in their respective roles; Sturgess is the most successful, and, sporting a genuine Liverpool accent, his song renditions come closest to their original versions, and so, by implication, are the best. Evan Rachel Wood brings a graceful beauty to the screen, and Joe Anderson provides the necessary comic relief, though his character sobers up considerably following a stint in Vietnam. Martin Luther McCoy's Jimi Hendrix derivative is also entertaining to watch, but the characters of Prudence (T.V. Carpio) and Sadie (Dana Fuchs) are an annoying distraction, and the latter ruins more than a few perfectly-good Beatles tracks.There's no doubting that Julie Taymor, working with cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel, has an incredible visual style, and the film's musical numbers are an extraordinary stage-show of lights and colours. Narrative-wise, 'Across the Universe' works most effectively when it avoids straying into spells of inane surrealism, though I was terribly partial to Eddie Izzard's nonsensical spoken rendition of "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!," which is a supreme piece of random nuttiness. As far as the films of 2007 are concerned, I'd consider Todd Haynes' Bob Dylan biopic, 'I'm Not There,' to be a superior piece of music-based cinema, and my preferred musical would certainly be Tim Burton's 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.' Taymor's film loses much of its steam after the first hour, and runs at least thirty minutes too long, but it's such an ambitious piece of film-making that one can only recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was Across the Universe worth watching? Yes and no. I've seen this movie sober, and under the influence and I must say, it was a completely different movie the two times I watched it. I first watched it while intoxicated while at a friend's home. It struck me as a movie not particularly worthy of remembrance, but with very good covers of some classic Beatles songs, which stuck with me through the week, though the rest of the movie seemed incoherent and pointless. I decided to watch it again, sober this time, thinking I would get much more out of it than the first time through. I was not completely wrong, but almost. The movie is actually much more of a musical than I'd expected. In my opinion, it nearly overwhelmed then entire storyline. I attribute missing this in the first viewing, to my influenced state of mind, but even then, I was truly surprised I didn't notice. Other than the music, the story is nothing short or predictable. You can see each and every turn, though it's mostly a straight line, from almost the very beginning of the movie. With no real in depth plot, it's probably not worth watching in any state of mind but relaxed and intoxicated. If you like amateur theatre you may enjoy this movie as well, but the normal cinema patron or Netflix subscriber won't be impressed with anything but the music. Overall, if you'd like to watch a movie, skip it, but if you're into 2 hour music videos of good music; stay in, have (more than) a few drinks, and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Across the Universe was spectacular. I saw it last week at my friend's house. She told me before the movie started that the first 20 minutes or so would be confusing, and boy, was she right. But, after that, I was singing along to all the songs I knew and learning the songs I didn't know. I found it utterly enchanting, especially "For the Benefit of Mr. Kite," "I Have Just Seen A Face," "All My Loving," "Revolution," and "I Wanna Hold Your Hand." "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" was touching, regardless of the scene Prudence was in or the unlikeliness of her NOT getting trampled when she is walking through the groups of football players tackling each other. "Revolution" was amazing because although Jude's message was good, the way he delivered it ticked off Paco, (hehe funny name... Paco!)Lucy, and the rest of his followers. But.. He is a shagger (0_o). This movie was absolutely wonderful and I love the ending. I recommend that everyone see it.

The putrid interpretation of a Jimi Hendrix on guitar and vocals by Janis Joplin to Oh Darling, really upsets my regularity. But, of course, I could say the same about every other song in this movie. Oh, and the accents, please give me a break. I would like to tell the producers of this movie that this is a profanation of The Beatles memory in the name of profiteering!</fullReview>

What started out as a fun little movie with some great songs devolves into a boring, pretentious slog to the finish. The whole second half of the movie you're just begging to hear Hey Jude. Because in a Beatles-themed movie it's a pretty safe bet that when you hear Hey Jude we're quite near the end. Hey Jude doesn't come nearly soon enough.While it's the songs of John, Paul, George and Ringo which are at the center of the movie we never hear those famous voices. The songs are sung by the film's cast, mostly to surprisingly good effect. OK, there are a few duds in there but by and large the actors do the famous songs justice. Jim Sturgess does very well with the lead male role, a character conveniently named Jude. And in the lead female role, Lucy, Evan Rachel Wood is a revelation. She's fabulous. A couple of her early songs are definitely among the film's highlights. And they're a lot of fun too. Unfortunately in the second half of the movie fun is in short supply. Director Julie Taymor spends most of the film's second half beating you over the head about how horrible the war in Vietnam was. The movie is of course 40 years late to that party. When not going on and on and on about Vietnam the movie is basically just a psychedelic mess. Taymor drives her movie well and truly off the deep end. Things were going along just fine until a musical number which accompanies one character's induction into the military. If you were being kind the best thing you could say about the sequence is that it's bizarre. The truth is it's out-and-out stupid. Laughable. And sadly a sign of what's to come. The rest of the movie is either more of this tripped-out nonsense or anti-war drivel. OK, we get it. In the '60s people did drugs and thought war was bad. Can we move on? Please? Sturgess and Wood do an admirable job trying to hold together a movie which is falling apart around them. They act well, they sing well, and they have very good chemistry. When the story focuses on the relationship between their characters of Jude and Lucy the movie works. Unfortunately that focus is lost and the movie clearly suffers for it. The last hour of this movie is not just bad, it's painful. Not even Beatles songs can save this. And while the Beatles songs used earlier in the film tuck neatly into the story later on there are some rather curious song choices which seem rather forced and don't come off well at all. The songs may be performed well. But too many of them fail to make any genuine impact. And some of them are totally wasted in the psychedelic haze. By the time the movie finally stumbles across the finish line the end is a blessed relief. A movie which seemed to have great promise totally lost its way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. First off the movie starts off with what I though was going to be a good plot. After about a half and hour the movie just gives up on it, the characters don't do any thing else until the last fifteen minutes. In the middle of the movie (which is VERY LONG AND BORING) nothing happens. I thought it was impossible to make a movie without a plot but this film proved me wrong. You can mark the point where this movie goes from OK to horrible, the moment where the kids enter the hipster bus. this movie is so bad that I really couldn't recall that much after watching it. I walked out of the theater and couldn't remember 95% of the movie. I tried really hard but my brain seemed to block out, possible to prevent myself from getting PTSD. This film is an abomination and makes me sad to be of the same species as the people who made this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great film.I always have been a big fan of the Beatles, and I think that this movie made a incredible work using the most famous songs of that band in order to create a completely new story. And the final result is more than excellent: In fact, this must be one of the best musicals that I've ever saw, along with Moulin Rouge.This movie combines an incredible story with incredible visuals and incredible music. Of all the movie that I've ever saw in the recent years, this has to be one of the most satisfying and impressive.Jim Sturgess shines as the main character, and the rest of the cast made an excellent work as well. I loved every single aspect of this film, and it is one of my all-time favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remembering Martin Luther King Jr. 1/15/2011</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i'm writing this two days late. i meant to write a review on his birth date but i was too lazy and a little depressed about the whole Arizona shootings in Tuscon. you know "happiness is a warm gun. shoot shoot bang bang".Julie Taymor's brilliant 'Across the Universe' seems like the perfect way to spend the MLKJR weekend. 'Universe' is actually more about the time period of 1967 than it is about The Beatles. as a matter of fact, aside from using the Fab Four's music, it really has nothing to do with The Beatles. The Beatles exist simply as a metaphor and nothing more in the film. which is just fine, since most artists who try to interpret The Beatles music usually fail. remember the dismal Bee Gee travesty 'Sgt. Ick'? unfortunately i do.Julie Taymor's direction is so breathtaking in this movie that i can't really think of anything in recent times that it compares to, with probably the exception of music videos. but this is not simply an extended music video, it truly has a good story with a very relatable plot. it also features one of the sweetest love stories i've seen in film romances.all the music is beautifully handled. the scenes that feature the songs "Let It Be" and "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" are real standouts and very touching and memorable. T.V. Carpio gives a soulful rendition of "Hold Your Hand" which is turned into a slow ballad and is sung by a girl who is in love with another girl. one of the best covers i have ever seen and heard.there is also a hilarious and vivacious scene in a small town bowling alley that has a nod to the audience favorite 'The Big Lebowski'. there is a camera shot of Jimmy Sturgess whistling out a little Beatles tune while he is being tossed down one of the lanes like a bowling ball. Joe Anderson, who is the film's only problem because the performance is way too cutesy, has some funny moments in this scene too.the whole cast is just remarkable in this amazing film, but the real star here is Julie Taymor's incredible film direction and set designs. i had the privilege of seeing Taymor's 'The Lion King' on stage, and i've seen the vast resources of her superior talent. can't wait to see her film of 'The Tempest'.Taymor turns 'Universe' into a real spiritual journey that crosses our universe and time. she has genuinely brought the music of last century and into this one. now the younger generation can appreciate the power of social change that the 60's and it's music had.this review is dedicated to the memory of Martin Luther King Jr. and the victims of the senseless Arizona shootings. who even, in a sense, the shooter was a victim of our troubled times too. God bless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 1960's musical with a social statement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Across the Universe (2007), directed by Julie Taymor is a coming of age film, set in the 1960's that utilizes a great deal of music written by the Beatles. Taymor attempts to capture the essence of the era with her use of several pivotal events of the time. She blends not only the story of her characters but also the story of a nation coming to grip with a changing world.We meet Jude, portrayed by Tim Sturgess, a poor shipyard worker in Liverpool England who is trying to break free of his drab existence and wants to locate his birth father in the United States. In his quest to find his father, he meets Max Carrigan, played by Joe Anderson. Max is a Princeton University student with too much time on his hands and too much mischief in his heart. Through Max, Jude meets Lucy, played by Evan Rachel Wood, Max's sister. The story then begins to develop around the relationship between Jude and Lucy and their love affair with each other and the influence of the time period on the people that surround them.This film also addresses the political and social environment of the 1960's in the United States. This is shown in the scenes depicting the race riots in Detroit and in the use of drugs at Max's fraternity house. It is further emphasized as we listen to the conversation at the Thanksgiving dinner in the Carrigan's home. Max and his father start arguing about the need for a formal education and we see the opposing views of the older and younger generation. The older generation, represented by Mr. Carrigan, wants the younger generation to be serious, get an education and a job. The younger generation, represented by Max, wants to first find out who they are, so their quest for happiness can be complete. By combining both a musical format and a social statement in one film, this director attempts to bridge the stigma of creating a musical film in an era that does not appreciate the genre. This may remind the viewers of the attempt of Hairspray to combine a musical with a social statement regarding interracial relationships.The director used some interesting sound technique's to create tension in a scene with Sadie, played by Dana Fuchs, and JoJo, played by Martin Luther McCoy. As Sadie is singing, JoJo who is angry with her deliberately uses his guitar and amplifier to overpower her performance on stage. The sound used was so loud and scream-like, the audience immediately knew there was discord not only in the song but in the relationship. This was a great way to engage the audience in the turmoil of the times and of the strain on human relationships. Another technique Taymor used throughout the film was the use of color as a communicator of mood. She showed the shipyard, the riot scenes and the war scenes in grays, blacks, and browns. This immediately set the mood for the scenes as dismal and dreary as well as reminding the audience of the struggles that were facing the people in those environments as they tried to break free.Throughout the film the musical score was interwoven and used to remind the audience of the amazing talent and creativity the time period produced. The social issue of the Vietnam War and the shift in the view of society toward the future of its youth made this film worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly breathtaking experience...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Julie Taymor's psychedelic musical extravaganza didn't really do much to light up the box office, recouping only $29 million of its $45 million budget. Not many wanted to see this film. And it's a real shame, as I believe 'Across the Universe' to be a truly breathtaking experience on the big screen, and one of the most visually spectacular films ever made. But be warned, 'Across the Universe' works purely on an audio-visual level? The main gripe I have with the film is that it lacks a necessary 'edge' when it comes to character. They all feel generic and the love story that forms the basis of the plot is dull. Being a musical, finding a great screenplay is always a difficult thing, especially when the entire plot is based around the lyrics of pre-existing pop songs. 'Across the Universe' can't escape from leering contrivances. For me, the most interesting aspect of the story was when Maxwell's return from Vietman. His PTSD, with traumatic flashbacks, could have provided a more compelling and unique plot. The love story was 'nice' but not absorbing ?but maybe I'm just not the romantic this was aimed at.HOWEVER, and it's a big HOWEVER, if you can deal with the stale narrative?wow, is this a film to behold. The voices, the choreography, the use of colour, editing, lighting?all struck a real chord with me, and resonated far beyond that initial viewing. 'I Want You', depicting the subscription process, would have to be one of the most brilliantly choreographed and photographed movie musical moments of all time. It's a magnificent scene, exemplifying just how a big musical number should be shot and edited. The hallucinogenic 'Happiness Is a Warm Gun', featuring cloned Salma Hayek nurses and flipping priests, comes close.The musical arrangements are respectful to the original Beatles songs, capturing the simplicity that made them so beautiful to begin with, but offering enough interpretation that they feel fresh. The vocal performances are consistently good throughout, and some are downright stunning ('I Want to Hold Your Hand' and 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' in particular). Evan Rachel-Wood and Jim Sturgess both have excellent voices ? a cut above the average leads in modern movie-musicals.Even with my complaints, 'Across the Universe' is still so astonishing. Julie Taymor is a true visionary, and her boldness and determination can't be denied...but it's those contrivances that stop this from being a truly great film.</fullReview>

The coregraphics are fun, and the covers are sure to enchant youngsters into loving the Beatles.On the negative side, the editing was not that great. The whole thing with Bono and Eddie Izzard could have cut out. There was no real point, the characters went around, pursuing their music dreams and enjoying life. The only real things this movie has going for it is the characters and music. Thankfully, that is going well enough to carry the film.</fullReview>

The characters are boring and have very weak personality (with the exception of Max, played brilliantly by Joe Anderson)... There are things good about the movie, the costumes and colouration are brilliant, the songs were sang pretty well by the actors/actresses although not jaw-dropping, and few songs (such as Because, Happiness is a Warm Gun, Strawberry Fields Forever etc) were presented very well... but other than that, there isn't much to it... the plot is weak and unlike Mamamia and We Will Rock You, the songs dictated the plot in Across the Universe, but it should be vice versa.</fullReview>

I am a huge fan of The Beatles and the cast of this film come together (no pun intended) and make almost as good versions of the songs. All of the stars have wonderful voices and all have bright futures ahead of them. This film has the right mix of humor, drama, romance and fun. A visual masterpiece, this film shows just how crazy things were back in those days. Also, a fun thing to look for during the movie are the similarities that Jojo has to Jimi Hendrix and Sadie has to Janis Joplin. Overall, excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrific tribute to the greatest band alive!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Julie Taymor is brilliant! She has created something truly amazing, one of the happiest, love-filled movies I have ever seen. Across the Universe is essentially a movie about the awesome era that is the 60's, with a love story added in. The plot is thin, but in this case, it is forgivable because Taymor obviously has no interest in a convention. This movie is a way to bring to life some of the greatest Beatles' songs to life in a bold, unique style. The cast do a fantastic job of covering The Beatles, because honestly, that is an incredibly daunting task. Although they will not match the amazing voices of The Beatles, they add there own touch to some amazing songs. As the two leads Jim Sturgess and Evan Rachel Wood shine, they both have amazing voices and great chemistry. The supporting cast are just as good; Joe Anderson, Dana Fuchs, Martin Luther and T.V. Carpio are smashing! The story follows Jude (Jim Sturgess), who travels to America to find the father he never knew. While there, he meets Max (Joe Anderson) and his sister Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood). Max convinces Jude to move with him to New York, where Lucy soon joins them following the death of her boyfriend who is serving in the Vietnam War. Jude and Lucy fall in love, but soon the turmoil of the 60's creates conflicts.Most of the story is told through the many different Beatles' songs, including: "I've Just Seen a Face," "Hey Jude," "Come Together," "Revolution," "I Want You (She's So Heavy)" and "I Am the Walrus." These are a few of the many, all sung with passion by the cast (including Joe Cocker and Bono in two separate appearances). With a bold visual style, these songs are brought to life and I was swept up and taken along a magical journey. Across the Universe is a movie I will never forget, and always love. The message that carries through from The Beatles' songs are still as touching as they would have been when first released. Love, peace, happiness...all these emotions are spill out, along with sadness, loss and death.Across the Universe is not a perfect film, people have commented on its clichés and poor pacing. Maybe they are right, but this is a movie that should not be judged on this when so much is done right. The acting, direction, visuals, music, it is all so perfect. Taymor has created a film full of love and hope, an amazing love story set in the 60's told through the songs of The Beatles. Sounds good doesn't it? 5/5</fullReview>

I think the difference is enormous. The above combination made me appreciate the stunning colors, the editing, the photography, the sound and the directorial achievement. With the help of consumer publications and internet sites, practically anyone can own a very reasonably priced video/audio system, bring out the organic popcorn, kick back, dim the lights, turn off the phone, shut everyone up, turn up the volume and truly enjoy movies the way they are meant to be seen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After my bad experience going to see SGT PEPPER back in the 80s, I vowed never to go to another film based on Beatle songs. After 25 years, I renounced my vow and watched ACROSS THE UNIVERSE. It is a far better film than SGT PEPPER but ultimately also a disappointment.Julie Taymor is a tremendously creative director, and there are some wild visuals in this movie. Outstanding sequences include Eddie Izzard's animated MR KITE, the draft board dance sequence, and the on-the-street dance with commuters and briefcases. There is no lack of visual stimulation here.The problem is: when you stuff a movie with a huge number of songs, there's not much room left for plot. So we end up with stock characters and boy-meets-girl clichés sandwiched in-between stunning musical numbers. I guess that's true for many movie musicals, but I guess I still expect more. And of course, we have the whole 60s counterculture boiled down to its skeletal remains (Hippies! Soldiers! Rock and Roll!)So: high marks to the director and art staff for keeping my eyeballs entertained, but a big snore for the writers who couldn't do any better than this trite plot that seems like the literary equivalent of a paint-by-number kit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great music, bad story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Beatles songbook is full of classics, but unfortunately I felt the value of many of those songs were greatly diminished in this simple, messy love story. Other than the music and a talented young cast, there was nothing exceptional about this film. Without the music, it would have been lucky to get 4 stars. Despite the film being over 2 hours long, several characters and plot points are left unexplored. This is most likely due to the fact that so many scenes were stuck in there for the sake of getting another song in, but added absolutely nothing to the plot. This really could have been so much better if more time were spent to develop the stories. It felt like every time there was a glimpse of real content and substance, in came a pointless scene that just confuses you more. There are touching moments, and I understand how hard it is to create a good musical with songs that weren't written to be a part of one, but if you're going to have such a simple plot, at least try and put in some depth and originality within it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't count myself as a Beatles fan, but I do know 99% of their songs. The musical side of this film is quite entertaining, I think. Of course, so many songs by them have been covered already. But there's always room for one more.However, as far as originality and creativity goes, this film has almost proved that there's nothing more new coming out of the Magical Four. Their music and thoughts have been thoroughly analyzed, chewed upon, digested, tampered, re-re-arranged and demythologized. Adding to this sad reality, Vietnam! For heaven's sake! Not that old stuff again.I guess this flick would appeal to certain age groups. But probably not in a fresh manner. Sorry, but many of us have realized that 'Love' alone doesn't save the world, peace isn't the opposite of war, and imagining no heaven doesn't get us anywhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Can Still Find the Scattered Limbs of the Poet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Invenias disjecti membra poet?." The scattered remains that Horace referred to are pretty much found here. Julie Taymor's film just about captures most of 1967 and 1968, illustrated in a thin but socially relevant story linking some Beatles songs of the period. The songs are the thing. They're not the original releases, which we can now hear rendered peppily in WalMart by a thousand and one singing violins. These are fresh, more grand arrangements backed by choirs of cherubim. We see the jarring anti-war protests, the celestial calm of what passes for love among teens, doomed simulacra of Janis Joplin and Jimmi Hendrix and Timothy Leary, the real Martin Luther King, Jr., and the real Walter Cronkite broadcasting King's murder. The songs include some of the less well known numbers, Prudence, as well as some of the overly familiar, Jude. The arrangements sometimes bring out a wistful beauty that was hidden in the original. "Give My Heart" is rendered more slowly and sung by a pure soprano. The tempo is slower and the electric guitars downplayed so that the silken harmonies become more apparent.The Beatles were mostly a funny joke when they first appeared on the pop scene, with "I Want to Hold Your Hand." Some joke. After each of their albums, I was convinced that they'd shot their wad, that no improvement was possible given this increasingly loose-limbed approach, light years away from "I Want to Hold Your Hand." They continued to confound me. Today, I find it difficult to listen to the tunes since they evoke some memories that are, after all, tragic. I can't hear Lennon singing "they're gonna crucify me."The direction and imagery are not light-hearted like "Yellow Submarine," and the directorial tricks are not exactly psychedelic in the sense of, say, Peter Max. Overall, it's a rather dark movie. The Vietnam War hovers over the whole thing and sometimes we are snatched away to Southeast Asia for a brief visit to the battlefield. The images are in fashionable high contrast and mostly rather gloomy, not in the spirit of Lennon et all but more in the sensibilities of today when the country or indeed the world seems wrapped in a nebulous hatred that is at least as intense now as it was then.I can't think of an audience for a movie like this. For those in the age bracket we think of as most involved with pop music, the social and political issues are strictly of historical interest. They weren't born yet. And the music, I would guess, is imaginative enough to be a daunting challenge. But those who lived through that window in time are likely to be prosperous burghers by now, resentful of today's reckless and self-satisfied youth -- or perhaps youth in general. Kids today (he said creakingly) don't seem to be exploring, let alone experimenting. They already appear jaded without having gone through florescence.It's a better flick than I'd expected. I thought it would be another exploitation of whatever box-office appeal the Beatles had left, but it's clearly more ambitious than that. A lot of effort has gone into the production and a lot of money and it deserves a decent return on both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dangers of Pre-judging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When "Across The Universe" was released in 2007, my immediate reaction was that this would be a picture I would not go near. A bunch of clean living "High School Musical" 20- somethings going through synthetic emotional angst and destroying some great Beatles songs in the process. All in all this would make the karaoke wannabees of American Idol and X-Factor seem almost acceptable.No, I thought. You may be old and decrepit, but at least you were there. Let today's children wallow in their melisma crazed mediocrity and you leave well alone.Cut to November 2008. "Across The Universe" is showing on a British movie channel this weekend. The house is quiet, I am by myself; OK let's just watch ten minutes and have all my prejudices confirmed.Two hours plus later I have been utterly transfixed and beguiled by one of the most enjoyable and compelling movies I have seen in a long while.Right from "the off" I thought this might be better than I thought, when I saw it was written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, probably the best TV and movie writing team that The UK has ever produced, and whose work goes back over 40 years and right up to The Bank Job with Jason Statham. (For younger American movie goers they script doctored practically the whole of "The Rock".)And the story, developed as well by Julie Taymor, the director, was very compelling and very well told. Instead of some vacuous piece of teen nonsense, we are given a very believable story of young people struggling with their own beliefs and sense of identity and self worth in a very tumultuous and world changing time. And I can tell you, even though this is ultimately a fairy story, and uses some very stylised set pieces, the sense of reality and truth was very strong. (Although I don't know why Ian and Dick had Jude working in a ship yard; there was precious little ship building in Liverpool in 1964.)And the set pieces were wonderfully done. The Induction scene was quite simply a tour de force of creative imagination, and even the Mr Kite extravaganza was a real hoot.The way the songs and the fairy tale fantasy was integrated into a very real and poignant story was excellent and a testimony to director, set designers and, above all, the actors. I had a real sense of time and place and never for one moment did I think that "these people are trying to create something they know nothing about".But ultimately it was the songs. The way they were used was superb and the arrangements were almost without exception imaginative, even breathtaking. Indeed the biggest compliment I can pay the music is that often the treatments gave greater depth to the songs than to be honest the originals actually deserved. Even as I am writing this I can't believe what I am saying, but it's true you know. I would actually like to get Prudence's version of "I Wanna Hold Your Hand".All in all treat this as a salutary reminder for old has-beens like myself. There are great things still happening out there; make sure your prejudices don't make you miss them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one got upgraded after my last viewing...There are a few films in a lifetime that can bring true emotion into the forefront and plater it to the screen, Across the Universe is one of those movies.The Movie Stars a young artist named Jude as he traveled to 60's USA. They come into contact w/ issues such as the war, race riots and other things as their very friendships come to difficulty. The movie is a musical using various Beatles songs in order to get the point across.The actors are mainly fresh faces and yet the acting and singing was done really well. I am usually very critical of actors trying to sing in a film I remember how sickened I was by Moulan Rouge which I still say is a terrible movie due to the low quality of the singing. These actors are very good at singing and the people in charge are not star stunned.When I first watched this film I went to theaters as I figured by the commercials it would be an entertaining drug ride, and indeed it was. What I wasn't expecting was a deep story that was very well put together and imaginative. The songs for the most part are executed very well and the imagery is very much stunning. This is one of the first films in a long time that had my attention fully from start to finish.Due to fears of spoilers I won't say anything more about the film. If you can you should definitely check this film out with an open mind. It isn't just some sixties drug trip romance...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Joy from Beginning to End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure whether the younger generation will appreciate Across the Universe as much as I. You see, I'm from the time that songs told a story, you could actually understand the words the singer was singing, and songs had a tune rather that just shouting to a boom-de-de-boom-boom rhythm. Across the Universe is a musical that actually began with the songs - all those of the Beatles. There are the standards that are familiar to anyone not living in a cave for the past forty years, but not being an avid Beatle fan, there were songs that were new to me.All of this takes place in the Viet Nam War era. It certainly means a lot to me as I would have been the age of those young people in the movie. There is an extremely inventive segment in which young Max goes for his induction physical. That certainly brought back some memories for me - both haunting and humorous. The induction scene is witty and camp, and the director certainly zeroed in on all the indignities save one - the bend over and spread your cheeks part.The story of the film is simple - yet beautiful and romantic. Young Jude is a steelworker in Liverpool who travels to the United States on a personal quest. He meets Max who has just dropped out of college. Max invites Jude to Thanksgiving dinner at his family's home where Jude meets Lucy, a high school senior and Max's sister.Jude and Max go off to New York and find living quarters in The Village with a group of creative young people. In the meantime, Lucy's love who has gone off to Viet Nam is killed, and Lucy decides to spend the summer before college with her brother in The Village.Needless-to-say, Lucy and Jude fall in love, and the two spend an idyllic time loving, drugging, and working - he as an artist and she as a protester of the war.Max, as indicated previously, is drafted and is sent off to Viet Nam.The lives of these three and all of their friends are shown to the audience through those wonderful Beatle songs, extraordinary choreography, and impressive video effects. This movie is a joy from beginning to an end that comes too soon.One last personal note: "Something" is my favorite song, and there is a scene in Across the Universe in which Jude sings "Something" as he watches Lucy sleep and sketches her. Wow, did that bring back memories and stir my heartstrings! I hope that Across the Universe does the same for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much Beatlemania here but not bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beatlejuice! Beatlejuice! Beatlejuice! Beatlejuice! Like a flying Lennonball, another Beatle homage musical has crossed the cinematic universe that has a familiar ringo to it. It is Director Julie Taymor's love-story jingle narrative "Across The Universe". A plethora of Beatle tunes are incorporated within the plot of a young Liverpool lad named Jude who crosses the pond to America and meets a gorgeous born-into-wealth "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds". Jude travels to America primarily to meet his estranged father who is an Ivy League university janitor so they can "Come Together". There, Jude meets a "Day Tripper" college student named Max and with "A Little Help From His Friend", Jude meets Max's sister none other than Lucy herself. Mad Max is exhausted by his family demands on striving to succeed so he rebels and consequently Jude &amp; Max move to America Beatleland, New York. In that "Apple City Field Forever", they meet a group of bohemians including a sexy cougar singer/landlord Sadie, a Jimi Hendriexian guitar player Jo-Jo, and an Asian lesbian Prudence. Not before long, Lucy joins them in New York after her boyfriend is killed in combat. "Hey Jude" now Lucy is available and before you can say "I Love Lucy", they fall for each other and all "They Need Is Love" now to exist joyously in this universe. "Across The Universe" then dwells into 60's themes such as war, democracy, violence, sex, drugs, an of course rock n roll. Cutesy for a 60's themed film but all too familiar; but I "Let It Be" since it is a film of the "hippie hippie hooray" era. I do commend the actors for their theatrical efforts in taking on such challenging characters, but none of the performances caused me to "Shout" with exhilaration for their thespian contributions. Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais are the "Paperback Writers" of the screenplay of "Across The Universe", but their film paper should have screamed "Help" because it lacked originality and authenticity. Director Taymor tames it well with the visuals in the musical sequences but has a "Ticket to Override" by inserting an overabundance of Beatle tunes which take away the realism of the film's romantic plot line. "Across The Universe" is not out of this universe, but not bad to check out after a "Hard Day's Night". *** Average</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taymor is without a doubt a visionary. Her film is like a lavish visual experience, and the cinematography is astounding. You feel like you're on the strangest drug trip of your life. But sadly, what this film has in look, it lacks in everything else. The story concerns two 70's era lovers Jude and Lucy. This story had potential, too bad it becomes a clichéd, tired look at a vibrant time. I thought Jim Sturgess' performance was fine, my real problem lay with Evan Rachel Wood. Her performance was flat, wooden and her character was a walking 2D construction. There was nothing likable about her character - disaster for a film that relies on its two leads.The love story never veers off run-of-the-mill. There are too many secondary characters named after Beatles songs that its hard to identify with any of them. The sub-plots are, however, more interesting than the central guy-loves-girl plot. Joe Anderson is trying hard to keep the film together. Halfway though, the film starts losing it, and never recovers. There has been some attempt to 'change up' the songs, but you can't improve on perfection, and many of the songs fall down with the plot. The actors are trying, and they are good renditions, but nothing more. Some of the songs seem to drag the plot along. Several times in the film, the 'hidden' Beatles messages get anxious and far too overt. Taymor assumes that the viewer is less knowledgeable than the filmmakers, and it gets too much.This film treats the viewer to some visual beauty, but overall lacks in everything else, and sadly, a pretty picture does not make a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Telegraphed Mish Mash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I very quickly got the impression that this film had no idea where it was going, other than into some kind of sticky setup for the next Beatles' song.Granted, the concept was well meaning, &amp; the visuals were creative, though mock retro, rather than actual period presentation. By far the best feature of the film was the arrangement &amp; presentation of the music itself, despite some fairly amateurish performers, &amp; some overtly awkward applications, with the noted performance exceptions of Joe Cocker singing an oddly placed, but inspired rendition of "Come Together", &amp; a Watts riot tie in being put to a Gospel arrangement of "Let It Be" which truly was, quite possibly, the only genuinely touching moment in the film.Without a doubt, the biggest flaw of this film, besides flying all over the place without direction, is that the entire plot &amp; many of the characters seem wholly developed for the purpose of jamming two or three dozen Beatles song into a movie, whole characters created &amp; named, solely that they can have their respective song sung to them. Between that aspect &amp; the relentless cramming of Beatles' references into the already unremarkable dialogue, the viewer is helpless to notice anything but these sophomoric tendencies, which reduced the film to leaning heavily on the brilliant skill of the very thought provoking original composers of this music, &amp; the powerful intent their songs can carry.Before now I'd never had a solid example of a movie that was rushing &amp; dragging at the same time. This film drags, &amp; I can only imagine that it was also ripped up by execs before release too. It drags primarily because the connection between characters hangs on threads or less, &amp; what actual plot they try to string together, besides poorly executed spoofs on Joplin &amp; Hendrix &amp; the like, is disjointed, clichéd &amp; insubstantial However, simultaneously as the film drags, it is also rushed, with no intention other than to quickly segue into the next musical number, &amp; hide the lack of skill in the script writing department. The only notable time where this worked in their favor was in the "I Want You" induction sequence. The rest of the time it only served to prevent the audience from becoming involved with the characters, on a more substantial level than just their stereotype.Oh yeah... We got lots of stereotypes in this movie, &amp; also downright spoofs on real life persons, &amp; though many might consider it homage, I tend to lean more toward hackneyed writing. though I suppose that in an age where this generation will soon lose touch with the historical noteworthiness of people like Ken Kesey, &amp; Timothy Leary, a film like this may be the only way to link them to Mid-Twentieth Century history. Such a sad comment that is, &amp; if it truly is the case, then I'd pray that we, somehow, as a culture could come up with a better way to present it than this. Perhaps I'm being a bit rough on this movie though, in expecting it to be less vapid or simplistic, being that I'm fond of The Beatles' music, &amp; also not necessarily within the film's target demographic. As musicals go, it manages to entertain, in about as substantial a way as Coco Puffs can be considered a breakfast meal. The cast is certainly full of pretty people. The dance numbers are well choreographed, the direction &amp; cinematography are eye catching, &amp; I can see how people who are into this kind of thing would be able to enjoy it, on its own merits, without dissecting it like I have beenTheir mistake, in my opinion, was in leading us to believe there was a story to follow beyond overdone clichés, &amp; people who were more than just a two dimensional caricature of a 60's icon, or a Beatles song archetypeBut I won't tell you to not watch it, because there is an off chance you may like it, &amp; not care about the things I'm mentioning, but I likely won't watch it again. I can like pointless musicals too, &amp; if I get the hankering to watch one, I'd be far more fulfilled by watching "The Muppet Movie" &amp; that's not Sarcasm. I like "The Muppet Movie"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are not a fan of musicals, this is not the film that will change your heart. The singing and the faces of the actors is just so thoroughly "stage-y", it's hard for me to put it any other way. It is close, but not so bad, to how I feel about how inauthentic kids are in shows like "Barney." Mix in choreographed scenes of football, fighting, army enlistment and even bowling may also cause a twinge for some, like me, who are skeptical of musicals.Of course, going in you sort of expect these things will happen. It's just that after "Frida" and "Titus" (which by the way I think is her current and still reigning magnum opus to date), I was really looking forward to Julie Taymor's new film. But by the time this was released, I knew I could wait for video. Alas.That being said, this is a fantastic film from a point of view of set design. I'm kidding with the subject of this post, but not by much. And some of the dancing at times was interesting (the flippy-floppy salesmen, the careening doctor before Nurse Hayek is injected into the film). I also enjoyed the Butoh-like scenes of Vietnamese women, the Bread and Puppet Theater escapades, and them thar' Blue Meanies. But even the background shots of stores in pseudo-Greenwhich Village...and Jude's sketches in the apartment, deep kudos to Don Nace whom I believe did much if not all of that work. The psychedelic effects do a mild overdose, in fitting with the period.As for the "cleverness" of the songs worked into a story. I don't want to pooh-pooh it, but my loose impression is that it would not be so hard to do. It was interesting how open some of the Beatles' lyrics are, and yet they do have enough spot-on love songs to rely upon as a staple in this film. It's not like Taymor is constructing a film out of the lyrics of Jon Anderson from Yes. Anyways, while I'm not a phoney Beatlemaniac, most of the renditions here were far from innovative, and far too close the the Muzak-ified trauma encountered in elevators and grocery stores through-out the 80s (till whenever they stopped that horrible mind-control experiment).Ultimately I didn't find this film so polarizing, just a solid 6 in my book. One small stage step for the fans of "true" theater, despite others citing Bono here, I think Eddy Izzard danced rings around the former Mr Hewson. Izzard's high-flying Mr. Kite was worth watching in the bonus takes on the DVD, he takes the inauthenticity of a musical and outlandishly expands upon it, while it appears riffing the lyrics off the top of his costumed hat.6/10 Thurston Hunger</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Julie Taymor certainly has a brilliant mind. Having seen both her Lion King and Green Bird on Broadway, I was eagerly awaiting the release of "Across the Universe". Week after week, month after month, I watched the Preview of it prior to the featured movie at my local theater, but it seemed to take nearly two years before the actual movie was released. When it was released, at least here in NYC, the reviews were less than positive and there was discussion about Taymor wanting to take her name off the film, etc.I recently purchased the movie on DVD and watched it. Reviewing this movie is as difficult as explaining it. It has a serious story about a young man from Britain who comes to NYC's Greenwich Village during a time when protests of the Vietnam war were increasing. But Across the Universe transcends from a serious story, to real life footage of the Detroit Riots, to an acid trip hallucination, then back to a serious story several times throughout its 2 hours and 15 minute running time.All of the actors are excellent and all the members of the Beatles would be proud, I'm sure, of the performances of those who sing the Beatles' songs.I'm a NYC resident and if this movie were released in the early 80's, it's the type of movie where one would have lit a joint in the balcony of the Loews Astor Plaza theater, and went for the "trip".If you like the Beatles or Julie Taymor or both, pop in the DVD, sit back, let yourself go and enjoy the ride "across the Universe"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hit soundtracks shine, story underwhelms in ACROSS THE UNIVERSE.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My take: A visionary but utterly uneven musical. Watch it for the songs! Before I even express my single regret for the Beatlemania-worship ACROSS THE UNIVERSE, there'll be a band of loyal fanatics out there who'll still defend this film from critics or simply critical viewers like me. "Oh, it's The Beatles. Screw You for not liking it for that!" They might say. But the powerhouse soundtrack is not the bad here. I wasn't even born during the supreme Beatlemania era but I know The Beatles music were and still is classic to this day. If you're a Beatles fan, there's no reason you shouldn't see this film, but I hardly doubt you'd want to see it for the story or its moralistic "messages". If I'd recommend ACROSS THE UNIVERSE to you, go see it for the music... and the music alone.This imaginative but scattered musical drama centers on mid-Vietnam war era, where hippies and partying teens hit streets. The movie is about a story told amidst the band's famous hits, which leads to romantic moments, emotional moments of tragedy, friendship and many other surreal adaptations drawn from the imaginative minds behind the screenplay (and basically, the whole film itself). For the record, the imagination here is immense and elaborate in every sense. Come on! Any film to associate Vietnam war, the Hippie era with a pleasant array of The Beatles' soundtracks fits the category of imaginative and outlandish. And besides, simply the music of those famous songs are bound to lure any of you to the big-screen or the video store, making sure you won't miss a thing.Everything about the soundtrack and the imaginative ideas are strong, but when it comes to finally telling a story, ACROSS THE UNIVERSE seems confusing and mostly dull. It concerns a love affair between a rebellious teen named Jude (Jim Sturgess), inspired from "Hey Jude", and Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood), inspired from "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", amidst a scandalous and chaos-ridden era of the Vietnam war. The story is convoluted and weakly-told. It's slow-moving and basically plodding, pretty weak when it comes to narrative. it all seems to be dependent on the Beatles music alone to carry the story, while it drags along. Director Julie Taymor has a thing for emotions, but she rarely swoops us here. Other than a blast from the past featuring Beatles favorites, the film rarely has a memorable moment once it devotes itself to dialog and screenplay.ACROSS THE UNIVERSE is not a bad film, it's just a major disappointment. Any fan of The Beatles would come and see this one, come what may. While they'll get their just rewards, they'll still be forced plod along a tedious storyline. Scattered character bits and weak story-telling make up for one imaginative and colorful mess. See it for the music, but you still have the option to buy the soundtrack instead.Rating: **1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I know that this movie could get a little weird at times, but I don't understand how anyone could hate it. It was completely creative, fun and addictive, so that you're drawn into it. It has such a good way of putting together many Beatles songs into a movie. It had me humming one song or another when the movie was over. The acting was really good (especially, in my opinion, with Jim Sturgess as Jude), as was the singing, although the originals with the Beatles will always be the best. They didn't destroy the Beatles songs with new people singing them. I loved this movie, and wasn't disappointed by it. It's a love story with a Beatles Twist! I could see it over and over. It doesn't get old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Across the Universe The Beatles, their words spoke for a generation in the sixties. Their music is renowned and loved across the world. Across the Universe tells a story no one has ever seen using the songs everyone has heard.Across the Universe is a visually stunning rendition of over 20 Beatles songs that will dazzle your ears and your eyes. They range from the world renowned "Hey Jude" and "Come together" to the more obscure "I've just seen a face" and "Because".The main character is Jude, played by the handsome Jim Sturgess. He is a dockworker from Liverpool who goes to America in hope of finding his biological father. Lucy is young woman played by Evan Rachel Wood who thinks love can conquer all. Jude meets Max, played by the equally handsome Joe Anderson, at Princeton University and they set out to New York where Lucy and Jude fall in love. From then on the story evolves into a face paced and musically powered story of love, war and everything in between.The cast includes the comedian Eddie Izzard, Bono, Joe Cocker and other musical greats. It also introduces Jim Sturgess, a young, brown eyed, blacked hair man who might just become the next teen heart throb. Evan Rachel Wood, Joe Anderson also star in a cast of relatively unknown actors.Now, to answer your question, the covers of many of the great Beatles songs have not been botched. The new renditions of the Beatles songs are spectacular. "Strawberry fields", "I am the walrus", "dear prudence", "Revolution", "Helter Skelter", have all been successfully reproduced and are sung and played out with a distinct visual style. The songs are so catchy that you'll be humming at least one of the songs by the end of the movie.Julie Taymor, the director and one of the writers of Across the Universe directs a visually inventive but slightly uneven story of war and romance in the early seventies. The cinematography is beautiful and imaginative but sometimes steals from the performances in the movie. The costumes are original and very impressive. The most captivating costumes are those in the "Mr. Kite" music number, they show a stunning display of originality. The lighting in the movie is slightly over-dramatic but succeed in portraying the director's vision, albeit slightly heavy-handedly. There are a lot of memorable scenes in the movie and the musical numbers are done with much more grace and style than most recent music videos.The film will surely be enjoyed by those of all ages and is a blessing to all those who love musicals and Beatles music. The movie breaks all generation gaps but will hold a special place in the hearts of those born in the sixties.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This heartfelt homage to the music and turbulent era of The Beatles certainly doesn't lack ambition, but it probably wasn't such a great idea to begin with. Knitting together a cohesive narrative from a random song selection is overreaching, and it shows. Unfortunately, the creators got carried away with themselves and let this thing go on far too long. Would have been better as a string of lively musical numbers without any of the boring dialog, which failed to tie it all together anyway. And ditch those pseudo-soul-searching renditions of the ballads ? The Beatles never let themselves become so maudlin. The cast is good, except for Evan Rachel Wood, who is one-dimensional. Enjoyed the Maurice Binder/James Bond-style closing credits best, but like the songs themselves, I would have preferred seeing the original James Bond title sequences instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OKAY...So many people talked this up to me and said "You have to see this movie really stoned or on drugs". The only reason that statement could be legit is because for SOME PEOPLE, weed just dumbs you down incredible amounts. But, even weed did not save this movie for me. It's like the script was written by someone who has absolutely no creativity, no depth to their personality (since their characters and plot have none), and absolutely no experience with what real life is ACTUALLY like. The portrayals of people, romance, war, England, being in a band, hallucinating, etc etc were all a complete embarrassment! And then, just because they use drugs in the movie, it tricks people into thinking "this is one of those really messed up, really DEEP - trippy movies" but it's not...I feel like the people who have made it have never used a drug in their life, which is NOT the case with most drug movies...ala Fear and Loathing, Trainspotting, Requiem for a Dream, etc etc etc.The movie attempts to make a statement and emotional impact, but all it does is causes you to laugh at how hap-hazzard and weak it's attempt is. What's the statement? People are at war in the world and it makes people sad? People die and it makes people sad? Why do you care about any of these characters? There is absolutely no depth to anything. How can you care about anything that happens to any of them? The only thing that makes this movie worthwhile are the segments where they have costumes and settings that are actually semi-creative. Particularly, the segment during the song "I Want You (She's So Heavy)" is probably the only impressive segment in the entire film. Unfortunately, to me, most of the effects-laden segments are just lackluster attempts at recreating the intense presentations we got with MOULIN ROUGE. And the "hallucinogenic" scene...anyone who has FINAL CUT PRO could create that in 5 minutes. There's absolutely no creative thought put into it. OOOOOOH COLOR CORRECTION - how innovative and worthwhile. NOT. I could excrete a better musical in one sitting. Don't waste your time with this mediocre garbage. Do yourself a favor and watch SWEENEY TODD instead, or ONCE, or even the new HAIRSPRAY.And as far as MUSICAL standards go, C'MON! The songs were for the most part very boring renditions of classics, and the stuff that was going on on the screen was not impressive or entertaining in the least! Barely any synchronization of anything! The choreography was so weak! It was like watching a really bad music video the entire time! A really boring one - that has like some decently talented people in the effects department, but then it's like the person in CHARGE, directing, is mentally disabled. There were a couple really really cool sequences but it wasn't nearly enough to save the movie.Most overrated film of 2007, BY FAR.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie musical experiment proves mostly positive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best ways I can describe Julie Taymor's Beatles movie musical "Across the Universe" is schizophrenic. At one point you're watching a drama--then a music video--then an art piece--then an actual stage musical--then a raging acid trip--and back to a drama again. The good news is the film leaves you with its strongest form: drama musical, and it leaves you feeling good.The music is awesome. The arrangements of these Beatles songs are great, modern and given beautiful, fresh voices. It's a definite soundtrack buy. The only problem is that sometimes the songs are portrayed in the film in ways that don't work or that simply detract from what the viewer really wants to see and cares most about--the characters, specifically Jude (Jim Sturgess) and Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) and their relationship. It gets cheated a lot in the film for characters that really don't matter in the end, yet we still care about them, so I guess that's what matters most.Basically, everything but the really "out there" musical-like sequences and the psychedelic scenes works. It's a constant guessing game and a fight as to which you're going to get with each song. The film can go for 20 minutes or so as a drama musical and then all of a sudden you get a scene like when Max (Lucy's brother played by Joe Anderson) goes to the army and you have dancing recruitment officers with abstract faces. Other scenes like "Strawberry Fields" gives a very emotional music video type feel that contrasts Jude's art with scenes of the Vietnam War. It is awesome and beautifully done by Taymor."Across the Universe" only suffers in this inconsistency. It could also use about 30 min shaved off. Otherwise it is a truly heartfelt love story with some of the best music of the 20th century. Fortunately, in the end, its best stuff comes out on top and leaves you with a generally if not overwhelmingly satisfying feeling. Without the excellent ending, you'd be left wondering what exactly the movie was trying to be. I'm still wondering just a bit, but I'm content with the general outcome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I could think of while watching this movie was of the controversy over the rights to the final edited version. Had it been tighter, and a good 30 minutes shorter, I would have enjoyed it more. The simple yet hole-filled plot was dragged for too long for the sake of interjecting "moments" and songs. Sometimes this device would work, but at others it would seem too contrived to the point where my husband and I would take turns guessing which song would come next: the minute I saw the TV reports on the death of MLK, we knew that JoJo would sing "While My Guitar Gently Weeps".I was entertained until I was exasperated. Maybe it is a movie meant to be enjoyed more under an alternate state of consciousness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is like a diamond. It has so many facets that create one brilliance. Phenomenal! I would do anything to work with this writer/director.Well..... my thoughts don't count unless I have 10 lines to say it in. So..... in the commentary alternate endings were considered and I am pleased with the one they did use. I interpreted it as no matter what developments/barriers progressed in Jude's and Lucy's universe (illustrated by being distanced by 2 roof tops) their lives were spiritually boned and came together again as did with all the main characters.It's been awhile since I enjoyed a work of art as this.

		<shortDescription>Not Just for Beatles Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was quite pleasantly surprised by ACROSS THE UNIVERSE, as I am not a big fan of The Beatles. I resisted seeing this in the theatres for fear it was too Beatles-centric.While the film isn't perfect, it's flaws are easily forgiven by the amount of heart that comes across, and the homage to the spirit of the period. It's actually quite magical, and this is one I wouldn't mind having in my DVD collection. And now I'm regretting not seeing it on the big screen.I really enjoyed her vocals. The cast in general has good chemistry and seems to have enjoyed the experience of making the film. I was especially impressed with Dana Fuchs channelling the spirit of Janis Joplin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Homage to the Pop Masters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely has an attempt to interpret the music of the Beatles through covers or another medium been successful to the extent the film makers here have succeeded. In this homage to the American era of the 1960s and the musical quartet whose legacy has come to be regarded as the definitive artifact of that era, rightly or not, the artistic expression achieved is reminiscent of the printed "Illustrated Beatles" which was published with the benefit of the Beatles yet together at the height of their influence and creative genius.That said, the viewer must go into this latest response to the Beatles formidable body of work with an open mind: purists might be offended, the uninitiated will be forever impressed, arguably inaccurately by what he or she sees. There is a plot here, a boy meets girl, boy loses girl simple plot, the chronology of which roughly corresponds to the years of 1962 to 1970. What this plot lacks in drama or complexity is quickly disregarded for the realization that it exists only as a vehicle to introduce the observer to the more awesome and stunning impressions of the events, and the Beatles musical contribution to the period of the 1960s conveyed through a series of often truly inspired music video vignettes. There are incredibly inspired visual expressions here, music videos if you will, of the Beatles' music interpreted through an historical lens pertinent to the events of that time such as the Vietnam War. The Army induction scene is simply breathtaking. Another spectacular example of the success these film makers have achieved in mating visual images to the Beatles music is the Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite vignette. Simply spectacular.Unfortunately, using the Beatles music to interpret the events of the Vietnam War and the social realities of the American 1960s has submerged hazards upon which even the best intended production can founder. And here there is trouble. The video vignette accompanying John Lennon's paean to his childhood school, Strawberry Fields, was frankly offensive. What was intended as a sublimely introspective, yet childlike and innocent look back at his youth was turned, by these film makers into something much darker, ugly and violent. This is a tragic flaw. In other instances, such as Blackbird, the music video vignette does not readily correspond to the artist's original intent. And in at least one case, the lyrics had to be edited in another of Lennon and McCartney's pieces to make that song fit the plot line of the story. But then again, even the best directors and actors have edited Shakespeare. The difference is, however, that the Bard's intent is usually well preserved.On critical and political side notes, the producers seemed to have cared little about the meaning and intent behind Lennon and McCartney's lyrics and at least once used this film to further an apparent bias towards the Democratic administration of Lyndon Johnson using audible slogans during an anti-war march scene, yet ignoring the truly malevolent and much more violent "surge" by the next Republican president, Richard Nixon, who eventually used the awesome power of the State to actually try and bar John Lennon from residency in the United States. It was during the Nixon presidency that Lennon's anti-war zeal really blossomed, not during Johnson's. A more historically faithful and honest film would have included at least an oblique reference to that ugly part of the story of the American Sixties.This reviewer has only two overriding concerns, that the images associated to some songs are offensive and that young people, new to the "scene" will be forever impressed, incorrectly, by some of these images. This film, Across the Universe, all things considered, however, is a must see for any sensitive spirits whose hearts are more often inspired by the angels of their better natures.</fullReview>

If you remember the protests, the war on TV, hippies, and radicals, then you'll feel right at home. Now imagine taking all these aspects of American culture and making a feel good movie from them guided by the songs of the Fab Four.Visually this movie will take you back to the 60s and early 70s during the upheaval of American culture. I know some say that it's TOO American, but the Beatles influenced so much of America at that time, I don't know how this CAN be too American. The songs were almost all perfectly picked and the vocals were stunning. I was amazed at the virtually unknown talent that starred in this film. This is not only worth owning, but worth watching again and again.</fullReview>

I don't have enough words to explain why this the worst movie ever. *****Spoiler alert ******when the movie begins there's a guy singing that's the part I hated the most there's also a Chinese girl singing which I did not like. I never heard any beetles songs before but these songs in the movie are just so stupid. If you like musicals go watch west side story that was a good musical movie. I want the money I wasted on this back don't waste money to watch this garbage if you want to watch it then watch it for free. But my advice would be to not watch it.

A pretentious, overblown collection of songs sung by non-actors, in a flimsy, incoherent plot and pace which I suppose one could say is a homage to the hippie movies of the 60s, although the driving force here might be lack of creativity rather than chemical ingestion. Anyone looking to base a school report on the Times That Were a Changing by watching this might also want to consult Species II for their biology essay and Timeline for their physics exam.

		<shortDescription>A 2-hour long Gap commercial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Across the Universe" is a visual collage of beautiful white people, dressed in fashionable clothing, dancing to modern renditions of classic tunes with no discernible plot. There are bright colors and cool visual effects. There are token non-whites, including an extremely funky black musician, and an attractive woman of mixed Asian ethnicity. There are ivy-league students decorated in plaid, playing golf on rooftops. In other words, it is a 2-hour long Gap commercial.The movie's plot starts out as a number of intertwined love stories. At some point, the plot completely disappears in order for certain musical numbers and cool visuals to happen. The plot then turns to how the Vietnam War affects the various characters. At the end, it becomes a love story again. Overall, the plot lacks clarity as it meanders forward in time with a random pacing. Has a day passed or a decade? It's quite hard to tell, even when the film attempts to imbue historical scenes into the story.When the movie does try to say anything, it fails horribly. Where the unrelentingly literal interpretation of Beatles songs makes whimsical scenes like "I Want To Hold Your Hand" merely cloying and unsatisfying, it makes the more serious scenes like "I Want You" and "Strawberry Fields" ring laughably hollow. I am certain I was not the only person to laugh out loud when the soldiers were carrying the Statue of Liberty while singing, "She's So Heavy". I prefer my symbolism seasoned in a marinade of depth, with a dash of subtlety. While the war-related scenes were at times viscerally reminiscent of Pink Floyd's "The Wall", there was no underlying tension to drive them home.The acting was decent overall, particularly considering the script they had to work with had no real character development. The actors played their one-dimensional roles as well as could be.The music was, on the whole, remarkably well sung and played. The more than 30 Beatles covers had a fresh sound while not losing their familiarity.This movie might be enjoyable if you shut off your brain and tune out while absorbing the audio/visual experience unhindered by critical thought. But two hours later, you may decide you'd have preferred to just watch a short Gap commercial.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Across the Universe {dir. Julie Taymor, 2007} (*/****)I've never been one to bury the lead, so let me tell you straight away, I hated this movie with a passion. The more I think about it the more I'm enraged, even offended, by this film. It is an attempt to weave the songbook of the immortal rock band The Beatles into a grand, romantic, cinematic spectacle. Its production design and narrative conceit are at times engaging but only in the smallest of fits. Suffice to say the bad outweighs the good; the treacle drowns the sublime. It contains good songs, well sung by capable actors (all of whom are given types not characters) but its soul is so hollow that it can only rely on its naive intentions. The simplistic attempts at establishing time and place are ham fisted and cloying. The 1960's were a complex time; the decade brought about social upheaval along with revolutionary ideas regarding music art and cinema, yet if one were to judge the period by this film they would come out with a completely positive and simple message: peace and love conquered all. That is simply not the case; the hippies goals were ultimately unrealized, that is the sad truth. As for incorporation of songs, Taymor's methods are flimsy (a character named Prudence is there specifically for the song 'Dear Prudence' to appear)and its entertainment value low. The more I consider this film, the more it enrages me and its been a few weeks since I've seen it. Get back, JoJo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revisionist Conceit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another attempt to cash in on, and regulate, memories of the 60's.By creating 1&#xff09;standardized images, while using 2) a montage technique to narrow the story line, and 3) the Beatles' music as an out-of-context filter, the decade is reduced to a few simplistic concepts, rather than showing a period of variegated social and cultural upheaval. Since MTV wasn't around, we who were alive and conscious in the 60's had the choice to visualize and interpret individually as well as collectively. This film is an MTVization of the time, which will ultimately corporatize the personal experience. As people's memories fade, the media images will remain. The real experience will be diluted, and only delusional conceits like this movie will exist.None of the humor, "hidden" meaning, and consciousness-imbuing attributes of the music, or the time, exist here. Only the lowest common denominator of impressions are used, as seen and gleaned from decades-old video. To appreciate what the Beatles were, listen to their original music, and watch the actual performances and promotional films."Across the Universe" is historical revisionism as entertainment: a far more dangerous activity than book-burning.The three stars are for Joe Cocker's authenticity. Everyone else, including Bono and Eddie Izzard (his being the trashiest "performance" in the film), sink to a very low level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tangle of unnecessary plots.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this movie I felt like I had wasted two precious hours of my life, seriously it is really bad and most of it is just wasting your time before getting to the point.The story could be summed on a one page script, except that the movie takes an annoying pleasure of taking you into useless trips and events that eventually come to an end brutally without influencing anything else in the story. You then feel like you have been taken in a trip just to hear a goddamn song not nearly as good as the original and often barely linked to the plot.If you really want to see this mess, then stop reading right here because next comes spoilers about the useless tales in this movie. Else, read on.As an example: (SPOILER) We meet Prudence at the beginning of the movie which is a lesbian cheerleader. We see her singing her sadness that she can't tell her love to another cheerleader. Then later prudence comes again in the movie, sad because she is in love with the Janice Joplin de service. After she disappears again, our useless Beatles song bearing name crew leaves on a trip with the walrus (which seems to be some sort of guru) in a psychedelic bus. The Walrus gets tired of the movie and leaves our team unexpectedly never to be seen again. Then the bunch ends up in a weird circus where there is an act in which prudence is. The girl is just barely visible so Jude points out and says "There's prudence!" Hurray for her! EXIT PRUDENCE because that's the last time we see her. The gang just realizes then that they had a story going on and they get back to it. If you take the whole walrus/circus/prudence thing out of the movie, it doesn't change anything, it has NO INFLUENCE on the main script. Just like the time where Jude's girl joins a terrorist crew which blows themselves out of the script without any influence whatsoever because the scripter didn't knew how to make it come to an end in a decent way. The story is filled with these and that's why the movie is wasting your time.Also the analogies with the Beatles tunes are really far fetched. Such as the walrus and (SPOILER) when Jude wants to design a logo and then thinks about Vietnam then smashes strawberries on a wall so Strawberry Fields Forever... which makes perfect sense in everybody's mind, right? That's just one example and that's why the movie is bad.Last, since when the Beatles were an American thing or linked somewhat to the Vietnam??? Seriously you should get the soundtrack if you want to hear the tunes. Stay far away from the movie, for if you die of a heart attack during it you would have died in vain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but very close to it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was one of those movies that couldn't be over with fast enough for me. It was utterly boring and I kept hoping that something profound would happen to change my mind. That doesn't happen.I must agree with another comment that I read. This is more or less a dumbing down of history during the 60's. The feel of the 60's just wasn't there at all. I was born in 1950, so I did experience the period. I joined the Army reserves to avoid being drafted (not a good move today) and staying out of Vietnam. I listened to a little transistor radio in bed every night to song requests from young girls nearly in tears who had boyfriends or husbands that were in Vietnam. Sometimes the requests for dead soldiers or sailors. After the requests they always played "Mister Lonely" by Bobby Vinton. Nearly 60,000 Americans were killed in the Vietnam war. We saw it on the 6 o'clock news every night. This movie doesn't capture any of this. It was a dark period in American history, not a musical.The singing was okay but the entire "story" was so contrived just to fit Beatle songs to it. The attempt is really lame. Most of the characters had names that are in the lyrics of Beatle songs, that were eventually sung during the course of the movie (no surprise there).I don't make too many comments about movies, but if this help people take notice of how bad this movie really is, then I feel like I'm doing my part. This is a really bad movie.</fullReview>

You know, typical things that happen to total strangers who by odd twist of fate all wind up together.As this bizarre story continues to unfold, we are treated to swirling colors, headache inducing visuals, Eddie Izzard dancing with Blue Meanies, and Bono warbling about how he's the walrus.Now, to be fair, I am not a huge fan of musicals, but this thing sucked out loud.

		<shortDescription>A trip down memory lane for Beatles fans, and what a trip!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When people of the "Beatles generation" (including this one) watched "Mama Mai", they must be asking themselves if you can build a musical around ABBA's songs, imagine what you can do with the Beatles'. Well, here's the answer to their?..er?..prayer."Across the universe" is a rhapsody of music to Beatles fans. Over thirty Beatles songs are beautifully presented in a variety of style ? male and female vocal, heavenly harmonizing, accompanied (unplugged, piano and rock band) and a cappella, rousing gospel (guess which one).Built on the music are two stories, one macro and one micro. The backdrop story is the US social revolution in the 60s and early 70s with the anti Vietnam War movement in the foreground. The personal story evolved around a bohemian household in New York comprising of people from various geographical, social, racial and cultural background. At the very centre of it is an often-told love story of boy meets girl, boy losses girl and boy gets girl back. Some critics fault the first for not having sufficient depth and the second for banality. These criticisms can be argued to no end. I went essentially, if not entirely, for the Beatles and couldn't have been happier even though so many songs were missing. But out of over 200, what can you do? That's not all. There is also the sumptuous feast of colour and images from Julie Taymor whose rich background in stage (particularly operas) art direction shows only too clearly in this movie.On the cast, you can almost say it is an ensemble ? there are about a half-dozen significant supporting roles. In a movie such as this one, they are measures first and foremost on their singing and all have done a fine job. Of the two leads, Jim Sturgess who plays a lad named Jude (take note) from Liverpool invokes an image of Paul McCartney. Evan Rachel Wood (the youngest of the 4 daughters in "The upside of anger" if you remember that one) is quite endearing and sings well enough. But I understand that her 2007 movie to watch is "King of California" in which she plays odd-couple father-daughter with Michael Douglas. I missed that in the Toronto International Film Festival (as I did with "Across the universe") and will try to see it the first time I get a chance.If there is a flaw with this movie, it's in being a tad too long, in trying to say too much with the narrative, particularly the social and political issues. Leave that to other movies. It would also be better to cut out the psychedelic bus sequence in the middle to bring the movie just down to within 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying: I was prepared to hate this. How can you mess with perfection? Who would dare take classic Beatles tunes and repeatedly rearrange them? And just how coherent a plot could/would be fashioned to string them together? What I was met with was a likable cast "reimagining" the cultural highlights of the 1960s. Granted, it's ridiculous how the main characters keep showing up at every significant hippie event, but this isn't (obviously) about plotting. My concerns were well founded in that regard. ACROSS THE UNIVERSE desperately tries to connect these events and the characters (who are all pretty one dimensional). And the happy ending is pretty tacked on.But I found myself being compelled to watch it. And to enjoy it. For every ridiculous plot development (and there are many) comes a moment of audacity. The reimagined songs even work well, excepting the occasional clunker like "Let It Be." And Eddie Izzard provides a hilarious turn.Don't look too hard for content. Just go with the flow. Turn off your mind, relax, and float downstream...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No longer the "Magical Mystery Tour"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually when someone sets out to produce a musical, they contrive a story and then create the songs to emphasize certain points or aspects that make up the story. Julie Taymore went against the grain with Across The Universe by taking thirty-three already famous songs by The Beatles and letting those songs shape the story she wanted to tell....And what a mess it is.Sure, this musical has it's good moments, mostly involving very original and innovative visuals and choreography, but it's low points and downfalls far outweigh the good! This musical accomplishes in creating some well-planned feel good moments, but ultimately fails in mashing together beloved songs into pointless and choppy nuances and obnoxious propaganda.Before I continue let me make it very clear that although I seem to be taking on the role of a critic I am in NO WAY trying to say that I could do any better. I can't and I know I can't. I'm simply making observations as an audience member and sharing my opinions as a movie fan who knows what to expect.Let us get down to the nitty of the gritty...there are two screaming faults this movie has in my eyes. One, too much liberality in licensing their own meanings to The Beatles wonderful songs; two, a broken flow of music and story that rarely seems to connect.My first example of Julie Taymore and her crew taking far too much advantage of making their own interpretations of The Beatles songs comes from the beginning of the movie. A cheerleader is singing "I Want to Hold Your Hand" (very well I might add) but you find out that she's longingly singing the song to herself about another female. Don't get me wrong I'm not trying to get into anything about homosexuality specifically, all I'm saying is, how do you know that's what The Beatles intended? You could argue by saying, "How do you know that's NOT what The Beatles intended?" Alright I'll give you that one...but the point still remains, Taymore is taking the liberty of morphing all these songs into what she wants for her story. And again, when they do the musical sequence for "I Want You (She's So Heavy)" they sing the words over and over again "She's so heavy, she's so heavy, she's so heavy, etc." and in the movie they depict that by showing a group of soldiers carrying the Statue of Liberty and making a subtle point about government."What's so bad about that?" you ask? People who loved The Beatles and flocked to see this movie will forever associate the meanings of their songs with the meanings shown in this film. And whether or not the movie actually DID get the meanings right the point is Taymore and her crew assumed the position of actually knowing the interpretations and asserted their false position of leadership by incorporating it all into their blockbuster film.Also, the movie was choppy, wavering, and sometimes just pointless. For example, the character Prudence nearly seemed irrelevant except for the fact that, because of her name, later on they had the chance to sing another song ("Dear Prudence")! Oh how contrived...Eddie Izzard's appearance was definitely fun (he's a good actor) but sequences like the circus, and where JoJo comes to New York and they sing "Come Together" (so out of place) is all so forced and pointless most of the time. It becomes more of a dragged out music video than a movie. The story was mostly simple and served only the purpose of giving a backdrop to the music.I suppose that I just saw it on DVD and I actually didn't get the "movie theatre experience" but all the same, it was a disappointment. The music was stunning at times, the singing was mostly well performed especially by the younger actors, and the visuals were almost always astounding and innovative. But the incongruity of it all, the forcing and obvious contriving of it all, and the lack of strong story brings it all way down. I felt like I was being catered to as a 12 year old, and even by a 12 year old's standards, it was pointless and waste of time...</fullReview>

Watching this film it is obvious that this was a labor of love by all concerned.There is a profound sense of joy abundant in this film; as if the actors, directors, set designers etc. were infused with a totality of inspiration. It would be easy to find fault with this movie. Yet it rises above all the flaws to emerge as a completely unique and engrossing cinematic treasure. In this way it reminds me of "Apocalypse Now", another film in which the glaring blemishes, born of inspiration,only serve to contribute to the sense of uniqueness and wonder at the effectiveness of the finished work of art. Immerse yourself in this film and you will be rewarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beatles are the soundtrack of the times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have waited for this film to be released on DVD, it seems like forever and played it as soon as Netflix came through. Although I felt that the film started a very bit slow, it did pick up nicely. My friend Roger is much better at analysis and criticism of films than I, so this is more of a consumer reaction than a real review.When I saw clips for this, I kept thinking of Moulin Rouge, but I could never really get my head around Moulin Rouge. The use of Beatles songs is a soundtrack for the times, which is where Moulin Rouge broke down for me: the juxtaposition of the era and the modern songs came off as too arbitrary for my taste.The musical arrangements and performances for Across the Universe were stellar and beautiful. For me, one of the true highlights of the film came when the plaintive and pure voice of Timothy Mitchum began singing Let It Be in that very moving sequence, with Carol Wood. It was somber, breathtaking and heartbreaking.Seeing Joe Cocker pop up was a delight, though I'd have been even happier had he sung With a Little Help From My Friends. The musicality of the I Want You/She's So Heavy number, and the symbolism involved, was wonderful, and captured the zeitgeist of the counterculture viewpoint of US involvement in Vietnam.I didn't mind Bono, though I've read some criticism of him in this (yes he was well disguised). His semi-Dennis-Hopper-Easy-Rider-meets-Doctor-Hook character was appropriate for its purpose. What I wasn't in love with was the Eddie Izzard-Mr. Kite sequence. It was a bit too dark for me, and the Monty Python-ness of it seemed a bit out of time synch for me, though I confess I can't recall whether Python was well known in the US prior to the 1970s, but if the time line of the film was in the least bit adhered to, this film was set in 1967-1968 (Martin Luther King was killed in the film), the summer of love giving way to more violent war protest and confrontations. I suppose that's being too picky. I really liked the rooftop concert nod and I wonder why Dana Fuchs wasn't being considered to play Janis Joplin.All notes aside, I was loving this film, it was an honest look at the era, with all its warts, and how a generation could move from hopefulness and idealism to cynicism and disillusionment. I'm fairly certain when I can, I'll buy it for my collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think this movie was very good. Don't get me wrong, I love The Beatles, but this movie is not tied to them in my mind. They were Beatles songs, preformed in a way that wasn't as good as the original. In fact I found most of the songs to be pretty bad. They were the best part of the movie, but I would have preferred to just listen to the albums. Other than the music this movie really had nothing going for it. The plot was the worst of any film to be this popular. Plus, the second I found out the main character was name Jude I almost cried. I liked the Beatles references, but a like subtlety would have been nice. Overall it was just a bunch of under average Beatles cover songs, strung together in a loose plot, hardly a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psychedelic but inconsistent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Across the Universe is a sensory musical that uses songs from The Beatles to tell a story about America in the tumultuous decade of the 60s. It is about a young man named Jude, who travels to the United States from his native home of Liverpool. Once there, he meets a dropout student named Max and they quickly become friends. They move to a building in New York City, where a relationship builds up between Jude and Max's sister, Lucy. They also meet a number of peculiar people from the city, widening the friendship circle. Alas, Max's departure to fight for the war and the differing stances between the remaining friends soon gets in the way.Across the Universe is basically a bunch of neat music videos, tied together by a mediocre plot. The only reason the plot is not a complete mess is that the characters hold it together (although at some points the characters have rather impractical motives). Some parts of the film are downright silly, but I guess that stems from it being a musical. It gets more serious toward the middle, when the Vietnam War and protests play a greater role. All in all, the plot left me unsatisfied.The music parts were certainly interesting. There were a couple of abstract segments, but it was very artistic and beautiful. The special effects are excellent. The use of colors (especially when Jude creates a "strawberry farm") is thoughtful. Depending on viewer tastes, the music might start to take a toll toward the end (although that is where the best songs come in). The music selection was a definite draw for me.The acting and dialog was pretty much standard. There are cameos by Bono, Eddie Izzard, Joe Cocker, and Salma Hayek, which adds to the musical flavor.The main problem I had was that the whole film was plagued by inconsistencies. It felt like the writers attempted too much to fit the songs into the story, which leads to problems. It presses for an emotional response, but often I disagreed with the messages.I should note that I am not a fan of musicals. Someone who likes musicals will probably enjoy the film more and be able to ignore the problems. If you like the Beatles, then the film is definitely worth watching. For a general audience, Across the Universe is a solid film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent, but better editing and story development...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I went in with an open mind, and some of the movie I though was shot brilliantly, but other times I felt that the musical numbers were a waste of time like "For the benefit of Mr. Kite." With better development about the main characters and cutting many of the unneeded numbers this could of been a halfway decent movie. Nice try, but still as sappy as the old Sgt. Peppers with Peter Frampton. I will admit, some of the numbers in their musical arrangement was great, but overall, I feel the movie could be edited to 1/2 of its length now, maybe 1/4 if they developed the characters better. I mean who the heck is Prudence and what does she really have to do with the story? I love the Beatles, but at times this move tried to be Grease High School Musical, and Woodstock all at the same time. Good idea, decent cast, decent music except for the Mr. Kite &amp; Dr. Roberts numbers. and kudos for getting Joe Cocker, Bono, and Selma in the movie, but actually, their scenes should have been cut too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think you could make a better movie about how Julie Taymor got to be so hip. How does someone get to be such a critics and (sheepy) fans favorite? If only her work measured up to the reverence. This big, commercial, stupid, dazzling/dull film might work for the middle brows and high school kids, but it's pretty terrible. An epic for the post video, ADD generation, it goes nowhere slow. The Beatles songbook, for better or worse, will be endlessly mined for all sorts of projects for years to come; it's brand power an unstoppable force. But Taymor pretty much rattles off the standard 60's clichés, with a modestly surprising song choice here and there. Soon enough, you'll be wishing you were listening to the records. Eddie Izard challenges Steve Martin's big number in "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" for winch inducing honors. Rachel Wood makes a dull, if pretty, heroine. It's not too bad at first; and just seems a peppy repackaging of the music for the Hillary Duff set. But the attractive cast ( weren't there any ugly people in the sixties?) can't ring much out of the non-story, and after 90 minutes you'll be quoting John at the end of "Stawberry Fields" ("I'm very bored").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The critics across the nation, as indecisive and inagreeable as they are, seem to have come to the conclusion that it's a visual fest with a story and music that fall in different categories. I certainly can agree with that categorization, because all three of the film's elements are vastly different to each other, and the film had quite a task to blend them together into what it is: a hippie-revolution era Beatles music musical with acid-trip visuals.The film opens on Jude, an Irish dock worker in his 20s, singing "Babe" to the camera. If that doesn't establish what you're getting into, nothing else will. We see his departure into America and meeting anti-war activists Max and his sister Lucy, whom Jude falls in love with.While the film's theme is all about the '60s anti-war movement and the idea of revolution in the modern age for years to come afterward, the film has a hard time getting a grip on this smart idea. The most obvious thing to talk about is the choice of music. In case you weren't informed (by the film's marketing or title), all the song and musical numbers are cinematic re-workings of The Beatles. This has caused the biggest line-separation of the film's viewers. With the die-hard fans of the band, half say the re-workings are bastardizations of the original work, while other fans feel they were made with great respect to the original work. Another population of the critics say The Beatles' should not have had any part in the music of the film and original music would have suited it better. As for me? My only complaint is that, while the Beatles were indeed an important and influential band of the era and suit it well, they were not the only band that did so. What if the film had musical numbers by the works of the Rolling Stones? The Doors? Bob Dylan? Different musical influences would have most likely added diversity to the music.But that isn't to say the numbers are boring or dull at all! The music is well orchestrated and suits what happens on screen perfectly. Which brings me to the next element of Across the Universe: the visuals. To call the visual effects "eye candy" is an insult. An "eye feast" would be a little more appropriate. Your eyes never want to wander away from the screen in some truly amazing scenes. Even the dark scenes are bright and joyous, and don't even get me started on the hippie trip-out scenes. So if you're one of the many who don't want to hear The Beatles "bastardized", you can take your iPod to the film and enjoy the insane effects and beautiful visuals.And, like any musical, the visuals and songs are selected to fit in with the plot and story, which brings us to the final element of the film: the story. This is, without a doubt, the film's true "flaw". While it has a great spark, focusing on revolution in the '60s in the anti-war movement, it has no real drive to bring the characters into the movement itself. Jude merely seems like a follower of the movement simply to stay with Lucy, the girl he loves. He never seems to feel the revolution and movement into his own life, sticking with the "misunderstood artist" attitude throughout. Lucy stubbornly sticks to the group of anti-war activists for no real reason except that she lost a family member from the war some month's prior. While the reason is strong, it doesn't seem to inflict onto what she's doing and why she's doing it. All in all, the characters follow through the personality stronghold, but are beautifully portrayed nonetheless.But if for nothing else, the film must be seen for it's marvelous diversity from everything else that's come out lately. Though far from original (you can't really call a musical that uses songs from another band 'original') it sticks out more than even musicals like Chicago and Rent by a milestone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie along with the 2004 film Ray. Ray was beautiful and a great cinematic representation of music. I cannot think of another word besides corny to describe Across the Universe. The cringe inducing dialogue as a family gathers around the table talking about "it's not what you do (for a living) it's who you are" was laughably bad. The show people smoking marijuana and drinking in a way that makes doing those things look boring. All the songs are used in a bizarre manner. The people in this movie are not attractive and are not the type of characters one should build a movie around. I had to shut this off after about half hour. It was just too dumb for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Julie Taymor's Lonely Hearts Club Band</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Beatles. Like them or not, you can certainly feel their mark on music history still to this day, whatever you listen to in most genres of music, you can hear their influence on music even today (coincidental or not). In fact, they're so good apparently that when you go to Hollywood executives to talk to them over a musical based on The Beatles' back catalogue, they'll go, "Sure! That's sounds totally original and amazing, here have the necessary money, have fun!" When in reality, this concept has been worked with 4 times before and unless it was done with the actual Beatles' co-operation, it never really worked ("Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" with the Bee Gees or "All This and World War II", anyone?).But alas, the opportunity to make another Beatlemania movie came calling when the respectively-imaginative Julie Taymor ("Titus" and the stage musical version of "The Lion King") decided to weave a large string of Beatles classics together into a plot about a young transatlantic relationship in the 60's, under the passionate title of "Across the Universe".Now, you'll be forgiven for thinking this movie would be absolutely incredible because it looked so astonishingly fantastic in the trailer (and it does). But it turns out that it shares two things trailers might have that can be problematic to the enjoyment of the movie: 1) They picked the best parts of the movie and 2) The trailer itself is even better than the movie! Well, ish...the movie itself has some very nice things about it, most of these things are especially noticeable and done well in the first half. The visual design is very appealing, the choreography is exceptional when it's being used to it's full and when special effects are used (in particular, Uncle Sam in the scene featuring "I Want You (She's So Heavy)"), they're pulled off quite decently. However, that's all that can be said over definite positives.The main problem with the movie is that it can't decide whether it's telling a story or it just wants to be a straight-up musical. Or what mood it's supposed to use. The first part is the most consistent part of the movie, although there's still a lot of inconsistencies and some interesting parts of the story that end up being completely forgotten and tossed over for the cliché boy-meets-girl standard and bad attempts at outdated political commentary. The middle part is the strangest part of the movie but is also the most odd-to-receive part. You're mean't to take it on as "Oh that's weird, ha-ha" but sometimes, it doesn't actually feel right in the context of the movie at all. I feel sorry for Bono as he has to deal with one of the most embarrassing cameos I've ever seen, as a guy who's supposed to be something of a ultra-psychedelia genius but just comes off as a bad Willy Wonka who even in the 60's would fail at being "hip", although of course the characters swoon over him anyway before his 8 minutes of screen time suddenly ends. Eddie Izzard however is fantastic as Mr. Kite and hosts a very entertaining and imaginative sequence, but sadly his screen time in the movie is even shorter and there's zero explanation to the scene and zero explanation to how the characters came back to normality.Third act is the worst. Clunky, irritating and surprisingly boring. Hardly anything flows any more, the songs performed start becoming monotonous (apart from "As My Guitar Gently Weeps", with Martin Luther's smooth, soulful vocals and beautiful acoustic guitar having to serve as background music to a character's unnecessary rant over sound equipment) and there's a lot of scenes where it's wise to emote with the characters but because there's no real emotion driven into the main character's two-dimensional personalities or into how the actors should emote, everything comes off as awkward instead. I ended up actually wanting to speed the movie up so I can get to more interesting parts or for the movie to just end so I can stop wasting my time.Overall, in my opinion this movie has good merit and potential to be quite good and some parts do have a sprinkling of good quirks and some inspired visuals. But overall, it feels too much like a movie made as a homework assignment than a fully-fledged major inspired production. Also, the Beatles covers are very hit ("Let it Be", "Benifit of Mr. Kite", .etc.) and miss (most of them as a lot of them sound the same). Which is a real shame as Julie Taymor is a fantastic visionary and she had to waste it on this. Good luck with "The Tempest", Julie, hope it makes up for this disappointing journey here!3.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misconceived homage ends up being a travesty that should be avoided by all Beatles or movie fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, I went into this much against my better judgment, and probably saw it for one of the shallowest of all reasons: the title. The title song might be my favorite Beatles song, certainly it's high on the list, and I thought, any film that makes a big deal out of one of the Fab Four's most musically innovative songs can't be all bad...Boy was I wrong. I really have no idea how much the theatrical version of the film that I saw was tinkered with against Taymor's wishes, how "compromised" it was, but from my perspective this was a horribly misconceived idea right from the get-go. Graft songs by the mostly apolitical, rather surreal and very British Beatles onto a story involving mostly American characters fighting the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights movement; have most of the songs integrated into the film in a completely literal and obvious way; don't reference the musical nature of the 60s at all otherwise except by showing a Janis Joplin and a Jim Hendrix clone, thrown together with the English hero Jude (a poor working-class lad from Liverpool doncha know) and the love of his life, Lucy (in the Sky with Diamonds, of course). Throw in some Bay area psychedelia, obvious Grateful Dead/Furthur/Ken Kesey references, and you've got yourself a movie guaranteed to puzzle anybody even remotely acquainted with the era or the music, if not infuriate them.It's not entirely terrible; I'm actually quite thankful that the filmmakers chose to use actors that could actually sing, and allow them to perform the music rather than post-dub actual Beatles performances (probably impossible) or covers by better-known musicians; and for the most part they do a credible job. None of the performances seems on its own a disaster, if none seem like brilliant interpretations either. And the cinematography was excellent throughout, though the dirty old England/bright and colorful USA seemed a bit of a "Wizard of Oz" metaphor to me which I don't think was intended.But ultimately, this is an incredibly stupid film that insults its audience and insults the music of the most important cultural force of the last century, by dumbing it down to the point where the average 5-year-old will make the connections. Throughout the film music is used, not as a counterpoint or an impressionistic addition to the plot, but as the plot itself; the storyline is built around the songs, and thus seems utterly trite and phony, and simple. Great as the Beatles were, their lyrics if just read on paper aren't always masterful, and they weren't primarily storytellers. I could imagine someone constructing a movie-world from the lyrics of Bruce Springsteen, or possibly Dylan, but Lennon-McCartney's vision isn't terribly cinematic and the film paints nearly every scene with such blunt strokes as "She came in through the bathroom window" -- just after a major character has done so. Shortly afterward the down and miserable Prudence is called upon to "come out and play"; when Jude's girlfriend takes up with an antiwar activist and Jude gets upset, he storms the hippies' offices with "You Say You Want a Revolution." There are a few songs that seem to fit better, to offer more of an aside to the action or to just express the inner thoughts of a character in repose -- "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" sung while Jude is in exile back in England, worked pretty well. On the whole though, this is shallow, foolish and simpleminded, and the enthusiasm of the actors/singers just can't carry the day. Theatrical viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best movies you'll never see! I don't much care for the Beatles or their music. But LOVED this movie. If you like theater, history, and unique ideas and experiences, you'll love this movie. It's going to be a cult classic. Plus, it modernized the songs and I found myself humming them days after I saw the movie.And who knew Evan Rachel Woods could sing?? All of the songs in the movie are sung live. The only songs re-dubbed in a studio are a few that were sung on the street and there was too much background noise. Did I already say that I think these songs are better than the originals...? Unfortunately the movie jumped rapidly out of first run theaters into second runs because the studio gave it zippo support. But, YOU MUST SEE THIS ON THE BIG SCREEN. PLEASE, do yourself that favor and go and see it if it's playing in art houses or on the big white wall at your local park during the summer.BTW - Julie Taymor, the director, also made Titus and Frida, two more really excellent movies worth seeing. She was the brain behind the Broadway version of The Lion King.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>after the first 35 minutes I had to walk out. I couldn't sit there and listen the legendary Beatles music get massacred like that. I want to retain my good memories of the Beatles songs, so I had to walk out. I was just unbearable. The music didn't quite fit the scene or the way the scene was depicted just didn't seem to match anything. There was no real plot, I couldn't care less about the Characters. There's nothing redeemable about this movie. It's as if it was thrown together by people that don't understand the essence of the music except from the lyrics,..in a mechanical sense. The problem with todays movie writers, is that they're a bunch of young insignificant plagarists with no real experience in life. So, they try to emulate the "60"s for what it was and instead created a big shlop of phoniness. Come on people, if you're going to make a movie, you better find a writer that lived and breathed that Era. Even Bono's part seemed so plastic and badly written. I got know feeling from this movie. Okay I downloaded it to finish what I started and still couldn't bear to see it through. I had to skip around just to bear watching what happened at the end which was quite stupid. I'm surprised this movie got a high score. I bet a bunch of Timberlake fans gave it a high score. I read an article in the Times magazine that the X generation and E generation ( today's youth ) are some of the dumbest group of kids this planet has ever known. The highest rate of Low Scores on SAT's nationwide. LOL ROFL. and you'd think the Internet would've made kids smarter. So you see, the voting here is all screwed up cause the majority of the voters are these X gen and E gen kiddies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>:::Possible Spoilers Here-In::: The rawness and artistic vision of Across the Universe almost carries this film to fruition. Strawberries oozing blood, young people experiencing love in a lake below a storm, animation mixing with live action mixing with puppetry mixing with outlandish costumes and make-up to create a hellish vision of Vietnam and the draft... it is almost too much for the eye to take in. Unfortunately, visuals cannot make a film fly without something to keep them aloft, and so Julie Taymor's latest piece crashes from its cosmic journey down to earth in a chaos of missed opportunities and un-centered beauty.Make no mistake. Taymor knows how to fill a frame. She showed this in both Titus and Frida. Thanks to her theatre work (particularly on the Lion King and The King Stag), we also know that she is capable of creating images, puppets, and costumes of astounding beauty that can carry a lot more meaning than the actors within. Across the Universe does nothing to challenge this view.However, like her previous films, there is a serious lack of focus that settles in about halfway through, bogging down an otherwise magnificent concept. Shout-outs to songs that didn't make the cut are nice, but pointless. Plot lines start in the middle of nowhere (the band's feud being a prime example), meander a bit, and end equally without reason. Secondary characters (Prudence, Sadie, and JoJo) seem built to make a deeper statement with their comments on music, sexual freedom, and voyeurism, but finish half-formed with stories that ultimately travel nowhere. Their songs and moments - from Prudence's search for love to Sadie's dealing with "The Man" - seem to weigh the story down in the middle rather than add to it. "Dear Prudence," among other songs, does nothing to really advance the storyline. It's just an excuse to show more pretty pictures. The entire film is filled with moments like these - as in the circus scene where Eddie Izzard as Mister Kyte transports the characters a land of nowhere and everywhere - that are beautiful but, because the characters don't fulfill their promise, seem dead in hindsight.The main characters, meanwhile, are as one-dimensional as the philotic lines that are supposed to connect them. Max = angry egotistical nihilist affected by the war. Lucy = disillusioned prom queen turned radical. Jude = lonely artist interested more in love than movements. We can see the plot points coming from a mile away, and while deeper characters might have been able to lift such a light load of love onto their shoulders, there is not enough exploration to explain anyone's actions, let alone make the roles interesting enough to want to know more about them. Jude falls in love with Lucy, but then immediately moves to New York without a second thought. He also picks up drawing, which seems to come out of the ether as randomly as Lucy's secondary love interest (which goes somewhere...eventually... but doesn't get discussed enough - save in anger - to really justify Jude's reaction to it). Max's story is simplistic in the extreme (fun-loving guy goes to war, comes back a shell) and the one (admittedly unoriginal) turn that might have added some fireworks (a possible drug addiction after his return) flairs then fades away without a second mention.And unfortunately, the music is sometimes the worst part. The covers themselves - like the film - aren't technically awful, just devoid of meaning. The worst are like "Revolution" and "Hold Your Hand", in which only the very surface of the songs are used, usually as either filler or to cover for the otherwise absent plot/character development. The best (like the war-torn "I Want You (She's So Heavy)"/Draft sequence) rip meaning from the songs and transplant something completely different onto them and create something new and unique. What are Taymor and her crew of Merry Pranksters getting at? It seems like there is no unified vision to the whole mishmash of Beatles tune. Yes, the Beatles are awesome, and so is Taymor's eye. Even the actors do well with what little their given. But, the question is, can John, Paul, George, and Ringo gild everything they touch simply by the filmmakers hearkening back to them? The answer is "No". I love the Beatles. I love their work. I also love both the underlying subtext and beauty to their lyrics and music. It is present in all of their work, from their first song to their last.But it is not present in Across the Universe. It's an aesthetically fantastic film that tries to use the best band of the 60's and an unfocused artistic paint brush of wonderment to cover up a by-the-numbers love story that makes all the usual statements about the 60's. Messed up time? Yes. War sucks? Definitely. Some people take revolution too far? Uh-huh. There isn't anything in here that will shock or offend anybody who experienced the time period or has seen any other film about the time period. And ultimately, compared to these films, Across the Universe just sounds flat.</fullReview>

This movie at first with the singing was different but by the end I could not wait to hear another song because they all helped tell the story. The special effects were mind blowing and the cast with perfect. Evan Rachel Wood is talented and she really showed off her talent. The newcomers were great they were enjoyable to watch on screen and made their characters so real and so believable. The music for one is of course the Beatles but I think more films sound be made like this one but with different artists telling a story just like this one. If your a fan of the Beatles music then see this, if not and you just love musicals then seen it. If you like an epic love story taking place in one of many difficult era's then I recommend this movie those people!~!</fullReview>

Visual Beatles/60's in-jokes and referencesLame - Vapid, vacant, clichéd dialog - Taymor should have ditched the 95% crappy dialog and just let the beautiful images and music speak for themselves. In many cases, the dialog detracted from the beauty of the film, and a lot of the jokes were just corny. Clichéd plot Some scenes seemed just weird for the sake of being weird - the Eddie Izzard scene (Mr Kite), while enjoyable in and of itself, seemed to come from left field. Basically, this movie should be seen and enjoyed while under the influence of mind-altering substances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not really sure what constitutes a spoiler, because everyone is different about what they don't want to hear, so if you don't mind basic details, like which songs are involved, read on.This movie is stunning. I went into it with high expectations, and while it got off to a rocky start with Prudence's bizarre introduction via, "I wanna hold your hand" very rarely did the numbers feel forced. The imagery was so vivid, it felt to me like a blend of Big Fish, Moulin Rouge, ad the Beatles' animated Yellow Submarine. There were several images pointing at the Beatles that only someone who knew something about the Beatles would pick up on, and at times, it brought a humorous aspect to the film. I would go see this film again, and I will certainly own it when it comes out on DVD. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie with high expectations. All my friends said it was terrific. The songs were really amazingly sung (I got the soundtrack before seeing the movie). But after viewing it I was sorely disappointed. The only character that was focused on at all was Jude. Not even Lucy--his lover--had that much development, other than her past tragedy. I thought the transitions from dialogue to song were horrible, and totally random. Additionally, it was hard to take the entire movie seriously. I wanted to like it, but found I couldn't. It started out okay, but everything just got more confusing as the movie progressed.The acting was good. The script was mediocre. The execution left much to be desired, as did the plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie had a great storyline with great acting. I have to admit I was a little apprehensive about the "redoing" of Beatles music. After seeing this movie, I fell in love. I love it, love it, love it!! I liked how the music told the story. I wish the song "Girl" was the full length version....Jim Sturgess has a great voice. I thought all the actors sang great! The "Let It Be" rendition is very powerful,it brought me to tears. Julie Taymor is a very creative, ingenious woman! I just loved it and can't wait for it to come out on DVD............great job Julie Taymor and co.!! Hmmmmm....maybe it'll come to Broadway..... Wonderfully done! ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Totally New Movie Experience!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone who knows anything about the imagery or music of the 60's, this film is a pure delight. The dialogue is filled with Beatle's lyrics, and each character's name is from a Beatles song, which was later playfully used in context with the story. I was SHOCKED to find out that each actor sang his or her own soundtrack! Unlike most movie/ musicals, which tend to cast the biggest Hollywood names they can find and then teach them to "sing", these people actually could sing - and quite well. And they each rendered wonderfully simplistic and soulful Beatles' covers. The only exception I would take to this was the character of "Sadie", played by Dana Fuchs. She was indeed "sexy" and beautiful, and a fine actress. She definitely fit the Janis Joplin image, and had a similar rustic-like voice. However, her covers did not suit the music well. And her strange changes to the melodies often sounded like a bad mistake. This was not true with the other singers, such as Jim Sturguess, whose gritty and beautiful voice lended itself well to the Beatles. With his McCartney-like look, he was able to change the tonality in Revolution from major to minor with assuredness and beauty. Martin Luther and Jo Jo also possessed a warn, smooth and gorgeous voice. And hats off to whomever arranged the music.Its hard to imagine just how many talented people were involved in making this movie. But Julie Taymor is just brilliant! Not only are the images and artistic flow sheer genius, but the active direction from dialog into song and dance was utterly natural and always loads of fun. Surprising and delightful cameos were made by Joe Cocker (who sang the crap out of Come Together), Bono (the trippy Dr. Robert), and Eddie Izzard as the wonderfully funny Mr. Kite.This movie will visually and musically rock you and move you to tears. Beautiful. Everything art should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By far, the best musical in this very young century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After you've done with this movie, you've got to ask yourself that, how one can chose 34 from 200+ The Beatles's songs, and still create such a brilliant songs compilation and coherent motion picture. I mean, you gotta see the mess behind this production and wonder how the hell it wasn't a complete failure. "Across the Universe" is simply, by far, the best movie musical in this very young century.As you can read my preview at here, I'm gonna skip the whole plot thing and focus on what made it so perfect. And, on the other hand, what made it so flawed in many critic's eyes.So first thing first, what made it so flawed? Easy answer, the plot. It was mediocre at best. Story of Vietnam's war the time of 60's? Hippy? An acid trip? Psychedelic pop? Yeah sure, we've been there a thousand times before. And there are stories of second tier characters which were left unexplained (so that, movie can spend time more with the lead). We never knew what will happened with Prudence, or how Sadie and Jo-Jo got back together again.True, those are undeniable flawed. The movie is not a masterpiece in the world of silver screen. But, hey guys, can we not look it as a movie? Can we see it as a tribute? A tribute to such an amazing era. It is a music-driven story which wrote by one of the most influential musician in our history. It represents what we love and hate. Jo-Jo represents our greatest guitarist, Jimi Hendrix. Sadie represents our greatest female rock &amp; roll, Janis Joplin. Jude and Lucy represents young ignorance people back then. Max represents young man involuntary joined the army in the 60's, etc. I knows, I am babbling here, but what I've said is really happened, wasn't it? I don't know how difficult or pain in the arse of the director, Julie Taymor, really is. But I do know one thing that she is indeed talented filmmaker. Her visionary is really one major thing that made this trip worthwhile. A Bowling scene, Journey with Mr. Kite, Underwater ballet, enrolled army, Vietnam scene. Those are all visual &amp; sounding inventive scenes. And it's not just she used the absolutely right song for the scene, she sometime also re-interpreted the whole meaning that songs for us. Like "I wanna whole your hand" which is a great, fun and happy song. But in the scene, Prudence sang in a ballad tone. Longing for her true love to hold her hand. I made me realized that no matter how wishful of this song is, it's heartbreaking when you can't hold somebody's hand that you desired.I never thought that they can find a right cast in term of appearance and vocal. But they did it. Jim Sturgess and Evan Rachel Wood indeed left me surprised. But what made me cheer with joy is Sadie which played by Dana Fuchs. She is simply astonishing in Janis Joplin's persona. And there's a final rooftop concert that I think is one of the great tribute to the last concert of The Beatles in 1970's.Someone might said "Wasn't it a suicide to made the Beatles's musical set in the 60's? Haven't you seen Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band?". I think they're taking risk by doing this movie. I'm glad that did it and, by that, did it REAL worth trying for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like somethings about this movie and dislike many, many more. First off great music, terrible singers, and ever more horrible renditions. I heard a fellow critic regard this movie as a butchering of Beatles music and indeed it is, but at least it's done originally. That's one thing I give this movie props for it's originality. But even all this original energy was not focused and frankly spun out of control to the point where the story, the characters and even the performances were laughably ridiculous. (you'd laugh too if a burnt out hippie/Bono look alike, started singing a psychedelic rendition of "I am the Walrus" out of nowhere.) This is one of those movies that's soo bad it's good, but it's still bad. all it all catch in on TV, where it's free. you'll laugh for all the wrong reasons and you won't regret wasting your time and money driving there or watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you are a child of the sixties, see this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wrote in the present tense, because you still have to be in touch with that child to enjoy this movie. Julie Traymor has really captured the feel of that decade with this production. To those youngsters who don't get it, I cannot apologize, because, to quote Walter Cronkite, "That's the way it was." I wondered at one point if Ms. Traymor had been one of my college girlfriends. It seemed she was writing the movie about me. My wife kept elbowing me at points in the film where we had been together in a particular scene. It was an amazing journey; it was written about my youth, and it captured the mixture of ecstasy and agony that was the 1960s.Obviously the movie has its flaws. Some of them are part of the story, however. The 1960s were a flawed decade. To those of us who remember, it is a time we look back on with both a yearning and a dread. The remarkable thing is how well the movie recreates both, and all at the same time. If you want to remember, go see it. If you want to take a stab at understanding the sixties, then go see it too, but pay attention because it's a complicated lesson.</fullReview>

In the process of the heady and at times heavy prospects of making the Fab Four's material even more accessible there are far more hits than misses and it's hard-pressing to be such a sour-puss when the overwhelming message of 'all you need is love' rings out in sweet harmony.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An EPIC Film.. Must see for everyone over 35!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the previews, I knew this movie would be a cornerstone film in many ways. The modern song arrangements and the modern visuals took the Beatles music to a new level. Music and Lyrics such as these were never more relevant, and I doubt we will ever see music as relevant again. I was just a young boy in this era (I,m 44 now), but this movie transports the viewer back in time and slices into the hearts and minds of the generation that changed a world. Julie Taymor's vision and the choreography and special effects brought the surrealistic 60's into a sharper focus. As someone who missed Beatle Mania, but clung to their music in later years, this movie answered so many questions about the songs and the songwriting of these musical geniuses. Their music will always be the standard of what musicians should be, the voice of the masses. The performances of this young group of actors should be revered.</fullReview>

What if the story is contrived just to fit into the songs? I was wrong.The artistic beauty of this movie is something almost unmatched. The colors and the dream-like sequences make for an amazing movie-going experience and well, the music speaks for itself. Evan Rachel Wood, as Lucy, was such a surprise that I was floored when I read somewhere that she's not had any musical training prior to this movie. The characters, and the actors playing them, are lively, talented and full of the kind of life that these songs require.I am in love with this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Movie that is Worth Eight Dollars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that this movie was amazing!! My friends and I are only 14 years old, but we could relate to this movie. As my friend commented about the summery: they did drugs and fell in love, stopped drugs and broke up, did drugs again and got back together. I thought this was a funny but true summery. I absolutely loved the cinematography and all of the different camera angles. It truly helped the movie be creative.I loved all of the songs in the movie. In fact, they're all on my iPod. Evan Rachel Wood, Jim Sturgess, and Joe Anderson have amazing voices! My favorite song is "Blackbird". It surprised me how much of the Beatles were in the movie, even though the people themselves weren't. I will admit, the ending kind of dragged along, but I still think the movie is definitely worth the eight dollars my friends and I spent. In fact, we're going to go see the movie again next weekend!! Go see the movie and enjoy!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maxwell's silver hammer came down on Julie Taymor's head!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What went wrong? What went so very wrong? This film is an embarrassment in its execution. The only redeeming quality of the whole film was the music, other than that it is a nightmarish offspring of a VH1 original movie and High School Musical. Julie Taymor is definitely capable of making a MUCH better movie. Frida was well done. But this ***shudder*** was just frightening. There was a Joplin-type character and a Hendrix-type character!! Why, you ask? Oh because they were already spinning a strange cartoonish version of the late 60s, so why be shy? There were moments were it did become visually interesting but when it happened it seemed to be at the wrong moments. Then there were moments that were screaming to become visually interesting and instead they sat there as limp as a wet noodle. I work in the art department on feature films and I must say that some of the scenic painting was nice in the apartment but the way it was all lit and shot, it just killed it all. It looked like a TV movie. I have never seen a movie that teetered on the edge of being good but instead leaned towards bad as much as this one did. I can only hope that this monstrosity was the product of the studio mucking it up. I know there were fights. I know that they essentially ripped the film out of Taymor's hands but I have trouble believing that they would take away visual effects that they had already paid for. If that is the case then I will watch a directors cut. I really want to believe that Taymor had a much better film in the can and that it was the "suits" that put this sad movie into the theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is one of the worst movies that came out in 07.yes the visuals are amazing, but they belong in music videos. but the point is THERE WAS NO STORY, there was no connective thread between all the elements of the numbers, it was all random bursts of beatles songs pooped right out of the butts of high school musical kids(except the mr. kite's number and maybe 'let it be'). the writing is laughable, the acting is amateurish at best, there was no chemistry or real development for the characters (and 'jude's bouts of depression that turned him into an artist' doesn't quite cut it) and the most desgraceful thing is how they cutesify the 60's experience and turned it into some one dimensional Disney channel crap. The movie is a kiddie pool and I expected at least a waist deep pond. It was too sterile and broadwayie and if you're a beatles fan it'll leave a disgusting taste in your mouth. Thank goodness I saw 'into the wild' and washed it all down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was brought along to see this with some relatives. They had drank the Kool-Aid, like most people had at the time, that there was something necessarily interesting or profound about a garish vehicle for a musical based on a bunch of Beatles covers.The movie itself was, ehh, it more or less succeeded in what it set out to do. I mean, it really wasn't a terrible movie; the cover songs were decent, the acting was okay, and the choreography and photography and art direction all paints a superficially believable picture of some young guy's coming-of-age experience hitch-hiking around the late-60's UK.The key word is "superficial," though. It's all fake as hell beneath its cutesy candy coating. There's barely any sense that we're getting to know any of the characters. Every situation is just a contrived backdrop for another Beatles cover done by what sounds like an endless line of 90s alternative rock has-beens who impart a sedate, simplified feel to the classic songs.The ending of the movie is worse than just the sterile sum of its parts though. It's actually sad in a way I'm not sure the filmmakers intended: the poor guy who was at the forefront of this epic musical journey ends up doing what? Working in a damned factory the rest of his life! I got the strong impression that we are to understand that what we saw him experience will be by far the most interesting thing that happens to him in his entire life, while everyone else seems to continue with their little adventures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two hours of bad Beatles covers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Across the Universe" is like a bad Beatles cover band. It means well, tries hard, and plays the band's catalog with love in its heart - but it's a waste of time. At the end of the show, you find yourself wishing that you had stayed home and listened to the real thing. Like most cover versions of Beatles songs, "Across the Universe" is awful, a poorly written and badly sung music video masquerading as a movie. The story is shallow, the characters paper-thin, and the musical numbers ridiculously over-the-top. That it drags some of the greatest pop music of the 20th century down with it just adds insult to injury.The plot, if you must: Lucy, Jude, Maxwell, Sadie and Prudence (get it?) sing Beatles songs as they move along with the change and upheaval of the 1960s, with each song representing a key event of the times. They drop acid while singing "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds". They tune in and drop out to "Revolution". They get drafted to "Happiness is a Warm Gun". Finally, as if there was any doubt, they realize that "All You Need is Love".I wasn't there for the 1960s, so I can't say what those times were like for people coming of age in that moment of history. No one involved in this movie seems to know, either. The themes of the time - the anti-war movement, changing sexual mores, drug experimentation - are given such shallow treatment that they have no real resonance for the audience. It's as if the protagonists are standing outside of the world they live in, so apart from the scene that they could have walked in from another movie. They know the words, but not the music.Wow, do they not know the music. The cast members are all technically proficient singers, but they put no feeling, no soul, into their renditions of Beatles songs. Jim Sturgess and Evan Rachel Wood, who play star-crossed lovers Jude and Lucy, sing "Strawberry Fields Forever" during a breakup scene, but with none of the loneliness that John Lennon put into every syllable. Joe Anderson, who plays Maxwell, sings "With a Little Help From My Friends" during a party sequence, but his rendition has none of the childlike joy that Ringo Starr brought to the original. Sturgess' "Happiness is a Warm Gun", sung while he unconvincingly shoots heroin, is so bad it's offensive.Writer/director Julie Taymor makes each song into a ridiculously big set piece. The "Strawberry Fields" number has giant, papier-mache strawberries. "Happiness is a Warm Gun" is accompanied by Salma Hayek floating in a syringe. I don't think I can describe the "Why Don't We Do It In the Road?" number in a family-friendly blog.Taymor is clearly a devoted Beatles fan, and works really hard to make her audience love these songs. Thing is, the band doesn't need her help. The Beatles are part of our cultural DNA; they don't need to be introduced to new generations, because they have been transcending generations for 50 years. Like a bad cover band, this movie has no reason to exist, and just makes us pine for the real thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute Rape of a Legendary Band</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phonie acting, emotion, and rape of classic works of art by a legendary band. I watched it once in the theaters when it first came out, and one more time recently. It rarely happens that my conception of a film remains the same or gets worse.In this case, it definitely got worse. I feel that being more interested in art in movies as I've gotten older, really demonstrates how bad this film really is. Before it was simply a dislike of the horrible way the actors were trying to sing the music differently for my younger generation. It was just absolutely disgusting and pathetic. They tried really hard to change it to stay in tune for this younger generation that they warped the music and took away its meaning. I mean, you can't say those Beatles songs mean the same thing in this movie. AT ALL. The songs held meaning for a decade in history, and in this movie, though they tried to add it, it focused on a stupid and phone love story. The acting was so horrible, I think you'd be lying to yourself if you didn't think about rolling your eyes at least a couple times during this film. I'll get back on it a little later. But these are just surface things about the movies. Back to the songs though. JUDE! LUCY? Strawberry fields? You've got to have a stupid sense of imagination if your eyes didn't roll right to the back of your heads. Did people seriously sit there and go... "HOW CLEVER!" Its absolutely pathetic because this film's only support is that of songs from a legendary band. Rewatching it, I definitely disliked the film more for destroying the classical and true meanings of the songs. Perhaps more so because the characters were played pathetically. If you think about it, Jude's story feels forced into the film simply to be clever and play "Hey Jude" and have some (if any) connection to the roots of the music by having a character from Liverpool. His character doesn't really fit in the movie though. He really has no emotion, real drive, reason for thinking the way that he does. If you think about it, every other character has a stronger sense of feeling or doing what they do because they have a stronger back story. Jude is as useless as Prudence if you think about it. Prudence's only reason for being in the film is to add Dear Prudence song. And to prove it, she's gone the rest of the film until the end. You have all these random songs being played because they are good songs, and the film tries to put them by adding a random character or scenario and having these random plot strings that kind of trail off and die. As far as actually filming, the acting is terrible, but I've said that a couple times by now. Why are Jude and Lucy in love? They met at a bowling place, and she shared a simple story with him about her boyfriend dying. Next thing you know she goes all the way to New York and sleeps with him. That'll do it I guess. I'm not sure Jude makes Lucy feel special enough for the connection to transfer to this longing for one another at the end. To be fair, Bane/Mad Max who is pretty much Lucy's boss and secret lover in reality, had a stronger connection with her than Jude. I'm really surprised at the lack of connection. This moves to the camera angles, art, and color added to make scenes look better in the film. The film did use color correctly and even had good concepts of film angling, but it was done totally inappropriately. We can sense a lack of connection with Jude and Lucy really... in my opinion when they get on the bus and find the circus. The reason being because the story is bringing about the decade more in its revolution. Where Jude is having fun, Lucy is living a revolution. I get the love part in the water with the blue and green color, but again, inappropriate, considering the plot has moved on. We continuously see a lack of connection, and all of a sudden we have Jude and the use of love with red in the Strawberry painting. How random, and also convenient to have a Strawberry Fields concept thrown in there. We see how the film has separated the two characters. Lucy is in revolution due to personal losses, but then the film also artificially keeps Jude in his own bubble. The only explanation is he stays in the apartment all day doing mediocre art. There are no real camera angles that depict the true meaning and plot of the film, except when they are all drugged up. Thats all fine and dandy, but all of a sudden Lucy and Jude are to be taken seriously.All in all, bad film. Bad acting, along with a plot that is all over the place due to the fact it is trying to be clever with famous Beatle songs makes it completely pathetic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, two warnings:1)This musical takes the material of 'The Beatles', maybe the most loved band of all times, so, clearly that some people will hate on it even before seen it. But this movie isn't no Yoko Ono, so chill2)This review is divided in two parts, 'For Everybody' and 'For Beatles fans'['For Everybody']This movie starts with a silly 'High School Music' feeling, quite dumb. But, when the principal plot is presented, we are on a ride for some good shots, that move the audience to the 60s, giving the whole experience on the youth of the time. And some times we are led to incredible moments, like the Detroit scene, or the strawberries scene, just blowing minds. With a combination of music, acting and photography that really bring a whole new feel to your soul. A very fun ride for allThis movie have some problems, if you don't have the Beatle's discography you may enjoy a little more the less famous songs, since its never the same thing, and get pretty disappointing when your favorite song is played in a "wrong way". Another problem is the feel that the filmmakers tried to shove the most music as they could in the movie, and sometimes you feel like a certain song isn't really needed in the moment.['For Beatles fans'] Don't go to watch this thinking on your idols, the actors do their best, but they aren't Paul, John, George and Ringo. In a homage aspect the movie brings the feel of the music, and on the time. So go for a fun ride, and expect a fan movie made for the Beatles.Ps.: Sorry for the misuse of any word, or any mistake on grammar, English is my third language</fullReview>

I couldn't believe that it took me years before watching it, gosh, it's Beatles musical. If I had known it before that the songs that they've used are all by Beatles, in a second, I'll play it right away.I enjoyed the film a lot, from opening to end. I can't get enough of how they incorporate the songs to the scenes which tackles about revolution, yes, revolution in the eyes of the young adults. The plot is very empowering and touches some issues of the society including gender preference, infidelity, being an illegitimate child, and etc. There were lots of dancing(contemporary ballet?), singing and interpretation from the characters. Across The Universe is not your average teenage film, it has more depth in it, the story has it's purpose, an intention to liberate our minds, or just to simply refresh our memory of how the people from before handled the world war. I like the acting of the cast. I'm deeply impressed with Evan Rachel Wood's performance, as this is the first time that I've seen her act. She seems dedicated with her role as her characterization is above average(she act naked and to me it's already a tough thing to do, that's why kudos to her), plus her voice sounds so wonderful(why I haven't noticed her before?why?). I'm certain that she gained another fan within this minute. Jim Sturgess is another factor why I decided to see the film. I want to see how will he act his character this time after seeing him in "21" &amp; "One Day". I know that his a good actor but I'm not prepared to see that he is also a good singer. It seems that his a former band member way back in UK(isn't amazing?), and I'm totally into him now more than ever. I'm literally drooling from all of his scenes because he reminds me so much of the young Paul McCartney(can you imagine?), they look really alike(or perhaps it's just the music..) anyway I can say that he gave an exceptional performance with this production. There are also a lot of supporting characters that contributed on making this one of the best films such as "Prudence", "Max Carrigan", "Sadie" &amp; "Jo-Jo".The cinematography of this movie makes me real envious, the shots and camera movement were all so epic that I wouldn't mind to share the same excellency. The music scoring is undoubtedly one of the production's strength as well as the captivating visual effects. The colors, the allude, simile, metaphor, the lyrics were all factors of making this an unconventional state of the art and definitely a must watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great visuals, Dana Fuchs and songs, poor everything else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen worse movie musicals, namely Xanadu, Can't Stop the Music and Mame, but as a fan of the genre I have seen far better as well. The colourful visuals are great and the songs(well it's the Beatles after all!) are wonderful. However, while I love the songs themselves I found myself left cold by the arrangements which were rather static and the singing which was often flat and lacking in heart and emotion.The story is a mess in structure, too thin for the overlong running time, and like Mamma Mia! was more an excuse to interrupt the flow with constant singing and songs, with a number of scenes feeling more music video than a story for a movie musical. The script is tired and clichéd, the choreography dull, the romance rather stilted, the pace laboured and I found myself indifferent to all the characters, mainly because they are not written very well at all, with some not doing much to bring the story forward and some lacking in personality.Evan Rachel Wood, Jim Sturgess and the supporting cast are talented and try hard, but the script, story and arrangements of the songs leave them not so much to work from, so they're either bland or wasted, excepting Dana Fuchs whose singing is wonderful and she is a breath of fresh air as well. All in all, great visuals, songs and one good performance are not enough to save a messy story. 3/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is weird. Director Julie Taymor had worked for Jean-Luc Goddard, and is clearly paying homage to the wacky French director here."Three Drunkards Come Home", as this film is sometimes called, begins with a surreal situation of A dock worker Jude travels to America in the 1960s to find his estranged father. There he falls in love with sheltered American teenager Lucy. When her brother Max is drafted to fight in the Vietnam War, they become involved in peace activism. Then the story starts again at the halfway point, continues for at least five minutes the same way, and gradually diverges.You need to be a serious film fan to take this sort of stuff. If you aren't a fan of Julie Taymor or Goddard, don't go anywhere near this film. If you are, then you have some idea of what to expect.As a fan of Julie Taymor but not of Goddard, I sat through this film with mixed feelings. As in Oedipus Rex, Taymor makes some strong points about the American discrimination against Liverpudlians. But as its apparently main purpose and theme, I feel this was handled much better in Oedipus Rex, and I consider Across the Universe to be one of her weaker efforts. Audio purists and everyone worrying about any loss can stay calm, there is no pitch or anything thanks to the Adobe Auditions processing methods.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually Stunning and Creative Musical Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Julie Taymor's "Across the Universe" is a visually stunning musical arranged with Beetles songs. The turbulent era of 1960s is the backdrop of this whimsical love story. The social and political commentary (anti-war protests, struggles of freedom of speech and civil rights) give the characters and story depth and meaning. Although set in a different time period it is still relevant today as government and society continue the same cycle. The two main characters Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) and Jude (Jim Sturgess) come from different worlds. Lucy and her rebellious brother, Max come from Upper Middle class suburb of Brookline, MA and Max attends Princeton University, while Jude is a ship welder in Liverpool who makes his way to New York by ship to meet his father who he thinks is a professor at Princeton but turns out to be the janitor. There's also the Guitarist JoJo who has a Hendrix flair while his love interest and vocalist, Sadie personifying Janis Joplin and lovelorn Prudence who hitchhikes her way to NYC. Each character's story is interwoven and they all come together sharing a Greenwich Village apartment living a bohemian lifestyle.The title of the movie, and many of the characters are named after various songs: Lucy, Jude, Max (Maxwell) Sadie, Mr. Kite, Prudence, and JoJo. The songs are used to set the mood of each scene and symbolize the character's internal struggle. We the audience gain insight through song and character's performance. The film uses the song, "Dear Prudence" as a subtle reference to Prudence character's reluctance to 'come out of the closet' in relation to her sexual orientation. Also, when Prudence sings "I want to hold your hand" it makes reference to her holding a hand she will never hold. The director Julie Taymor changes the mood and meaning of a upbeat song to one of frustration, unrequited love, and sadness.The film sequence with the song "Come Together" featuring Joe Cocker illustrates the characters coming together adjusting to the New York City lifestyle before they meet cohabiting with one another. It also gives off social commentary of living in NYC- structure, robotic movements, and the rat race come to mind when the businessmen dance and expressionless city dwellers move systematically. There is a GI Joe dance sequence with the song "I want you she's so heavy" as Max is recruited into the war. He is sent on a conveyor belt as is a product being manufactured. He is the puppet being pulled by strings as he is molded into a soldier. Recruiters hold a statue of liberty as they walk through a Vietnam field singing "She's so heavy" as they take on the weight of responsibility or duty to their country. When Max sings "Hey Jude" it makes reference to the character Jude as he sulks in a Liverpool pub thinking of Lucy and his friends. Suddenly he makes the decision to go back to NY to try to get his girl back.Many scenes derive from actual political events which are compressed within a short period: the song "Let it be" plays through the Detroit riots. Within the context of the film, this is a song about accepting death of loved ones. This is universal but the director gives us parallel stories. A young Black boy sings hiding behind a car while the riot occurs. His life is abruptly taken away along with Lucy's boyfriend who died in war. Julie Taymor shows images that people are familiar with but the context is what makes people see it with a new perspective. Other Political events include premature detonation of a bomb by a radical organization, the violent student protest at Columbia University, Vietnam war both referenced through the songs "Across the Universe" and "Helter Skelter". Julie Taymor also uses pale-bodied Asian women dancing top of the water referencing towards the dead civilians who have perished during the war.Through all these events we see a radical shift in politics during a era filled with cultural, social, and political upheavals. In the end, the director gives us her central message or punch line as all the characters meet on a rooftop to sing the song, "All You Need is Love." We all need the same thing in the end, love. It is a anti-war film which tell us through life we must remember to come together to create peace, love and unity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The artistry and inventive genius of Julie Taymor is sublime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a Brit whose 1960s childhood was immersed in Beatlemania (I even saw the Beatles in the flesh from afar, as I watched from the top of the control tower at London airport as the Fab Four were being driven in their limousine to their waiting plane to transport them to America in 1966), I at first felt a slight irritation at the start of the movie, when the "Paul-lookalike" boy from Liverpool started to sing "Girl" (one of my many favourite Beatles' song). I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy this "Americanization" of MY All-British Beatles. I mean, how would the Yanks like it if we made a British based movie, set in London with characters singing Elvis songs or a movie set in Birmingham and Buddy Holly songs? However, I have to say, that after 10 minutes, Julie Taymor, the director completely won me over, and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of her unique, highly original, creative exuberant film."Across the Universe" is absolutely fabulous, with great performances, superb capturing of the times. And I concluded that, in fact, the Yanks had a right to own a piece of the Beatles, because, first, the Beatles were originally inspired by American Rock and Roll. Without the import American popular music culture, the Beatles would probably have never existed. Secondly, the Beatles visits to the States, introduced them to psychedelic LSD experience and the whole counter-culture of the Ken Kesey and Timothy Leary that was part of it, which had a fantastic influence on their subsequent music (that was when I started really enjoy the Beatles "Sgt Pepper", "Magical Mystery Tour" and "The White Album"). Then there was the effect of the anti-Vietnam war protests on the Beatles, especially John Lennon, my hero, who was murdered by an American. So the destiny of America and the Beatles was inextricably intertwined. Julie Taymor, as an American was perfectly entitled to make such a film homage to the music of the Beatles. If you want a visual and musical feast that gives you an impression of what it was like to live in the 1960s, then watch "Across the Universe". For me,the big message of the movie, with its depiction of the anti- Vietnam war protests, is that nothing has really changed. America and Britain have not learnt from the disastrous experience of the Vietnam war. We are still making war in Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, soon to be Iran, when we should be making love. America still feels the need to wage war in foreign lands in an attempt to exorcise the shame of having been defeated in Vietnam. Watch out for the Janis Joplin / Tina Turner character, as well Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters' Magic Bus. I would say, Julie Taymor is the closest American counterpart to our Ken Russell in his prime. Also her work reminds me of Alan Parker's excellent movies "Bugsy Malone", and "Pink Floyd: The Wall"."Across the Universe" is a "must see and hear" movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My deeper insight to this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone who was of this age (the age of the main characters in the movie) at that sad time in our history will find the movie to draw out many laden memories that were so strongly buried and embedded within use. Whether if the script writer intended it or not, I was very surprised to have found much of this decade (the 1960s) coming to the surface during the viewing of this movie. I found very emotional memories which lay hidden within me for all these years. Someone just a few weeks prior to this movie had asked me "what is the first word that comes to mind when you think about the 1960s." That word for me was "fear"! I cannot think of much good about the 1960s without having those thoughts over shadowed by things like: The Cuban Missile Crisis, The Assassination of JFK, The Vietnam War and its escalation by Johnson, The Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., the riots that took place in the streets during this time of civil rights uprising that turned into war in the streets with sniper fire, and the Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. Plus it was a time we grew up wondering if any day the Soviet Union and America were going to go to nuclear war. It was a time when this country was torn apart with the birth of mistrust for those who governed us. There was a lot of burden and emotional impact on the young of this country as a whole. It was a time our souls were greatly traumatized and left with scars. Scars that left us with distrust in a nation we once thought was so great that it could do no wrong. Through our continued enlightenment we were beginning to see a nation that had seemed so God-like to many as now being corrupt and faulted. It was now a realization that we had people in power that had no conscience and were ready to use us as their sacrificial lambs of deception for their own personal power gains, control and greed.The movie made me realize looking into the faces of the actors just how young we were at this time in history and to just how young every generation (being nothing more than children) are that are sent off to fight each new war. It is a time when we are just coming into adulthood and are looking forward to simple and wonderful things in life, like falling in love and wanting to continue to believe in what once our great nation told us to be true. This should be a beautiful time of transition in our lives where we are looking forward to all kinds of wonders. But instead, we are, like all wars, abruptly hit and shaken with a rude youth awakening and our innocent are then taken from us, an innocent that we cannot ever regain again within this time and reality. Why do we do this to one another? It is beyond my ability to accept that there are actually other fellow souls that has journey here with us, to this time and space to learn with us, who have fallen to a darker side and are willing to turn on us for their own short term stay here for a material gain of wealth and control which will be all gone in a short time anyways. We live in a world where most wars are started from false flag operations because the powers that be have something to gain from these wars other then what we are told they are for. I believe there are a very few elite group of people in the world who control all and they are the ones who use the young, without any conscience on their part, to sacrifice their lives as nothing more than mere pawns in their game to get what they want. We have been dumbed down by the ruling cr?me of cr?me elite ruling class that has misdirected us from further back in time then what we could image to ignorantly and blindly go and fight for false causes.The movie is a musical that uses classic Beatles songs, sung by the characters, to convey its mood and feelings to emotionally impact your feelings into its storyline about this time in history and the love and fear of its generation. Each person will get a different reaction and meaning from this movie; rather being good or bad. The good side for me is this movie has done a beautiful job of choreographing the music with such strong emotions of the time, to the point of where your soul feels a vibrational connection through the music. With the feeling of what the writer is trying to convey, much of what is felt is read in-between the lines of the script and is left for you to fill-in your own history of emotions for this time period. While some will sit back and absorb the music and experience an occasional tear for the two young people who are in love, others, like me, will look deeper into a time of discontent and feel many emotions that are not exactly joyful. For better or worse, these feelings need to be brought to the surface, because we should never ignore our past, good or bad, but instead remember so we can continue to learn from our mistakes. Either way, I think most will get something different from the movie, but many will still come away with a memorable experience and feel a sense that they have gained something that has furthered their connection to their own reality. This movie will stand out as being above the so many over inflated bells and whistles popcorn type movies, which is a movie with a meaning and a message! -Don Allis</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Originally, I wasn't a Beatles fan. I kind of thought their music all sounded the same, and was really weird (other than a few exceptions like "Hey Jude" and "Let It Be"). This movie totally changed my perspective on it. I've learned to really appreciate the Beatles and their music, which I now think is brilliant, because of the movie. It skillfully mixed multiple references and successfully crammed 30 songs into 2 hrs. The visuals are stunning, and the story was so much better than I expected it to be. The main characters, Jude ("Hey Jude"), Lucy ("Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"), Max ("Maxwell's Silver Hammer"), Prudence ("Dear Prudence"), and Sadie ("Sexy Sadie") help make the story what it is. This isn't a movie where there are few scenes that stand out. The movie as a whole should stay in your mind long after leaving the theater or watching the DVD. Some of my favorite scenes were "I am the Walrus", "Let it Be", and "All You Need is Love". Spectacular cameos were made by Bono and Salma Hayek, who actually sing (SHOCKER). This movie is one that you need to see and enjoy for what it is, not what others expected of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Across the Universe (2007)One of the best musicals in decades. The story by itself even without the songs would have been a great love story, but when you add songs by the Beatles it turns from great to fantastic. At times the film gets a little weird, but at times the Beatles get really weird so its excusable. There's really no bad I can talk about the film besides that. The acting was great, the singing, the writing, the directing, everything worked well together. Its powerful and beautiful and deserves more attention. One thing I was worried about going in that they were gonna cheapen some of the songs. Usually I don't think anyone else should ever touch a Beatles song, because usually they're already perfect. However, they really stayed true to the songs, yet still made them their own Anyone who enjoys musicals, and more so, anyone who enjoys the Beatles, should really love this film. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in the 60's it follows the life of many young people during that time. The main characters are a young woman named Lucy and a young man named Jude. Lucy is an American upper class girl who's boyfriend is away in the war. Her brother is away at college and she lives the normal life of a teenage girl. Jude is a poor boy from Liverpool who is the bastard child of an American soldier. He thinks because his father is at a college that perhaps he is a professor so he goes there to meet him, only to find he is a janitor. He meets up with Max and becomes friends and Max is Lucy's brother. Max drops out of college and he and Jude head to New York where they find a room with Sadie (a hot singer). Soon a guitar player moves in by the name of Jo Jo and after Lucy's man is killed in the war she decides to go crash there as well. Prudence comes in through the bathroom window and makes the house complete.Lucy and Jude fall in love, Sadie and Jojo seek fame and Prudence leaves to find happiness soon after Max is drafted. Jude does art to make money and Lucy gets highly involved in protesting the war. Eventually all the things collide and love and friendship and the beauty of song keep them all together and makes everything all right...All you need is love right? - This movie uses 30 wonderful Beatles songs and references many others as well as other bands from Creedence to Janis to Jimi.What a great movie. I am not always big on musicals but when they get them right its wonderful. Here with such a great band as The Beatles you can't go wrong. This movie was so on point with the way things were in the 60's and how the war made so many people start getting involved with ways of protesting and standing up for our rights. The subtle messages like with Max and Lucy giving up the great wealthy life to go live a not so comfy one in New york, yet New York was the place to be.The direction is absolutely perfect and so many of the sets and colors and locations and all is breathtaking, it is one of the most beautifully shot movies I have ever watched. The actors did an amazing job, Jim Sturgess even looked like a Beatle. Wood did pretty good, although I am not a fan of her work. I liked them adding Joe Cocker in the movie but could have done with out Bono, he is just annoying to me. Salma Hayek is also an actress that disgusts me. Most of the actors did wonderful though.This movie was really good, but it was missing some great Beatles songs. The movie had an ongoing story up until about an hour into it then it kind of went astray. I hated the Benefit of Mr. Kite part and from there on the movie suffered. It got really slow and started adding many parts that had no relevance but were used simply as art. When art goes with the story it's beautiful, but art for arts sake in a film is boring.The first time I watched this film I gave it 9 stars, but here on my 3rd viewing I had to face the facts that the last half of this movie wasn't as fun as the first. I gave it 8 out of 10 stars, cause it is a great film that I highly praise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Safe and not as romance novel as I'd feared</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So... I'm a man. I'm a manly man. I do like intellectual dramas but mainly I like it when stuff BLOWS UP in films. :)Thus I put off seeing Across the Universe, because, from the promos, it looked way too girly, plus I was afraid that the film would be overloaded with awkward plot twists designed to fit the music of the Beatles. In other words, bad.However! Having seen Mamma Mia and enjoyed it, the mishmash of ABBA music turned into a film, I decided to give Across the Universe a shot and enjoyed it quite a bit.True, there are unfortunate twists, like naming one of the characters Jude, which I thought was a heavyhanded excuse to incorporate the song "Hey Jude". And the film definitely glorifies drug use. However, I think it was ultimately true to the 1960s in a way more important than the plot line. It was true in the experiences of the characters.Sort of like how M*A*S*H the movie or TV series, about the Korean War, I mean, you would never have all that stuff happening to one group of people. However, if you pick and choose the biggest stories from hundreds of people's Korean War backgrounds and mash them into one storyline, that's what M*A*S*H is.So, while I found the plot somewhat contrived and unbelievable, with a thin-as-paper lesbian romance, for example, I can believe that each scene by itself says something about the 1960s that matters. There's innocence but there's also war and crime. There's groovy but there's also bummer. The music was often corny in its relation to the plot but - - dang! - everyone loves the Beatles and I did find myself tapping my toes. Plus there's a lot of dancing, as there should be in musicals, to further remind you that the plot line is symbolic and not meant to be taken literally. (In the real literal world, people do not break into synchronized song and dance numbers.)That being said, every song (I think?) had some kind of plot excuse. I can't think of any song in which the characters weren't really singing. Do you know what I mean? Sometimes a film just totally stops, there's singing, and when the song's over, it's like someone's paused the real film for a musical break and then restarts it. But, for example, in the Sound of Music, when there's singing, the plot rolls along, the characters in the film are actually singing. I like that.And the film has a great ending.Such an ending! Thus, I pronounce it safe for you Action Film Guys whose girlfriends really want to rent it. You will survive, I promise. Just don't let her get the Princess Diaries!! :)I'll give Across the Universe a solid but not classic 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It just might be the best Musical ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Across the universe is a mind altering substance so far out there the trailer will give you a contact high.The music is, of course a large selection of the Beetles best, skillfully performed, easily meeting the bands standards and a rousing rendition of "Hey Jude" that's so moving and heartfelt that to my ears it's actually better the Beetles version. Oddly, you might not expect a musical to have some of the most stellar visuals in film history, but this movie showcases a unique set of eye candy best watched by fans of the surreal, it actually make "Yellow Submarine" look tame. The story comes off all little bit like "Hair", but instead of the traditional Hippies are good, Government is bad mentality (common in these 60s remembrance films) it shows a much more realistic depiction of life. It's the first movie of it's kind to acknowledge that while hippies may have had the right idea most of them were lazy and kind of useless and some of the revolutionary ones were just terrorists. It's a very realistic world shown through the eyes of an artist, an artist frequently on something at that, but what centers it is that it retains the overarching War Is Bad love is Good message.If there is anything bad about it it's how may relevant characters (which might be why the movies so long) and none of them are fully developed, but there not suppose to be, this movies about emotion and reality, and the real life rarely has closure. Honestly there's nothing I'd change about it, the characters are all very real and as such memorable and relatable.In short, if you like the beetles or musicals you will die with regret for not seeing this visual and auditor masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone who grew up around the time the film was set I have to say that this film goes a long way to evoke the feelings of the time using the songs of the Beatles so eloquently. I was at the US Embassy protest in 68' and the Isle of White Festival in 70' so I speak from personal experience. The director deserves great commendation for giving us such a wealth of Beatles songs so brilliantly slotted into the story line. I loved the choreography and I sure that if this was put on Broadway or the West End it would run in equal measure to Mama Mia if not better. Why this film did not recoup its initial outlay is a total mystery as it shines way above the likes of High School Musical etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stunning, original and charming musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During this decade, something that I have noticed is the lack of proper and serious musicals. One of my personal favorites, "Rent" was a nice adaptation of the play but the whole merit was Jonathan Larson's (R.I.P.) "Mamma Mia!" was very amusing to watch, and I kept singing Abba songs for weeks. But, when the purpose of the movie is to maintain catchy songs that already existed, along with the image of the scene in your brain, "Across the Universe" wins the jackpot. Before watching this movie, my only memories of the Beatles' songs were those of Mom's Day Festival at elementary school, singing "Obladi-Oblada" in front of a small auditorium, shaking like I was in the Antarctica when I saw everyone was looking at us. Those certainly weren't good memories. "Across..." made me a Beatles' fanatic, and still now, 2 years later, when I listen to "Come Together" I remember my favorite scene of the entire film: JoJo arriving at New York, while executives, bums, pimps and prostitutes were singing and dancing. That is the whole credit of Taymor's masterpiece: take old Beatles song that were already famous and make you remember them in a completely different context. I'll never listen to "I Want You" without seeing Uncle Sam pointing at me and singing it. The film is stunning from the aesthetic point of view, original because of the whole construction of the storyline based on the songs and charming because of its mood.****1/2 out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its been said that if you remember the '60s you weren't really there. Well, I was there, in many of the same places and circumstances this film covers, and let me say: It is real. Indeed, it is the first 'true' film about the '60s that I've seen. True, not to fact (the story is fictional), but to the spirit of the times. That it mixes romance with this truthfulness of spirit is its strength.The film works on many levels. It is a concept film - one must go in accepting this and making some allowance for it - but the too-real '60s situations of the principle characters holds it together.The working in the extensive Beatles songbook is amazingly natural and in most cases unforced. Indeed, after seeing this film one '60s musician friend of mine said that she only now fully appreciates what great song writers Lennon, McCartney and Harrison really were.As to my own reaction - I was so stunned by the emotions the film raised that I had to sit in silence for some minutes when it ended to get control of my feelings. And I must add that this was not due so much to my connection with the music as with my connection with those extraordinarily painful times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>if you're a music lover, you'll love this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this movie, cause i like the music. and the acting, and the singing and the visual and the everything. sure, it's not as real as Star Wars, but it's pretty good. maybe a few songs from Napalm Death would've set it justice, but that would've gone against the Beatles theme.. i liked it. So with that lacking, the rest of which i have to type and not have any idea of what to say because this opinion fits perfectly with the movie because... if you don't know anything about the white album, which i'm sure most of it's from, then it won't make sense. but damn is it good, and this will reconnect you old-schoolers back to it... after a long run of poop for music. i really do love Napalm Death. hey Barney!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over use of autotune...grrrr!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only managed the first 9 minutes of this movie, which is a shame as even in that short time I got the impression that it would be quite watchable. The reason I couldn't watch, or rather, hear, any more, was purely because of the gratuitous and heavy handed use of autotune on all the sung vocals. Even in parts where the singing was part of the dialogue, where one would expect the singing to be slightly out of tune, somebody in the production team had decided it would be best to process the vocals to such an extreme that I couldn't listen to them. Yes I'm a musician, and yes this is already a pet hate of mine (so often a perfectly good vocal performance is made to sound like a robot because it's a few cents out), but seriously, at times the autotune is so obvious it becomes almost reminiscent of Cher's famous pop song, "Believe" (Do you believe in life after love?...) It was so distracting that I couldn't watch the movie, which I feel is such a shame as the actors/actresses (or their voice doubles) are clearly talented vocalists and needn't have been subject to such treatment - or at least not to such a degree.I'm disappointed, disheartened and extremely annoyed. What a waste. Grrrrrrrrrrr.....!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't much care for this film the first time I saw it, however during the second viewing, I began to understand what the director had intended and in subsequent viewings, I grew to not only just love it, but admire it's brilliance! With the exception of one or two songs, the story is not driven just to include another Beatles song....rather each song chosen ENHANCES the storyline. And thankfully for CGI (or whatever, Salma Hykek portrays ALL five dancing/singing nurses at the same time. Eddie Izzard is truly great, in an almost impromptu performance of FOR THE BENEFIT OF MR KITE. The main performances, by mostly unknowns, all very well done. Never over the top. The singing is great (who know EVAN RACHEL WOOD could sing, too, after her stellar acting work in THIRTEEN). Jim Surgess, Joe Anderson and Dana Fuchs are wonders to behold and have great work ahead of them, too.The is NOTHING not to like about this film. It does NOT exist for 30 music videos of Beatle music. The surviving Beatles (and Yoko and George Harrison's wife) loved the film, and it is easy to see why. This movie USES their music....it doesn't exist BECAUSE of the film.A perfect evocation of the times and....well, just perfect!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Q: Are We Not Walruses? A: No, We Are the Eggmen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a feeling someone might, immediately after seeing Across the Universe, accuse it of pretension. Well, duh! It is a musical, after all. Okay, so, true, it is more pretentious than most musicals -- it's even been dubbed the Beatles musical. But it's also more creative. It assumes a world where the Beatles never existed, and it hardly has much time to mention anything that was happening in music at the time (nor does it have much sense of chronology, really).But this might be missing the point: anyone looking for the subtext is taking the film too seriously. Let's be honest, this is Julie Taymor -- she's one of the most visually creative directors in film, and here she outdoes herself. Take for instance the hilarious retake on "I Want You (She's So Heavy)," the exquisitely-manicured mash of prog-rock and minimalism from "Abbey Road." Who wants whom? Why, Uncle Sam wants Max (Joe Anderson) as part of the army for the Vietnam War. And who's so heavy? Well, apparently Lady Liberty.Or how about Joe Cocker's turn as the star of "Come Together"? Cocker personifies the song, giving one of the best performances. Equally engaging is Eddie Izzard (the alliteration gets annoying, doesn't it?) as Mr. Kite in the fun-house version of the circus of "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite." Most of the songs are interpreted pretty cleverly. Some aren't, though. Bono's turn as Dr. Robert, the author of a book called "I Am the Walrus," leads the cast in a rather boring version of what I had always thought to be a song that was completely impossible to ruin (c'mon, "goo goo g'joob" is a lyric, how can you ruin that?). The other annoying renditions are of "Sexy Sadie" and "Dear Prudence," if you're wondering.So you may be asking: is there a plot? Well, kinda sorta. It's a prototypical love story about a guy named Jude and a girl named Lucy (most of the characters are named after Beatles' title song characters), and it's about their living through the turbulence of the 60s. Does that sound lame? Yeah, it is.But Across the Universe is mostly an elaborate series of music videos, filled with good performances and renditions, and fully engaging. Taymor has outdone herself in indulging herself. This is not a great film, but it's entertaining whether you know the songs beforehand or not. I liked it... goo goo g'joob.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing: Need to Watch It Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like so many of my contemporaries, I am a lifelong Beatles fan. Like Moulin Rouge and Tommy, or any of the Beatles' movies, this drags us into their milieu. It also has elements of A Clockwork Orange. It is certainly provocative and seems to escaped from the late sixties or early seventies. The anti-war message introduces a group of characters who find they have been reconditioned for combat. There is the embedded love story, and, for the most part, pretty cool renditions of the Beatles' songs. There was a little too much White Album for me, but these songs show a kind of nihilism and sadness that the early ones didn't have. It's a movie that went too fast for me and I will have to rent again. It never came near my home in its theater debut. It's a little gem that bears watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't get enough of this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw the trailer when I went to see another movie and I remember saying "I need to see that" then I never heard anything else about it. I'm guessing it had a limited theater release. I happened to finally see it on Starz on Demand and I was blown away! As soon as it was over I hit start over and watched it again.The music is great. All the actors sing so it's not cheesy lip syncing. It's not the typical musical mainly because it's Beatles music. Each song is specific to the scene, so instead of the characters giving the exposition in the form of dialog, it comes in the form of a song. The songs are great, because they're different. They've all been altered to fit the mood of the scene. It sounds like it would be blasphemous to alter music that's already great, but in this film it really works.The visuals are stunning. There are some scenes in which the visuals fit so well it's uncanny. The one with the draft office and then the nurse scene are just spot on in the way the graphics relay the underlying message. Don't want to spoil anything so I'll leave it at that, but add that if this movie had been done with an IMAX 3-D version it would have been a blinder! The cast is perfect! Everyone just *fits* their role and they all play their character so well. I also really appreciated that it wasn't full of big bill celebrities. There were a few people that made you say "oh wasn't he/she in that one movie...oh what was it???" you know how that goes? Even the big name cameos made you look twice and say "Was that really Joe Cocker?" All in all two thumbs up. I loved it. I'm watching it again (for the ...well I lost count how many times now) right now. =D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So, the movie musical isn't dead. The Beatles will be forever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The hardest thing about writing about "Across The Universe" is figuring out where to start. There are just so many things that, for me, make this movie such a great experience, and an experience that can, and should be enjoyed over and over. I'm not going to say that if you like The Beatles, you'll like Across The Universe. Many people will, a few won't.Before I go any further, a confession: I was born in 1963, some of the first music I remember hearing was The Beatles, I've been listening, intently, to The Beatles since then.When I first heard of a musical, with nothing but Beatles songs, I was both intrigued and concerned. The idea really appealed to me, but the horror story that became "Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" (1978) came to mind.Happy to say that Julie Taymor and her creative team didn't disappoint. "Across The Universe" fast became one of my favorite films. This is a smart film, that respects it's audience and has great respect for The Beatles. It also gives us a small, and somewhat safe window on the 60's. It's not "Easy Rider", and that's okay. It still tells it's story, and does it sometimes against a lovely psychedelic canvas.Watching T.V. Carpio (Prudence) singing "I Want To Hold You hand" surprised and moved me in ways I would have never imagined. I loved "I Want To Hold Your Hand" as a great song, and as Classic Beatles, T.V. Carpio made me love it all over again, in a completely different way. Amazing!! I'm watching it again, as I write these words. It's worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm exaggerating when I say: This is the most amazing film I've ever seen. "Moulin Rouge" just fades next to "Across the universe". I mean, "Across the universe" has a better soundtrack, more natural and respectful, and how could it be bad with the Beatles' music? All the songs are sung with such a passion by a group of actors that includes almost only fresh faces: and each one has a beautiful voice and stunning artistic skills, especially Jim Sturgess (Jude, so gorgeous) and Dana Fuchs (Sadie, so Joplinesque). Director Julie Taymor crafts tastefully absolutely beautiful scenes that are eye-candy and ear-candy, and never shows dangerous fallings into the cheesy and the kitch. And cinematography, costumes, sets, all top notch. Do you know where the injustice is this time? The movie is splendid, original, almost revolutionary, but the Academy ignores it. That's the sad story of any true masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually original and energetic musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I am not normally a fan of musicals. But I do like Beatles songs. And the way they present them will have them stuck in your head for days. Jim Sturgess and Joe Anderson are very appealing male leads and Evan Rachel Wood is a fine actress, not to mention pretty damn easy on the eyes. The singing was very good and the choreography was fantastic. The production is quite sumptuous as was the cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel. Julie Taymor and her team went ape with the production and milk it for all its worth. It gives it a good feel of the changing era but at the same time gives it a certain fantasy element.On the storyline front, I liked that they managed to weave a love story and the darkening of this country's ethics into this. That is most definitely a story that these songs could have told. Unfortunately, not enough time is spent on the supporting characters and towards the middle, the whole Eddie Izzard sequence was just too damn weird even for my tastes. But fortunately, it picks up again and drives home the tragedy of the Vietnam War and how it tore apart this country.Now if you are very liberal about your artistic tastes and believes that visuals can speak just as well as words then this will give you a good tribute to the freedom of the 60s.</fullReview>

Most of the actors were unknowns which i believe was a very good idea but the downside to having unknowns is people not wanting to see a movie with actors and actresses they've never even heard of. I think the director did a good job with picking The Beatles songs that are in the movie she used the iconic songs and matched the scenes with the songs brilliantly. This movie is definitely a buy rather than a rent because you find something new in the story and visually every time. This movie is perfect to watch with friends over popcorn.</fullReview>

They sang the songs pretty close to the way the were sung originally. The art in the movie was great, really creative and the way they made the entire movie go along with the songs is most ingenious. Whoever thought of it really deserves an award. Some of the Beatles songs didn't make any sense to me till i saw this movie. It was like they took the song and just made a visual of it. We need more of these types of movies and less of the random action movies, half of them are no good anyways.

		<fullReview>I have become quite jaded when it comes to movies. This one blew my socks off! Not even kidding . . .The concept is contrived (we saw it before with Momma Mia, i.e. shoe-horning in a story around songs written in an entirely different context), however here, in this movie, the use of the Beatles songs did not feel contrived. Rather, the viewer was left with the opposite impression -- how creative a team must have been behind this movie to make the musical interludes work so well! In addition, the production, performance and singing on all of the songs was outstanding.It's a little slow getting going, but if you let yourself get about 30 minutes in, you will laugh, cry, fall in love and generally have a great time. Another reviewer mentioned that after finishing watching this movie, he felt like he'd experienced a "moviegoing moment," i.e. where a movie so touched you, you felt changed at the end. That's how I felt after watching this movie. I can't wait to get my friends to see it as well. If I had to describe it in a few words, using other movies as comparisons, I'd say "A historic romance in the vein of "Moulon Rouge" crossed with "Once" and interpreted through the music of the Beatles." Loved it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheap - a fade copy of sixties movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only young or very young people could love this movie. It is superficial, no originality, a fade copy of sixties movies. In England a bunch of smart producers took ABBA's music and put together a stupid story Mamma Mia. Here very talented people took the Beattles' music and put together a movie. I really hope it is not a new fashion. The movie itself is a salad of things we saw in Help, Mystery Magic Tour, Easy Rider, Aquarius, and a hundred other movies and video clips. Some characters are insipid people based on Jimmy Hendrix, Janis Joplin, or just "Prudence that came in through the bathroom window". Like Prudence the name of the main character is Jude so there is no big intellectual effort to link the movie with the music. In general, the association of the story with the music is cheap. But the main question is really why Vietnam and the sixties? Is Julie Taymor afraid to touch issues such as Iraq and Bush's society? Too controversial for 2006? She did a good job in Frida. Is she not ready to go far from that? I must confess the story is not stupid as Mamma Mia, the movie itself is very beautiful and the music performance is impressive. However, even so, the whole thing left a bad taste. Cheap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been searching for any kind of website to contact the director and writers of this movie to express my love and appreciation for this beautiful story. Please excuse my incorrect grammar, misspelled words and lack of creativity in my story below. I just had to comment in hopes that the creators and actors know, what they have created, is an absolute master piece.My mother shared her love for the Beatles all my life. When she heard about this movie she immediately rented it. She made us, her kids, buy her the soundtrack the very next weekend for Mothers Day. The first song I heard, "All My Lovin", I got chills down my spine. I thought, "WOW, these guys have done an AWESOME job recreating these timeless classics." Even though the Beatles were not in my era/generation I have always had a passion for their music. I live in big Ole', hick Texas and someone asked a group of people one day, "who do you like better? The Beatles or Elvis Presley?" Of course being in Texas everyone responded, "Elvis". I was the ONLY one who chose the Beatles. How can you NOT love the Beatles? They were the true innovators of an "open mind" at that time. They sang about everything no body wanted to talk about in those days. Not only were they not afraid to say it, but they put it in ways that lured you into accepting these changes.I am a very boring married mother of 3 and I'm about to turn 30 in July. After I heard the sound track, the same weekend I rented the movie. I was glued, dazing at the screen as I watched the incredible performances from the actors and the unbelievable creativity of the story. I told my mother, "I want the CD and the DVD for my birthday...." I called her 2 days later and said, "you'll have to get me the CD, I just bought the DVD." A week later I called her again, "I guess you'll have to get me the T-shirt because I just bought the DELUX CD with ALL the songs." She was jealous because her soundtrack only had a few. Now, I am obsessed, I have the ring tones and everything.Also, I am a VERY devout Christian and I know the song, "Across the Universe" has the phrase, "Jai Guru Deva". Which can be interpreted several different ways. The interpretation I liked the most says "Thanks to my Heavenly Teacher". Even though John Lennon may be referring to a Hindui teacher we as Christians can refer to our teacher, Jesus, while listening to this song. We all obviously have the same priority LOVE not HATE.Please rent this movie, it's well worth your time. For the younger generations, don't look at this as a musical, it's merely a long music video. Open your ears, your eyes, your mind and enjoy."Nothing's Gonna Change MY World" because "All you need is LOVE" PEACE</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Across the Universe will likely go down in history as the movie that "got it right" in terms of translating the Beatles' music to the big screen, but part of me thinks that they haven't quite got it yet.Let's summarize major Beatles' movies to date: A Hard Day's Night had music translated into a film, and although it was amateurish and manic, they did well.Help! had music translated into a film, an although even MORE manic, did OK.Magical Mystery Tour had music translated into a film, and was a mess. I could barely sit through 20 minutes of it.Yellow Submarine was a very good mix of music/film, with a bit of non sequiter.Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was a wacky interpretation of more Beatles' music than it should've been, tainted by the music producers of the 70's. It was definitely a product of its time.Across the Universe was a simplistic love story spanned over two countries interspersed with real-life events. Charming, but shallow. Nostalgia and music carry the brunt of the film. It is the Forrest Gump of Beatles' music movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Julie Taymor is one of the most talented persons alive today. Luckily for us, she is also able to perform and expose her work as the head of a collection of wonderful artists who are part of her crew whom I am not personally acquainted with, but in a metaphysical way, I respect them truthfully.Across is a great musical which is not restrained only in focusing on the main couple love story and actually reaches towards more "universal" subjects with seriousness and competence. The non-literal interpretation of the lyrics meaning is linked perfectly with the script as John Carney's Once is being one of the best things in both. Perhaps the downfall is the acting of the main couple. I was surprisingly disappointed with Wood and Sturgess lack of continuity. The shine in their eyes are blurred by weak dialogs specially in the jealousy scenes preceding their temporarily break-up.The technical aspects as a musical and a psychedelic tribute achieve masterful results making it a must see for fans of the genre, not to mention if you're a Beatles freak. The film reaches its peak in With a Little Help, Come Together, Happiness is a Warm Gun, and the "Salvador Dali" surrealistic homage superbly performed by Eddie Izzard (who you might remember as Charles Chaplin in Peter Bogdanovich The Cat's Meow).Following Milos Forman's Hair mixed with James Cameron's Titanic love affair, the formula inevitably works, for the songs and Julie are part of human patrimony.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Acroos the Universe should be better analyzed as an experiment than as a "normal" movie.The film,as an experiment,results to be very interesting and it challenges the spectator.The performances are phenomenal.Jim Sturgess brings a great performance but the best performance of the movie is made by Evan Rachel Wood,who back to confirm she's one of the best young actresses of our days.The musical parts are amazing.They are not only visually beautiful but they are also perfectly done.They all feel very natural.I do not know if I can recommend Across the Universe to everyone.I think this is a very interesting experiment but I perfectly understand this movie will not be liked by everyone.But,in my case,I liked it pretty much.Across the Universe is an unusual movie and that's a very good achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Instead of watching it, try listening to a real Beatles album.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Across the Universe is a musical set in a world where The Beatles don't exist but everybody constantly sings Beatles songs. I say that The Beatles don't exist because surly somebody would have said, "Instead of listening to all these Beatles covers, why don't we just listen to the originals?" Covering Beatles songs is a very difficult task - one which this movie mostly fails - because the original songs are so good, it is hard to add anything original and new to them. What is more difficult is trying to cram 20 or so Beatles songs into a movie that is trying to maintain a cohesive plot. This leads to a lot of points in the movie where you think to yourself "What does this singing and dancing sequence have anything at all to do with what's going on?" The plot is really simplistic and unoriginal, though it obviously only exists to fill in the moments when the people aren't singing, however, I have to admit that the acting is pretty good. But every time a character uttered a line like "Hi, my name is Prudence" or "This is my sister, Lucy" I cringed at the thought of hearing another poorly covered song about them. I did think that the actor who played Jude was pretty good, but that's mostly because he did a very good Paul McCartney impression while singing.Overall the movie was long, boring, and pointless. Though I applaud the film makers for being able to make U2's Bono (playing the role of Dr. Robert) look like even more of a douche bag than he already is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just not that good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm kind of shocked to see so many positive reviews here, as I grabbed this movie last night on a whim (my eldest daughter remembered the trailer and generally Eddie Izzard is worth watching) and it was just not a very good movie.Oh, visually it was interesting; but the story was beyond naive, the principal characters were cardboard and the soundtrack--the movie's selling point judging by the marketing--was just awful.First off, and I hope I'm not ruining it for anyone, but it's a lesser version of "Hair".Honestly, the same ground is covered in much the same way as in Hair, but it takes longer (*far* longer) and the characters are far less likable.And the music! I like the Beatles just fine, but the re-imaginings of the songs can (with the exception of Bono's version of "I am the Walrus") could best be described as "Slow it down and make it somber" Seriously. A huge proportion of the songs are a single character sitting introspectively and singing slowly and breathily.The first time it happens it's an interest take on classic Beatles tunes. The Second time? Still an interesting idea...the third? I'm seeing a pattern forming.By the umpteenth time it happens (like when the artist kid is drawing a still life of fruit and, seeing a Strawberry, launches into "Strawberry Fields Forever" my eyes are getting tired from the rolling.My daughter excused herself at about the halfway point to go do something else. I wish I had joined her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had no idea what to expect from this film; I didn't read Thing One about it because I wanted it to be a complete surprise. All I knew from the commercials was a) it was set to the Beatles' music and b) the cinematography looked interesting. From the minute it began, with Jude sitting on the beach, opening his mouth and singing, a live, pure, quiet, respectfully arranged version of "Girl," I was intrigued. The entire film celebrated the powerful music and lyrics of Lennon/McCartney/Harrison/Starr, and wove them into real characters facing real life, all named - well, I'm not going to go there for fear of spoiling some of the delights of the film. If you know the Beatles' music, stay alert for fun little references to their work throughout. I don't want to spoil it for anyone so I won't say any more, except that the acting, singing, dancing, story, script and graphics were phenomenal. I am buying this DVD because I want to go back and watch the entire film with commentary. Wonderful - even for teens - because while there are sexual scenes and drug usage, it still gives what I feel is a historically accurate picture of what was going on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So, what's the purpose of a movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To enjoy or not enjoy? To be critical? I feel for those in the minority who won't &amp; can't have a good time with this movie. It's as if they'd rather be stuck in "hell" - there own (if there were such a place). I felt very moved emotionally by this film, &amp; wonder if it will be like the Wizard of Oz where it eventually becomes a major classic. The singing was awesome - every song, with such sincerity &amp; some with close-ups as they were we being sung. The background was so great. All the connections to the Beatles, the 60's, &amp; the challenges of that day are so well expressed in a creative way. I loved the special effects! I hope they get all sorts of awards, etc. Truly amazing video display - psychedelic. Some people just hate life as it is now, &amp; it all came about starting in the 60's for some, but was embraced by the others in the 70's. Nope, it's not Donna Reed (who? or those shows in the 50's. Not Lawerence Welk or Grand Ole Operie. I think you have to have liked being young, think/feel like your're young, be tolerant, like young people, &amp; essentially know who you are &amp; not just think of yourself as defined by what you do (someday you won't be able to do anything at all on this planet). I don't support drugs, just their legalization (for some). But if this technology was available back then &amp; this movie came out then, I think a lot of people would want to get into the drug world (mushrooms?). All 4 Beatles or their representatives gave this movie a thumbs up! Cool! Could it be that those who poohed-poohed it did so because they are anti-drugs &amp; pro-war. That's not "bad", just "in the box". Nothing's wrong with that - being/living in the last century or previous. I love the Pransters' bus ride through the country. It was SO gloriously colorful, so Renaisance, &amp; one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen! See this movie, but with no expectation, just abundant expectancy &amp; openness (to fun, entertainment, joy, &amp; being pleased - or is that a s.i.n?). It's kind of a Forrest Gump type of movie, just a different angle. And they're both "me"! The way to see this movie is "high", but just not on drugs - duh. High on life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Julie Taymor once again uses her considerable innovative magic to create a film that not only is mesmerizingly beautiful to watch, but also a 'semi-documentary' about the world changes that occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s as young people for the first time spoke out against the war in Vietnam, the death of Martin Luther King, and the senseless mayhem that extended from the battlefields of Vietnam to the streets of America, all set to the significant, timely music of the Beatles. It sounds like an impossible juxtaposition of themes and ideas, but in Taymor's hands it succeeds. Opening in Liverpool, England (where the Beatles began their impact on music and thought) we met Jude (Jim Sturgess), a working class boy with the gifts of an artist who decides to set off on a sea journey to meet the father he has never known. Once in New York he meets Max (Joe Anderson) and Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) who represent the wealthy class, but who both show roots of rebellion against the comfortable norm and an objection to the war that is festering like an abscess in the rice paddies of Vietnam. Jude meets his janitor father in a union that is anticlimactic, and in disappointment he falls in with Max, living the artists' life in the Village with free-wheeling singer Sadie (Dana Fuchs), her beau/guitarist JoJo (Martin Luther) and their newest tenant Prudence (T.V. Carpio), an Asian girl trying to find her place in a confusing world. The group eventually bond with music and rebellion mixed with free love and the passion that they can make a difference, while around them racial crises are at a peak and the draft tags many of the young men (including Max) for the war they cannot condone. From all of this turmoil the story builds to a climax leading to some very touching scenes that convey the spirit of the times and the overriding importance of love and understanding in a world torn apart by political and racial crises. The cast is strong with each of the actors singing their own versions of various Beatle songs very well (the division between singing and spoken dialect favors the former). But the real magic comes from Julie Taymor's mixture of hallucinogenic visuals, wonderfully choreographed crowd scenes, and ingenious movement from reality scenes displayed on the television to the reactive scenes of the world as viewed through the eyes of the youths and the lyrics of the songs. It is at once touching in its ability to recreate a particular period of history and wholly entertaining in the inventive use of music/dance/visual effects/drama. This film is important now and will only increase in stature as a document of that trouble but exciting time in the history of the world. We can only wonder why the youth of today are not responding to the Iraq War in a like manner, or, more uncomfortable to consider, why we now adults can't muster the same degree of distress about the myriad traumas that are still happening 'Across the Universe'.

		<shortDescription>Music was fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I am a freshman in high school and I absolutely love this decade that this film was supposed to take place in. I have never been too major of a Beatles fan but I am a fan of many other bands of the decade. At my school, freshman were RAVING about this movie. Personally, I find freshman to be stupid and I don't think they understood anything in this movie. They probably just liked the music and played along with the crowed and said it was fantastic. This movie was not fantastic. It was descent. The plot was very...blank. So to speak. I felt as if you couldn't really connect with any of the characters. There is also the fact that I am a extremely conservative person and this movie was extremely liberal. It is kind of hard to enjoy a movie when you don't agree with anything in it. The only reason I give this film 6 stars is because the music is very catchy. Now you may hear people say its so "artsy", I personally thought it seemed like whoever created or directed this movie was trying too hard to be artsy, if that makes sense? All in all, see this movie, it's descent. It's worth the $3 at the video store but don't be surprised if you aren't overly impressed.Also may I add, I took it as Sadie represents Janis Joplin and Jojo represents Jimi Hendrix. I may be wrong but to me that is the way it appeared. I mean guitar hero and rockin chick...okay maybe I'm wrong!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An original musical film, Across The Universe is a fictional love story set in the 1960s amid the turbulent years of anti-war protest, the struggle for free speech and civil rights, mind exploration and rock and roll. At once gritty, whimsical and highly theatrical, the story moves from high schools and universities in Massachusetts, Princeton and Ohio to the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the Detroit riots, Vietnam and the dockyards of Liverpool. A combination of live action and animation, the film is paired with many songs by The Beatles that defined the time.Note: I am not a Beatles' fan. I have never been one and probably will never be, even after watching this film. I am only familiar with a couple of their more famous songs and I'm a fan of musicals. Now, I will say this film is extremely creative with its art direction, production design, choreograph, and anything else from the brilliant mind of Julie Taymor. However, I was kind of disappointed with the film as a musical.I really don't like much of the Beatles' songs. In the film, you'll hear about 35. Out of those selected 35 songs, I would count 3 as some very good songs and 7 as good songs. Yeah, I'm not really into their music as much as the billions of people around the world. I just expected better songs, you know? However, I enjoyed the film.When you first watch this film, it's hard to determine whether you will like or hate the film. In fact, it can polarize audiences. I felt like I could've hated or loved the film because some musical spots were fantastic and creative while others are incredibly horrible, in my opinion. I did like the cameo by Bono.The new, fresh faces in this movie is good. As an ensemble, they're decent, compared to other ensemble-type musical films. The story, unfortunately, is kind of predictable. You might already know what happens to the guy and the girl and the whole formulaic thing behind that.If you're a Beatles' fan, I don't know if you will like the film or not. I'm not so sure. I'm just an outsider who was just excited to see a musical, in which so many people I knew loved. This film could probably make you hate what they've done with The Beatles or love The Beatles even more because you've seen this film. It's your choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I did not grow up in the era of the Beatles, I have to say that I did grow up with some of their music. My uncle who lived with my mom and I up until I was 13 would play their CD's and old records whenever he had the chance.I've seen a lot of complaints about this movie from people that grew up with the original Beatles and I have to say that I completely disagree. While the original's were rather good, the way that this particular movie captured the essence of the Beatles and that particular era was rather amazing.Across The Universe is different, edgy, fun, and a musical. What's not to love? The entire storyline was brilliant and although I can't go through every movie ever made, I have to say that the way the film was brought to life was entirely different than anything I, personally have ever seen or heard of. Making a movie with most characters being based on names in popular Beatles songs was just unique and that made this movie refreshing.While the majority of films created in 2008 have been lacking in something, Across The Universe went above and beyond to produce something both unique and amazing.All in all this movie gets a 10 out of 10 star rating. And if the scores went any higher, it would get that too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in the sixties this film tells the story of a guy called Jude, living in Liverpool and working like many men of that time at the docks, and having little money to spend. Sick of the job and the little prospects it shows he decides to go the USA and test his luck there.Some films get released and work because of a gimmick. This is one of those films. The gimmick in this case being the fact that the most of the dialog is converted into people singing songs previously done by The Beatles. For this to work out most of the film is build around the opportunity to sing a song - but it is done so well that its storyline is actually good enough to make the combination work out.The film is attractive visually as well - some of the color schemes are pretty wild but they match the setting. Most characters are played out well enough and all of them fit the theme of the film. Hence, all added together, there's the makings of a great artistic film with a high entertainment value.8 out of 10 songs covered</fullReview>

Most songs used, especially in the first half of the film, are strategically used to help the story and not just thrown in gratuitously (except "Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite," which the film could've done without.) The performances are strong and the choreography, music, and visuals are astounding. There are places in the second half of the film that could've used some help in editing to improve the pacing (the second half drags from Bono onward) but it's still a must see for any Beatles fan. I would also recommend Moulin Rouge, an extraordinary musical that also uses contemporary pop songs to tell a story (and in my opinion, done better by Baz Luhrmann than Taymor).</fullReview>

Its all set to the music of the Beatles.Julie Taymor has fashioned a musical that tries to do too much (cover the social upheavals of second half of the decade) while skimping on plot (the love story kind of is never fully developed-it just is taken for granted). thankfully her choice to use the Beatles classics drives the film forward when all else fails. The music brings the emotions the story is lacking. Lets face it there are times I was reduced to tears- the first time was the stunning Let It Be. Most of the musical segments are "Wow" inducing treats that get an added kick by the flimsy plot line.This is one of those movies you'll want to share with people because it is an amazing (though flawed) experience.

They are there all the time but still are absent. It's funny and strange in the first encounter when the guys could blow their fingers off without anything actually held between them and gets pretty seamless as the movie progresses but I still consider it to be a betrayal of the spirit of the movie for PG-13 rating. The movie is a little less true to its message but it definitely didn't spoil it for me and most people won't even notice it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is an interesting concept, make up a story and tell it through a series of popular Beatles songs. The characters will sometimes have the same name as the character in the song, like 'Jude' and 'Lucy'.The period is the 1960s when the Beatles were at the height of their popularity and there was turmoil in the USA, including race riots and discontent over the Viet Nam conflict. Evan Rachel Wood, who sings very well, is Lucy Carrigan, about to graduate from high school. Her sweetheart goes off into the military.Brit Jim Sturgess is Jude, in England, who finds out that his father is an American GI from the war, working at Princeton University, where he travels to look for him. 'Just so we will both know about each other.'Brit Joe Anderson plays Lucy's brother Max Carrigan, who becomes best friends with Jude. Jude and Lucy eventually develop a love relationship.I was a college student in the 1960s when the Beatles invaded America. While I like them and agree that their's was a permanent influence on popular music, I was never a Beatles fanatic. So for me this movie was just 'OK.' The story was contrived to make use of the lyrics and the characters in the sings, and that works pretty well. There are some great visuals and all the characters are competent to good singers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was raised by a huge Beatles fan so when I first saw this preview while watching Hairspray, I knew I was going to have to go and see it. The beginning of the movie is very fun and put together in a beautiful way that is original and refreshing. The second half of the movie is somewhat of an acid trip to music, but it's still good all in all. Eddie Izzard (who I was ecstatic to see because I love him in the Riches) was great in the Mr. Kite segment. It's not only a musical but a great love story. Yes, some things maybe a little predictable, but all-in-all it's still wonderful. I must agree that you need to watch this movie with an open mind, if you don't you will shut it down towards the middle. But give it a chance, stick it out, and at the end, even if you feel a little confused, you will look back on it with love. I was afraid to recommend it to my mother who loves the Beatles, but I bought the soundtrack for her before the film was released and she loved it. So I encouraged her to watch the movie, but just to be aware that some parts may be a little off to her, but she loved it as well. She said it was a great justice to the Beatles and she would watch again. I ran out and bought it the minute it came out on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what you expect ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you first hear the concept for the movie you're first reaction, like mine, is "huh?". How is that even possible? I don't know. It's not a bad movie by any means. It's just... interesting. This is one of those movies that when you try to explain it to someone you it comes down to you saying, "You have to see it to get it." You can't say too much about songs used otherwise you ruin the surprise of usage.The concept may seem contrived and stupid but it's in fact not. You get sucked in from the very beginning. The songs are placed perfectly, sometimes to a point where it's annoying or irritating. But you have to love it anyway. It's not the picture as a whole that gets you it's the little parts that make it up that do. The characters quirks, especially Max, soon make you feel for these characters and then it doesn't let you go.By the end of the movie you're wondering to yourself what the heck did I just watch. The ending seems strange at first but then you think about, and you realize it's perfect. I had to re-watch it right after I was done watching it the first time. The movie is not going to change your life, but then again most movies don't. It's a very entertaining, fun watch that you leave from taking away just a general good feeling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful social commentary on the 1960's told through some of the greatest 'Beatles' songs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was excited about this movie when I first saw the trailers for it. Both my parents are huge 'Beatles' fans so I grew up listening to them and I to am a big fan. I finally got to see this movie over the weekend and i have to say It's one of the best I have ever seen. The movie gives accurate portrayals of the '60s, peace activists, views on drugs and incorporates a band that's impact on the world is still strong today. The movie is fun and has a happy peaced out mood but also shows the heartbreaking realities of war without ruining the mood. The 'Beatle's' covers are amazing, All are well done (I recommend the soundtrack!). The drug trips are very magical and mesmerizing. This film an incredible trip that everyone can take. I highly, highly recommend this! (BTW some people have claimed the "Fake" British accents are bad but um yeah Jim Sturgess is um... FROM ENGLAND!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up loving the Beatles (parental influence) an I have an artistic loving heart.... so I was so excited to see this movie, and fell in love with it before the first song was over. Now I have alway been a sucker for the eclectic movie ( Rocky Horror picture show and Grease are in my regular circulation) and I love how the song and dance production do not take away or make you forget there is a story, but enhance it and help tell it. I also love that none of the headliners are known but will be after this. They are all every talented and beautiful people who deserve every gift given to them. i would recommend it to any to watch at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of this years best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So when I heard there would be a musical using Beatles songs and Taymor's visions I immediately began waiting for a masterpiece. I was not let down by any means. I have enjoyed Taymor's work from the time I had seen "Titus", her take on Shakepeare's bloodiest play. She is always entertaining and a joy to all the senses. This is no exception. It is both visually stunning and lyrical. First I have to mention the amazing covers of the Beatles songs. From the slowed down "Hold your hand" to the trippy "Dear Prudence" they never let you down. Even the instrumental score is wonderful. But when you take those songs and allow some of Hollywood's brightest to get their hands on them you have cinematic genius. Which leads me into the cast. Jim Sturgess is someone to watch for. His performance was sweet and endearing and the boy can sing. Another to watch is Joe Anderson, the charismatic Max, Jude's best friend. Throw in a slew of other Beatles characters (i.e. Sadie, Prudence and even Lovely Rita Meter Maid) as well as surprise visits from veteran rockers Bono and Joe Cocker and even a surprise visit from Eddie Izzard and you have something very special. There was one downfall however. Why is Evan Rachel Wood even in this? She was flimsy and completely out of place as Max's sister and Jude's love Lucy. She has a few songs, all of which are delivered with a bad opera impression. I'm not sure "Blackbird" will ever be the same for me. I won't deny that she looked beautiful but there was much more required of this lead than a pretty face. When you put her against the other players she pales in talent on every scale. She is out sung by the supporting females, particularly Dana Fuchs who's show stopping cover of "oh darling'" made me wonder why she hasn't been heard of before, and out acted by EVERYONE. I would normally take one point away for her boring and vapid performance but because everything else was truly cinematic genius I am forced to give it a full 5 stars. However, studios need to rethink casting Wood is these kinds of roles. Perhaps she should stick to annoying, disobedient, drug-seeking whorish teenagers. All in all: * * * * *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people will definitely not understand what has been done here. Better, they won't even bother to. I am also a Beatles fan and after some initial prejudice, was happy to comprehend how the film honors its name. Across the Universe literally takes you throughout The Beatles era side by side with the evolving Beatles generation. The plot is nothing special, but the well casted actors compensate for it. One won't find Mr. Geres or Mr. McGregors escorting Mrs. Zeta-Jones or Mrs. Kidmans, the cast is about almost unknown characters with great singing talent and better charisma. The story starts in the sweet 60's and runs all trough the hippie 70's, when people would had to duck, crawl, roll and jump to sing for survivor and cry for love, showing the world what it really needs. With an interpretation of Beatles songs, it tells a story of what could this all have been or meant, keeping alive the spirit of this group. Beatles fan or not, I'd like to invite all to take this tour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>in this most extraordinary film. It is hard to single out any of its stars for special praise,as it was basically an ensemble piece with everyone using their own singing voices and spinning new interpretations of the old Beatle classics.Julie Taymor took my breath away with the chances she takes. Here she combines the broadness of opera, the teasing reminiscent feeling of the sixties, the artistic sensibilities of the era and lush sequences that enhance the plot threads and move it forward. It is one of those movies that can have you laughing out loud one minutes and crying the next.And I did found it relevant to today, even though I was exposed to the Beatles very early in their careers prior to their being discovered by "North America" and I have always been passionate about their music.Indeed some of the scenes amazed me by their sheer genius, the recruitment office, the Vietnam jungle, the psychedelic circus, the ward in the hospital, etc.I won't single out any of the actors for particular praise, suffice to say is that the company was amazing.But I will single out Julie Taymor who goes where no one else ventures and takes such honest to goodness joy in the performances she extracts from her entire cast and crew.Brava! 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Across the Universe (2007) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Step back into retro 1968 for a very colorful and wondrous musical trip featuring today's young performers saluting The Beatles through their music. I must give credit to screenwriters Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais, as well as the director Julie Taymor for having more success in producing glowing results, especially when one recalls the disaster that was 1978's SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND.This is a loose and meandering story of a young Liverpool artist named Jude (Jim Sturgess) who goes off to search for a father he never known somewhere in the U.S.A. He meets various characters named after certain Beatles songs and befriends them as they all go about their lives together amidst the outrage of the Vietnam war, "flower power" psychedelia trips, and love.I just watched this myself on DVD last night along with my wife, my sister and her husband, and my 16-year-old nephew and his young girlfriend. Other than the sad fact that the kids first cringed at the sight of the movie being letterboxed and that they wanted it to be "the Full Screen" (sigh) it went over very well. Except for my 12-year-old niece, however, who kept retreating to her room and is at this point in her life a lost cause who prefers cRap and Britney Spears to good music. Well, I guess she'll see if anyone makes a movie featuring their stuff in 40 years time. I am a die-hard Beatles collector/freak, and yet I have never managed to sit through all of the SGT. PEPPER movie. I must admit that I went into ACROSS THE UNIVERSE with much trepidation, but I came out of it very exhilarated and with the satisfaction of feeling that there might be young teens out there in the modern world who were now made more aware of The Beatles' music where they wouldn't have thought they were cool enough before.It's pretty much a futile exercise to attempt a whole coherent film and any sort of linear plot line when the whole idea of a movie is to tell a story using songs by a music group and characters conspicuously named after classic songs (like Jude, Jo Jo, Prudence, Sadie, Lucy, Max, etc.). There were some curious missed opportunities -- I kept wondering what the point was of having a character named Maxwell who was angry at his parents and was seen wielding a silver hammer, if not to use the song? Same thing with Sadie (who I wrongly presumed was going to be serenaded for being "sexy" and for "making a fool of everyone") and Jo-Jo was never told to "Get Back"!But with ACROSS THE UNIVERSE, whatever must be found lacking in story is much more than made up for with creative cinematography and some great music at every other turn. I liked just about all of the new renditions of the classic old tunes and it was actually invigorating to hear them freshly sung by new (and some old) faces. I found myself eagerly anticipating what the next chestnut to be attempted was going to be and who would get to sing it. The vocalist who really hit me especially was the character Sadie's (Dana Fuch's) Janis Joplinesque rocking on songs like "Why Don't We Do It In The Road" and "Oh, Darling!" (even though the latter was sometimes hindered by the interruptions of Martin Luther McCoy). A couple of weak singing moments that stood out for me were the embarrassingly silly "Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite", by Eddie Izzard, as well as leading boy Jim Sturgess' softcore blabbering for "Revolution". Still, even these didn't hurt the movie as a whole. Oh, I might nitpick that a seasoned Beatles devotee like U2's Bono ought to be aware that the sounds which are barked in the classic "I Am the Walrus" are not the commonly misheard "Koo Koo Kachoo", but rather "Goo Goo G'joob", but this is desperate criticism. It was great to see him perform this psychedelic tune, and ditto for Joe Cocker croaking out the opening lines of "Come Together".The memory of The Beatles is alive and well and made fresher than ever for a new youthful audience thanks to ACROSS THE UNIVERSE. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I must preface this by saying that I think that people who are ignorant to the music of the Beatles might not get as much out of it, this movie is pure genius!!! By weaving a selection of songs into a script instead of writing a script and then writing songs I think this movie comes across as more than a "musical". It transcends all theater and film before it in the raw emotion it delivers. And not only that, but the virtually unknown actors and actresses within strike out to the heart of anyone who has just gone somewhere for the hell of it and made the best friends they'd ever know. They're singing brought new life to these songs even for me and I was raised listening to the Beatles.. this movie brought this music back into my heart and mind again and reminded me that young people have always had the prose and poetry pouring out of their hearts, but not all of them had the audience that the four boys from Liverpool had. 3 CHEERS!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gotta admit I'm a sucker for the aesthetic. So when I saw the trailer for this film there was no way I was missing out. Sure The Beatles may not be one of my top 10 bands, but I've always had a liking for their work, so the fact that this film was a story told through their songs only made the experience sweeter. But I found that there's even more to it, oh so much more.Pros: The filmmakers assembled a very talented cast of mostly unknowns. Plus each person sings beautifully. Excellent visual effects work. Made a visual feast with vibrant colors, projections, animation, etc. Some really powerful dramatic moments and images. Impressive costume and production designs that really make one feel like they're in that time and place. A beautiful instrumental score. A quick pace throughout. Loaded with inventiveness. Great choreography.Cons: Some more character development outside of the songs would've been nice.Final thoughts: Few movies make me feel the way 'Across the Universe' does. It got my heart racing, gave me the chills, made me want to sing along, and overall just made me feel good. If musicals are your thing then you don't want to miss this one.My rating: 5/5</fullReview>

I can't wait to watch it again! The placement of the songs brought new meaning to each set of lyrics and my husband and I kept looking at each other in disbelief! I think I thought the movie would have the Beatles songs as "background", sung by the Beatles. WRONG! It was very much like a Broadway musical. My favorite songs were "If I fell In Love With You" and "Let It Be". They took my breath away! The storyline of the movie followed the 1960's &amp; 70's timeline of the songs perfectly, integrating the lyrics into the plot in just the right places.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read some of the quotes on this film and there seem to be a fair amount of negatives, which I truly don't understand, I think that Across The Universe is by far one of the best musicals in years. To call it just a musical though is to pigeon-hole it too neatly in a category that it doesn't really fit.Years ago watching Moulin Rouge after all the hype and being somewhat disappointed, I thought I would watch this one with an open mind and no expectations. What I found was one of the most superbly crafted musical dramas in years, full of deep and passionate meaning, incredibly talented artists, and a massive amount of symbolism so deftly done that people watching this film I'm sure would relate to it in different ways, and on so many levels.The cast is just superb, the ease with which all the characters engage the story, and the flow I don't believe can be faulted. One pet hate of mine is when artists butcher classics to create an "artistic" version, and yet so many of the songs in this film have been dramatically altered or slowed down to suit the current theme, but at no point did I ever think, " wow...that was a terrible rendition". The songs were delivered beautifully with passion and conviction, and I dare anyone to watch the "Let It Be" scenes without the hairs on their arms raising! In short, an amazing and enjoyable journey on so many levels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Julie Taymor does "Hair"; as a Beatles' Jukebox Musical, no less. As expected from Ms. Taymor, the imagery is exquisite. Most song arrangements are interesting, and the occasional reference to past interpretations (Joe Cocker) add some fun of recognition to this humorless endeavor. I am not sure who is the target audience ? as a Beatles fan I was irritated rather than entertained by the manipulative use of character named just to excuse some songs and the unfunny use of quotes ("She Came in Through the Bathroom Window"), and I found the plot too pale for those not fully aware of the catalog. "Across the Universe" is not a "bad trip" (pun intended), just not a potent one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You just never know. My wife and I are Beatles fans. Big Beatles fans. Abbey Road,and everything else. We went to the movies last night with our minds made up to see Elizabeth. When we got there late (probably during previews) after a rushed supper, we spied a movie poster for this movie, and asked the ticket girl what it was like. She said, "Well, everyone seems to like it, it's got a lot of Beatles music in it, that's all I know." We looked at each other, bought two seats and walked in. After endless previews, the movie started and we were a little non-plussed.The film moves you in very slowly. I am 61 years old, so the Beatles are prime time. Their music is amazing, still hip and relevant, even after more than 40 years, just like good theatre, classical music, etc. The first 10 minutes promised a rather contrived, hokey experience. But we were determined to watch, drawn forward by the amazing vocalizations and incredible productions of Beatles songs that we never believed could be sung by other voices so well (although over the years they have always had varied, some good, some bad, covers).Then it happened, just when we thought it was too much camp to take, we got sucked in totally. The plot, loose as it was, moved us through endless poignant vignettes of the era. I sang with it (quietly) since I knew almost every word, I cried many times at the evoked memories of a passionate time in life.The leads, Evan Rachel Wood and Jim Sturgess, were made for their roles, combining the idealism of youth with the awakening of meeting a nasty, cynical, hard world reality. They were beautiful, and so was the rest of the cast. How can you explain perfection.Go and see -- this is a stunning visual and auditory experience.When we left the theatre, I felt 40 years younger, and as though I were walking above the ground. This morning, I am nostalgic about last night's experience. This is the first movie in a very long time that I may rush out to see twice before the DVD comes out, just because I am so anxious to relive it.This is the greatest surprise of a movie buffs life. Wow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Across the Universe was one of the best movie I have seen in a long time. It is a complete masterpiece. The actors and music are what attracted me to the movie the most. The actors had such great chemistry with each other. When I was watching the movie I actually felt like I was in it. The sound track and special effects is what brings the whole movie together. All of the colors bright colors that were used just memorize you they make the movie fun. The time that the movie was based around was a very good for the plot of the movie it made the movie a lot more interesting and exciting because there was so much going on in that era. When you hear the actors and actresses sing they make you want to jump out of your chair and sing along with them. This movie makes you wish that you lived in the 60's because of how much fun they make living in that era look. The director Julie Taymor did a great job with working with the crew. They definitely did a great job of picking out the cast. The cast worked well with each other and the set and their surroundings. They had great voices. The dialogue of this movie was another thing that I liked in this movie. The cast work really well with the script and put a lot of emotion behind what they were saying and acting out. I could feel what the actors were feeling when they were acting out the scenes. You could tell that they were really devoted to this movie and wanted to be there to film it. The editing of this movie really made the film flow very well. The scenery and locations used for the filming of the movie really put the movie together well for me. As Max was going into the Vietnam War I could feel how scared he was and how scared Lucy was for Max. When Jude got deported from the United States Back to Liverpool I could feel the heart break that Lucy and Jude were feeling. I could feel the excitement that Lucy and Jude felt when they were finally reunited at the end of the movie. This movie did exactly what it was supposed to do. It made me feel like I was a part of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am blown away by this film for many reasons. Yes, I am a Beatles fan, so perhaps that has colored my perception, but this is truly a creative masterpiece from Julie Taymor &amp; co. The beautiful cinematography, the choreography, the amazing music, the way the film captured the turbulent 60's and used the Beatles' music as a narrative are just a few of the film's merits. I loved the appearances by Bono, Joe Cocker, Eddie Izzard and Salma Hayek. But the two leading actors (Evan Rachel Wood and Jim Sturgess) more than just held their own and delivered heartbreakingly tender and gorgeous performances. Wow, wow, wow. I had to watch it a second time, plus the special features on the DVD. The relatively unknown Martin Luther McCoy and Dana Fuchs are outstanding musical talents and were perfectly cast as a Janis Joplinesque and Jimi Hendrix-like duo. I can't wait to get the soundtrack. If you like the Beatles, the 1960's, and musical drama, this is MOST DEFINITELY the film NOT to be missed!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was offensively, horribly bad. Let me begin by saying that I actually like the Beatles quite a bit, I even like a lot of Beatles covers, and I even enjoy a fair number of musicals. But this film was wretched bad.There are two scenes which don't stink.(1) The 'Let it Be cover', though in many ways not 'faithful' to the original, is done with a nice sincerity, and the performance is quite good. The imagery is heavy-handed as heck, but early enough in the film is hasn't entirely numbed your brain. (2) The scene in which Maxwell shows up for enlistment with the military is quite good, excellently choreographed and full of great imagery. Even the musical adaptation of 'She's so Heavy' is quite good, and the image which plays during the main chorus of the song is itself almost worth sitting through the rest of the tripe which constitutes this self-indulgent piece of crap.Aside from that--- it's a stinker. Since the movie deals with music, let's address the music of the film; for the most part, these are the worst possible Beatles covers I have ever heard. Do you enjoy whiny emo inflection upon half the songs, wherein the instrumental portions are generally put so far in the back of the mix that they are barely audible at points? They made a movie just for you. The most painful covers are those which constitute the 'psychedelic' portion of the movie--- which is strange, since developments in sound technology could have made these the most enjoyable covers. "I am the Walrus" is an insult to the Beatles, and whoever cast Bono as Dr. Roberts.... well, they should have thought that out a little better, to be gentle about it. Bono sucks. A deadpan 'Coo-coo ka-choo' indeed... But the cover of "For the Benefit of Mr. Kite" is certainly worse. In fact, it may be one of the worst covers ever done in the history of all covers ever being done, ever. There are not enough negative adjectives in the English language to fully express my discontent with this cover. The cover of 'Helter Skelter' is pompous, and warps the frenzied passion the Beatles played with into a cliché bar-rock version... The music, in short, is bad.Of course, music is always a matter of taste. Maybe you'd enjoy hearing really awful covers of good music. Music aside, what is there? Plot? Barely. Here's the plot: Boy meets girl. They fall in love. He decides to become an artist. She decides to become a political activist. They get in an argument about whether or not violence is necessary in a revolution, or whether all you need is love. Turns out, sure, all you need is love, and then a crappy movie full of covers to remind people, as the failure of the 60's revolution is fully comprehended in it's massiveness, amid war and economic depression.There are some subplots. The Jimi Hendrix impersonator and the Janis Joplin impersonator have a rocky relationship. For those under age 13, who are apparently in the marketing demographic of this film, it might interest you to know that Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin were not in the Beatles.There's a character who gets drafted, goes to war, and concludes 'war sucks'. Just in case you didn't know.There's a lonely lesbian pouting in a closet. She's asked to come out of the closet.But plot-wise... it's cliché, contrived, and just bad. Obviously a vehicle for various songs to have a 'new' context. So let's excuse the plot, and the music. What are we left with? Visual images. Ah, yes. Well, again, it's all subjective. You like watching Apple Ipod commercials for a few hours straight? Then this is your film. It's as if the director told these actors "Just act wide eyed and amazed, and smile vapidly at everything, and maybe that'll be infectious enough..."... There are nice enough images, but they've all been done before, and, frankly, better. Woo-hooo, bombs that look like strawberries. This is meaningful. Sure. Oh, hey, look, the world dissolved and they're all staring blankly at the blue sky. Wow. Never seen that before. Gee, I wonder what the visualization of an LSD trip is like.... Oh, right, inverted colors. Sepia trippy, woo-hooo.Why was this film made? Because in the mind of studio execs, it's a surefire sale, and how could it suck? Now we know. Just add Bono. And a scary Joe Cocker.If you're going to watch this one, have the fast-forward button ready. It'll make the whole process less painful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love the Beatles, but hated this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was absolutely terrible. Its as though they decided to take some great Beatles songs, do terrible remakes of them and just put them into a film without a plot. All the songs have the same sound, usually slowed down and given the same boring tone, completely ruining the songs. As for the plot, well, there wasn't one. The characters would be at places or doing random things just so they could fit a Beatles song in, regardless if it made sense or had an explanation. I watched this with some friends (also huge Bealtes fans) and all we could do was make fun of the film for lacking a plot and ruining songs. I quit watching it near the end because I felt like I was totally wasting my time, so I don't actually know how it ends.I had high expectations but was extremely disappointed.I just wanted to write this to prevent other people from wasting two hours of their lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Across the Universe is a good movie, the ending is a little cheese, it has some really well put out scenes, in other words it has a very good art direction, sometimes the movie focuses only in the art, on the music, half of the movie is mostly spent on the music, which is good because the music is great, the arrangements for the Bealtes songs are good enough and the images and the moments in the movie where the songs are placed fit in with the story, putting meaningful lyrics about the characters life is the way writers of musicals make sense out of the music and how music is the way an artist puts his life on his creations. The movie is a trip, i don't usually like musicals, but this is more like music video with great visuals and even better music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Across the Universe (2007) *** (out of 4) Much like Paul McCartney's marriages, this film is rather hit and miss but you have to give the director credit for trying something like this. I've always wondered what would happen if you tries to make a movie using nothing but songs as well as using song lyrics as dialogue. I really don't think the story here matters too much so I won't go into it. The film at least can make Beatles fans forgotten the God-awful Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. I thought the music selections were very good with a few of the songs coming pretty close to matching the original recordings. I've always preferred Joe Cocker's version of "With a Little Help from My Friends" but I think the version here is just as great. The scene here comes off very fun as does other numbers including "Strawberry Fields Forever". I thought the climatic "Hey Jude" was pretty awful though. I also thought the film was too ambitious in that it tries to be cute but then turns pretty dark at the end. The political nonsense started to get rather boring and I thought the film went on for way too long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Across The Universe is over all a spectacular (in its most literal sense) film. Yes, there are some cheesy allusions to 60s pop culture (ex: the John and Yoko pose with Lucy and Jude, the rooftop concert, "She came in through the bathroom window", etc.) but in the end it all seems to fit together. The choreography, musical arrangement, and effects are awesome. The song/video montages (especially Strawberry Fields Forever) are really cool. The soundtrack is great too, yes, even if they're Beatles remakes, they're great. I do think that this film is much more suited to the younger generation, rather than those who actually lived through these events which is understandable. This movie is a lot like Hair (with some definitely uncanny similarities), but more relateable to today's younger generation. It glides easily through the lighthearted early 60s, into the trippy, psychedelic era, and falls perfectly into the serious wartimes of Vietnam. Furthermore, it gives insight into the tumultuous 60s era while still painting a good love story.after watching Across the Universe, you feel as though you've been on a journey. You remember about Jude and Lucy at the beginning of the movie and really feel their personal changes through the times.This is the kind of movie you want to watch over and over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't too keen to see this because of the lackluster reviews but I'm glad I did anyway. Anyone who's ever had a Beatles phase will definitely enjoy the mostly brilliant covers of the Beatles' classics that this movie's script is based on. Even if this was set in the turbulent 60s, it is still based on real events, and the meshing of Beatles' songs did not seem forced into the story. There were some cringe-worthy sappy moments that come with most musicals, and overlong psychedelic sequences, but overall, the performances from every one in the talented cast were enjoyable. Evan Rachel Wood was perfect as Lucy, a fresh-faced, sheltered teener from the suburbs, who attracts her polar opposite in Jude (played by Jim Sturgess), a scruffy sailor who jumps ship from Liverpool to the US in search of his father. They live a bohemian life in New York in the company of their flower power friends, amid the radical activism prevalent at the time.Memorable renditions of Beatles songs featured in Across the Universe include: "Helter Skelter" performed by Dana Fuchs (who plays singer Sadie), "I Want to Hold Your Hand" performed by T. V. Carpio (who plays cheerleader/lesbian Prudence), and the best sequences were "With a Little Help from My Friends" performed by Joe Anderson and Jim Sturgess, which was incredibly choreographed, and so was "Come Together" performed by Joe Cocker and Martin Luther (who plays Sadie's guitarist and lover, JoJo), "Something" performed by Jim Sturgess while he was drawing a sleeping, naked Lucy, and "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" performed by Martin Luther and Jim Sturgess. Cameos from Bono and Salma Hayek perk up the already trippy and visually stimulating movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Julie Taymor has directed what will probably go down in history as her magnum opus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from "Across the Universe", the other Julie Taymor movie that comes to my mind is her biopic "Frida", about Frida Kahlo. Taymor has now shown that when focusing on cultural heritage, one needn't limit oneself to straightforward biopics, but can also look at the sorts of things that happened in a certain era, while fictionalizing events. And that's exactly what she has done with this one. Opening with two vastly dissimilar settings - one shows the seedy Cavern Club in Liverpool, the other shows an upper middle class high school in the United States - the film tells the story of a working class Brit named Jude (Jim Sturgess), who journeys across the pond to find his father. Although he accomplishes this, his trip takes on a new purpose: falling in love with American girl Lucy (Rachel Evan Wood), and participating in everything that took place in the sixties.If absolutely nothing else, it would be beyond amazing how they incorporate the Beatles' songs into the movie and use them to tell the story. To be certain, every major character has a name from a Beatles song (plus a few actions referencing Beatles songs). But the psychedelic/mystical approach that they take, all the while keeping everything very political, transcends even that. Taymor has created a nearly indescribable experience here, much like the Cirque du Soleil spectacle "Love" that I saw in Las Vegas. It's like Chuck Jones's "What's Opera, Doc?" (although I understand that some people will object to me comparing the two).All in all, this one that I will recommend to everyone for all time. An absolute masterpiece. Also starring Dylan Baker, Bono, Eddie Izzard and Salma Hayek.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have seen the past, present and future of U.S. cinema and it is "Across the Universe."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Words are flowing out Like endless rain into a paper cup They slither while they pass They slip away across the universeWho knew that the trippy lines from songs of the Beatles could become a hit movie? I know what your saying, they already did with "A Hard Days Night," "Help!," and "Yellow Submarine." No, this is a movie with the Beatles' songs but without the Beatles singing the, and has nothing to do with the Beatles whatsoever.This movie centers around the northeast in the time of change, yes it's the sixties.Jude (hey) leaves his home in Liverpool (even more familiar) to go find his father in America. His father was an American soldier who impregnated his mother and is now a janitor at Princeton, that's just a side story. Along the way, he makes friends with a student there named Max (as in "Maxwell's Silver Hammer"), who has a sister named Lucy (like as in the one who's in the sky with diamonds).Lucy has a boyfriend who's off to war in that place we were in during the sixties, I forgot, oh yeah, Vietnam. She writes him letters and they maintain a good relationship until he gets killed over there and Lucy (played beautifully by Evan Rachel Wood) decides to take a stand and join the peace rallies. That's right Wood is not "Thirteen" anymore she needs to get off her wild side and give peace a chance.Jude, Lucy and Max move into an apartment with Sadie (yep), Prudence (another) and Jo Jo (get back!) and they come together and go through the sixties like strawberry fields forever.Sadie is an aspiring singer and Jo Jo (who reminds me so much of Jimi Hendrix, another Beatles offspring) is her very trippy guitarist. They put on gigs at the local go go joints and get by with a help from their friends, and get high with a little help.. OK nevermind.Max gets called to join the Army and being the hippie that he is, he doesn't want to go. Oh, he goes through the recruitment process, but thats all before he and his friends go to a hippie commune with Bono (yes, that Bono, but he plays the head hippie) to hear Eddie Izzard on his commune. Izzard's character looks a lot like Johnny Depp in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."Well, there's a lot of other plot to the movie, something about a "Revolution" and everything goes "Helter Skelter" at a college campus. I don't want to give away too much plot.Julie Taymor (director of "Frida") is a imaginative genius and "Across the Universe" is more evidence of that. She took the songs of the Beatles, with the backdrop of the sixties; and a story of star-crossed lovers and has turned a cinematic masterpiece of a movie.Oh, of course there's the music, never forget the music. The music tells the story, and it's of the Beatles, the best band ever! Also, the actors sing the songs as the scenes unfold. I never really like musicals before because they always occasionally broke out into song. Well, with "Across the Universe," the actors breaks out into the songs of the Beatles, and that's just fine with me.See this movie! Watch it over and over and when you're not watching it, because you're sleeping, listen to the soundtrack. Dream of the movie, because if my dreams could be a movie, they would be "Across the Universe."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beatles Songs Get The Silver Screen Treatment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ACROSS THE UNIVERSE is a musical for those who love the Beatles and/or the Vietnam War era anti-war protests. Specifically, it's for those who love the Beatles though.Paying homage to almost all the Beatles' songs of this era, Across The Universe paints a set of narratives across the silver screen against the lyrical backdrops of such greats as 'All My Loving', 'Let It Be', 'Come Together', and 'Hey Jude' to name a very few. All of the character names are also either pulled directly from Beatles tunes (Jude, Maxwell, Lucy, Sadie, etc.) or from the times (JoJo as Jimi Hendrix, etc.).Although very cleverly put together as a whole, the first forty minutes of the film are scattered and much of the music forced into the plot in order for it to make sense. The constrained script plugs along, trying to take wing but more often than not, falling back to Earth and trying again.About an hour into the film, however, Across The Universe finds its wings and gets aloft. After Max (Joe Anderson) gets inducted into the military, there's an incredible sequence in which we see a platoon of soldiers carrying the statue of liberty across the jungles of Vietnam. Never have I seen something so contrasting yet beautifully explored with regards to how the U.S. felt as boys were sent to fight in Southeast Asia ('Liberating' the Vietnamese by trampling down their country). The song 'I Want You' is interspersed here with the lyrics "she's so...heavy!" cut from it. Amazingly done.The story is really about love and tolerance during a time of incredible bloodshed and governmental turmoil. Lead actors Jim Sturgess (as Jude) and Evan Rachel Wood (as Lucy) do a fine job of making us care about this conflicted couple and how in love they eventually become thanks to their similarities but also their differences. Jude wants to stay out of the war and focus on his artwork, while Lucy is forced into the Peace Movement when her brother (Max) gets drafted and shipped out. Lucy finds that peace at any cost is too high a price, while Jude's eyes are awakened when he pulls his head out of the proverbial sands.The drug culture is explored in-depth as our would-be lovers trek across the U.S. in a psychedelic bus after drinking some "purple punch." The visuals are wild, and the colors even wilder as their "experience" drops them into the hands of Mr. Kite (Eddie Izzard, MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND) who sings, not surprisingly, 'Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite.'" His blue buddies are indicative of the LSD experience for those who wanted to "turn on, tune in, and drop out." The ending is well rendered if a bit predictable. Love cannot be denied amongst these terrible times, so Jude and Lucy must find a way to make theirs work.If it weren't for the terrible beginning, this film would've gotten an easy five star rating. But it faltered so much in those first forty minutes that I'd be lying to myself if I said the middle and end made up for all of it. It didn't. But Across The Universe is still a musical worth watching. Just get past the beginning and you'll be swept up in the nostalgic music and characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magical mystery faux pas, but pleasant enough until it strays beyond its superficial remit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely have I fallen in love with a picture so much in the first half, yet been utterly bored by the second. But every viewer is different. I will explain my reservations about Across the Universe in the hope that the information might help you decide to like it.It is a musical based entirely on songs by the Beatles. As it has a nominal story of its own, it would be unfair to call it an extended music video. Just be prepared for a story predicated on the songs, not vice versa.The first thing you notice is the songs are sung well. Exceedingly well. They even ? dare I say ? improve on the originals quite often. It reminds me of Eva Cassidy singing a classic like Somewhere Over the Rainbow. She found depths of beauty of her own and discovered the song in a whole new way. This is possible in Across the Universe because, instead of using actors that can sing a bit (a particular bugbear of mine), they use singers who can act a bit. Pretty young things with voices that could sweep to victory in any X-Factor sing-off.For anyone who loved the originals of I Want to Hold Your Hand and Hold Me Tight, this is the best homage imaginable. Simple boy-meets-girl kicks off a standard 3-part plot and your emotions can soar to the fullness of Lennon-McCartney lyrics.One of the best ever films to make use of popular songs in this way was Singing in the Rain. In those days, there was a ready stable of stars that could sing, dance and act ? and usually all three at once. The film used a fairly topical story (the advent of sound in movies) and barrel-loads of charisma and humour. It is a formula that was easier for studios of old than ones of today.But Across the Universe falls down not because it doesn't have a good story. It falls down because of two major errors in plot development. Dock worker Jude travels to America to find estranged dad. A few subplots later he falls for Lucy. Lucy's brother is drafted into the (VietNam) war and this is where it all starts to go horribly wrong.The love songs have gone terribly well with attractive leads that make no great demands on their acting skills. But launch the film into extended tragedy and their inexperience sadly shows. The second mistake is the choice of plot focus. We are in the 'Summer of Love' ? the 60s era of Flower Power, psychedelic drugs, and disillusionment with society (especially the war). The message was to turn on, tune in, drop out. (I know - I grew up in the tail end of flower power.) But to make a musical that focuses on the horrors of war is a very major undertaking, and well beyond the otherwise exemplary grasp of these filmmakers. They miss almost any reference to drugs (smoking hash and dropping LSD ? acid ? was a central part of the flower power era) and Jude and his friends seem to sidestep the philosophy completely. Which also seems a bit untrue to the Beatles. If they had to miss drugs for the censors, a few references to meditation, for instance, would not have gone amiss. Consequently, when Jude triumphs with All You Need is Love, it sounds hollow and unconvincing.The film is worth watching for the superb interpretation of most of the songs, especially in the first half. Surprisingly, the two well-known celebrities perform worst in terms of singing. They should have been omitted from the trailer. Bono is a great performer, but cannot compete vocally with more classically trained voices. Likewise Eddie Izzard might be a great comedian but his rendering of Mr Kite is at odds with the original tone of the song and his singing is variety show shouting. Producers would have done well to study the Beatles' "Magical Mystery Tour" for this section.Across the Universe starts well but ends sanitised and unsatisfying. Excellent symbolism ? for instance, soldiers tramping VietNamese jungle underfoot merely to carry a gigantic Statue of Liberty ? is wasted by a story that stays in the mud rather than soars. The only turn on is fairly shallow. The only psychedelics are in the well-worn photo-effects. And the meticulous costumes fail to re-create an era that was more liberal than today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the more hit or miss films in recent memory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The incomparable Julie Taymor strikes again with her vastly ambitious musical set to alternate versions of Beatles songs. Certainly with it's share of misfires, some a little embarrassing, Across the Universe is still a wildly creative and sometimes stirring roller-coaster ride down the interpretative lens of some of the world's most successful pop song lyrics.What Taymor sets out to accomplish in her film is nothing short of miraculous. By organizing her so-so plot about two lovers and a myriad of supporting characters around many of the groups most popular songs, and in fact synchronizing scene after scene so the lyrics often literally translate out on screen at that moment within the context of her story, she is obviously going to have some sequencing not fit in the most intuitive way, as the film's slow beginning hints.When this restless director is firing on all cylinders however, Across the Universe becomes a marvel of beauty, an exquisite mixture of sight and sound no less powerful then when Pink Floyd's The Wall film debuted. Never mind the slight controversy of remaking these classic songs by different artists-although a few seem misinterpreted or just flat out butchered, I feel any true Beatle fan will feel like justice has been done to paint their visionary music along the skyline of consciousness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It breaks my heart to say this but Across The Universe let me down. :( Since the moment that I saw the literally jaw-dropping trailer I wanted to see this movie more than any other.Then I watched it. Visually stunning, PERFECT casting but very weak substance. Some songs are executed perfectly and fit so very well but others seemed like.. "let's see how many Beatles songs we can fit in a film". The sparse dialogue seemed as filler to the next song and the viewer isn't given the chance to delve into the the characters and care about them and their story. The characters are presented, we get a back story, then we're off to the races. It's so rapid fire that the events of the movie are like a "by the way" to the auditory and visual aspects. The stringing together of so many songs allows your attention to wander. I've heard these songs a million times before. Yes, they are singing them BEAUTIFULLY but WHY are they singing them? There's a fine line between a song speaking for you and someone just singing a song.Opera can get away with this because that's what you expect, all singing. With this, it seemed more of.. Okay, here's Jude! Here comes Bono! Now.. Mr. Kite! We're not gonna tell you anything more about him other than he lives somewhere and does strange things. The symbolism was at times gut wrenching yet, at other times, was like... "and? what? why?" I appreciate the film and applaud the effort and the idea so very much. So much so that i will give it 6 of 10. I will buy the soundtrack. I just wish so much that there was more substance to it, rather than just a concert of covers. I would have sat for a longer movie if it would have helped. Close, but the execution was off target.Is there an actors cut out there or characters cut or anything? I may sound harsh in my comments but I really believed in the idea and was so let down. I'm sorry. :(</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reminded me that Cinema is indeed an art form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember? Cinema is an art form. Somewhere between the hollywoodish sky high explosions and walking talking 3D animals it seems we forgot about this. Movie-magic was somehow just limited to entertainment, rarely transcending into art. "Across the universe" makes this journey. And completes it in style.The movie is beautiful. The lives and times of a bunch of young new yorkers living in a troubled era in American history is beautifully captured on canvas and then pulled on the movie screen. The colors liven up the psychedelic images that so truly defines an era that I've only read about. The music makes the time period come alive in a way that - well only Beatles could.A young lad named Jude from across the Atlantic searching for his dad. A beautiful teenager named Lucy who loses her first love to a war that few understood (Bonus points if you made the connections on the names with the lyrics of those boys from Liverpool). A Princeton dropout. An up and coming singer. A troubled guitarist whose music is fueled by angst. The characters are rich and deep. The interconnections that happen between these individuals seems magical and real at the same time. Music is mastered and voiced adding a layer of beauty of the Beatles' tunes that defined a generation. In many ways the movie is reflective of current reality of war and violence, and in some ways vastly different than the world we live in today - somehow the energy of the grassroots power that existed back then (both in good and bad elements of society) seems to be lacking today.Epochal events like Vietnam, Dr. King's death, Hippie movement are all so beautifully presented, that sometimes I felt it is almost a shame that those kids didn't change the world. Or maybe they did.The only wiggling question I had at the end of the movie: was it a tad too long? At times, imagery became too abstract and livid to effectively contribute to the narrative. But it's just a brushing thought that in no way dilutes the beauty of the final product.The movie was a delightful treat. It's a perfect movie for one of those lukewarm afternoons when it's raining outside and normally you'd grab a CD to listen to some good ol' rock n' roll. Pop this DVD in. You just might be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Splendid Tamor Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that I am quite a big fan of Julie Tamor, so what instantly made me fell at home was her very unique (very) visual style. Her psychedelic and bizarre presentation in films fits perfectly into the transitory period in which the Beatles were writing. Transition was the name of the game here, and I think the movie ultimately captures this very well, and its only faults come when it loses this edge.So firstly, the songs are obviously fantastic; I particularly love them being a big Beatles fan. However, I much prefer the Beatles latter works to their earlier, more commercial stuff. That worked out well in the end, because Tamor mostly focused on Rubber Soul onwards, which is where I think the Beatles catapulted themselves into eternity. These are the songs that fit best into the film. The start of the movie focused on explaining who the characters were, often through songs. I thought that these were the least effective part of the films, because the songs, though good, felt the most patched on. After the move to New York, and the rise and fall of the characters, we get into their more serious, political and social songs, and this is where the music and the plot blend wonderfully. The ultimate success of this film is showing a new generation how the Beatles encapsulated a mindset of a huge part of the population, and are such a great band because they spoke for the times.As for the singing itself, this is where I always get irritated at such films. The Beatles couldn't really sing in tune, but I love them anyway. The question is why Tamor asked the sound technicians to make every note right on key. I prefer a few wrong notes, because it makes the experience more real and immanent. It really keeps me at an emotional distance, as well. The best songs, therefore, were the angry songs, like Helter Skelter and Why Don't We Do It In The Road, because you could feel the emotion. But Joe Cocker's rendition of Come Together was easily the best song in the movie, as his raw energy shined through, and they didn't do much to his voice. As for the way they fit the music and the action together, the use of names was twee, and I giggled a bit, but ultimately I thought it worked quite well. Some of the songs like Mr Kite seemed a bit useless, and I think some other songs did as well. Across the Universe, Happiness is a Warm Gun, Strawberry Fields and All You Need is Love were incredibly powerful.As for the characters, I thought the acting was very good, and everyone did a very admirable job. However there were simply too many characters, and there was just too much going on. I would have preferred if Sadie, Prudence and Jojo were more peripheral, not because they did a bad job, but because they ultimately made the movie drag; as did much of the early scenes about Evan Rachel Wood's family.But what this movie ultimately showed was change. Nothing from that period could exist. The bizarre extreme nationalism of the governments who went through Vietnam, as well as the anarchistic counter-movement were both creatures that could not live on. As were the lifestyles of those engaged, particularly the hippie movement. So what irritated me slightly was the ending, when the main characters got back together. But, as I reflected a bit more, the ultimate message of the Beatles was one of hope in dangerous and transitory times, when love can be abandoned for heartless ideals like nationalism, capitalism, revolution and even freedom. What the Beatles said, and what this movie showed well, was that love grounds life, and redeems us of our faults.I thought this was a very wonderful movie, and I think I may enjoy it even more on a second viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rarely give movies a 10 but this one most definitely deserved one! I just loved the whole experience! Jim Sturgess is just sensational. Ten lines is not needed to comment on this film. The word "magnificiant" sums it up. All the Beatles songs were so wonderfully sung by everyone, I just loved the way they were performed. I want to see more and more films like this one! I praise all the cast and crew. This deserves to be shown everywhere. I watched the Pal version of the DVD and cannot wait to get my hands on the R1 release. I will definitely watch this one more than once. Thank you for creating such a pleasurable film to watch!!!!!!!! Please consider making more like this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A romance that emerges from Beatles songs like Venus from the sea.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Julie Taymor. Written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. Starring Jim Sturgess and Evan Rachel Wood."Across the Universe" is a romance that emerges from Beatles songs like Venus from the sea. Young Jude (Sturgess), a shipyard worker in Liverpool, leaves his steady, Liverpudlean girl to look for the father he never knew. He ships out and jumps ship in America to find his father, a professor at Princeton. Or so Jude imagines. Turns out his father is a janitor at Princeton. He had sired Jude while stationed in England during WWII. Time present is sometime in the mid-sixties. Dad now has a family and has no place for Jude in his life, but he does find a place for him to bunk in the building he maintains.Some student pranksters hit golf balls from a rooftop, smashing through the window of a fraternity house. In the ensuing chase by frat boys, one of the pranksters, Max (Joe Anderson) is given shelter by Jude. Max has a sister, Lucy (Wood), whose boyfriend is shipped off to Vietnam early on.Jude and Max become fast friends, and Jude spends Thanksgiving with Max's family, where he and Lucy meet. Max gets his draft notice, burns it, and drops out of Princeton. He and Jude head for New York, where they rent space in a loft run by an aspiring singer and Janice Joplin figure. The film follows Jude, Lucy, and Max in an exploration of "the sixties", cross-cutting among scenes of football practice, with square-jawed young athletes and comely cheerleaders, to an urban uprising in Detroit, to scenes of campus protest and clashes with police, to battle scenes in Vietnam, featuring Max, who let himself be drafted, despite his attitudes toward the war and authority in general. All of the venues come together (sorry, Beatles titles are in my head) in one way or another to form a maelstrom that swirls around the young lovers, drawing them in, bringing them together, hurling them apart, then casting them who knows where? The main set piece features a psychedelic trip, a magical mystery tour on the Merry Pranksters' bus, made famous in Tom Wolfe's "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test". Dr. Robert (Bono) sings and commands the bus as a kind of Ken Kesey figure. Along the way, they take in a show by Mr. Kite (Eddie Izzard). Words cannot do justice to the visual effects during this trip, and throughout the film for that matter, so I will not do them an injustice. The visuals, however, do complete justice to the Beatles' music and to that whole milieu. The drug-joke is that if you were there, you wouldn't remember. Not true. I was there, and I remember.Taymor makes excellent use of the music, which outlines the plot. She gives some Beatles numbers a clever twist, as when "I Want You" comes from the Uncle Sam recruiting poster, and sometimes insightful, as when a lesbian cheerleader (yeah, yeah) sings "I Want to Hold Your Hand" from a distance to a stereotypical blonde cheerleader. As Roger Ebert pointed out in his review, the originally upbeat number is transformed into a ballad of longing and heartbreak. "Across the Universe" is an unabashed musical, right from the opening shot. I recommend it to anyone who was there in those times. For those who were not, I recommend it for its fresh presentation of the Beatles' songs and for its visual delights. For those who abhor musicals, stay home.</fullReview>

Do you remember your first hit of acid/ your first maryjane rush to the tunes on Revolver or even performing with your theater cast party the entire SGT Peppers album? Why even try to comment on something you know nothing about? Did you listen to the White Album in the fall of 1968 on a dorm turntable set to 'endless replay'? memorize the Lyrics to "Glass Onion"? well, I suppose everyone is entitled to an opinion. i was afraid to see this with anyone else, for fear my reactions would embarrass them.. yes, i was in NYC in the summer of 1970, still mourning the breakup, visiting a friend and fellow fan who would be dead of AIDS less than 20 years later; too, I was in Boulder, CO that fateful summer, and Berkely, CA - saying goodbye and farewell as I prepared my heart for the united States Army. See, we all went to "Let It be" and we all went out on the barricades on campus and we mourned the deaths at Kent and Jackson State, as we had the deaths of MLK and RFK the year we graduated... It is so easy for me to fall into this movie. I had never seen ms Wood in a film, and she so reminds me of old girlfriends! I dropped out of college, wasted an academic, Big ten scholarship and in an existential rage went to Vietnam as an infantryman. Good dope and live ammo. 1971 was a nightmare. I survived horrors beyond imagining only by the grace of god Almighty - whom i could have cared less about in 1968..... so see this as homage, as eulogy, as tribute to an era long gone and blessedly dead, but bear with us dinosaurs and sixties survivors who need the catharsis still, the weeping that endures for a couple of harmless hours... could I take my wife, kids, grandkids to see this? the movie PLATOON? not either of them - not hardly. but for those of you born after 1958, my heart's desire is that you honor the memories of your older siblings, parents, relatives and friends, and cut us the slack we so dearly need.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit that I went in there expecting a musical. I was expecting a Beatles-esquire musical. I got what I was expecting. It felt like I was in the heads of the band members, during their good times, and their bad times. It had a very "symbolic" message at times (Lucy in the Sky, Sgt. Pepper, I Am the Walrus type of symbolism). It was also gripping at times (war and protest footage, Jude's personal as well as his and Lucy's relationship struggles. However the soundtrack score was awesome. I loved how they put it together. You do need an open mind. I mean go in with no expectations. Expect lots and lots of symbolism. Maybe I should sum it up as the '60s in America from the Beatles' perspective, made into a musical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are people who hate musicals. Sometimes they go to see a movie like this knowing they'd never like it and then complain about it, misleading people into thinking the movie is bad. If you're one of those people stay home, you ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow.Julie Taymor has done an outstanding job. Firstly these kids can sing. I'm sick of people announcing a musical and then the people in it are famous people or someone they think will draw a certain crowd and then those people can't sing. Well, she luckily has chosen some great singers for this film. Secondly she did something very interesting. She mixes in regular history, with Beatles history and the stories within the songs. If you're familiar with the Beatles catalog as most of us should be, you find yourself guessing the next song based on the context. And then you hear the first few notes and you think "Perfect!" And then comes the part where you give up trying not to sing along. Yeah I did, and after a while I'm fairly certain I heard the person across the aisle doing the same.I didn't totally get into it right away. It took "Come Together" to really draw me into it, and I'll admit that's my favorite Beatles song, so maybe that's why, but this version of it (and I adore the Future Villain Band version from SPLHCB) is really great. She got some vocal help in addition to the basic cast on that song that really punches it through. And all the cameos are great.I was watching it thinking it should be movie lots of people love. The 'High School Musical' fans should like it provided they're old enough to see a PG-13 movie. That's up to the parentals, since it has a boob, and a few butts, and a couple of funny cigarettes, and some cursing in it. But it's pretty minimal for these days. I think people who lived through the time, who don't hate musicals, should feel like they're taking a trip down memory lane. And there is a really collective memory vibe to it. (But I wasn't even born then, which is weird.) If you've seen a few movies, you'll probably be reminded of 'Hair' and of course 'Sgt. Pepper's' but this movie is a truly well made film and really the story is wrapped together so well, I guess it's like 'Shakespeare in Love' in that way. Check it out if you don't mind seeing art.</fullReview>

I loved how they did the songs without slaughtering them. I think the Beatles would be proud. In the movie their is a guy named Jude from Liverpool that goes to America to find his dad and his dad basically tells him to get lost. With no where else to go he stays with a college drop out ,Max, which has a sister named Lucy. Jude falls in love with her and they head out to New York. While in New York they meet all kinds of odd people like Prudence, a girl that feels no one loves her. The whole movie you see the people struggling through their young lives with thing like being drafted which is one of the things Max deals with. And so on.... The movie was Very Cool! Watch the movie for the rest of the story, unless you are a BOOM! person then maybe no. Awesome movie! Two thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Uneven...at times brilliant...many times over-indulgent and overwrought. Weak on storytelling most of the time, this film relies on its one overpowering asset, the Beatles' music, which is undeniably compelling. Shamelessly evoking iconographic images of the time, the film has little to say about them. A light entertainment that doesn't, in the end, amount to much. Really just a longish music video. OK for that. There are definitely worse ways to spend an hour and a half. To a new generation unfamiliar with the Beatles' music it maintains the integrity of the songs while adding images that vary from poetic to silly. As a piece of cinema it does not break any new ground or have much to recommend it. The Broadway-style production numbers just seem out-of-place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a great trip. All in all the majority of the music tied in superbly. There were obviously some scenes depicting drug use, but hey it was the 60's. The usage of the songs "Hey Jude" and "All You Need is Love" were incredible. All of the versions of the song were very good; if anything "I Want to Hold Your Hand" was a touch off and didn't really have a large impact on the movie. The sex scenes were done very tastefully so this movie is appropriate for everyone except small children. There was a slight political twist on the movie which i really thought was apropos to the current situation. Basically, go see this movie, it is one of the best movies I have ever seen and was the most astounding artistic film I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An attractive cast cannot distract the audience from a cliché. Despite how good-looking Jim Sturgess and Joe Anderson are, I found myself not laughing at this movie...in places that weren't even remotely funny. It wanted so desperately to be artistic, and it did have its moments, but ultimately, just emulated High School Musical. High School Musical on LSD.Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate the film. It was just a cookie-cutter image of what younger people imagine the sixties were like. I am really thankful that my friend works at the theater, so I did not pay to watch this one. My advice is to see it, but save yourself a buck or two by waiting until it comes out on DVD or begins playing on one of the movie channels.To sum Across the Universe up: It was a really good try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget Moulin Rouge and Hair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film does have similarities to both Moulin Rouge and Hair, however never have I seen a film which pays homage to sadly a long forgotten genius of cinema that being Ken Russell. Julie Taymor must have seen every Ken Russell film and loved the sheer audacity and creativity that seemed to have gotten lost in the critics eyes. A sad lot they are. Ms. Taymore it seems, was ,is and hopefully will in the future continue to expand where Russell left off. There are far too many scenes, shots, camera angles, themes, to mention but should you admire what Russell did in the 70's you must go see this film. Taymor must be credited for taking a chance in the making of this. It may not be your cup of tea, but If you can not appreciate this film for what it is, then you know nothing about the art of film making. From Production Design, Art Direction, Props, Costumes, cinematography , all shine in this instant classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie...it exceeded my expectations. I am critical of anyone who does a Beatle's cover with very few exceptions but I must say that every song was done so well and with such depth that any criticism even by a member of the Beatles would be unwarranted (such a tribute!). The underlying symbolisms are numerous and I think it would take me many times of watching it (and loving it each time) to catch all the nuances displayed. This is a true work of art in an industry so caught up in violence for the sake of violence or what is thought will sell more tickets in the "so keep it mainstream folks" industry. This is NOT a mainstream movie and I'll bet that "Across the Universe" will go down as one of the first true and timeless cult music films of this new century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Across The Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Across The Universe is a musical set in the 1960's about a group of young adults who discover love and friendship among other things of the time such as the war and protests that came with it. The film's characters sing and the music of the film is of classic songs by The Beatles and instead of just playing the original songs the actors in this film sing them themselves and the music is set against the events going on in the film as well as some visually stunning backdrops and cinematography all meant to look and have the feel of the whole 60's psychedelic era and very reminiscent of the Beatles animated film Yellow Submarine only unlike that this is not animated. This film seems to be pretty divided by critics and audiences. I have read some reviews by critics who have loved the film and others who have hated it. I have heard of some members of the audience walking out of this film and others who will not even see it because they think it looks terrible. I personally thought this movie was great and even though I liked it a lot I could see where it might not be for everyone. I have heard some people say that the story in this film wasn't really anything new and lacked originality. I enjoyed the story and while it interested me and kept me entertained I think the real highlight and thing to see about this movie isn't necessarily the story, but the music it is set to and the wonderful and almost hallucinatory sequences they are set to. I personally am a big fan of The Beatles music, so I enjoyed the soundtrack to this film immensely even though I have heard many of these songs before on classic rock stations that almost play them to death. However because these songs have so much energy and because they are still catchy, well written and just enjoyable songs I didn't mind hearing them again and I thought the main and supporting actors did a good job of singing them and as I already stated the sequences and images they are set to make for some very unique viewing. The colours and visuals of this film were very bright and really a treat for the eyes because of the uniqueness, originality and sometimes beautiful things they are set to. This really is a film that relies heavily on style and visuals, but the phrase style over substance isn't totally applicable here because I really enjoyed the story and the characters as well. This film was like watching a time capsule of the 60's from everything to the wardrobe to the hippie/beatnik lifestyle the characters lived and acted. This is a gorgeous and unique film filled with originality and wonderful music set to (at least what I found to be) an engaging story that could easily have taken place now almost 40 years later as well. This was a treat for the eyes and the ears and I enjoyed every minute of it.</fullReview>

The choreography of the sounds, actions, feelings and history were perfect. I went for the surrealism and was treated with the thoughtful, insightful songs and acting. If there is one weak point in the whole movie it would be the adequateness of the lead female actress.

		<shortDescription>Please don't call this BEATLES</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off let me relate a story that will demonstrate my clear bias to this film going in ? My wife had bought the CD based on some review that she had read or on some one's recommendation, it doesn't matter which. She played it for me in the car one night. Before it got to the third song I pulled it out of the deck and tossed it. The music was so bad it was insulting. I couldn't believe that anyone could possibly consider these bastardized renditions of some of the Beatles' greatest songs as music fitting to listen to other tan corporate CEOs who only cared about how much money they might bring in with sales.Now, if you had to rank this film against others of its nature, say, Hair or Jesus Christ Superstar, from that era, then, you'd have to rank it 5 stars. The movie accomplishes what it attempted to do with each song matched to entertaining visuals, though more often than not the songs' content don't match to the lyrics or to what the Beatles were saying or living at the time they wrote and performed them.But the fact is this film should be rated a negative star or two. This film wasn't made in that era, it isn't that era, it is today, here and now.Fast forward to the future, some time into the present. I was preparing to do my wash as a good documentary (Shut Up and Sing ? the story of the Dixie Chicks controversy ? no I am not a fan, but the film was good documentary coverage of what they went thru) had just ended. I took a quick scan of what was next offered on the movie channels that I subscribe to and saw this film's write up, thinking, a movie revolving around Beatles' songs, how bad can it be, besides, I'd be in and out of the room doing the laundry, so if I missed any of it, at least the songs would help me pass the time. How wrong I could have been never crossed my mind. Unfortunately I didn't put the CD and movie in the same context until I was well into the film.Just to set the record straight ? I stopped paying attention to this film before it was halfway through ? I only wish I had a fast forward function on my set as I would have liberally used it during the time I was watching the film. I also want to state that I did not turn the film off, I did not walk out, I just tuned out.Given there are well over 400 reviews in this Amazon posting I didn't read them all, though I did my best to read as many of the negative ones as possible, once again, showing my bias. I started by reading the positives and found that they were basically all along the same lines, praising the greatness of the artists, the director, the visuals, and the accomplishments of all of their visions. I guess they were the same people that Mama Mia was created for.About all I could add to the line of positive thoughts about Across the Universe is that the film did its best to follow thru with an exploration of that era's look, feel, and philosophies, while attempting to include all sorts of events and music innovations (was that woman supposed to Janis and her boyfriend Hendrix), although, those were bastardized as well, ala Woody Allen's Zelig style, and later Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump.Maybe I'm thinking of Across the Universe was a mutation birthed by a copulation of THE FILMS Hair and Godspell.If you want to see a movie with Beatles' songs in it see Hard Day's Night, see HELP, even go see Yellow Submarine (not one of my favorites though great music) but whatever you do, don't see Across the Universe and then walk around telling people you just saw a great Beatles film because all you saw was this bad piece of crappy celluloid. If you want to hear great Beatles' songs, listen to the Beatles. Listen to any one of their songs, song by them, and then compare it to the songs in this film. If you think these were as good, came even close, or were actually better, then . . . you, my friend, are just a fool without a hill.Note: I'm not a fan of the films Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band and Tommy (OK, not a Beatles' film but all of these films are of the same mindset, look and feel), but this ain't no Tommy, it ain't no SPLHCB (though I guess that was what they were thinking), and it ain't a decent attempt at properly portraying the Beatles' songs. PS: I find it extremely unfortunate that the writer, director, and producers felt they needed to coop the aspects of British music history (the way they used the Beatles' final roof concert as a plot dressing in the closing of this film turned my stomach) that they did in this film and morph them into some sort of American bastardization of life seen thru American eyes during that era. But I guess that was what this movie was all about, morphing life into their desire to make money. Am I wrong or did this movie only last 3 weeks in theaters?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaotic, but beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Julie Taymor was not shy about saying there wasn't much dialogue in the film. There is a share of dialogue, but mostly to transition to the next musical scene - no large bodies of text or academy award winning speeches. This is a musical to its very core. It has a lot of ideas and there's always a lot going on. Most of it works.The 90s onward have been cursed with jukebox musicals, using an artist's songbook for the story. While Across the Universe does this, it doesn't spin some hackneyed Vegas style musical together and instead uses the Beatles songbook very appropriately, detailing lovelorn tales, drugs, and the ever so political decade of the sixties.So it shouldn't surprise anyone that while the songs are used mostly to tell a love story of Lucy and Jude, the plot plays merely a supporting role to the images and performances that the Beatles songs inspire. The ones that stuck out to me were "She's So Heavy" which was transformed into a nightmarish image of individuals reporting for the draft and "Strawberry Fields Forever," offering perhaps the best narrative portion of the film were the two male protagonists use it as a vehicle to state their conflicts. It functions well on a dramatic and aesthetic level.But with all the wealth of ideas, there are a couple missteps. The amount of characters can be overwhelming. It mostly works, but Prudence could've easily been excised from the script, as she is merely a subplot and her take on "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" comes off as unintentionally funny.My only other complaint is that a little too much time is spent on some "Drug tripping" sequences. While it's appropriate to the times, it seems more like a way for Taymor to do more visual work, which is fine because the scenes look fantastic.And I guess that's what it boils down to. The performances and visuals stand out so much in this film that it's hard not to recommend even with the chaotic overflow of characters, subplots and sometimes bizarre imagery. It's a feast for the senses and thoroughly enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Across the Universe" was one of the best movies of the season. With such titles as "30 Days of Night" and other B-movies to look forward to, AtU was an uplifting adventure that kept you mesmerized and enchanted. There is only one flaw in its entirety. The creators of this excellent piece decided to make a movie that fit in as many of the Beatle's greatest hits (all of the movies songs are remakes of original Beatle's songs) with stunning, albeit a little odd, special effects into a two and a half hour period. What would have made it so much more enjoyable would be a more in-depth story line and fewer songs. There are twenty nine songs that are sung in this movie. Each one is roughly between two and five minutes. In comparison to "Moulin Rouge!", a movie similar in many aspects, "Moulin Rouge!" had fourteen songs that were sung by the actors. This left room for more acting sequences and thus, a far more riveting experience. "AtU", because of its significant greater number of songs, was not allowed the time to show the prowess of its actors, only their voices which, without a doubt, were enchanting. Which brings me to my next point, the songs. I am an actor and hopeful singer. Thusly, I was hypnotized by the voices of all of the characters. The entrancing tones are only matched by the visual effects that accompany them. I bought the soundtrack about a month before the movie was released. I was not a huge Beatles fan when I bought the soundtrack on iTunes. Now I cannot get enough of them. It is amazing to hear the transformations between the original tracks and the revamped "AtU" tracks. The brilliantly executed songs sound even better when accompanied by the visual effects sequences in the movie. The movie also deals with a lot of issues on peace and the war in Nam. One of my friends who accompanied me in the theater was a little upset at the "hippie peace" people, due to the fact that he is a hard core supporter of war and the troops. Thusly, I would suggest this movie to anyone, only a little less enthusiastically to those who share the same views as my friend. Overall, the movie is given an eight out of ten in my book. Its only drawbacks occur with the lack of significant acting sequences and the large number of songs. Either way, the movie is highly suggested and should be seen by all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure artistic expression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The World through the perception of a lost era. A vision that could only be described as optical poetry. No creative entity of film making went untapped. As well as amazing visuals, this film had brilliant plot, dialog, and acting. Everything about this movie delivers pure passion and reminds us of the timeless period of free love, through grade a musical interpretation. Any fan of the Beetles or any music of the Vietnam era will love this movie. Truly a heart felt story of love, loss, and strife. I predict this to be one of the ageless classics of our time. An absolute breathe of fresh air during the most stagnant and creatively void periods of film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have seen it twice already!!! What a masterpiece and a work of art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw it, I wasn't too sure I'd like it, because I usually don't like "musical movies,"(for instance 'Hairspary.') But, as I became more and more engrossed in the characters, the story and the music I felt myself literally immersed in this film...enough to go see it again and take my mom who lived through the times shown in the film. She loved it too and said everything, from the clothing to the whole feel of the film was soooo from her era. It reminded me a little of Moulain Rouge but so much more artistic and the story line itself was very strong as well as the actors. I felt myself laughing, tearing up, and getting chills especially when 'While my guitar gently weeps" is played toward the later half of the film. The special effects in this, from the love-making water scene to the army draft, to "Bono's" Trippy bus ride were enough to make me want to own the DVD, the soundtrack, and hope this film gets nominated for an Oscar for the creativity and true artistry it displayed that is not often seen in films anymore. Go see this!!! On drugs ;) or off it will take you on a wild ride that you'll want to pay to take again and again...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Across Generations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm at an age where extolling the virtue of The Beatles' legacy and impact on culture can be nothing more than a tiresome exercise in presumption ... something I seem to be guilty of in most of my writings anyway. But as someone from Generation Y, I am apt to admit that I'll never know what it was like to experience The Beatles firsthand. I'm content to say I've made sure to expose myself to that music and indeed I do love it, both casually and as a listener striving to appreciate those sonic innovations the group is reputed to have brought forth.I do feel a kind of good fortune in my dad having been of that generation and sharing his memories with me. And The Beatles seemed to have been intrinsic to his experiences (my mother -- for her part but not to her discredit -- was on about other things at that time).If I may be so bold, I think a picture like this is bound to work better for someone my age than for my dad and others of his generation. This is a sentimental mosaic-anthology conceived by minds ostensibly younger than the period it explores, where the music comes permuted and wrapped around visual memes clearly meant to connote the familiar idea of care-free romanticism and innocence frozen for a moment in history, when America was on the cusp of the disillusionment and cynicism that pervades its society today. It was a shifting perspective often sighted in The Beatles' work, with "Rubber Soul" always acknowledged as the turning point in their musical ethos. Surely any young person watching this will not mistake its depiction of '60s-'70s history as anything more than a simplified encapsulation. And for them, as well as the filmmakers probably, that immortal chorus, "All you need is love" may have an untarnished urgency no longer shared by those who feel they went through a kind of collective up-and-down phase along with John, Paul, George, and Ringo.The movie's boy-meets/loses/gets-girl plot is absolutely standard and without innovation and all the better for it, because the life-blood here is not the story or characters, it's the music. It's the through-line. What you see on the screen are really little more than avatars. Now, those avatars still need to be intelligently designed by the filmmakers for maximized effect, and fortunately that is the case here. Some sequences are flat-out terrific, such as the early scene in a bowling alley ("I've Just Seen a Face") and the later one in a recruitment office ("I Want You"). Some of the actors do their own singing (quite well) while others are dubbed, and though the resulting interpretations don't always coincide with my own (nor yours), that lump is easily swallowed once we remind ourselves of a fundamental aspect of music, which is universality.Where I think the film might not work for people who lived in the thick of that tempest (maybe I'm wrong) is in the fact that it doesn't end on the note of disillusion which history records. It doubles back with an optimistic conclusion, by which director Julie Taymor -- a most gifted visualist, never more so than here -- isolates the film and confirms it as something hardly representational of that time, as remembered by those who lived through it, but as a euphoric tone-poem kind of reality, experienced through the prism of the era's music, designed to key off emotional -- rather than objective -- notes. I think that's where some are going to have serious problems with this.But it's no great shakes for me to let that slide. As I write this I'm in my early 20s and whether or not that has anything to do with anything, I know I felt absolutely enabled to have an open dialogue with this picture on that emotional plane. It's a beautiful movie. A romantic, bitter, idealistic, cynical, gritty, trippy, sad, happy, clever, simple, complex, sardonic, sincere, exciting whirlwind of a movie that is all about its music. I walked out of the theater feeling as though my soul had been replenished. The best thing a film of this concept could hope to do is to inspire me in the same way that listening to a Beatles album can inspire anyone, regardless of their age or circumstance. This film achieves that.Blake's rating: 4 (out of 4)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up with the Beatles. I remember when Magical Mystery Tour came out - my brother bought it and played it non-stop. I remember the riots of the 60s, the horror of the Viet Nam war and the feeling of hope that saturated this time in history. This movie captures all of it: the look, the sound, the feel, the hair (Lucy's mother's hair in this movie is PERFECT) I got full-body chills about twenty times during this movie. It was like I was living those moments again: the fear, the joy, the hope, the wonder. And the music. Once again I am filled with gratitude for the Beatles and the miraculous songs they wrote. Just these disparate elements would have been enough, but Julie Taymor (and the writers of the screenplay) weaves it all together with a cast of believable characters caught in the throes of youth and revolution. I left the theater feeling like I was walking on air. A wonderful, wonderful film.I am relatively hard to please when it comes to movies - a bad script, bad directing, careless attention to details can all damage my enjoyment of a film. Hollywood seems to crank out steaming crap pile after steaming crap pile these days. But Across the Universe is a revelation. In my opinion, it is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish this movie was required viewing for anyone who lived through the era of the Vietnam War--just to remind ourselves what a senseless war that was, and perhaps to ignite some more activism against our current senseless war. This is a superb movie--which starts of lightly, perhaps a bit silly--because all the characters are so two dimensional. But the total mass of all these characters gives the movie a greater depth. And the subjects it begins to tackle--the draft (and avoidance of draft), activism, USA's mission in Southeast Asia--without European support, drugs, sex, bisexuality, rock &amp; roll,Detroit riots, police brutality, and more.Three comments: First, the music is great!--and surprisingly not cliché in the choices and placement. Secondly, a good portion of the movie is visually fantastic. And lastly, great casting--one feels the loving chemistry between the characters. Bottom line--this movie starts like a chick flick and ends like The Deer Hunter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is a very good film that succeeds on its own terms, as a musical revue of the 1960's. A lot of the criticism of the film centers around the fact that it glosses over the tremendous upheavals of the 1960's by reducing them to glorified music videos. It is expecting too much to ask for a musical to really deepen our understanding of such a large historical moment. What the film does do well is remind us that there was a context for the Beatles' music. The settings for the songs serve as a kind of shorthand reminder of the larger context. Case in point: the setting of "Let it Be" as a funeral hymn sung at the funeral of an African-American boy killed in a race riot. On the one-hand, it reduces the racial tensions of 1960's America to three short minutes--on the other hand, it reminds us that "Let it Be" is really a hymn, a prayer for peace in a time of tremendous upheaval. And it is exquisitely sung. It is a moving moment in the film.On the whole, Julie Taymor really makes the music come alive on the screen. Some of the voices are fantastic. Dana Fuchs is wonderful as the Janis-Joplinesque singer, and T.V. Carpio's tender rendition of "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" early in the movie drew me in completely. One of the other criticisms of the film is that the versions here can't hold a candle to the originals, and here I have to vehemently disagree. Lennon and McCartney were great performers AND great songwriters, and it is a testament to their strengths as the latter that their music can be reinterpreted with such success. But it is also a testament to the music producers, arrangers and singers that the new versions work so well. "Helter Skelter," for one, is every bit as engaging as the original. The film is all the more impressive as many of the Beatles' recordings have become almost cliché--especially now that they have begun to be used more in advertising.On the whole, a very imaginative film, which leaves you wanting more from director Julie Taymor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>do I want what Julie Taymor is smoking? overlong, visually stunning work of pop art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to love the Beatles. They're almost the apex of what British rock/pop music was in the 1960s, and their legacy will remain long after Paul and Ringo join John and George. The songs were of love, and other wild and crazy things, and from everyone 2 to 22 to 64 to 100 can find appeal in the melodies, the harmonies, the experimental usage of sound effects and other tools at the time. Now comes Across the Universe, adapted from the stage musical, and it's like a half lovey-dovey goofy romantic drama, half mind-warp commercial for classic Beatles songs, not to mention a kind of condensation of infamous moments in Beatles pop-culture (sans the Ed Sullivan Show for some reason). At the least, it intrigues one to think how this could ever be executed on a stage- or if it is somewhat less ambitious- though on its own it seems to cast an impression that should be taken on its own. This is mostly due to director Julie Taymor making this a kaleidescope of 60s socio-political fever ala Hair, only unlike Forman's film Taymor weaves in and out of making something of a crazy exploitation film, and it's in these moments that a break from 'conventional' musical film-making can be seen.But in a way the experience of seeing Across the Universe reminded me of what I thought of Pirates of the Caribeean: At Worlds End; both films are overlong, at least by a few (if not more) minutes, tend to not make much sense at times, and also contain some chunks of tastefully tasteless acts of brazen, hilarious surrealism (where Verbinski had Jack Sparrow in Davey Jones's locker, this time we get Bono as Dr. Robert, and Eddie Izzard performing 'Benefit of Mr. Kite' in sequences that would've thrown the AIP people for a loop with their psychedelic product). The story is meant to be simple, as many musicals tend to shoot for, and anyone who's seen a few melodramas will know what's going on in plot turns: Jude and Lucy are a British kid and an American girl respectively who meet when Jude comes to America looking for an estranged father (only seen in two scenes, by the way), and Lucy meets Jude by way of brother Max (as in Maxwell Silver Hammer, there's more in-references).Soon Jude and Max decide to split the college area, go rent out an apartment in New York City thanks to (Sexy) Sadie, who soon meets Jo-Jo (come on flat-top) right out of Detroit and can play a mean guitar for her singing group, and then there's also Prudence who "came in through the bathroom window." Then there's love, a good chunk of drama, horrors of war and protesting as backdrops for the wishy-washy love-affair between Jude (who doesn't see the reason to go all-out with the protesting) and Lucy (who doesn't seem to realize until her bosses at the Democratic-action headquarters are making bombs something is fishy). If this sounds like it's getting not as simple, I neglected to mention the throwaway psychedelia scenes, making up a good twenty minutes in the mid-section of the flick.What ends up distinguishing this flawed film- and it's hard not to have at least some criticism even if you go into this a die-hard Beatles fan, as more or less forty years has made playing on a roof-top old hat, or just in the putridly conventional turns the story makes in the last fifteen minutes (including a version of 'Hey Jude' that makes an already overrated hit even more unbearable)- is really the vision behind it, the verve to make many scenes at least have the feeling of vibrancy and intimacy, and the guts to take theatricality into the realm of camera compositions, deranged lighting set-ups, production design out of underground paintings, et all. A scene like at the bowling alley is taken as far as it can, playing with all the space and as the actors (including the guy who played Jude, can't recall his name) make it fun times with the palette of colors used. But then when looking at 'Mr. Kite' or 'I Am the Walrus' (with the guest stars Bono and Izzard bringing their own weird quirks to the process), or even 'Because', all logic is cut-off, not even little bits like in other portions of the film (i.e. Prudence in the movie) and suddenly it's imagination incarnate.This all being said, I'm not sure when I would want to see this film again. It's not like one of the Beatles movies from the original era, where Help! or Hard Days Night or Yellow Submarine carried unique comic and cinematic charms as well as a level of rewatchability that's unparalleled in rock movies. It also becomes something of a nitpicky affair to go from one segment to another and have it jarring to find one excellent or touching and the next shrill or just stupid (despite them both being great performers, I couldn't stand the 'arc' given to Jo-Jo and Sadie). But the singing and performances, for what they're worth, are at the least fantastic covers (far and away better than those for I Am Sam), are quite accomplished and, for the 'kids' as it were spot-on for what's needed. And there's a balance that Taymor tries to keep in scenes like 'Happiness is a Warm Gun' where there's the aftermath of war and veterans in hospital beds, and at the same time six Salma Hayek nurses all doing dances, that are all her own. It's all nothing great, but I was glad I saw it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here in the UK, "Across The Universe" has had somewhat of a rough ride from some critics. (Hi there esteemed film reviewers of the "Independent" and "Metro" newspapers!) Basically they felt that "Across The Universe" was just awful; shoehorning the Beatles music into an ill-thought through piece of musical cinema, using those songs in wholly inappropriate and crass ways.I cannot say that I understand their opinion completely. Maybe you just have to be a Beatles fan to appreciate the film, but I thought that "Across The Universe" was absolutely wonderful.OK... Maybe not absolutely wonderful. Outside of the many great musical set pieces (there are 31 songs on the soundtrack) the film suffers from a somewhat lethargic pacing and a fairly witless and predictable story. Guff about the innocence of the early Sixties being eroded by Vietnam, civil rights, the expanding drug culture, sexual and political revolution is used as a background to a simplistic story of Boy meets Girl, Boy and Girl fall in love, Boy loses Girl, Boy gets Girl back and, hey, guess what? The message here is that "All You Need Is Love".You got all that? Good. Forget all of it, because what makes "Across The Universe" a really good film, and where it really works, is in the stunning visuals (Julie Taymor also made "Titus", which anybody will tell you is an astonishing looking film) and the brilliant versions of those songs, some of which are over 40 years old.Highlights?T. V. Carpio's version of "I Want To Hold Your Hand",reinvented as a lesbian torch song. Evan Rachel Wood's exuberant "It Won't Be Long" (I sadly have to report that I had completely forgotten that brilliant opener to "With The Beatles"), as a great, lost, call and response, Sixties girl group number. Bono's truly bonkers version of "I Am The Walrus". Joe Cocker's muscular take on "Come Together". Joe Anderson's "Happiness Is A Warm Gun" (with Salma Hayek popping up a a nurse, oh, yes!) Practically everything sang by Jim Sturgess ("Strawberry Fields Forever", "Across The Universe", "Girl") and Dana Fuchs ("Helter Skelter", "Oh Darling", "Don't Let Me Down").Er... Basically the highlights were all of the musical sections of the film. True, Eddie Izzard doing "Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite" was kind of terrible, but I think it was supposed to be terrible.Even if you are not a Beatles fan, and there are some of those curious creatures about (Hi there, Mr. Planet! Hi there, Graham!), there is a lot to enjoy in "Across The Universe". But be warned. You are almost certainly going to miss out on some of the fun Beatles references, he says smugly. (A girl climbing in through a bathroom window, anyone? The climatic rooftop gig being interrupted by the police, bringing to mind the last time the Beatles played live, on the roof of Apple headquarters on 30th January 1969.) I think that "Across The Universe" is worth seeing, but I would say that, being Beatles fan A number 1.Remember... "All You Need Is Love".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a little hesitant about seeing this, but it exceeded my expectations.Being a fan of Oldies' music, I was deathly excited to see what Julie Taymor would create from a script almost entirely based around Beatles' music. The first portion of the movie was phenomenal; I was sitting in the theater thinking "alright, this one is totally going on my favorites list." The creativity put into these music sequences was incredibly. I loved the bowling scene especially; I thought the guy who played Jude was great, especially with his quirky smiles and fairly decent singing voice. The whole idea of remaking the Beatles' music with the actual actors was also a good idea. I actually like some of these remakes (namely "Hey Jude", "Girl", and even "I want to hold your hand") as much or better than the originals. Probably the only pitfall for me was some unnecessary questionable content. A few downfalls... parts of the movie seemed like it was just thrown together using because Taymor was trying to stick too much to just music instead of creating a decent plot. Also, I'm fairly certain that the film could have been just as decent or possibly better without so many excessive drug and sex implications. I understand that this is an image of the 1960's, but Across the Universe could appeal to a larger audience if they cut out a bit of the nudity and such. Not to mention, I really don't understand how this film could have received a rating of PG-13; it certainly should have been R. However, all in all, I was highly pleased with the outcome, and am actually going to see it again on Friday. Cheers</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All right, top five things about the movie. Here it goes:5. The emotion of the sixties is captured in a completely new way. There are the highs, which get your heart beating and your mind racing (as well as redefine 'high'), and there are the lows, which take you so far into the characters lives and make you so connected that you feel the need to turn your head away in embarrassment.4. Not gonna lie, Jim Sturgess is attractive. He sports the short shag and the British long shaggy hair extremely well, he can sing with emotion...and he has that wonderful accent. For some, this is reason enough to see it.3. After I saw this movie and went around raving about it to my friends, one of the questions they asked me was who was in it. I honestly told them that it didn't matter. This is one of the best ensemble casts I've seen in a long time. Not all of these people are unknowns, but enough of them have gone under the radar that when they display the amount of talent that they do, you have a whole new appreciation for them.2. The movie straddles the line between reality and imagination and does so in a way that makes it a work of art. The surrealism is invoked at appropriate times, when drugs are implied or there is a mental breakdown, and doesn't hinder the plot, only helps it.1. The music. I ran out and bought the CD as soon as the movie was over and haven't stopped listening to it since. First of all, the actors are all extremely talented singers and it is pleasing to listen to. Second of all, this movie either redefines or reemphasizes the meaning and emotion behind these songs. The way the songs are incorporated into the plot make you rethink the words and it is the songs that carry the story and not the other way around. If you go into the movie looking for classic Beatles and an open mind, you will enjoy yourself. It is a new generation's swing on the classics, which needs to be understood. It is a reawakening of Beatles music.In a nut shell, see this movie with open ears and an open mind and you will not be disappointed. All you need is love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. It had a few disjointed moments, but was overall very awesome. The puppet sequences looked like they were directly from Bread and Puppets (not surprising, seeing that Julie Taymor apprenticed with the troupe in the 60's!), and caused my daughter to exclaim "hey, there's the cow!" (we had gone to Bread and Puppets in VT for the soul purpose of seeing the puppets after seeing the preview in August).Although I have at least one review downing the movie, I really liked it and was thrilled to see some of my favorite Beatles tunes incorporated into such a creative story portraying such a diverse period of our history. It was interesting trying to explain everything to my daughter, including why Max would have to hospitalized for drug addiction after returning from the war, and the vivid example of the civil rights race riots that occur early on in the film.We honestly need more films like this, giving us both the good and the bad points of periods of our history.</fullReview>

The movie showed the life of how many people lived in the 1960s, with peace marches, black history, drugs, love, dances, overall this movie was a truly good musical. The reason it lagged for so long was to show you every single detail of their lives, if they hadn't shown you the whole fight with Jude and Jenny you wouldn't have gotten the Strawberry Jam part towards the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's one thing to make a movie based around Beatles songs, how could you go wrong, but Across the Universe is so full of delightful surprises, so flawlessly executed, so heartfelt, it feels like a very welcome gift to our troubled world. I am no fan of on-screen dancing, but the choreography for the 'dance' numbers was so creative that I loved every minute of it. The actors singing voices all had a great sound and gave a new dimension to these "old favorites". Finally, the weaving of the songs into the storyline while sometimes predictable (and there's nothing wrong with that), at other times completely caught me off guard. I used to believe that there was no point in other musicians covering Beatles songs, because they couldn't be improved on -- after this move (and the I Am Sam soundtrack) I no longer feel that way.</fullReview>

The Beatle's music is assaulted with insipid versions that do no service to the paper thin plot. Serious money was spent on special effects and production value. What a waste!How long will it be before John Lennon is heard singing over a commercial for sleeping pills?The Beatle's music is so good that no amount of violation will cheapen it. This film will disappear and be forgotten soon enough but then again, if it makes a bucket load of money, maybe for Arts sake, a Broadway/West End musical will be produced.

		<shortDescription>It's borrowed cool and it doesn't work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time I saw a preview of this movie, I literally held my breath. That's how high my expectations were. After all, it's a movie about Beatles music. How could it go wrong? Let me tell you how.I had posted a short and scathing review after my first viewing of the film, but decided to give it another chance, based on the number of people who recommended it to me. Now, instead of having wasted two hours of my life on this tedious, pretentious montage, I've wasted four, and I think Julie owes me, anyone else who watched Across the Universe, and particularly the Beatles, an apology.I have to admit I'm not a huge Julie Taymor fan, and although Frieda was interesting, it worked marginally only to the extent that it relied heavily on the visual imagery of not only Frieda Kahlo, but also Diego Rivera. Nevertheless, it did follow that, if Taymor could mine those subjects successfully, she might have success with the greatest popular musical catalog of all time.She didn't.What she did do is force together, almost randomly, and often brutally, fully thirty-three Beatles tunes into a steaming dung heap of self-indulgence and pretension. I've seen drunken karaoke singers do better, and actually, I like the plot at karaoke night better than the flimsy story used to string this mess together. The love story ostensibly supported by so mercilessly torturing these musical masterpieces is touching enough, except that neither of the romantic leads, nor any of the other characters in the movie for that matter, is in any way even remotely likable. They are just as self-indulgent and pretentious as one must presume Taymor to be, based on her preposterously bombastic directorial style.What's worse, Taymor seems not to understand at all any of the zeitgeist of the sixties, although she did witness it firsthand, albeit from the insular vantage point of a privileged upbringing, which is patently obvious in how she casts her central characters as devoid of any obligation to do anything other than indulge themselves. Instead, she apparently views the most turbulent period in modern history as a string of sentimental clichés, and the people who populated that era as two dimensional cardboard cutouts with only a passing resemblance to actual, multi-faceted human beings. I love how easy it is to pretend to be a revolutionary when you're away at school on mommy and daddy's dime. Now that's real life.The movie itself is absolutely devoid of structure or substance, oftentimes breaking into song almost for lack of anything better to do. The music, to be sure, is sublime, and almost any visual accompaniment would benefit from it, but it should be the other way around. The visuals and the story should add something to the soundtrack, not rely upon it utterly. Oh, and Julie darling, for the record, the Beatles don't need pretentious directors conceptualizing meaning in their music. The greatest songwriting team in history already has that covered, sweetie. This movie is an absolute and complete mess. I kept expecting Simon Cowell to chime in from his perch center stage that the singers, other than the rare and magnificent appearances of the likes of Joe Cocker and Bono, who must not have had anything better to do, were "simply dreadful" as Mr. Cowell is so fond of saying. Indeed, most of the singers would not have lasted past the first round on American Idol, and some even used (over-used) pitch machines to ameliorate the tone of their voices. How lame is that? As someone who remembers the Beatles not simply as nostalgia, but as something that was integral to my youth, as someone who reveres John Lennon and his contribution to music, peace and love, I have to imagine that none of the Beatles, particularly John, would be pleased with this silly, shallow and trivial music video. I also have to object to the comparison of this disaster to Moulin Rouge. It's like comparing hamburger to filet mignon. One is a ground up mess. The other is perfection. One is a postmodern masterpiece. One is derivative, flaccid and unredeemably bad. I think we know which is which here.And what was with the Jimi Hendrix/Janis Joplin characters? Are we supposed to accept that as artistic license or character compositing? It was just silly, and, frankly, cheap, like the video clips of Walter Cronkite and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It's borrowed cool and it doesn't work. This movie has no cool of its own, and in the end, it was painfully, embarrassingly bad and should be a period at the end of the sentence that has been Ms. Taymor's run as a feature film director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as you'd think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take a whole bunch of songs by The Beatles. And then make a film around them using the songs &amp; character names. Doesn't sound like much of an idea for a film does it? But somehow they managed to sell it.When I saw posters and adverts for this film I had the feeling it was an animated feature, not live action. How wrong I was.It hasn't got any actors or actress's I know much about so I can't really talk about how this compares to previous movies they've been in. There are a couple of basic plots of a boy called Jude who goes to America to find his father who'd been a GI stationed in England during the war. There's also a plot about a guy who gets drafted and decides to have a final blow out before he leaves to go to Vietnam.The plots are intertwined with Beatles songs &amp; characters who feature in Beatles songs.There are nice locations that do look very 1960's but nice locations and a good soundtrack aren't enough to make for a good film. Trying to use The Beatles songs to link the plot together makes for a bit of a weird plot to be honest.Even with guest cameos from people like Bono, Joe Cocker &amp; Eddie Izzard doesn't make for a good movie. It's just too weird to make for a decent enough film to follow. The whole idea of wanting to be a free spirit during the era of protest and freedom and peace are all good themes but nothing is ever explored thoroughly enough to make a decent or lasting plot thread.The film is just too surreal in places and to be honest there are too many songs sung by the cast constantly breaking up the thread of the film itself making it harder than ever to follow.It's fine to have an Anti-Vietnam film but the fact that the cast keeping bursting into song every 5 minutes is exceptionally distracting from what little actual plot exists.Dr Robert's (Bono) rendition of "I am the walrus" does nothing but allow the film to move from New York out to the middle of no-where for pretty much no reason. He's only in the film for 2 scenes linked by his song, Izzard gets 1 scene and 1 song, Cocker gets a tiny cameo in 1 scene singing 1 song.If this had a lot more plot and a few less songs it might make for a half decent movie. I'd cut at least half the songs out, not have any of the characters singing at all(the music could stay but just as behind the actual action) and then it might stand a chance of being a movie people might actually be able to watch and enjoy.Comparing this to other Beatles related movies? This makes "A Hard days Night" bearable. Avoid, even if you are real huge Beatles fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is by far one of the most original movies I've seen! To call this movie a whimsical musical is so wrong. The way the songs are woven in to the movie is absolutely SPOT ON. I almost get a feeling the movie was made for the songs. All the best Beatles songs, but I do admit I'm not 100% familiar with all of them. Their other famous songs hat were left out would just not have suited the theme of the movie and after seeing it, you'll agree that the songs featured suit the period very well (think Beatles trippy period vs. the psychedelic parts of the movie).Across the Universe has that wonderful "feel good" about it unmatched by few. If you like Moulin Rouge you'll love this one too. To touch the subject of the movie, the era couldn't have been better chosen! The 60's... It's politically involving without going to far (there's no moral qualms trying to be settled re. the Vietnam war etc..) and it shows us the hippie movement doing what it does best, a hell of a lot of weed ;)Hope this makes sense...Go see this movie NOW! And then get the soundtrack ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, the 60's...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't listen to the mixed reviews: "Across the Universe" is a gorgeous, psychedelic musical, and easily my favourite film of 2007 so far. Julie Taymor (a Broadway veteran owner of a stunning visual style, as you can see in her previous features, "Titus" and "Frida") has created a breathtaking masterpiece that's even comparable to Baz Luhrmann's unique "Moulin Rouge!" (I'm biased, though, since "Moulin Rouge!" is my personal favourite musical ever).Yes, the movie is just a "2-hour music video", but a fantastic one at that. The Beatles' songs are more than enough material for a great musical, and Dick Clement &amp; Ian La Frenais ("The Commitments") know that. You can call some of the plot elements cheesy, but they work as fun stereotypes of the 60's. I was born in the late 80's and enjoyed the film with a "nostalgic" feel... you don't need to have lived in the 60's to know it was a time like no other: for music and the world itself; a time of change and war, but also of fun and passion. Maybe it's because today's popular songs are about umbrellas and putting *it* into your mouth, maybe it's because The Beatles were just plain great, but "Across the Universe" arrives at the right time, introducing Paul, John, George &amp; Ringo to a new generation. It's the kind of movie you should go watch with your parents and/or grandparents, and all of you will enjoy it equally (I promise:). The young cast (Jim Sturgess, Evan Rachel Wood, Joe Anderson and the revelation Dana Fuchs - what a voice that woman has!) does a fine job, and there are fun cameos by Bono, Eddie Izzard and Salma Hayek (sexiest singing nurse ever? I think so!), it's the only movie I've ever gone to see twice in theaters (and maybe I'll go see it again, if I have time while it's still playing). Generally, even if I love a film I've just seen in theaters, I wait for the DVD to see it again; but "Across the Universe" is one of those that deserves to be seen on a big screen, for the experience. Watch it on a double feature with the classic "A Hard Day's Night" (1964), and be prepared for a fun time celebrating an era like no other. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and teenagers and kids...hey, that's everyone, isn't it? I put off seeing this for a few weeks because I usually despise films that have inappropriate singing in it and thought because I hadn't seen any TV promo for it that it was one of those films that movie companies release under the wire hoping enough people will see it in order to break even financially; I couldn't have been more wrong! This film broke through all my cynical barriers and actually made my week! Intelligent, transparent merger between the spoken word and song, great acting (I didn't recognize any of the actors, but that's probably just me), and a fantastic script! The special effects weren't overworked even though they were used often, you didn't feel barraged by them. I actually cried during a few scenes... Ironically, this movie somehow applies in some surrealistic way to the war in Iraq that we're fighting presently; Hopefully, it will inspire our youth and boomers to unite as one in an effort to put an end to what's happening to those fighting in the Middle East (and other locations). I will see it again...this movie is the sleeper hit of the year!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie was to the 60's what Grease was to the 50's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this movie and I must say - that was fun! The story is pretty universal - a guy and a girl from two different cultures fall for each other and their differences strain at their relationship, but eventually love conquers. The story has been told a lot of times - this one was set in the hippie period. But the centerpiece of this movie is the music.One thing a great musical requires is great music - and how can you get better than Beatles music? Listening to all those extremely familiar songs, I still marvel at the changes in chords and the way the music unfolds - awesome - makes me want to cry. Music really gets a person where they live - it exalts the human spirit and adds poetry to everyday experience - great music does it in a great way - Beatles music is great music.So with the awesome music, the movie has a great head start. Beyond this it is pretty well done - capturing the culture, politics, fashion and icons of the time. (We were pretty sure we saw Joe Cocker in this movie and IMBDb confirms it.) I noticed the director was born the same year I was - knowing Beatles songs inside out and having lived this era caused the movie to mean a lot to me. In addition, the movie had that aspect that you can't just put your finger on - it just moved me.I know I'm biased, but I believe the years 1965 to 1973 or so were the best ever for music. Every generation rebels against their parents' culture and that usually includes the music. But there is something different about the music of this period. I have noticed that my children's generation and all the subsequent generations to the "60's" rebelled against my generation - but the music is an exception. Subsequent generations to the 60's seem to love 60's music and Beatles music. So this adds some universality to the movie. There were several girls about 16 years old in the row in front of us in the theater - we could see they loved the music and this movie as much as we did. (My frame of reference to the movie was the hippies, protests, Vietnam War, etc. - I can't help but wonder what their frame of reference is for such a movie?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This beautiful work of art tore me apart -- in an amazing way. If you feel, like I do, that reality just keeps knocking you down, there is nothing like escaping across the universe. Cute boy, rebel rockstar meets the beautiful prom queen-esquire girl next door. The music works extremely well to go along with each scene. I didn't see one viewer not stand up and give a clapping standing ovation at the end. Visually impeccable, this is not just a movie for Beatles fans, but for those who love and want to be loved in return. Rhymatically the movie paced itself, incorporating the hypocrisy of war protesters, civil unrest both in the US and Vietnam and how love conquers all. Let's face it. We all want the good guy to win, and I fell in love with these characters and rooted for them to be together all the way. Buy the soundtrack, and yes, it's not Lennon/McCartney and it's not what it's supposed to be. We're here to see how people of ever age, race, sexual orientation, etc. can relate to each Beatles song, singing it with such convincing passion that you're glued to your seat, maybe shedding a tear or two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ticket To Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first laid eyes and ears on the Beatles at age 11, and consider myself a charter member of the era and a volunteer protector of the legend. This was unapologetically the music of my young life. This is the music I introduced to my children, and God willing, will teach my grandchildren.Fresh vocal and instrumental arrangements of the group's most famous songs, formed together as a story of young love in the midst of civil unrest and war, made interesting with fantastic choreography and special effects, and fun with Beatles allusions, were enough to hold me spellbound, laughing, crying, and overwhelmed, for more than two hours. It was a fantastic roller coaster ride and I wanna do it again.In only the briefest moments was I disappointed or puzzled by some of the minor clichés and unnecessary puns, and in others, stunned with the intuitive RIGHTNESS of the images.Since another commentator already mentioned it, I LOVED the funereal procession of soldiers carrying the Statue of Liberty to "She's So Heavy." You don't need to be an intellectual to interpret the message of patriotism as a crushing burden in those times. The use of "Strawberry Fields" was a deeply moving metaphor, as well, but I won't spoil it for you.Some of the negative critical reviews, I suspect, were written by persons who either did not live the era or somehow expected the movie to deliver a profound, all-encompassing insight not demanded of other entertaining movie musicals. Someone even foolishly compared it to the ditsy long-ago Sgt. Pepper movie (with the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton), leading me to suspect that they had seen neither. No, you will still need to be a scholar of the Beatles, the 60s, and the Vietnam War in particular, if you want to begin to know "what it all meant."But for those who simply want to enjoy a quality musical and visual production set to the images and music of their young lives, yet told fresh and anew by young talents, you will be very pleased. It resonates with love, care and respect, just like a ringing George Harrison guitar hook over a burst from Ringo's solid drums, leading into a soaring Lennon-McCartney harmony.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ACROSS THE UNIVERSE is a 'magic carpet ride' of incredible music and a love story of a wonderful young man's journey from Liverpool to America and the lessons he learns about real love, suffering and what it takes to find the woman of his dreams-and more. This is a great film and the cinematography is out of this world and Bravo! Julie Taymor for giving us a film you wanted to bring to the screen and not be dominated by the demands of a studio. I loved this film from the opening to the closing frame and it has the magic of ONCE with a dash of HAIRSPRAY in another role played by the incredible Evan Rachel Wood and a fabulous cast of actors and dancers.Having grown up and come into 'manhood' in the '60's, ACROSS THE UNIVERSE hit home to me with the remembrance of the draft, Berkeley and People's Park, the flower children of San Francisco and like the songs from the Beatles, I kept thinking about the Jefferson Airplanes' WHITE RABBIT and Grace Slick belting out her songs in Golden Gate Park and of course, the powerful songs of Janis Joplin.I look forward to hopefully seeing ACROSS THE UNIVERSE at Awards Season for a nomination and the pleasure of watching the cast again deliver a breathtaking performance and command of a love story which connected such an important time of events in American history.</fullReview>

I also like Julie Taymour's work, she's a great director and I hope she does really well in the future. Evan Rachael Wood is probably going to get a golden globe nomination, Jim Sturgess looks like Paul McCartney a little bit. If they make a Beatles movie he should play Paul, Paul Dano, should play John Lennon cause he kind of looks like him a little bit. Joe Anderson to me looked liked Curt Kobain, and Martin Luther who played JoJo looked like Jimmy Hendrix, so it kind of had a pattern of some sort</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Across the Universe" is a brilliantly directed film that wants to be more than a typical love story, but has a hard time. The fantasy musical numbers are really half and half with wonderful and strange. Even the strange ones are enjoyable, though confusing.The film deals with a young man from Liverpool, Jude, who's in America to meet his dad, and Lucy, a well to do American girl. They fall in love, while the Vietnam war is still raging. Lucy's brother Max has to go in. Subplots from characters named after Beatles songs like Sadie the aging rocker, and Prudence the closeted homosexual come into play. It's really pretty standard fare material. The musical numbers make this a fun movie. With that said, "Across the Universe" does have a good sense of humor for a drama/musical. Though the characters aren't overly developed, they are all still likable.I enjoyed this film very much, but it did have it's problems. Sometimes it felt like a surrealistic masterpiece, and sometimes it felt like "Blues Brothers 2000". Luckily the surrealistic masterpiece won over the other.My rating: *** out of ****. 126 mins. PG-13 for nudity, language, violence and drug use.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've got an idea. Let's take some of the greatest songs ever written, suck all of the wit, irony and originality out of them, have them performed by second rate performers, create some cardboard "characters" to "sing" these songs and act out a "plot" cobbled together by the original songs' supposed "meanings." Brilliant! When I first began playing music as a teenager, I began with songs from bands like the Eagles, Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, etc. It was only after I had been playing for about five years that I truly attempted to learn the Beatles' music, and, when I did, their timeless songs opened up whole new musical horizons for me that I am still exploring to this day. I am convinced that the Beatles' music will still be widely shared and enjoyed 200 years from now. Their songs were of a certain time in history, but their meaning is timeless. This movie is horrible. It's an outrage. It's the film equivalent of taking all of Picasso's work, hacking it to little bits and having those pieces rearranged by a far lesser artist into some hackneyed "interpretation" of what someone thinks Picasso was trying to "say." Now, one might argue that the Beatles' music are pop songs, not great art, and therefore are game for this kind of "homage." Fair enough. But if you truly love the Beatles like I do, forgo this bomb of a movie, and, instead, pop on some headphones and listen to their music. Close your eyes and let your own imagination paint a picture of the songs' meaning.</fullReview>

Although the plot is at times predictable, it is well acted with solid performances throughout the cast. Song selection, placement and performance are very good, the visuals are even better, dare I say stunning? Worth seeing just for the music sequences which are interwoven very well with the story development. Some of the cultural references may be obscure for those who did not come of age in this era but missing them will not detract from enjoying the movie. I know this will spark interest and the entire Beatles record catalogue will sell more briskly for a while, I wonder if anyone will pick up a copy of The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test after seeing this movie.</fullReview>

I went to see it and..............it exceeded every expectation that i had about his film!!!!!Words cannot describe this film. It's a love story. It's a musical. It's hip, bohemian, completely original, and...... uses the music of The Beatles to tell the story!!!!!! Julie Taymor has created a masterpiece. The songs fit perfectly into the narrative. Jim Sturgess &amp; Evan Rachel Wood are perfect for the roles of Jude and Lucy. Their love for each cannot be described with words, so music takes place instead. This movie makes you feel as if you are going along this journey of Beatles songs.It's not like a normal musical in which characters just burst in to songs, they do it subtly and with a kind of seamless flow. It's a very realistic story (with a couple of fantasy moments thrown in) and surprisingly, it's very political as well. This is truly a musical about sex, drugs and rock &amp; roll.Do not believe anyone when tell you this film is rubbish. This is the greatest love story ever told.3 Favourtie scenes: Dear Prudence, Because and Hey Jude.Rating: Infintity/10Go and see this film!!!!Totally worth the money!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me save you the trouble of having to watch this film: Guy is loser in Liverpool. Moves to the States, becomes loser there. Falls in love with promising young lady who turns into loser anti-war fanatic. Loser guy gets deported to Liverpool. Loser guy comes back, but is still a loser. Gets back together with girl, who is still a loser as well.Character arch? Development? Lessons learned? Nothing.But let us ignore the silly characters who never learn or develop in any way, except to change for the worse. Perhaps the film's saving grace is in its social significance. Maybe it was trying to, you know, "tell us something." What, oh what could that be? That, folks, will remain a mystery. The only stretch I can make here is that the director is trying to make a comparison between the anti-war sentiment of the '60s and the lack of it today. A way to rile up the crowd, so to speak.Still, even with that in mind, the film falls flat due to a terminal bout with pointlessness. Some character named "Prudence" (hey, ya think we'll hear them sing 'Dear Prudence' later on?!) dressed as a cheerleader sings a song, then disappears only to sneak into some strangers' flat for no apparent reason (I cringed when one of the characters said, matter of factly, that she "came in through the bathroom window"), then has some lame emotional upset and that's that. The only purpose she served in the film was probably to put in an Asian face 'cause, you know, we gotta have a nice collection of faces representing every continent in every single film that comes out of that infested hole called Hollywood.Speaking of such lameness, there is a character who is a Janis Joplin clone and a guy supposed to look like Jimi Hendrix. Why? Wait, don't ask why. That's not important now! What matters is that we can now cue the interracial relationship. How groovy.Perhaps the most irritating part of the film is the development of a character who is a well-to-do young white woman from a good family. She moves to New York to study at Columbia, then falls in love with Liverpudlian loser mentioned above, becomes a complete anti-war fanatic freak, starts smoking, getting high, squanders her future, and then... stays that way till movie's end. For cryin' out loud, at least get us to the point where the characters have grown past the ridiculousness and filthy depravity of the abomination that was the 1960s and have grown up a little.Then there was the inexplicable hippie van ride the main characters took with some west coast druggie guru to go meet some "doctor." We see them driving there whilst enduring some idiotically performed song by the "guru." When they arrive, the doctor won't see the guru. The guru takes his loser horde and drives back to the west coast, leaving our main characters stranded. They all lay in the grass and sing -- again. Why? We will never know.Then there are the "visuals." Oh god, the friggin' visuals. Sure, every pretentious, nonsensical art school student here probably liked them, but if you are an even halfway logical individual you will probably not only be bored but downright revolted. The most enduring image I have in my mind is that of a bunch of incredibly freakish-looking naked female creatures with pasty white skin and disgusting contorted faces falling backwards slow motion into the ocean. We even get a close up of one of the she-freaks' twisted faces. Yeah. Great visuals.The only enjoyable part about this movie consists of the first two minutes, as the movie open up with Liverpudlian dumbass Jude singing the opening verses to "Girl." "Is there anybody going to listen to my story / all about the girl who came to stay." "Woohoo," you think. This is gonna be good. Little do you know what's in store for you.The other interesting scene is an army recruitment sequence where the soldiers are cartoonish, identical characters, preparing everyone for in-processing while performing a mechanical choreography. I can't remember which song was used for this, probably because its rendition was less than memorable.And, lastly, speaking of the songs, I don't think they were that bad. I really enjoyed the rendition of "Come Together," as well as "Hey Jude." Aside from that, nothing else about this film is memorable, and I'd like to forget what little I do remember.Stay away from this tripe. If you want to see a socially significant film dealing with the '60s, rent "Forrest Gump" instead.</fullReview>

Every other scene a talentless singer does an acapella cover of a few lines of a beatles song- it really hamstrings the film and also causes projectile vomiting if you are a musician and can sing and like the beatles- you won't be able to sit through this crap and live. I love the beatles and I hate this film. It's utter rubbish like that hag of a movie that Nicole Kidman was in La Cage Aux Follies- really talentless losers hacking good songs to pieces and looking good doing it but sound simply pathetically awful and talentless in the singing. After the sixth pointless acapella of a slaughtered and ruined beatles song, I shut this piece of crap off.PLOT: A liverpool boy is off to America but it looks like everyone can't stop going acapella and singing beatles song off-key and off time and very painfully bad. This will make a real beatles fan slit their wrists so they don't have to watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was absolutely horrid. It was a terrible waste of time and money. Nearly 2.5 hours of an painful attempt to create art that only produced an embarrassment. The only storyline was about a bunch of self-indulgent hippies complaining that they can't get what they want. Nothing but crying and whining set to no-talent performers singing horrifically bad covers of mediocre Beatles songs that made me want to jab a pencil in my ears. If it wasn't for the fact I was with my fiancée, I would have left the movie after the first hour. I would rather spent that time watching paint dry than even consider watching this movie again. The sad part was that I really had high hopes for this movie, but it just failed to produce in any category.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Who can protest and does not, is an accomplice in the act." The TalmudToo long I have been waiting for an heir to the creative energy of Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge, but I found it in Julie Taymor's Across the Universe. Both use already established music to fit the book of classic stories about love and loss. Taymor's equals the visual virtuosity but doesn't have the emotional range of Luhrmann's. However, it uses more effectively the music to further the story, in this case the Beatles' canon to reflect the story of '60's era lyrical love and violent protest. It is simply a perfect blend of an era with its music.The '60's and the Beatles are inseparable as the group sang sweet songs of love that also protested adult suppression and the slaughter of thousands in an unjustifiable war in Vietnam. Jude (as in Hey) (Jim Sturgess) is a bloke from Liverpool looking for his natural father in maintenance at Princeton. Better than his limited dad, he finds Lucy (as in diamonds) (Evan Rachel Wood), falls in love, and at one point loses her to the war protest movement, inspiring one of the most imaginative sequences with Strawberry Fields Forever and bleeding berries. Not every song works this well, but at the least they feel organic to the story, much like the songs in the recent eccentric, endearing musical Once. The songs in Across the Universe are variously integrated into the story and introduced softly and naturally. From "Let it Be" as a lament for fallen soldiers in Nam and citizens in the '67 Detroit riots to simply gorgeous nudes slithering and smooching underwater to "Because," it all works.Having spent some time in mid-twentieth century America, I can attest to this film's fidelity to the spirits of revolt and love. The contrast with today is that while love retains iconic status in the culture, the spirit of protest, so worthy of the current illegitimate war in Iraq, is not visible except in the hands of Maureen Dowd and Jon Stewart. The idealists who dominate this vigorous and occasionally languorous musical don't seem to go out much anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot find words to explain the awfulness, craziness, and ridiculousness of this movie. It seemed to me, that the creators of this movie spent more time on the soundtrack, than the actually story and characters themselves. The movie had no sense of plot, suspense, character building at all. All it was, was a very shallow and very, very empty love story trying to mix in a war drama and basically everything that happened in the sixties. The movie dragged on, for what reason? I don't know! I couldn't care about the ending of the movie because I couldn't care what happened to the bland characters in the movie. Especially Prudence, i thought she did a horrible job acting and her character was very insignificant to the story. It had me wondering, why is she here? why is she in this movie? is she supposed to symbolize the gay population? Don't waste your time, if all you care about are visuals in a movie, then this one is the one for you! Because only the visuals were good, but everything else was just plain stupid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Was Embarrassing to Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a huge Beatles fan, I've been excited to see this movie since the trailer was released a few months ago. I was disappointed that the movie wasn't in a theater closer to me, but I wanted to see it so badly, that my boyfriend and I drove an hour and a half to a theater that was showing it. When the movie opened up with Jude sitting on the beach singing "Girl" I turned to my boyfriend and squeezed his arm, it started off really well, and I was excited. But much to my dismay, it went insanely downhill from then on. As the movie continued I found myself looking around the theater, wondering if everyone else found the scenes as corny and absurd as I did. For example, Every scene with Prudence was completely cringe producing, because first of all the girl can't act and second the character lacked any sort of development. I was sitting there wondering "why the hell do I care about her?" She could have stayed in the closet as far as I'm concerned. (literally and figuratively) I literally got up and left the theater when the cast began singing "Dear Prudence" to her. IT WAS JUST SO CORNY. Such flat singing, and sloppily put together story line almost completely bastardized songs i have loved my entire life. I mean, I get it - this movie could potentially be saved by its overt cult value, and generally I am really opened minded to movies like that. What this movie lacked in that respect was awareness of its own absurdity. The drug references, the anti-war agenda, its forced but failing relevance to todays political and social issues, all proved to me that the director and the actors were taking themselves far too seriously. This movie is a joke. Evan Rachel Woods can't sing, she has the voice of a mildly talented girl in a poorly done high school musical. She is a mediocre actress, almost muted and boring to watch. The "Janis Joplin" and "Jimi Hendrix" sort of characters were just stupid, and too pointed, and way off topic. The movie didn't have to go through the entire 60's and try to reenact. That's too heavy of a burden, and far too vast and important of an era to be encapsulated by a campy musical. What it comes down to, ultimately, is that the story was written around the songs instead of vice versa. It would have made all the difference in the world if the story itself was strong, and the songs only served to compliment it, subtly. Instead the songs and their supposed meanings were forced on the story line. The ONLY instance of saving grace in this movie, was in the beginning during the "Let It Be" scene. The scene worked to show the racial and civil tension of the time, and the subtleness of the singing, and the real emotional impact was definitely effective. If only the rest of the movie could have achieved that poignancy. It didn't. I wasn't emotionally invested. I could go on and on. I think the movie was an embarrassment to some of the greatest music ever. John Lennon and George Harrison are rolling over in their graves. Additionally, Bono sucked, he's so self important. Seriously, don't waste your time. This movie is awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, for one, thought this movie was incredible. Being a long-time Beatles fan I can appreciate any rendition of their music (including Ben Harper's version of Stawberry Fields or John Butler Trio's Across the Universe), and I feel like this was beautifully done. Many people felt like this movie lacked heart or even a good plot, but I completely disagree. It was strewn together by song and the heart of the story was written in everything from the chemistry between characters to the way each scene was shot. There are a few different love stories, the main one being between Jude, played by Jim Sturgess, and Lucy, played by Evan Rachel Wood. Their love is challenged by different elements that I feel anyone can relate to. There's also the love that Prudence (T.V. Carpio) has for, well... pretty much any woman that pays her the right amount of attention. Lastly, there's a very sexual undertow between Sadie and Jo-Jo (Dana Fuchs and Martin Luther, respectively).Aside from the love stories, I feel that Max's character (Joe Anderson) provides the right amount of comic relief and depth that this story needed. Max gets drafted and you get to take a ride on the military mass production line. It shows all these young men going in in their skivvies and coming out basically carbon copies of each other.I guess, to sum it all up, this movie was just amazing. With that being said, I think it takes a different kind of person to really enjoy it. So, it's just not for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a Beatles fan from their first song (gives my age away). Watching this movie is going back in time to hear the songs and watch a story unfold that parallels what was happening in our world at the time. It truly took my breath away. Watching it with 3 teenagers, my sister and I were glued to the screen, almost unable to breathe, until the last note. The actors are a wonderful group of innocents on a trip that changes their lives (and hopefully how they will live their lives). Too many people have forgotten these years. Watch this movie--you will find yourself watching it again, talking about it the next day, and singing the songs you knew as a teenager! Don't expect "Sound of Music" or "Mama Mia", this one stands on its own as a great musical.</fullReview>

It is about 2 young people who fall in love and some how the Vietnam war keeps them apart and there is also a lot of war protesting involved. Beatle songs are sung all the time. Doesn't really have much to do with what little plot there is.No wonder I had never heard of this film before seeing it on cable. It was a complete waste of time. It was a bunch of hodge podge of songs and visual effects thrown in.FINAL VERDICT: One of the worst films I've seen. There was nothing interesting about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love. Love. Love. Love is all you need. This was one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen. It celebrated love of all types - unrequited love, sibling love, love lost and re-found, gay love, interracial love, parental love, and a love of the music of the Beatles.All this was played out amidst the upheaval in the 60s due to an unpopular war. The children of the 60s were not yet consumed with X-boxes and cell phones, and had the freedom to concentrate their energy towards the greater good.This film has all the elements of a winner. You were consumed with the names of the charters, and when a Beatles song would be woven into the story for these characters. The over 30 songs just fit perfectly with the story.What more could you ask for in a film than outstanding cinematography and sets, over the top choreography, costuming that was amazing, and acting that was superb. Of note, Evan Rachel Wood as Lucy, Jim Sturgess as Jude, Joe Anderson as Max, T.V. Carpio as Prudence, and Dana Fuchs &amp; Martin Luther as the couple Sadie &amp; Jo Jo. Add Bono, Eddie Izzard, and Salma Hayak and you can't miss.Without a doubt, one of the best films of last year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by no means a perfect film, but it remains one of my all-time favorites despite its flaws. Yes, it is thematically simple, even childish at times; yes, the plot is at times predictable and at times tangential to the point of madness; yes, some of the acting is wooden. But if you are willing to look beyond plot and character and see it first and foremost for its CRAFT, its FILMMANSHIP, if you will, you will find a dazzling masterpiece. The point of this film is not to accurately portray the 60's or realistic characters that may have lived in that time period, but to capture the period's ESSENCE through the songs of its most iconic musicians and a positively STUNNING sense of aesthetics that captures much of the psychedelic and liberal feel of the time. The film makes my heart soar and often takes my breath away. Any film that does that deserves praise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Julie Taymor may be a competent Broadway choreographer, but she displays a total lack of movie-making skill with this dreadful film. Though the Beatles songs are competently sung, they are wrenched out of their musical context in a way that completely put me off. Further, Taymor trvializes the Sixties in a contrived, mechanical and offensive way, hitting everything with the same superficial note. Even the choreography, supposedly her strong suit, is lacklustre. The actors are helplessly adrift in what amounts to a poorly conceived and executed procession of music videos. You can tell this movie is going to be bad within the first five minutes; by mid-point, things are hopeless. Not even enjoyably terrible, "Across the Universe" is a real dud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tried to like this movie, I really did, but except for the soundtrack, I felt as if I had just watched Julie Taymor's senior project from film school. While trying to be an homage to the Beatles and 60's counter culture, the non-existent plot and blatant reproduction of images from other works left me wanting the two hours that I spent watching this peace of drivel back. From the blatant copying of Richard Avedon's photographs of John and Yoko to the anachronistic nods to Zelig and Forrest Gump, it is clear that Taymor, Clement and La Frenais had no idea of structure or plot and simply recreated some very famous images in order to make a two hour music video featuring the songs of the Beatles. Toss in the one liners, "Strawberry Jamz", "Hello, Hello" "She came in through the bathroom window", "Meet Rita" and the transformation of JoJo into Jimi Hendrix, the Janis Joplinesque Sadie along with the none too disguised reference to the Merry Pranksters, Dr. Timothy Leary, the Hog Farm and the nod to Apocalypse Now and in the end you are not left with an original film but a poor derivative work made up of stock images which paints the 60's, not vibrantly as Peter Max would have, but in a very pastel shade of rose. This mish mash of unoriginal images is not good film making nor is it a fitting tribute to two of the greatest song writers ever, John Lennon and Paul McCartney. In the end, I wish that Max had beaten me with a silver hammer and put me out of my misery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was weary of renting 'Across the Universe' because it got so much hype, I felt I would be let down. Finally I broke down. This movie has been called, "Breathtaking," and, "Creative," but the only word I can use to label this atrocity is, "Bad." I felt it was only considered, "Breathtaking," because of the over-use of showy editing and vivid colors. I saw not one thing actually, "Creative," about this movie.Now, the cast DID have a good voice. It is my opinion that the cast was the only good part of the movie. The characters, on the other hand, is another story. The fact they were named after Beatles songs was unimaginative. Just because you put something to the Beatles does not make it, "Cool," or "Psychadelic."As far as being, "A great Anti-War statement," this is FALSE. The only part that made me sad abut war was when SPOILER: the little black boy is seen in a coffin.I think this movie was an excuse to show the female form and have it called, "Artistic," and show drug use in a nonthreatening way. As well as some little editor guy to get really stoned and put his hallucinations on film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the music of the Beatles and was curious to say the least when I happened to catch this movie on an intercontinental flight the other day. The fact that this movie, that hardly made it to theaters outside of the US, was on an in-flight program should have made me suspicious: after all, airplanes is where box-office bombs usually go to make up for revenue lost on the ground. The movie started out quite pretentious and even though the start - with Jim Sturgess' weak rendition of "Girl"- wasn't promising, the idea of a musical full of Beatles-music still sounded intriguing. However, not too long into the movie I was quite appalled by the exploitative character of this musical: the story hardly gets a chance to develop since every 5 minutes the story takes a U-turn because another excuse needs to be made for another actor or actress who takes himself or herself too seriously to start blaring out another Beatles-tune. To make it even more pretentious the history of the sixties is intertwined in the whole thing. Sometimes this makes for some unintended laughs, especially since the acting is usually quite bad. You can tell every air-headed cast member in this turd is convinced that his/her below-par rendition of any which Beatles-track they're singing is their big break, so they try and make it more "emotional" with meaningful contemplative dreamy look son their faces that make soap-opera acting suddenly look quite intense. You'll have a hard time taking any cast member (but especially leads Sturgess and Wood) seriously in any role after this. I know I will never be able to. To say this musical is a beautiful tribute to the music of the Beatles feels like saying that Heather Mills truly loved Paul McCartney. This musical is exploiting the Beatles just as much as she is. To Beatles-Fans and movie fans worldwide: stay as far away from this dud as you can. It bombed at Box Offices worldwide, with all the right in the world to do so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up watching musicals. "Oklahoma", "Singing in the Rain", "West Side Story"... These were great films with great stories and great musical performances. They tended to be on the longer side, but no one noticed while watching, because everyone was transfixed on the film. The fact that so many folks have praised "Across the Universe" in their reviews indicates that musicals, with quality production, could make a magnificent comeback.The music and the visuals were wonderful. I especially enjoyed T.V. Carpio's rendition of "I Want To Hold Your Hand" and Joe Cocker and company with "Come Together". The choreography as a whole was excellent! More than once, I found myself singing along.For me, the music sequences were able to sustain an otherwise ridiculous storyline that reminded me of 1978's "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band" or 1980's "Xanadu". In the case of "Across the Universe", the plot is haphazardly shaped around the lyrics of many Beatles' songs. There is (Sexy) Sadie and (Dear) Prudence, JoJo (Get Back) and (Hey) Jude, and even Lucy (In the Sky With Diamonds). It's all fun, sure, but the script lacks any serious creativity. The story's backdrop seemed to me an attempt at Forrest Gump meets "John, Paul, George, and Ringo". For me, it just didn't work as planned. About 30-45 minutes out from the end you start looking at your watch, but the finale leaves a very pleasant taste that lingers well after the credits have finished rolling.I would love to experience this film in an Imax as so much of it is an amazing combination of sight and sound. It could have been a masterpiece, but is still very good.</fullReview>

This movie made me realize just how good some of the Beatle tunes are that I had not previously thought highly of. Remember when Eric Clapton came out with his unplugged version of Layla which in it's original form wasn't a favorite of mine, well the unplugged version is. This movie is what I would compare as the unplugged versions of a lot of the Beatle music. This movie may be a love story but that is not the focus or even the reason for making this movie, it's all about the music and based on that it succeeds or fails. I think it definitely succeeds. The Janice Joplin and Jimmy Hendrix look and sound alike versions of some Beatle tunes are the highlight, but the best new rendition of a song is sung by Joe Anderson and is Happiness is a warm gun. Wow!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you don't like this movie, you're not a beatles fan. As beatles fans already now, the Beatles are one of, if not the most, influential band in music history. So, if you're not a "Beatles fan", then you might not love a movie which is a musical that tries to incorporate as many of the major Beatles songs as possible to add emphasis to all the drama. But, if you are a true Beatles fan, then you will love this movie with all your heart - it's that good. A true Beatles fan could not ask for anything more. Simply Brilliant. Plus, Rachel Evan Wood is one of the few teenage actresses that is good enough to be as good of an adult actress as she was a teenage one. As is evidenced by the downfall of so many of our youths, this transition is by far anything but a simple feat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was a young person I and my friends laughed at the scorn we received by our parents, the straights, and the establishment due to the new music, idealism, and freedom we embraced. We called it freedom, expanded consciousness, and heightened awareness when all along we were reducing our consciousness, and conforming to all the other rebels as though it was our own idea. We marched in step to self delusion and selfishness in the guise of liberation.The counterculture, and the resulting drugs, excessiveness, and permissiveness destroyed more people than all the wars combined, millions of lives all in the name of individuality and free expression. We still suffer from the effects of the self indulgence of that time now in the form of pornography, gambling, rap music, pop culture, stupidness, pharmaceutical drugs, laziness, fatness, and loathsomeness. We still have leaders today trying to make something good out of the lies of the past. You would think we had learned by now.We can thank the Beatles and others. Why we still celebrate them and can't see through what we fell for after all these years amazes me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No matter how hard I try, there is no word to describe the uplifting, emotional and truly sensational journey that this film took me on. It's simply indescribable. From the opening scene of waves crashing on a shore mixed in with newspaper headlines, a vague trace of the film's most powerful moment where the two lovers are ripped apart by police and protest and the classic 'Helter Skelter', it is clear that Taymor is going to take us on an epic journey of revolution, charisma and entrancing sequences of Beatles brilliance. Every single scene is so vibrant, fresh and unique.Taymor manages to keep the integrity of each work of lyrical art, while also adding her own distinctive touch of excellence to it. Each sequence is powerful, enthralling and utterly joyous. I really can't put the sensation this film gave me into words, but it's the most wonderful feeling I've ever experienced. And the most remarkable thing about it is that this feeling wasn't just during one particular moment or musical number, it hit me strong in the opening sequence and carried me on a pillow of divine euphoria unlike any experience I've ever had.The love story that plays out over the entire film is beautiful, painful and riveting. Both of these young adults are unique and beautiful revolutionaries, but they take their protests in very different forms. Eventually this drives them apart, and in an attempt to reunite we experience the film's most brilliant but painfully heartbreaking scene. As Lucy is being pulled away by the police during an immense protest, Jude fights his way through the crowd and officers to get to her. As they reach for one another, a club hits Jude across the face and he goes down. This all plays out under the cathartic collision of 'Helter Skelter' and 'Across the Universe' while we also see Lucy's brother, the resisted soldier, quickly falling into madness under the extreme pressures of the Vietnam War and Jude's face become bloodied and beaten. It's a scene that brought tears to my eyes and streaming down my cheeks. Thinking about it brings these tears back, but makes my urge to see the film again even stronger.The cameos should also be mentioned, as they are particularly lovely. Bono is hilarious as the drugged out, 'inspirational' Dr. Robert, but it's Eddie Izzard who steals the show. His Mr. Kite is hilarious, surreal and utterly brilliant and through him, Taymor creates a scene that will take you on an acid trip harder than anything Hunter S. Thompson experienced. Another bizarre cameo was that of Salma Hayek who had me lost for at least five minutes. I thought I was stereotyping every Latino woman into the same category of appearance, because I was sure it was Salma Hayek but was confident that she wouldn't take such a random and tiny part in the film. Of course this is when I remembered that Hayek was directed to her Oscar-nominated role in Frida by Julie Taymor and she must have asked to be in the film. Later I learned this to be true.Of course even though the cameos are so exceptional, the main performances highlight the wonder of the film. Evan Rachel Wood and Jim Sturgess have perfect chemistry and their acting abilities are just as profound as their lyrical beauty. In fact everyone who plays a musical part really amazes me by their singing talents. Surprisingly, it's Joe Anderson who steals the show in this one. He is charismatic, gorgeous and brilliantly hilarious throughout the first half of the film and then we see the entire affect that the madness of war plays on the mind simply through his painful eyes in the second half. Since the second I first saw the trailer, I thought this was going to be the greatest experience of my life. Slowly I realized that nothing could possibly live up the expectations I had created for this epic cinematic journey. Well, I was proved wrong as Taymor easily met my expectations and more than exceeded them. This was a journey unlike any other, and created a cathartic experience far too brilliant for words. Just impeccable in every way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of potential-horrible directing - with good musical sequences though-</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well ... what a waste of potential! if Paul Mccartney had the rights of the Beatles songs, he might only have let a capable director lay hands on them- The directing is a complete disaster!Although the psychedelic parts are really good without exception, the storyline is so disintegrated. Eddie Izzard as Mr.Kite though is exquisite; I thought who the hell is he reminding me of? I got it now he looks pretty damn much like Tony Curtis! Dr.Robert is quite good too(nicely portrayed by Bono)But overall the film just comes along incoherent.Most characters that appear don't evolve to any depth,nor develop any shape apart from the main character Jude.It's a real pity cause you can absolutely sense the potential- if only someone like Alan Parker,Milos Forman would have had the baton ...but further on: Jude has a really nice Liverpudlian accent,which is nice as a footnote because The Beatles were from Liverpool,England and so to bring a little more authenticity into the story. But then he's shown in this all American rich people's super mansion and the house's daughter sighs that she was never aware of her "o so normal life" when she hears Jude's story- Well but for Christ sakes! it is far from being "normal" to live in such a villa as she does! it's a f...... privilege for rich people!-John Lennon would have rolled over in his grave!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was waiting for this movie to come out, and when it did I wasn't aware because I thought it had a different title, but then I found out. It was amazing, I was a little under the influence which only made it better. How someone can make a film about the biggest cultural phenomenon of the 60's AND make Beatles music fit into it is ridiculous, and the trippy things that happened only made it better. I must say the ending was fairly anti-climactic though, and the theater I was in had REALLY crap audio so it was all crackly, definitely a bummer, but still a great movie none the less. Until I saw this movie I didn't know that the African-American civil rights movement was in the 60's, and now I feel very stupid that I didn't. Only musical I've ever liked. Kudos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An honestly beautiful love story told in the strangest of ways...an acquired taste with some downfalls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Across The Universe immediately appealed to me. First of all it looked totally out there...strange and bazaar, unique and unlike anything else. And it was ultimately a musical with the music of one of the greatest groups in history, The Beatles. I am, and always have been an enormous Beatles fan so I thought I had to see this. Now Across The Universe definitely fits the bill for being unique and different and fulfilled everything you might expect from it. It really had some stunning visuals and beautiful choreography and a really decent story to it as well. But the story is perhaps where it stumbles slightly. The film starts out absolutely fantastic, just literally sucks you in with the story of this young man going to America to fulfill his dreams, falls in love, finds a best friend and is living life to the fullest. They use all the best and most well known Beatles' songs and make you sway to the music and really get involved and then after about 45 minutes into the film everything....begins....to....slow....down. The film clocks in at an astounding and very long in the tooth 2 hours and 15 minutes and it's simply not necessary which is unfortunate. Musicals do tend to be longer than most but Across The Universe could have easily cut itself down to an hour and a half give or take. Still the characters redeem the slow pace in the middle and the end makes up for it and during that time you will find yourself mesmerized with the unique style of the film.The very talented Jim Sturgess headlines the cast as free spirited Jude. Sturgess definitely gives us a character that you can really fall into and get involved and feel his emotions. Sturgess makes the film very worthwhile in all it's awkward stages and he is a star!! Evan Rachel Wood is the lovely and outspoken Lucy. She does a really terrific job and has a very pretty voice and a very girl next door look. She also plays the sixties protester very well and her characters goes through a lot of changes. Most importantly her and Sturgess make a dynamic couple and make for a really great love story. Also keep your eye on Joe Anderson who plays free spirited, smart talking Max. He doesn't have as big a role as some of the others but he still is a really great performer and really captures your attention on screen with his unique look. He also got sing one of my favorite songs in the world..."Hey Jude." Supporting cast including Dana Fuchs, Martin Luther, and T.V. Carpio do a really decent job although I would like to say that I believe Carpio's role as Prudence, the closet lesbian that breaks out into spontaneous song was completely forced into the story and had no real purpose at all other than to just be there.There lies part of the problem with Across The Universe. Unlike a truly great musical parts of the film felt really forced, like they had to fight to get certain Beatles songs into the story...such as "I Wanna Hold Your Hand," which was a beautifully done song but pointless to the story. If they realized this and removed some of that overkill (although I love some of the songs they used) they could have made a shorter and more effective and brilliant film. Director Julie Taymor is certainly no new face to directing musicals having already won Tony Awards. Perhaps this musical didn't translate to screen as well as it may have on stage but she made a beautiful love story and the cast really do a terrific job. It's just a little long and definitely way out there which some might really enjoy. Certainly there is nothing wrong with being unique. It was also really cool to see cameos by infamous rockers Bono, and Joe Cocker (I knew that was Cocker as soon as he started to sing.) Across The Universe is definitely something to see to experience something unique and moving and if you love Beatles music then you'll be completely enamored. See it for yourself!! P.S. To the many reviewers and posters who feel it necessary that you have to be on drugs in order to enjoy this, and insist on blathering on about their obvious drug addictions...you're wasting your lives and hurting those around you. Get help.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has buckets full of heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Across the Universe offers a new generation an experience of the vitality and sheer exuberance of the Beatles musical portfolio. Julie Taymor's flawed but ambitious salute to Beatlemania is a celebration of thirty three of the Beatles most famous songs and how they reflected the idealism of the sixties. Utilizing her background in puppetry, folklore, mythology, and mime, Taymor brings imagination and creativity to the table with some silly but mostly wonderful results. The film not only integrates the Beatles songs into a heartfelt love story, it also provides a mirror into the political and social turmoil of the decade.While clips are shown about the fighting and dying in Vietnam, the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, and the racial turmoil in our inner cities, the film primarily offers a heart warming picture of young idealists fighting a corrupt system. You will not find any mention here of drug overdoses, children begging in the street for spare change, or clinics and hospitals clogged with young people carrying sexually transmitted diseases. The songs are the stars and the fact that they are sung by the cast themselves rather than being lip-synched adds immediacy to the experience.Unfortunately Taymor dumbs down the power of the songs to capture our imagination by providing too literal readings, naming the characters Lucy, Prudence, Max, and Jude and tying them to specific plot points. For example, Prudence enters "through the bathroom window" and provides a lesbian reading of the song "I Want to Hold Your Hand". Max has a sequence with a hammer and "Strawberry Fields Forever" becomes a music video in which falling strawberry bombs explode on bleeding strawberry bodies.The story itself is thin but appealing. Jude (Jim Sturgess), a dockworker in Britain is enticed by friend Max Carrigan (Joe Anderson) who has dropped out of college to go with him to New York. Deserted by his American father (Robert Chohessy) prior to his birth, he is eager to meet the father he never saw, now working at Princeton University as a Janitor. Jude and Max move into a Greenwich Village apartment and meet their landlady Sadie (Dana Fuchs), a night club singer who is reminiscent of Janis Joplin, JoJo (Martin Luther McCoy) who plays guitar in the mode of Jimi Hendrix, and Prudence (T.V. Carpio).Cameos are also performed by Bono as a Ken Kesey look alike and Joe Cocker is a street person who sings "Come Together". Soon Jude falls for Max's sister Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) whose boyfriend (Spencer Liff) was killed in Vietnam. While he pursues a career as a graphic artist, her interests lean toward political activism and the values of the two clash on more than one occasion. As Max is drafted and sent to Vietnam, the film touches upon key events of the sixties. One of the most touching is a sequence in Detroit during the racial unrest as a Gospel choir sings the beautiful "Let it Be" to mourn the death of a youngster in the riots. One of the best choreographed sequences takes place at a draft center when figures emerge from an Uncle Sam poster singing "I Want You" and menacing looking masked soldiers process the stripped-down inductees in a military formation.While the film gets most of the history right, there is some confusion in linking the counter-culture street people with the student protests, two distinct elements that were mostly at odds with each other throughout the period. Nonetheless, for fans of The Beatles and for a new generation that is eager to learn about the nature of their appeal, Across the Universe is a moving and at times transcendent ride. Joyous and passionate, the film has buckets full of heart and a vibrant energy that invites us to viscerally experience a time when people believed in something larger than themselves and were willing to put their bodies on the line to support it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film For People With ADD, Who Want To Go On An Acid Trip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Across The Universe is a musical that tells the story of multiple people living in the time of the Vietnam war. A young man travels from Liverpool to find his father, but ends up falling in love with a young American.Stanely Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey was a a technical and artistically remarkable film, but it lacked a story, had a long running time and had very little entertainment qualities about it, which ended up hurting the film. Julie Taymor's Across The Universe runs down the same path, it's visually beautiful and full of life, but the lack of story and long running time does more damage then one would imagine.Across The Universe is many things, but above all it is ambitious. It's a musical set to Beatles songs. In a time when the musical is pretty much dead, Taymor relies on visuals and the popularity of the Beatles to bring in the audience. It's a shame that that is all she relied on because the film is severely lacking many things. What it excels in, it does so beautifully, what it fails at is key to what connects the audience to the film. You can't simply have a character sing a verse of a song and expect people to connect just because it's the Beatles.Across The Universe is for people with ADD and who want to go on an acid trip. The film has no real set course, it jumps from one song to the next and from one bizarre and beautiful image to the next. One minute you're with Bono on a bus, the next you're underwater naked. If you're able to keep up with the bombastic images thrown on the screen then you will really enjoy yourself. Every image that is shown on the screen is ripped straight out of a Beatles song. When you hear Strawberry Fields Forever, you see Strawberry Fields. This could ruin some imagery you might have while listening to those songs.The film changes it's direction, from the journey of this young man, named Jude, to the anti war movement with Lucy. Yup, those are their names, along with Max and Prudence and Sadie. All the character names are taken out of the songs as well. Also, it doesn't take a genius to know that the song Hey Jude would inspire this character to do something. The characters, who all are modeled after icons in the music industry, such as Jimmy Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Kurt Cobain, have very little are no arc. With the exception of the two leads, Lucy and Jude, both acted very well by Evan Rachel Wood and Jim Sturgess, everyone seems to be one noted. Sadie has one conflict in the film, it is never explored, Prudence has lots of conflict, that is never explored. Prudence even disappears half way through the film, only to show up again at a hallucinating sequences.A lot of the images are beautiful and you will without a doubt encompass it all, but there are still some that are too bizarre to connect to the story. One scene we see Asian woman naked, with their bodies painted white who stand on water, then they dive backwards under it. What does this, and many other symbolic elements mean? We are never told and can't sit and think because the next image is thrown at us right after.You will be tapping your toes to the music and singing along as well, if you know the lyrics. There were two or three songs I didn't quite know, but I'm sure the hardcore Beatles fans will know them all. Although, not all the songs are happy dance numbers. Some of them are poorly done, surprisingly I Am The Walrus from Bono is one of them. Jor Cockers take on Come Together is a highlight as well as the army sequences performed to She's So Heavy.Across The Universe is ambitious, beautiful and will have you singing along to the tunes. It's about thirty minutes too long and has very little character development and plot, but the story is there. It's just sung aloud in song and not really performed. If you can get pass a lot of the obvious film images and metaphors, like Prudence coming out of the closet, then Across the Universe is a film for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unoriginal and uneven but dazzlingly beautiful and unique</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Is there anybody going to listen to my story all about the girl who came to stay?" Julie Taymor's ambitious Beatles musical opens with her main character crooning this classic Beatles tune in a sad, melancholy tone longing for his love, quite reminiscent of Ewan McGregor's crooning David Bowie's "Nature Boy" longing for his love. The similarities are hard to miss, and this one song alone effectively sums up my whole opinion on the film, which is a series of parallel conflicts and contradictions that somehow all work in the end.On the one hand, Taymor's movie has many flaws. It is very simplistic and although it deals with large political and universal themes of the time it portrays, it doesn't really bring anything new to the table. We've seen the whole hippy-getting-drafted-to-Vietnam tale in Hair, and we've seen the all-you-need-is-love theme in Moulin Rouge, which Taymor's picture reminded me of greatly. The story at its core is one of utmost simplicity: boy meets girl on the background of 1960's America political upset. The characters themselves are paper thin, each having about one or two identifying characteristics and one very straightforward character arc, and nothing more.But Taymor's work also delivers such immense beauty and brilliance in other fields that the two natures of the film overlap each other. As simple as it is, the epic boy-meets-girl tale outstandingly works on both an entertainment and on an emotional level. Once we reach the film's finale, we do feel for the characters and we are moved by their final gestures of ultimate love, despite their being thin and underdeveloped.But the film's true beauty lies in its visual and musical styles. Visually, the film is an accomplishment of unreachable levels. I haven't the slightest idea where Taymor drew her visual style from, as it is indescribably, remarkably beautiful and utterly original and never been seen before. Her film contains such downright amazing imagery, such as ocean waves clashing juxtaposed with protesting citizens clashing into walls of police forces, an incredible underwater sequence, a New York loft apartment becoming the sky, soldiers carrying the Statue of Liberty through a miniature Vietnam jungle (singing "She's So Heavy" while doing so, no less), and five Salma Hayek army field nurses. The film is, no doubt about it, a sight to behold. But it's not just the sights that make this film such a unique beauty. It's also the sounds.For the Beatles' song adaptations, I truly and honestly salute Taymor and her crew. In this film she has created some absolutely exceptional productions. Naturally, the film's most beautiful, touching, poignant and best scenes are the ones involving the musical numbers. It's not just the songs, it's the entire scenes Taymor crafts around them that don't just feature the song ? they embody the song. And being a die-hard fan of The Beatles' music, it was just these parts featuring their tunes that were the most special for me. There are 33 Beatles numbers throughout the whole film, but a few truly stood out for me. "I Want to Hold Your Hand", which was consummately transformed from an innocent song about young love to a sad, melancholy tune of unrequited love without changing the lyrics whatsoever; "Get By with a Little Help from my Friends", which features the Ivy League gang and Jude ransacking and running wild around Princeton; "I've Just Seen A Face", as Jude sees Lucy for the first time; "I Want You (She's So Heavy)", featuring Max arriving to the drafting office and striking imagery of soldiers trudging through a miniature Vietnam jungle carrying the weight of the Statue of Liberty on their backs; "Strawberry Fields Forever", as Jude spirals down into frustration while bleeding strawberries are pinned to his wall; "Happiness is a Warm Gun", "Hey Jude", "Because", and of course "All You Need is Love" are my favourites.After I first saw the film, I wasn't entirely sure what to think, as my thoughts were so conflicting and contradicting. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it is a lot more complex than just a simple love story. It is in the simplicity that lies the key. The film isn't just a film that draws inspiration from and features The Beatles' songs. It breathes them; the songs literally embody the film. They are one and the same, drawing from one another. Have The Beatles' songs ever featured in-depth and intricate characters, or have they always been about simple, universal, undisputed love, especially their old works? Also, notice how the film begins with their older songs ? "Girl", "I Want To Hold your Hand", "Hold Me Tight", "All My Loving", "I've Just Seen a Face"; in the middle are the psychedelic songs ? "I am the Walrus", "The Benefit of Mr. Kite"; and in the end their later works ? "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", "Hey Jude", "All You Need is Love". The film forms an arc similar to The Beatles' discography, and I don't think it is by chance.Ultimately, with Across the Universe, Julie Taymor creates a piece of film-making that simultaneously draws from many other sources before it such as Hair and Moulin Rouge, but also exists as a totally original and unique piece of art. Although Taymor's characters can be described as rather flat, we still do feel for them and by the film's finale are entirely emotionally engaged with them. The musical adaptations are downright incredible, absolutely beautiful and truly a revelation, and Taymor's cast of unknowns delivers incredibly well. The film doesn't always work. Whenever Taymor trails off and loses focus from her main plot line, the film can become rather tedious; the scenes with Bono and Eddie Izzard are particularly irritating. But on a whole, this is an ambitious, beautiful achievement in the movie musical genre with its ups, downs and contradictions but that ultimately works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the trailer to this film and got really excited but then the film got mixed reviews and I was worried, but this movie is one of the best of 07 and one of the best musicals I have ever seen.If you love the Beatles or the 60's this movie is for you, the story is actually good and the acting is also much better then one would think from such unknown actors but they all do good.I went with 2 other people and one was my father who grew up in that time and the movie made him remember some stuff, and the music works because the Beatles represent that time and period of the world.This film looks good and sounds good, I hate when the Beatles are sung by other people but somehow this film didn't bother me.I also was surprised how I got into the love story of the film, don't let anyone tell you it was disappointing or bad because you need to make that choice yourself.Also do not wait for the DVD, this is a theater experience and if you see it on a DVD you will miss the joy of seeing this on the big screen.Go see this movie, tell others to see it and make sure to just set back and get into everything that is going on and you will have a great time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It really captured our memories of the time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My partner and I went to see Across the Universe without knowing very much about it. We both liked it very much and agreed that it really captured our memories of the time. I liked it so much that later that night I went on line to download some images from the film in order to print up a little 'promo' for the bulletin board in my shop which has a younger client?le. I was totally taken aback when I began to come across an incredible amount of very negative reaction to the film. The Ann Hornaday review in the Washington Post was one of the nastiest pieces I have ever read in a mainstream paper. Looking again at her review the next morning it seemed to me that it said more about the writer than about the film itself. And today, looking at some of the external reviews linked here on the IMDb this question comes to mind: Why has a movie so often dismissed as vapid, dull, and kitschy generated such an outpouring of venomous bile?One theme seems to be that the film appeals to 'know-nothing' kids and 'nostalgic, aging boomers'. I might suggest (though I certainly can't prove) that the crowd that rejected all that 'Sixties nonsense' and brought themselves back down to earth to deal with practical matters are precisely the people who reject this movie. (You might check out the Ella Taylor review in the Village Voice which is linked in external reviews on the left-hand side of this page.) I think they hate it because the characters aren't properly punished at the end for all their idealism and they hate it because it makes them uncomfortable to see what they themselves have chosen to leave behind. After all, George W. Bush could be a character in this film. He could have been any one of the Max's friends at Princeton, or even Max himself had Max 'sensibly' chosen to stay in school and pursue a career in politics. This country has 'sensibly' chosen to follow such a man who still seems to be driving golf balls off the roof without a thought to where they might land. But to use a roof for a free concert? Free for God's sake!! That would be unprofitable, illegal and so very naive!To put it bluntly, this film 'sends the wrong message'. These days it makes many people feel uncomfortable to suggest, even for a moment, that perhaps Governor Moonbeam was more of a pragmatist than the Great Communicator. But look at a graph that charts the rise of the national debt. Was trickle down (voodoo) economics actually a 'realistic' policy? We're still dragging that huge bronze Statue of Liberty across foreign landscapes. Isn't that at least as unrealistic as "All you need is love..."? And Lucy's mother pleads that she just wants her daughter to be safe... such a post 9/11 thing to say... but isn't that at the price of her son's life at risk in Vietnam. The plot of this film is only vapid, dull and kitschy if you choose to block out anything meaningful it has to say.OK... so my partner and I are both about 60 and we met on a rooftop on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in 1967 (and we're both guys). My shop 'promo' read: "To get a notion of how I remember the Sixties see: Across the Universe". We both loved this movie and urge you to see it too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take me Across the Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine if you will Moulin Rouge meeting the Beatles. This is the best way to describe the effect of this movie. Acoss the Universe is a movie written totally around Beatle's song lyrics. That in itself was a hard feat, but to make the songs tell a complete story was another challenge.The movie was genius in so many ways. I initially didn't expect to like the movie very much because the previews seem a bit odd. Then we had such a hard time trying to find the movie, because it didn't release nationwide until a few weeks later, then I finally got to see it.The music clearly drives the movie. Don't worry, if you are not a hard core beatles fan, which I am not, you will still love the music. I was really impressed with the new arrangement of some of the songs. The cast was absolutely amazing. Their voices were so impressive. This is a good movie. But what I have discovered from my students and my friends is that you are going to love it or hate it...not many people in the middle. I wonder where you are going to be?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A feast for Beatles fans and maybe also for those who aren't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of Julie Taymor (I hated Titus) so I was a bit leery about going to see this movie. Still, as a Beatles fan, I decided I should see it on the big screen. I went with my 19-year-old son, and we both enjoyed it very much. The film is a visual and auditory feast--sort of like a long music video--yet connected by a linear plot and sub-plots. For those of us who came of age during the 'Nam era, this brought back some vivid memories. But it's the music--a continuous parade of Beatles hits--that is the real treat. Somehow the plot, the (sometimes surrealistic) imagery and the music blend together for a sensual tour de force. Don't miss this movie while it's still playing in theaters; it just won't be the same on a small screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic feast!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the urging of a friend we went to see this movie today. Now, I am an old guy that grew up when the Beatles were at their peak. So...being familiar with the music was a plus in this movie. However....from the very start the beauty of the cinematography just jumped out on the screen to us. It wasn't setting me on fire to begin with but then, something happened and I was just sucked right into the big screen. At the heart, this is just a very good love story. All of the characters are likable. It is interesting reading the comments of those in the younger age group not "getting" this movie and I do understand that. However...me thinks that it was made for those of us that still yearn for those years that were both innocent yet turbulent with the riots for equal rights and the protests of the Viet Nam war. I got teary eyed more than once in this masterpiece of movie making. It is sad that it is not a box office hit and even sadder that the trailers for it on the TV are so bad. All you need to do is see this movie and the rest will be history. It is also nice to see a movie that is not jammed with today's "stars." A lot of these actors are not mainstream but man oh man are they a talented lot. It is a magical mystery tour of movie making. Sit back and enjoy the ride America. SEE THIS MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. I have shied away from this movie for weeks presuming I would be disappointed. What a wonderful experience director Julie Taymor ("Frida") has created ... regardless if one is a Beatles fan or not. The music and visuals and stories are extraordinary and her vision comes through in that the parts create a whole.Jim Sturgess stars as Jude, a dock worker from Liverpool who sneaks into the U.S. and stumbles into Max (played energetically by Joe Anderson). As one might imagine, there is a scene where Max(well) is utilizing a silver hammer. There are so many small details and tributes throughout that I can't wait for the DVD to tell me what all I missed. Terrific, as always, is Evan Rachel Wood as Lucy. This amazing actress just turned 20 years old and is assembling a remarkable resume. Her talent is exceptional and was on full display in "Thirteen" and has grown as she has matured. She has the ability to look angelic and soulfully wounded in the same film. This young lady will be fun to watch as her career continues. While Sturgess and Anderson are passable in their singing, Ms. Wood's singing here is top notch, especially "If I Fell".Also strong is Dana Fuchs as Sadie, a Janis Joplin like singer whose throaty voice and bourbon swilling are a hoot! Capping the support group are Martin Luther McCoy as JoJo (Hendrix tribute), Joe Cocker in a couple of roles recreating his "Get by with a little help from my friends", Salma Hayak as multiple singing nurses, Eddie Izzard as Mr. Kite and a hilarious Bono (yes THAT Bono) as Dr. Robert in a tribute to Ken Kesey and the electric Kool-Aid.There are too many cool moments to recap here and the film plays like unwrapping mounds of presents at Christmas. It offers a bit of "Moulin Rouge", "Jesus Christ Superstar" and "Tommy", while staying true to the music and the unique vision of Ms. Taymor. There are numerous real life moments recognized in the anti-war stories. I loved the rooftop concert (as in the Beatles final public appearance) and mostly enjoyed the shots inside The Cavern Club in Liverpool where The Quarrymen got their start. Good stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, but lack of Britain and what did this have to do with the Beatles?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Across the Universe - Julie Taymor's homage to the 60s and 70s. I'd call it an homage to the Beatles, but aside from using 33 of their songs (and referring to a few more) and eye-roll-inducingly calling the two main characters Jude (Jim Sturgess) and Lucy (Evan Rachael Wood), this movie has no real tie to John, George, Paul or Ringo. Nor, aside from Jude and Mr. Kite (played by the lovable Eddie Izzard), who I'm pretty sure was a hallucination (or was it? It looked so real), is most of the cast British.What shots there are of Britain (at the beginning and end of the film) show a stuffy factory-working bunch of elderly old men. Yeah, it's not like anything happened in Britain during the 60s and 70s anyway, right? Unless you count, um....THE BEATLES! I guess they were all so downtrodden cause we stole their Beatles.I love music and singing. I like Beatles music. I also liked most of the arrangements in the movie. Quite a few caused that goosepimples reaction. I also liked most of the singers. Evan Rachel Wood, Jim Sturgess, Joe Anderson, and Martin Luther were quite good. Didn't really care for Dada Fuchs as an actress or singer, and I found it kind of funny that SHE was the one to go on as a professional singer in the movie. My favorite has to be Joe Anderson. He had the most charisma, and was also the best written part. I wish that more of the songs weren't pre-recorded (There is a noticeable difference in sound) but I'm happy that the singers did their own singing.There is undeniable power in these tunes, if you're into musicals or just plain Beatles music. I am. Notable entries were "Hey Jude" "Come Together" ""Strawberry Fields Forever" "I Am The Walrus" (How ridiculous was it for Limey-disliking Americans to say words like knickers and "English Garden and English Rain). Notably weird and therefore personal favorite entires were "I Want You" and "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite". "Twist and Shout" was surprisingly absent, as well as most of the more shallow-pop Beatles songs. I guess Ferris Bueller cornered the market on that one. I was disappointed as I expecting a scene where Jude drunkenly types out one of the more innocuous Beatles songs like "Love Me Do" or "P.S. I Love You" in a letter to Lucy.Unfortunately, if the 33 Beatles songs were the films strong point, they were also it's weakness. Sometimes they had little to do with what was actually going on in the movie (or if they did, it was in a very roundabout way) and sometimes I had little clue as to what was going on. The script was kinda "helter skelter" and thinly tied in with the songs. These are elementary musical mistakes. If you're at the point where you want to get through the dialogue to get to the next song, the musical's in trouble. The music should assist the story, not override it. And this is a paper-thin story. The songs don't reveal or mention much about the characters themselves, aside from the obvious "Hey Jude", and "Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds" doesn't play til the credits roll. What was the point of naming her that then? Events are mentioned that mean little though are meant to mean more. People break up and re-unite for reasons not explained to the audience.This was an ambitious movie, and it suceeded and failed in various places. Loved the singing. Wasn't so crazy about the thin characterization and story. A mix, but mostly enjoyable, Across the Universe gets a B.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since I first saw a preview for this film, I've been anticipating it like a kid anticipates Christmas. I finally saw it last night and, apart from a few flaws, it was one of the best movies I've seen.Now it must be said that there were a few transitional mix-ups. This particular film didn't play around with the messy parts during transitioning periods in the storyline such as when Jude and Lucy fell in love or between when they were stranded and when they got back to New York. In my view, I think the music took care of the transition and did an excellent job.The color, the music, the story... this was all an acid trip and a work of art simultaneously. Having taken a few art classes and film classes, I was stunned by the use of color and the way the story was set up. I loved it. I can't say enough about it. Everyone who ever had interest in the sixties or love and peace should see this movie at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apparently filmed using a kaleidoscope...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Julie Taymor's new movie has been getting somewhat middling reviews (on the high end, the all-father of critics, Roger Ebert, gave it four stars and said it was the only movie at the Festival that he saw twice), and I can see both sides of the coin, although I ended up enjoying it quite a bit.The film is a musical set in the 1960s, following various characters through the various signature features of the era (student activism/militancy, anti-war protests, the civil rights movement, the draft/Vietnam, the sexual revolution, drug culture), all set to over thirty Beatles songs. Pretty much all the characters are named after characters in said songs: Jude, Lucy, Max, Prudence, Sadie, etc. Jude (Jim Sturgess) is a Liverpool dockworker who decides to go to America sort of on a whim, and ends up meeting Max (Joe Anderson), and then Max's family, including his sister Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood). Jude falls in love with Lucy ("She's got a boyfriend." "That's alright. I've got a girlfriend."), and eventually everyone ends up living in New York, in a single apartment populated by a bunch of other characters, including an Asian lesbian runaway named Prudence and two singers modeled on Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. The plot isn't particularly important (one of the main criticisms of the film in reviews). The movie is all about the songs.On the subject of the music, a lot of the really big Beatles tunes are absent here, and even having a character named after one doesn't necessarily mean it gets in (Maxwell does wield a hammer at one point, but the song itself is absent). I had never heard of a lot of them (my knowledge of the Beatles isn't particularly deep). Everybody can sing quite well, and Sturgess and Wood have good romantic chemistry. Since this is a Taymor film, the visuals tend towards the quite extravagant, often going to full-blown music video rather than musical in the traditional sense ("Strawberry Fields Forever" particularly). One thing that I really liked was that Across the Universe is quite unequivocally a musical where people burst into song; one of the problems I had with Dreamgirls was that for a long time it was ambiguous about whether or not the characters were just singing the songs on stage or were actually in a musical, so that it was jarring when the film started to have characters singing conversationally.And this movie has Bono show up as a hippie guru singing "I Am The Walrus", which sequence appears to have been filmed using a kaleidoscope; and not one, not two, but five Salma Hayeks as sexy nurses at a VA hospital.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Across the Universe had a bad hair day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was pretty good, but the hair almost ruined it for me. Men didn't wear their hair like that in the 1960s! They pretty much either had crew cuts or Beatle hair slicked down with bangs...not preppy, pretty-boy feathered, layered, and styled hair like Max and Jude wore! The women didn't wear red lipstick either. White was trendy for a time, and light pink, but not red like the main actress who played Lucy. The film makers needed to do some research on the hairstyles of the day and make sure they were accurate. I know, I know, the movie is supposed to be timeless, just like the Beatles songs, but it WAS supposed to be set in the actual time period that the songs were popular. I didn't mind the episodic, MTV-styled music video format too much. The singing was fantastic and the Beatles tunes were rendered with much emotion. Pretty good job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can i just say Wow This movie was all around fantastic. I loved it, Jim Sturgess did a fantastic job as Jude his musical performance was off the charts this boy is rising to the top and fast. When i first heard of this movie i was a little skeptical about it mostly because of the remake of these legendary Beatles Songs. When i first started to get into the movie and Jim Sturgess started to sing one of my favorite Beatles songs 'all my loving' i was like my god this movie is going to be off the charts. It was, it was off the charts, it was mind blowing. The songs they picked to represent the things going on through the movie were perfect like 'Strawberry Fields', when Jude was putting up all those strawberries showing nothing was real around him and he felt that he did not have purpose and he did not really know himself at that point in time. Over all this was a fantastic movie and i would say Jim Sturgess is one of favorite actors now so right on."All You Need Is Love"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like Beatles' music and have fond memories of the sixties - do NOT miss this movie. It's one of the most creative and entertaining films I've seen all year. Beautifully done, it was a treat for the eyes and ears. The right casting is really what made this film special. The characters were well developed, and the acting excellent. After seeing this movie I have even a greater appreciation for the mass of lyrics created by The Beatles. Though this movie is over 2 hours of total bliss, one leaves thinking about how many more lyrics could have been used from the endless supply of Beatles'songs. I was particularly impressed with the smooth transitions between scenes and the easy flow of unfolding the turbulence of the sixties. Expect to be humming Beatle's tunes for a few days after you see this one. Loved it - want to see it again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone's entitled to their opinion, but I loved this flick. Julie Taymor is a genius, and the visuals alone were spectacular and imaginative. The songs were (for the most part) used brilliantly. "Let It Be", "Strawberry Fields Forever", and "Happiness is a Warm Gun" were absolutely riveting (I was blown away by "Happiness"--she actually fit in that bizarre song so it all made sense in the plot.) Sure some of the songs were repurposed ("If I Fell" sung by a girl), but they worked. Some of the symbolism was too obvious ("Dear Prudence"), but it still worked for me. The performances were also generally first rate, especially the three leads. I rate this a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Across the Universe is a testament to the greatest band of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Across the Universe," is one of those rare films that captures the turmoil of a generation, personifies it with music, and then moves us with a heartwarming love story. Not since "Forrest Gump," has a film authenticated the cultural and personal upheaval that was the 60s, and what better musical score to epitomize it, then the Fab Four from Liverpool, England.The film circles around, Jude who is a shipbuilder from Liverpool, England who meets college drop out Max in Princeton, New Jersey. Max invites Jude to Thanksgiving dinner at his family's stuffy, conservative home in suburbia. There Jude meets Max's sister Lucy where they decide to go to New York to escape their conformed lifestyles.Julie Taymor, who directed the play "The Lion King," is a master choreographer, who accomplishes a surprising feet in almost telling this entire story through the music of the Beatles. The musical scenes coincide with the character's personal narratives and also the cultural, social, and political overtones of the decade as Taymor brilliantly crafts "The Beatles," music into a perfect incantation of the generation's feeling and attitude.The film's 33 Musical numbers first lends its focus on the developing romance of Jude and Lucy. Lucy's boyfriend is killed in Vietnam which prompts her to rely on Jude for comfort as she is deeply conflicted with her feelings for him. In one of the most emotionally captivating performances by the young singer, she sings "If I Fell," as she watches Jude from a distance at a party. The song fleshes out her apprehension and conflicted heart so perfectly you'd think that John Lennon wrote it specifically for a similar situation.There is an apparent revival to many of "The Beatles," more obscure songs in "Across the Universe," as Taymor's interpretations prompt the listener to connect with them in a more profound way then the original. In one of the film's subplots we see a girl, named ironically Prudence somberly singing, "I Want to Hold Your Hand." Later in the film she meets the film's central characters, but she is a troubled lesbian as she longingly gazes at a girl, wanting to hold her hand. The upbeat tempo of "The Beatles," version is suddenly transformed into a song of longing and emotional heartache for a love that will never be realized.As the film's characters immerse themselves deeper and deeper into the 60s influences, the choreography of the film becomes more intense, creative, and elaborate. Bono lends his voice and appreciation for the Beatles as he plays a psychedelic hippy who performs "I am the Walrus," and takes the films characters and audience on one of the film's trippiest numbers as we go on a "magical mystery tour." The psychedelic musical numbers call to mind Pink Floyd's "The Wall," but thankfully "Across the Universe," evokes its abstract scenes subtly and with a sense of organization and purpose.Jim Sturgess is impressive as Jude, as he carries himself with vulnerability and pose during a generation of many baffling cultural changes. Evan Rachel Wood is angelic as Lucy, as I and countless other males in the theater fell in love with her soft gentle voice. Both stars I believe could carry themselves on Broadway as they move through countless scene changes and sophisticated choreography.The film's central conflict centers around Lucy's involvement with a peace movement. Jude is against the political convention and fears for Lucy's safety, but she contests, and their relationship falters because of it. I won't unveil too much, but this aspect of the story felt a bit underdeveloped. This musical is not as emotionally prolific through its songs as Baz Luhrmann's "Moulin Rouge," but that film in my mind is a masterpiece, "Universe," falls short. Sometimes in this particular musical, the song numbers seem forced or awkward in the midst of the film's story, as we see Eddie Izzard perform as Mr. Kite in an insane carnival piece to the song, "Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite." Although beautifully conceived, the song has no tangible reasoning in the film's plot line.The director may have crammed too many musical numbers into the film, but we'll let it slide. Despite the film's strained middle, its beginning and end move eloquently as a touching musical passageway of story almost as good as any Beatle album. "Across the Universe," is a delightfully sweeping testament to the greatest band that will ever be, and shouldn't be missed if you are an avid fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My first introduction to this movie was when I went to see the film 'Stardust' in theaters. I saw the theatrical trailer and was deeply moved by both the music and the sequences between the characters. My first thought: I have to go see this! And so I did.I have to admit, I've never been big into Beatles music. They were before my time, but I have always heard the odd song here and there on the radio and my Dad's attempts at recreating some of their most famous works (but don't tell him I said that!). Still, there were a few songs I recognized right off the bat, such as "I Want To Hold Your Hand", "All You Need Is Love", and "Let It Be". The rest were also truly amazing. I was very pleased that there were such good singers in the movie to bring the songs to life.I really like the idea behind it all, too. It must have taken the movie makers a long time to figure out how exactly to fit a lot of the Beatles' songs into a worthwhile plot. I'm impressed at how well they did just that. Even without the music, the movie would still be good, it just wouldn't hold the same depth it did.I loved the film's more abstract sequences - I thought they added to it in a great way, especially the "I Am The Walrus" and "Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite" parts. "Strawberry Fields Forever" was by far the best part, if not the very best song.I really liked "Revolution"; in fact, it's my favorite song, right before "I Want To Hold Your Hand" (the adaptation was remarkable; the simplicity of the singer had a good effect), "Blackbird" (I had never heard this song before, but it is very good), and all the rest of the soundtrack for that matter! The soundtrack was so great that I got home from the theaters and bought it right away! I couldn't wait to hear all the music again. Now I listen to it all the time.All in all, two thumbs up! It was a win-win situation; I got to see an incredible movie, my dad got the exhilaration of hearing his teenage daughter is becoming interested in the Beatles, and the theater got ten dollars.Go see this movie! You won't regret it.</fullReview>

She has presented the Beatles music in such an original way. the use of the colorful photography (often used in Beatle posters and 60's era magazines) was so lovely visually in the moving images on the screen. The credits at the end were fabulous and the puppetry through the film as great as well. The masks on the soldiers was very symbolic. I especially liked the Eddie Izzard sequence. He was perfect for that part. All of the dancers, the makeup crew, the costumers, the puppet builders did a fantastic job. What a creative endeavor.

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie About My Generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a little worried about this movie. I thought, with the premise of using Beatles songs and dance numbers to tell a story, it's going to be either incredibly good or incredibly awful. And I thought it would take a genius to make it incredibly good.It's incredibly good. If I were a history teacher at an unbelievably liberal school, I'd use this movie to try to explain what it was like in the 60's and early 70's. I was there, and there are things I remember all through this movie. The musical numbers and dance are the most important factor in the movie, of course, but they are supported by a plot with characters who are genuinely authentic and story lines that catch the best and the worst of the times.People who were there will love this movie, and younger people may come away with a better understanding of what made some of us who we are and (MILD SPOILER) the realization that indeed, sometimes, all you need is love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let Us Take Beatles Songs and Pretend We Have a Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a Beatles fan, I was excited about this movie. I was expecting an over the top musical, talented performers and songs that I grew up with aiding in an interesting story. But this movie was AWFUL and there is no way around that. Although I was not a fan of the "A Story Line" (Jude and Lucy's love affair), it was the useless and random "B Story Lines" that made me hate this film even more. *B STORY FLOPS* PRUDENCE is introduced at the beginning of the film, a lesbian longing for a fellow cheerleader. Later in the film, she turns up as one of the many residents in the NYC flat. How did she get here? Well, since there is no Beatles song about that, let's pretend it doesn't matter. After falling for the landlord, who is already involved with JoJo, her character disappears and reappears, with no problems, with a girlfriend. Explain to me why a character was introduced with a real problem, who the audience could feel sympathy for, and then without any reasons as to how or why, everything is all better for her. We have no idea how she turned up where she did, or how she overcame her initial fears of being a lesbian.SADIE AND JOJO have a steamy relationship from the beginning, but Sadie gets a chance to be a great singer, if she leaves her old band (including JoJo, behind). Sadie ends up hating her new situation, stating that the new band has no soul. JoJo is depressed and lonely, and leaves towards the end of the movie stating he's not going to find Sadie in a bottle. Magically, at the end of the movie, Sadie and JoJo are back together, and everything is fine. Once again, there is no need to discuss how this occurred, because the audience obviously doesn't care about a real story, only an ending. MAXWELL and his lack of a silver hammer represent the many who were against the war but forced into a draft. This humorous (but I assume not trying to be) representation of being drafted, including Uncle Sam posters singing "I Want You," was perhaps the only good scene in the entire film. It was so bad, it was hysterical. The scene in which injured men are lying in hospital beds and POP up to join in the sing along with Max, terrifyingly reminds me of a childhood game called "Don't Wake Daddy," in which children pressed on an alarm clock until "daddy' SPRANG out of bed. If you are unaware of this game, I recommend checking it out and the re-watching this one scene. It serves as a good laugh. I've been told by one of my peers that this movie should have won Best Motion Picture at the Academy Awards, because it is a movie everyone NEEDS to see. When I stated, but it had an average plot, awful "B Story Lines," and fixed all problems in an instant, she agreed. So my question is, how can this movie be a popular MOVIE when there was a terrible plot and awful characters. Yes, some of the actors can sing, which makes it a good Tribute Concert at best, not a movie.</fullReview>

John and Paul made this song for lesbians? Or this is again a stupid American bulls**t about tolerance? The "Director" made lesbian tragedy two times. The 2nd is "I Want you". This is awful. The amazing Beatles song "Because" was ruined by the 6 middling voices who sings out off the tune. I understood that Jude is "Paul" and Max is "John". It is simple be coz they both look like them. But how come Max goes in Vietnam, takes the gun and yells "Die you all..."? Is this really about what John sang in his songs? Bono... Oh Dear Bono. What the hell are you doin'? Awful version of "I'm the Walrus" attacked my ears. And i'm not talking about screenplay now. Its awful too. Artificial Story. 1/10. John, George... I'm sorry for this women.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie was horrible. i erupted in laughter at the scene where this dude goes to enlist in the army and ends up in a weird dance scene with army officials and is then transported to Vietnam where he finds himself under the burden of lady liberty (literally). way to make a joke out of a truly turbulent time...real artistic, guys.perhaps its because i don't like musicals. perhaps its because as a beatles fan, i was offended by certain interpretations of the songs...this was an insult. its another fluffy, overly-sentimental, vague glorification of the sixties. i couldn't identify with the flat, upper-class characters, and certainly couldn't identify with another cliché appearance of Hollywood's flower children-- sniveling morons unfairly painted as ignorant, space cadet kids. true, many who engaged in certain recreations of that time were only in it for the wrong reasons, but some participated in the scene to obtain some sort of self-knowledge and worldliness...(which this movie fails to do justice to)see it if you don't really give a crap about the beatles and love nauseating movies like grease. otherwise, put on sgt. pepper or the white album and close your eyes. thats all the entertainment and sentimentality you will need for a night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A jumbled, disorganized mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film doesn't work on so many levels, I don't know where to begin. It feels like the filmmakers came up with their favorite songs from the era to use in a movie. The problem is, they weren't able to tie them together in a lucid, linear, narrative way. The story is so superficial as to be distractingly awkward. I can't help but think of the play/movie "Mamma Mia" which had only the hit songs of ABBA to put together into an interesting narrative which succeeded in the attempt. This film had countless songs to choose from and they seem utterly unrelated even with boring, pointless filler dialogue which should be binding them together. A bad movie with good music is still a bad movie...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so excited when I heard about this film. I'm a massive Beatles fan and thought it was going to be amazing! To be honest I found it almost unbearable, the tedious links to Beatles songs which were then played out in a full on Americanized way. The fact they put links to Liverpool in but couldn't quite bring themselves to set it there. He's called 'Jude' (can you see which song they're going to end up playing out for him?!), his mothers Martha (hmmmm), There's a Lucy, Sadie and Jojo. Its all a matter of time. Its cheesy, its tacky, but not in a good way. And other than the fact that they play the entire Beatles back catalogue, it doesn't have an awful lot to do with them. Couldn't quite face watching it to the end, it hurt. If you want Beatles watch Help or A Hard Days Night, even Backbeat or that Australian one where a group of fans get trapped under the stage!(Secrets??) Not this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow Motion Does Not Make Things Meaingful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a complete disappointment. It used some of the best Beatles songs and had interesting scenes but overall the story was weak and unconvincing. The worst part would have to be Evan Rachel Wood's one and only acting face which is 'the world is falling apart around me and I'm so unfortunate and helpless'. Letting her sing blackbird was a travesty. Slow motion was also severely over-used in trying to establish some sort of emotion in the most banal circumstances. Being carried away by police during a peaceful protest doesn't mean the end of all existence so there was no reason for the over-dramatic hand reaching. The film might have been better if it wasn't trying so hard but I never want to hear their version of any of those songs again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Flavor of the 60's to others, but it was music without plot to me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that the reason many people love this movie is because it is cinematically breath-taking, musically thrilling and it gives a generalized taste of the 60's. If you want it to be about character, about war, about love... you won't really find the movie answers satisfactorily. Each scene pops from one reference to 60's culture to the next and while the movie makes a couple brave statements, in particular the war, it is only reminiscent of the time (past and present) not the plot. PERSONAL REVIEW TO FOLLOWI enjoy The Beatles. I was eager to watch this movie, but did not get a chance to see it in theatres. I was not a "lucky one" who saw it on opening night amidst a large crowd of people just as excited. I watched this movie with a small group of friends which consisted of military brats, music aficionados and conservatives. Needless to say, the overall tenor of the group was not one of awe and love as the movie progressed. My personal outlook of the movie had to be developed after seeing it in it's entirety. After analyzing the music, the cinematography, the acting and the plot, I have to say that I did not enjoy the movie. I won't go as far as to say it was a waste of time, because the reasons why I disliked it make me think critically.The music was enjoyable; I will not mind owning a copy of the soundtrack CD. My only pet peeve was the cover of "Let It Be" which is one of my favorite Beatles songs. I realize that it was not that the gospel music was bad it's just that for this song I am a purist. There were times that I felt the music forced the plot in some direction and had little motivation, however this will be discussed with my problems in the plot.The cinematography was interesting and beautiful. I enjoyed the choreography and the part with Dr. Roberts(?) was mind-blowing. The scene "For the Benefit of Mr. Kite" was weird like much of Moulin Rouge, but I am not really a fan of that type of manic scene.The acting was, to be blunt, wooden. I did not realize how much so until I watch "Serenity" and saw the actress playing River Tam convey dialogue in just expression and the tilt of her head. I think this may have been the fault of the plot and not the actors themselves. Perhaps though the cinematography was the problem because it concentrated so much on the effects and not on the actors applying their craft, or it could be the music, which has so much meaning that the director didn't feel the need to concentrate on what the characters were feeling as they were singing.Most of my distaste for the movie comes from the plot, or lack thereof. There was a story, an ending moral and themes throughout, but none of these were enough to keep me interested in what was going on. The music was the only thread of connection in the movie, not the plot. I did not care about Jude and Lucy's relationship. (In fact, I cared for about Sadie and JoJo than the 'main' characters.) And given the end of the story the director really wanted you to care and realize that 'All You Need is Love". Yet that theme was never really introduced fully until the end. The themes of fighting, radicalism, oppression, and chaos were stressed, but not love. Love was taken for granted in this movie by every character except Prudence and she disappeared and reappeared throughout the story. Prudence as a character was never explored, then again none of the characters were, but in her case it was particularly painful. She struggled with something (the word 'lesbian' is never explicitly mentioned, but it is understood by the audience) until she leaves the apartment for good and then she is magically well-adjusted. For someone who sang "I Want to Hold Your Hand", a portion of "I Want You (She's So Heavy)" and had a song ("Dear Prudence") sung to her, she was an enigma as a character. The scene "Strawberry Fields Forever" was forced. The strawberry comes into play later with Jude's painting, but the song itself is crammed into the movie for no express purpose. The theme of war and fighting against it were... odd. I can understand the sentiment of the feelings, but the entire build-up of Lucy's affair with the protest was negated when she saw her boss building bombs. It confused me as to what the message of this theme was supposed to be, unless it was to 'give up because both sides use violence'. Afterwards the entire subject is completely dropped. The scene of "Let It Be" was also one that confused and aggravated me. There were parallels drawn between the death of Lucy's first boyfriend and the young black boy, but the civil rights movement was never brought up again until it is mentioned that Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. In essence, the characters were not explored, the scenes were rushed into songs and the important themes of the movie were foggy and confused.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An inventive visual treat from start to finish, this clever film is a great introduction for 20 somethings and teens who are not aware of the Beatles music or of the turbulent 60s and what it all meant. Wrapping 2 dozen Beatles standards in constantly amazing set pieces, I personally found ACROSS THE UNIVERSE a very satisfying experience. I kept thinking "Kids would just love this" especially if they have not been weaned on good musicals, the political past, the wildness of the late 60s and especially if they unfortunately think modern entertainment is all killing and destruction. As a time-capsule, UNIVERSE delivers, and I would strongly suspect a DVD gift would make a greatly effective intro to witty visuals and extraordinary and emotional songs for any younger person. I am very impressed with the imagination that has been carefully developed in each sequence and genuinely enthusiastically encourage an older generation to share this film with the younger. UNIVERSE is genuine cinema visual art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Across the universe and back in time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously, a film such as Julie Taymor's Across the Universe isn't going to please everyone. Some may discount it, as I nearly did, because they've seen previously released and dismally fashioned limited or entirely non-verbal "rock" musicals. Two that come to mind are Tommy, which was a total disaster, and The Wall, which badly needed at least minimal dialog. However, I put away my preconceived notions based on word of mouth and found the themes, characters, settings and music in Taymor's film to be entirely believable and thoroughly engaging. There is truth in the story and characters that transported me to a parallel universe, one that existed for me nearly 40 years ago when I lived in NYC and volunteered with the National Peace Action Coalition for a time. The place, the time, the marches and the protests against the war in Viet Nam are excellently conveyed to the screen. Similarly, the music resonates with meaning and feeling; and the music too reminded me of an essential aspect of my youth. Yes, I cut school along with some of my 9th grade friends to welcome the Beatles when they landed in Queens a few short months after the death of President Kennedy; yes, I saw them twice at Shea; and yes, I grew my hair longer, wore boots, and sported a suede jacket like the one the fab four sport on the cover of Rubber Soul, while I walked the halls of high school with a copy of Sgt. Pepper under my arm four years later as my classmates got ready to graduate. As with so many of that generation, the Beatles' music is the soundtrack I hear when memories of youth come flooding back. Conseqently, Taymor was treading on somewhat sacred ground by having the music come from other mouths. But she ascended almost immediately. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the film, as did my son. Even the music, which I thought I knew from every angle and nuance, gained new meaning for me at times. One slight example, Evan Rachel Wood's If I Fell. Though I can't say I enjoyed every single minute, I was transfixed by Taymor's characters, themes, and images, as well as by the Beatles' lyrics for damn near the entire running time. So was my 21 year old son, Julian when we took in a recent late morning matinée. The timing was our good fortune because we had a private screening in a multiplex theater that was empty except for the two of us. In short, Across the Universe is a film experience that will engage anyone who gives it the opportunity on many levels. As we said back in the day, be prepared to be blown away. PTMR</fullReview>

The way the story line was generated and the way it presented itself in the time-line it did was truly masterfully done. I was thru those times and every song I know by heart and mentally sang along too. The character building was totally believable, and the way they did both sides of the pond in the beginning was not as confusing as it appears to be. I truly shows we are the same no matter where we are or from. Jude, has a great voice, Lucy perfect and dead on, Max was great too but, Sade and Jo-Jo were awesome and I cannot wait to get the soundtrack. I LOVE the BEATLES and this was a GREAT way to turn people on to how complex and beautiful their (Lennon/McCartney) music really was.

		<shortDescription>All you need is - Across the Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am an unabashed unashamed Beatles fan and have been since the early 60's. I am so wrapped in the Beatles that I hate it when other artists sing their songs (sacrilege) - until now! I went to see Across the Universe after seeing the preview. My expectations were more inquisitive than high.After the first 10 seconds I was totally wrapped in this movie. The actors come singers were sensational. I particularly liked the way 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' was turned into a lament and 'Strawberry Fields Forever' became an anti-war song. Completely new meanings to well known songs.These and other songs in the movie were incredible re-inventions of the songs I have known and loved for most of my life. I didn't think it would be possible to impress me in this way. Another stand out song is 'I Want You', changed from the original love song to 'Uncle Sam wants you' but ending up as a love song again.I laughed out loud several times (when no one else in the cinema did) when I noticed movie events were reflecting actual Beatles movies or events. A good example was when Prudence was hiding in her room. Her character is named after Mia Farrows sister Prudence, who, when they were with the Beatles in India, hid in a room and wouldn't come out. This resulted in the writing of the song 'Dear Prudence' In the movie the song 'Dear Prudence' was sung to entice her from the room.I got thinking later that, well, the Beatles have gone but their songs are still there. We can only listen to the Beatles themselves in so many ways (the last I heard was the too tricky Cirque de Soleil show 'Love'. To me this was a total failure, but that's another story). Surely then, it is now time to let these songs be re-invented. If done in such a fantastic way as with this movie then there are still further chapters to be written in the Beatles amazing story.This review purposely avoids reviewing the actual movie but discusses the songs. The reader should read some of the earlier reviews for comment on the movie itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let It Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certain films are bound to be hyped to the point of unreasonably high expectations, and Across the Universe proves a perfect example. Right from its conception, the film boasted immense promise - the notion of a musical populated entirely by songs by The Beatles and the astonishing psychedelic visual effects demonstrated in early trailers promised an impressive feat indeed. And while Across the Universe may not prove to be a life altering experience, it is an unquestionably innovative and visually stunning take on the musical genre, and a comprehensive enough overview of sixties teen culture, well complimented by the Beatles soundtrack.One's enjoyment of Across the Universe may vary based on what one's expectations for the film are. The majority of complaints regarding the film have been in regards to the allegedly shallow and feeble plot. While it is true that the storyline is not the most monument in recent memory, as is the case for many musicals, the story is structured primarily to drive the film from one musical number to the next, and as such, it is a rousing success. Initially presented as a more conventional teen romance (complimented well by The Beatles' earlier cheery love ballads) the film's tranquility doesn't last for long before it is plunged into some of the darkest themes of the sixties: the Vietnam war, political rebellion, protests, riots, teen alienation and experimentation with drugs, fitting well with much of the Beatles' later and bleaker works. Despite the subject matter presented toeing being fairly familiar for those with any knowledge of the decade, the script mirrors the content and changing tone of the Beatles songs admirably, and the outcome is an overall positive one, even if the emotional tension does fall flat on occasion. And while not always integrated as seamlessly into the plot as one might hope for, the musical interludes themselves are simply flooring - the visual effects are breathtaking and director Julie Taymor demonstrates an eye for colour and composition which would seem more befitting of an experimental art painting, let alone a mainstream musical. Both the psychedelic drug-induced interludes and the regular numbers boast an inventive and energetic choreography and a slew of distinctive visual styles, with Taymor drawing beauty out of the most mundane of situations, such as a football team tackling each other in slow motion morphing into a surreal but fascinating aerial dance sequence. The cast perform admirably, effortlessly underlining their brilliant singing voices with suitable emotional resonance. While many of their parts may fall dangerously close to archetypes, the cast manage to infuse new energy and interest into their roles. Relative newcomer Jim Sturgess is a noteworthy discovery indeed as British dockworker Jude, and he proves a more than adequate dramatic leading man as well as phenomenal singer. Evan Rachel Wood's Lucy, the upper class American girl turned war protester may be slightly underwritten, but her natural charisma and genuinely beautiful singing voice easily make up for an occasionally shallow character. Great support is provided by Joe Anderson as rebellious draft victim Max, Dana Fuchs as spunky rock singer Sadie and Martin Luther McCoy as JoJo - a guitarist not unlike Jimi Hendrix. The film also showcases amusing cameos from a nearly unrecognisable Bono as a cowboy hat sporting hippie singing "I am the Walrus", and Eddie Izzard as a very memorable Mr. Kite during his titular psychedelic circus song number. Fans of the Beatles have much to enjoy from the inspired and beautifully sung covers, as well as frequent references and in-jokes to their works (some tasteful, and some groan-worthy, such as the many hammer cracks to the character Max). While the storyline may cover very familiar ground, it does make for a compelling enough template for the key events of the late 1960s, and mirrors the spectacular musical numbers spectacularly. Treating Across the Universe as a narrative Beatles concert, aided by some truly astonishing visual effects will likely yield the most satisfying and enjoyable effect. At any rate, it is refreshing indeed to see such experimentation with the cinematic form and the musical genre, especially when it yields a result this satisfying. -8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fresh breeze sweeping away the cloud of gloom that has descended on Hollywood this fall, "Across the Universe" is a nice antidote to all of those grimy, dour films currently filling movie theatres. The point of all of those seems to be that we live in a crappy world. The point of "Across the Universe" is that sure, things may be crappy now, but they've been crappy before, and as long as the important things -- like love -- remain, the world we live in can always get better.A simplistic message? Perhaps. But no less welcome for that. Stage veteran Julie Taymor, most known for her revolutionary staging of the Broadway musical "The Lion King," sets her movie in the turbulent 60s, when anti-Vietnam sentiments and racial discord were reaching a boiling point, but there's no doubt that the criticism of American foreign policy is aimed squarely at the leadership of today who currently have us embroiled in another potential Vietnam, Iraq. The movie unfolds in bursts of song and color (the score is comprised completely of Beatles tunes), and even though the movie is far too long given its wisp of a plot, it mostly manages to sustain an infectious energy.The Beatles songs mostly sound great, and they're used creatively. I already knew I liked the Beatles, but hearing their songs performed here in a different context reawakened an appreciation for them. "I Want to Hold Your Hand," for example, originally a perky pop anthem, becomes here a heartbreaking ballad performed by a young girl in love whose object of affection doesn't return the favor. "Come Together" plays over a dazzling montage juxtaposing New York's Wall Street elite (represented by a troupe of suited business men dancing in unison) to its disenfranchised. And "Let It Be" becomes a gospel anthem underscoring the Detroit riots. Other songs fare less well, like "Strawberry Fields Forever," which feels awkwardly shoe-horned into the film. The young cast of mostly unknowns is attractive and engaging, even if the film doesn't demand much from them. The standout for me was Dana Fuchs, playing a singer obviously modeled after Janis Joplin.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>5 minutes in, I loved this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's only one reason to not give this movie a "10:" the story is fairly pedestrian. And yet, the music, cinematography, visual effects (spare and well-employed), and direction completely overcome that minor issue.I first heard of this movie in March 2007, when the trailer hit Apple's iTunes website. I was mesmerized. I next caught the trailer in a theater prior to "Stardust" (another great and under-appreciated movie.) My girlfriend really couldn't grasp my love-at-first-sight passion for this movie. Until, that is, we went and saw it this past weekend.First of all, Julie Taymor and her team are a bunch of geniuses. To take thirty songs from the Beatles, rearrange the music and re-task the songs into situations they might not have fit into at first glance, is an amazing accomplishment. Evan Rachel Wood, it turns out, is a fine singer, and shines in her role as "Lucy." Dana Fuchs' "Sadie" (Sexy Sadie, indeed!) can feel free to join Janis Joplin and Etta James in the land of women with powerful, gut-wrenching voices. Martin Luther's soulful vocals are a great counterpoint to Fuchs' raw energy. Truth is, all these kids can sing, and sing well.Bono, as Dr. Robert, and Eddie Izzard, as Mr. Kite, are wonderful additions to this cast. Bono, especially, does not play his role "as Bono," which I wholeheartedly appreciated. The cameo by Joe Cocker was great fun for me, as well.As a fan of the Beatles, I loved this movie. It's a love letter to the band's fans as much as a love letter to the band itself. I'd recommend it to anyone and everyone. It won't be getting any Oscar nods (with the exception of Best Song, perhaps), but awards are not why we see the movies. We see them for enjoyment, and this film delivers enjoyment at a high level throughout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I never grew up in this era, therefore I will never now what it is like to live amongst a real war happening. So what does that mean, nothing. What matters is that this was a film made to inspire anyone who ever sees it. I am a dreamer like Jude, Lucy, Max or anyone living then or living now who seeks to discover. Love is what I want, it is what you want, all of us need it. All of us need to be understood and understand why living can be so BEAUTIFUL, yet so hard to get through that one day. Across the Universe isn't solely about Beatles covers, the underlying message it gets across is all we need is love.Yes, this movie to me deserves an excellent vote because I have never seen love like this. I have felt it, but this was quite different. For the first time in a long time my eyes, ears, mouth, and heart were open. Walking away from the theater it was almost as if I stepped out into the world for the first time. To imagine how I must have felt as a baby leaving the hospital, who brushed my head first, who was the first to look in my eyes and say I love you. Probably my mom.The thing here is this is just another movie, but it was like magic or something you could never expect to see again. I do not now how I would convince anyone to see this nor do I wish to. But if I did I would illustrate to them a series of captivating pictures taken of the world we live in, friends and family they have grown to love, and tell them Across the Universe is more than a musical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it comes to The Beatles I'm usually a purist. Meaning I steer clear from those who would cover, imitate, or otherwise copy their work. BUT, Julie Taymor and the cast of Across The Universe have proved me WRONG. This film is a fresh and visually engaging voyage into The Beatles music as told through the characters in the story. The song selection was perfect, and the cover tunes ideal in terms of the selection for which cast member is chosen to sing each particular tune. Jude (Jim Sturgess) finds his groove early and Evan Rachel Wood (Lucy) is as captivating as she is beautiful. I was shocked to discover that she was only 20 years old. And was shocked once again to discover that she is hooking up with Marilyn Manson. But you gotta give a guy his props. Nice catch. Joe Anderosn (Max) fits nicely into the visual puzzle, and the cameo by Selma Hyack was well placed. Hello Nurse. Basically, I can't say enough good things about the movie and will wait anxiously for it to arrive on DVD.</fullReview>

And don't get me wrong it's not like they sang the entire thing. There is dialog mixed with the singing. I felt the the visuals were really well done as well. I was very pleased with all the scenes and even when it got "artsy" I was entertained. I don't give out many 9s and I don't usually comment on movies here. So for me to put this effort in must mean I liked it. I took my 18 year old son who loved the movie as well. This is a must see for any Beatles fan!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant spectacle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I expected this movie to be good, I was still impressed by how brilliantly executed it all was. Instead of just having the characters sporadically (and awkwardly) break out into song, Director Julie Taymor seamlessly mixes the spoken dialog and the music. What's even more impressive is how easily she takes the movie from realistic imagery of the 60's to the surreal and back again. What's best about this movie is that the story itself could have stood on its own, but combined with the music of the Beatles it just made it into something fantastic. I don't think you really have to be a Beatles fan to enjoy this movie either, in fact a lot of the songs I had never heard until I saw this movie, and some of their more familiar songs are used in unexpected ways, but they always work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern masterpiece--the best film of 2007</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever have that experience of a lifetime at the cinema? Walking out having seen a film that truly reached out to you in the theater and grabbed you by the neck and looked you deep in the eyes, making an impression on your life that you won't forget anytime soon...and leaving you speechless for the rest of the night.There have only been a select few films I've seen that truly gave me that experience, and I'm beyond delighted to say that the newest edition to that category is "Across The Universe," which is in my opinion the only decent film to surface since Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.Across The Universe deals with six major characters--a British art student from Liverpool coming to America to find his estranged father. A preppy, pretty, high school senior whose boyfriend has been drafted into the raging Vietnam War. A black guitarist from Detroit whose son has died in a peace rally. A young Asian cheerleader, running away from her home in Ohio to go after her life. A burnt-out, wannabe singer who performs at a small club and wants to show the world her music. And finally, a college drop-out with a passion for drugs, sex, and booze in search of himself.Somehow they are all brought together by a small apartment in New York and begin to form unique bonds with each other. In the midst of the Vietnam War, and peace movements going on constantly around them, they are drawn to fighting, drugs, pursuing their dreams, finding themselves, and above all, finding true love, which is what the movie is all about.Across The Universe is by far one of the most unique love stories ever written and unlike other deeply romantic films you may have seen, it is not sappy in the least or aimed toward female audiences. Across The Universe is not for the faint-hearted and is surprisingly gritty, hard-hitting, intense, and even shocking in many scenes. The film is shot in an extremely awkward (in a GOOD way) "Tim Burton" style that will be admired by anyone who gazes upon abstract art at a modern museum, and I was truly mesmerized.The film seems like it is eight or nine hours long, and in no way is that a bad thing. Coming out of the theater after a 4:30 screening, when my watch showed 6:45pm, I thought it had frozen at some time during the movie. The person I saw it with couldn't believe it either. Across The Universe feels like three or four films--all with separate story lines, and all aimed at different audiences--merged into one, creating a bold fusion of film-making art. I'm being quite literal when I say it has a little something for everyone.And as if the intricately written screenplay and exquisite direction weren't enough, the film is paired up with astonishing performances by EVERYONE in the cast, most of them largely unknown actors, and everything is hauntingly believable. I'd say a good 60% of the movie are Beatles songs, each song seemingly about the current event of the film, and the songs are sung by the actors, all of them with great voices. A lot of times I find musicals kind of worn-out, washed-up and boring, but never in my life have I been so captured by the beauty of film and music together--as one being. It was the absolute perfect addition to the film and put the icing on an already deliciously tasty cake. If you're a big Beatles fan like I am, you'll pick up on hundreds of intimate, subtle references to the Beatles' music such as character names, locations, and events.Quite simply, this film is nothing short of a modern masterpiece, and will sweep the Oscars come February. It's a little bit of Moulin Rouge, Forrest Gump, Ghandi, and Titanic merged into one, with a Beatles soundtrack accompanying. See this film on the big screen before it leaves theaters...it will leave you gasping for air.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fabulous movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know who else besides Julie Taymor could have made such a great and inventive visualization of Beatle songs .... as hard as it is to do the movie lives up to the high standard of the music. I saw the Beatles in 1965 and their music was(is) religion to me, so I went to this movie looking for a nice evening of music, not expecting much, but was amazed at the creative way the songs were used, the great singing, and the theme's relevance to today. It made me wonder ..... where is the protest to the Iraq war that went on in the sixties to the Vietnam war ? The movie beautifully illustrates the brutal contrast between the consciousness that was awakening during those times (and continues to blossom) and the viciousness of the old paradigm and the powers that be and their childish ego games and horrific disregard for the sanctity of life. Highly recommended !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matter of Opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie last night, and I positively adored it! It has definitely made its way into my all-time favourite films. Jim Sturgess does a wonderful job as Jude. I loved the new variations of all my favourite Beatles songs, and every dance sequence was spectacularly choreographed. Aside from the music, the film's portrayal of a difficult time in history is powerful and moving. The characters were believable and even lovable. I think it's safe to say it's earned a spot in IMDb's top 250.You can imagine how shocked I was to see that it received less than glowing reviews. Of course the viewers must decide for themselves what they think of it, as with any film. I can understand that not everyone will love this movie, and it may not appeal to everyone. However, I strongly disagree with all critics who say this film "sucked". It is fine to dislike a movie, but there was nothing slipshod about this one at all. As I said, I thought it was raw brilliance, but that is a matter of opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie and all that were with us loved it including my 17 year old daughter. Not just because of the music (although that was most excellent) buy the visuals and the references were amazing. This movie took me right back to my younger years. This director did a fantastic job! My husband felt the movie was very much in the vein of "The Big Lebowski" as far as cinematography goes. We will own this movie and watch it over and over. Every song was done with great voice and the actors did a wonderful job singing. The references to other artists and events during the time were fun to catch. The movie was very entertaining and I would recommend it to people who are music lovers, Beatles fans and remember the 60's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really loved and enjoyed this movie! I am a Beatles fan from way back, and this movie just catapulted you back to the 60's. It is very reminiscent of Hair and Sargent Pepper and those movies of that period. The songs wove together intricately with the story line. It brought together so many of the experiences the good and the bad. And at times was just mind blowing. It brought back memories of and turbulent and passionate time in our history. It also gave us a look at England that we rarely see. It went from being totally hilarious at times to heartbreakingly sad at others. Take a step back in time and take a magic carpet ride across the universe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took my breath away. I admit I was nervous about Beatles songs being performed by actors/actresses and the songs getting that sometimes lame Broadway sound. Yes, it could have been heavier at times, especially the part with JoJo and playing the guitar, but it wasn't ever lame. I am a huge Beatles fan and so is my musician husband. I dragged him to go and he actually enjoyed it very much. I am now obsessed with this movie and am seeing it again on Saturday. It was a beautiful love story and the fact that the music was recorded live made it that much more believable. I loved how they incorporated much of what was happening in the 60s/70s into the movie with the Vietnam war and protests and Charles Manson, and Martin Luther King. It was very well done to show the mood of the times. The cinematography was magnificent. This goes right to one of my all time favorite movies that I will watch over and over. I haven't listened to anything other than my old Beatles CDs or this soundtrack since I saw the movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a visually and musically engaging movie. It paints a picture of the 60's which is spot-on without being a cliché. (it avoids overwhelming us with tie- dye and headbands), More than anything else, the performance of the numerous Beatles' songs in this movie proves that while they were brilliant song writers, the Beatles were not great singers; their versions are so much weaker than those presented here. here. In particular, the opening "Girl" by Jim Sturgess and the later "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" by the lovely T.V Carpio make the Beatles' versions seem pale in comparison. Anyone familiar with th play "Lion King" or MacArthur Fellowships will again be convinced that Julie Taymor is a creative genius. There are so many levels and references in this movie that you'll want to see it again as soon as it's over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Music: Great, Acting: Great, Story: Eh...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm interested in the range of comments on this movie... from 'incredible... moved me to tears' to 'not artsy... worst movie ever'. I can see both extremes as far as the ratings go. I've seen the movie twice and would see it again in a heartbeat. However, I would like to say that the reason for this is the music... and, very sadly, only the music. Obviously, the songs they chose for the movie were amazing, and I thought most of the remakes, while not surpassing the originals in excellence (with the exception of Helter Skelter- Dana Fuchs does an absolutely SUPERB job with the remake), are very, very good in their own right and definitely deserve a listen.****SPOILERS****Sadly, the movie is greatly lacking elsewhere. The acting is great (huge Rachel Evan Wood fan and I thought that Jim Sturgess was great in this), but the story doesn't really go anywhere. Basically, it takes over 2 hours to tell the story: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back, boy and girl are assumed to live happily ever after. There are side stories thrown in but they are poorly developed. For instance, we see a snapshot of a civil rights sort of protest/ revolt/something like that (it's not clarified well) in what we can assume is the segregated south, during which a young African American boy is singing "let it be" and, during the song, we see him lying in a coffin, apparently having been killed in the riot. This is used as the reason Martin Luther McCoy's character moves to New York. However, we don't really know how he knew the boy, if at all. He was at the funeral, but the boy is not mentioned again in the movie and, with the exception of a few "deep" lines muttered by Luther's character about music being the only thing left in the world that makes sense, we don't get the idea that he experienced a significant loss. As far as the choreography/cinematography... I'd say it's average. I think that parts were great (Strawberry Fields Forever, I Want You) but some were horribly overdone (I've Just Seen A Face, Hey Jude).Basically, I'd say this movie is worth watching because it has its strong points- I think this is a good point to mention the amazing performance by Bono. However, consider this a warning to anyone who is expecting to go into this film and see a deep, well developed, eye- opening plot, because it's just not there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it reminded me a little of HAIR...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this deserves a valid comment. This movie reminded me of HAIR in a lot of ways, but contained far more depth with strong images and profound symbolism. It exemplifies the era without just exaggerating stereotypes of "hippies," their costumes and setting. Hippies are constantly illustrated in films protesting in futility as bums and druggies that not a lot of people in this era can really relate to. While there was a lot of visual effects this film places emphasis on the humanity of that era and gives today's audience a perspective that they can carry with them. Like in any musical, the characters randomly break into song at any moment but the lyrics are uniquely interpreted and fit in well with the scenes. This film captures the true message of The Beatles' timeless songs and their relevance in any era. The songs carry a very simple message that anyone can understand. It was an overall meaningful and enjoyable film and I think everyone should give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet, imaginative, uneven musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most surprising things about this lavish musical epic is the identity of the screenwriters: Ian La Frenais and Dick Clement, the dynamic duo responsible for classic 1970s British sitcoms such as "The Likely Lads" and "Porridge". Their latest effort "Across the Universe" is a homage to the music of The Beatles that is breathtakingly ambitious and epic in scale. The plot is predictably threadbare, plucky young Liverpudlian dock worker Jude travels to America and is smitten by apple-pie-cute Lucy. But the path of true love never runs smoothly. Along the way we meet characters named JoJo, Sadie, Maxwell (is anyone noticing a theme here?), and...well, you get the idea.Visually, this film is plain gorgeous. The screen positively glows thanks to the use of a massive color palette that makes even grimy Liverpool look like it's covered in diamonds (sorry!). Frame by frame, much of "Across the Universe" simply bursts with imagination. Ditto for the set design, choreography, and cinematography.However, there are downsides. At times the plot drags and some stretches of the film are somewhat dull. All the numbingly over-familiar totems of the 1960s (Vietnam, the Civil Rights movement, MLK etc.)are once again hauled out of the dusty closet of Boomer history and put through their tired paces- lest we forget that this overexposed decade is really the center of all recorded history as we know it. Only die-hard Beatles fans will likely appreciate the two-plus hour running time, as the extra musical bloat makes the whole affair seem agonizingly slow at times (though not often in fairness).All that having been said, "Across the Universe" tries very hard to be liked and is mostly successful. It's best moments are really outstanding , such as the set pieces constructed around renditions of "I am the Walrus" and "Happiness is a Warm Gun". The film also succeeds in letting the audience feel the sense of hope, happiness, and adventure that the main characters are clearly supposed to embody. The cast appear genuinely spirited and spontaneous. Also, the cameos by Joe Cocker and Bono are fun.In conclusion, this is definitely a must-see for people who appreciate deeply beautiful visuals and knockout choreography. Obviously, Beatles fans are likely to adore this film. Otherwise, go see "Across the Universe" for a sweet, if hackneyed, love story about youthful characters living in a youthful time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best musical ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw Across the universe at the theaters and it rocked! Way better than Tommy or any other acclaimed musical. The songs were amazing! Mostly Beatles but there might have some other origins to the songs. And even though the adaptation's weren't exactly like the original songs they were still great. The acting was very convincing and effective. And the surreal moments were, well, SUREALE! Sometimes confusing though. For example I really didn't understand the deal with the Kayako looking girls in the middle of the lake, but oh well still a nice visual. And all the colorful tydye and volcano lamp images were pretty cool too. This is the perfect movie to watch with some friends. That way you could walk out of the theater singing and dancing in the streets like i did with mine! XD</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, man, how can I even DESCRIBE this movie?? It was just fantastic--the actors were also amazing singers!!! As I said before, this is a musical, but instead of having cheesy show tunes, it had songs that I love, sung by people with beautiful voices.I think the best part was with Dr.Robert, singing 'I Am the Walrus' and everything was all lit up in vibrant lights. The song 'Strawberry Fields Forever' was awesome because of Jude's bleeding strawberry masterpiece. Also, 'I Want You (She's So Heavy)' and 'Happiness is a Warm Gun' both stuck in my mind because they were just incredible to watch. Evan Rachel Wood's version of 'Blackbird' was lovely. So basically what I wanted to say is that this movie is probably the best movie I've ever seen, or at least in the top three. I advise everyone to go see it, because I know you'll love it as much as I do!!!!</fullReview>

Once again must be seen with an open mind and be able to sit through maybe 20 minutes of boring moments but in the end it's worth.

		<fullReview>This movie is amazing! I have to say that first, whoever loves the Beatles will love this movie no matter what. When I first saw the trailer I was blown away, I had to see it. The songs are sung excellent and I love how the songs fit in with the movie, or should I say the movie fit in with the songs. The songs are the movie, Julie Taymore just gave them picture and movement. It's a classic love story about a boy meeting a girl but it's thrown all together by the power of music, and of course the music is from the Beatles. The cinematography is amazing and the colors they use are brilliant. All of the actors and actresses have phenomenal voices and sing the songs perfectly, when i was hearing Jim Stugges singing (Jude) i actually thought it was the Beatles. The dialoge, that wasn't sung, was also good, its very passionate and loving. Anyone who like musicals, love, and weird, bizarre movies, this is the must see movie of the year. Hopefully it wins Best Musical of the year, Sweeny Todd may have some competition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Across the Universe does several things gloriously. First and foremost, it tells an archetypal love story (that is, a love story that is intended to be familiar and universal, not novel and quirky) and makes it incredibly moving by doing it as a musical using many of the best Beatles songs (more about that later). It's visually stunning and features some of the most audacious, jaw-dropping choreography to come out of Hollywood in years. And it paints a very solid picture of the political unrest and psychedelic exploration that fueled the 60's.It's in the latter sequences where the movie sometimes misfires slightly. The straightforward Beatles love songs are almost always complete successes. The problem comes when the script tries to incorporate the tripper songs from their psychedelic period ("Strawberry Fields," "I am the Walrus," "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"). These lyrics aren't really about anything the way "It Won't Be Long" or "I Want to Hold Your Hand" are, and the scenes built around them (while wildly inventive and entertaining if regarded in isolation) come across as slightly forced and/or bring the plot to a halt.The music? I'm a former rock critic who owns nearly 2000 CDs, none by the Beatles. It's not that I don't think they're great, it's just that these songs have been so overplayed, I really feel no need to hear them again. The versions here are almost uniformly terrific and serve as incredible reminders of just how great these songs are. If you're someone of my generation who acknowledges that "Hey Jude" is a brilliant song but is just plain bored by it after the 1000th listening, run to the theater, because hearing it here is like hearing it for the first time (maybe better, since it's embedded in a love story that, by this point in the film, has really grabbed you). And if you want to know whether a film critic can be trusted with movie music, see if they hated the music here but loved the music in "Dreamgirls": if so, they're musically illiterate.8/10 (and I'm a tough grader: that means I loved it and endorse it without reservation).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved every second of this movie. I have been a Beatles fan for most of my life (granted I am only 19) and felt that this movie represented how music by the Beatles helped give a voice to a generation. The stories of the characters suck you in and let's your mind explore a musical world, in which I'm sure most of us wish was real. There are parts in the movie where the symbolism and artistic filming can make you look over to your movie watching buddy and say, "really, did they just do that? That was a little weird" But I believe those moments are what make this movie special. It is different from all the mainstream movies and lets your mind free itself of what society and reality has laid down as rules. If you don't like artsy movies, then this probably isn't for you. But if you are an indie film fan or like movies such as.... Breakfast on Pluto or any musicals then this movie will be like an addictive drug to you. I just saw it 2 days ago and I am dying to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Psychedelic Awakening for the Senses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Across the Universe has been on my "Must See" list since I heard about it back in September 2006. I must say, that the wait was definitely worth it. All my expectations were met, and then some. As Stephen Holden said in The New York Times, "Imperfections, however glaring, become endearing quirks..." but those quirks quickly become perfections.We begin our story with Jude (a very promising Jim Sturgess), sitting on a foggy beach in solitude. He turns to the camera, and asks the audience "Is there anybody going to listen to my story, all about the girl who came to stay?", inviting them in, giving the movie the quality of a story that's been handed down from generation. The music is soft and resonant, as is the sorrow in his voice. WE then fade into a montage of waves crashing against the beach, with an image of our main character's love, Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood), being shown in a protest, while viciously being restrained by the police. The waves come crash on the beach, just like the changes of the 60's did on the main characters.Contrast is a huge element in this movie. The movie starts out with The Beatles' earlier Ed Sullivan show songs, backdropping a more innocent '60's, then transforms into the revolutionary, darker times, with tracks like "I Am the Walrus" and "While my Guitar Gently Weeps" to help them cope with changes like Lucy's brother, Max (Joe Anderson), going off to Vietnam, and the core group of friends they had going their separate ways.Director Julie Taymor is known for her artistic and stimulating way of composing a shot. She takes extra care in making sure that her "paintings", shall we say, emphasize the hidden meanings of the scene, instead of simply taking her brush and smothering it so that we, the audience, can't understand what she's trying to get at. In the scene where Max goes to get examined for the draft, we see him and the other terrified draftees carrying our country's pride and joy, Lady Liberty, as they sing "She's So heavy". Liberty is getting hard to carry, and the country is relying on it's youth to support it, no matter how scared or confused they are. I could get into how it parallels with today's political situation, but honestly, this movie was made to be enjoyed and thought about, not bring up another protest that we've already heard so much about from other recent films.By the end of the movie, after being separated by political turmoil, and a little thing Jude forgot to get called a Visa, he and Lucy find a way back into each other's love, as the reunited friends sing "Love is All you Need", which is the feeling that swims through the theater by the end. The ending may have been the tiniest bit cutesy, but it was resolved and it went out with a bang, like most good movies do. And finally, a color treated image of Lucy and Jude embracing while suspended in water, as Bono sings "Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds" (his performance wasn't exactly Oscar worthy, but hey, it's Bono, need I say more?)begins the credits. Director Julie Taymor has made a stunning, thought provoking, savory feast of a film. The cast was nearly perfect in their performance, complete with pleasantly surprising appearances such as Eddie Izzard as the audacious Mr. Kite, and Salma Hayek, who starred in Taymor's previous film "Frida", as a pin-up singing nurse. The story flowed wonderfully, and...I could continued to gush, but I'd need eight days a week for that (sorry, Beatles fans, the song didn't make the cut).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Musical of 2007, Best War Film of 2007, but not without its quirks...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying that this film is brave, timely and poignant and I love it to pieces. However, I concur with the other reviewers who have had slightly mixed feelings. The key to producing good musicals, especially now that the art form's pinnacle of popularity in the golden studio era of the 50s is an entire half-century past, is to maintain the audience's suspension of disbelief. In that respect, Across the Universe is exceedingly clever, transitioning with choreographed precision between what one might call diagetic and nondiagetic moments- "real" scenes and dance numbers. For example, football players careening and colliding in front and behind the protagonist of the moment gracefully transpose into dancers, flipping and tumbling yet still retaining a style of movement consistent with the football theme.The visual style of the film echos the innocence of Hairspray in earlier moments, and the colorful melodrama of Moulin Rouge in its representation of the Beatles' later more political work, as the politics of the film begin to cement. Smart editing in the opening sequence creates graphic matches, carefully balancing newspapers atop crashing waves. An army boot camp montage splits individual body parts into separate boxes, suggesting the dehumanization by fragmentation (Full Metal Jacket?) that takes place to create soldiers. Strawberries are grenades, bombs, bloody masses sacrificed to the war on terror --strike that-- the war against Communism. Yet in some scenes, all the visual trickery loses its place, and doesn't quite live up to our expectations of sensory overload? the circus scene somehow seems too thin and too out of context for its own intentions.The film contains some of the most innovative set, lighting and costume designs I've ever seen- Max's abduction into the military comes to mind. Floors slide unexpectedly, hospital beds flip with Busby Berkeley precision. Soldiers march over a scale-model of Vietnamese jungle carrying a heavy Statue of Liberty. Many pieces surpass Dream Girls in their ambition and pure bravado. The budget, clearly many multiples larger than Hairspray's, lends itself well to the rendition of the Beatles' music, and the action is indeed impeccably matched to the visuals and emotional pitch of the plot. There's even some surprising re-casting of songs to suggest alternates to literal readings, ie "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" about loneliness.But there are exceptions- the bowling alley scene falls particularly flat, as does an elating but contrived vision of "Dear Prudence" (could that effect be any more cliché?). The plot also occasionally hits a rough patch, failing to sufficiently motivate Jude's animosity towards Lucy, and skipping awkwardly around the issues surrounding Prudence (is she Vietnamese? Were the filmmakers timid about offending the audience by exploring her sexuality in a less roundabout, under-the-radar kind of way?) and Jude's father. The emotional weight of the film takes longer to develop than it should, leaving audiences to spend the first 20 minutes wondering if they'll care about the characters or not.Despite these quirks, Across the Universe is the kind of film I have been waiting with bated breath for a brave filmmaker to take on. Its characters are not literally the Beatles or Janis Joplin, nor the actual characters described in the Beatles' music, they are in effect *metacharacters*- stand ins for ideas, people who embody the ethos of a generation, and by proxy, a suggestion on the direction of our own. The film repoliticizes and recontexualizes the Beatles' music for a new generation, allowing us to understand both the original context of the work, and its pointed applicability now. Comparable to Apocalypse Now in its timely, subtle and yet provocative objection to a war without end, Across The Universe asks a new generation to take up the struggle passed to it by their spiritual predecessors. It is a brave and elegant statement, despite its quirks and oversights, well deserving of a wide and receptive audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel like I should have given this movie a 2/10 but that would be misleading. This is a bad movie. Its really bad. Bad plot, bad transition, bad character development. Its a bad movie and you can sense it within the first five minutes.And yet I love it. Why? The music. The adaptions. The trippy-fest. The actors have beautiful voices. The adaptations and interpretations are so great. The videos they put to the music will send you on a magic carpet ride.The movie starts out feeling bad and boring, at least to me, - but it will start to get very intense and so will the music. I feel like the movie was just an excuse to expose people to someone's interpretation of the Beatles. Its something that... I would cut out everything that is not musical and then put it as a series on youtube. You have the movie just so you can put the people in the videos in some sort of frame of reference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very optimistic about this film because I love the Beatles and Julie Taymor's creative work,and the ads for the film indicated that this film would be a visual feast of imaginative images reflecting the creativity and culture of the 60's. However, the first third of the film was so plodding that I considered leaving, something I almost never do. Eventually the story picked up as did the art direction, which accounts for the 5. Some of the visual metaphors and/or dance sequences that accompanied the songs ("I Want You"; "Happiness is a Warm Gun"; )sorely lacked mental muscle, like pages from a sophomore art student's journal. (C'mon Julie- stretch it! Feel the burn!) Am I being a curmudgeon to want the woman who created the costumes for "The Lion King" and directed the brilliant "Frida" to try harder to come up with some sharp and truly new ideas to depict the familiar themes of the 60's? On the up-tick, about half of the film succeeded very well, and the scenes featuring Joe Cocker were stellar. If only the whole film were of that caliber...The film pays homage to A Hard Day's Night, Rent, Hair, and maybe even some Madonna videos, but "Across the Universe" lacks the verve and spirit of the originals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a summary, it is a warning. Few things spurn me to review a movie. Even less propel me to espouse the negative of any one in particular. Holding back commentary on everything else about this flick, I must note that merit based upon revered psychedelic content is bunk. Ooh! The visuals are psychedelic!... Yawn. What is it that your life is lacking anyway that this completely unimaginative and convoluted film could pretend to conjure up any sense of continuity? The 60's came and are now gone. Don't believe me? Look at the calendar? It seems that we're now in the 2000-somethings. Anyway, my point revolves around the 'psychedelics' of the film. Literally, a psychedelic experience portends a lack of perception, especially in the realm of reality. Simply, the director of this film sought connections for the screenplay in pop-culture media that weren't even vaguely related. Don't make me listen to a Beatles song bastardized by Jefferson Airplane overtones. The Beatles were the Beatles and Jefferson Airplane was Jefferson Airplane. When some self-aggrandizing, masturbatory film-maker feels the need to forever confuse the two in the annals of cinematic history ? beware.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For someone who hates musicals - I'm completely agape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had anything to do with the musical Hair, I would now shoot myself. There's no comparison. Unlike Hair this is the real deal. Sure there are a couple of rough spots, but, in general, no one, not even the Beatles themselves, have put together such a loving tribute to their music. And I really, really hate musicals. I only went on the strength of Roger Ebert's review. He said he saw it at the Toronto Film Festival, and that, despite his heavy schedule, he had to see it twice! He was right.I was a young man in the 60s and 70s and this film very deftly brings out the core spirit of the times amongst those who were enjoying the alternative lifestyle. Nevertheless, I would have made a couple of changes in this film. For example, I would have made the cops more cruel, and I would have had Vietnam veterans be far more ruined and lost by their experiences. But as far as the most lyrical and emotional aspects of the times, this movie has it down perfectly. High praise to Jim Sturgess and Joe Anderson especially. Evan Rachel Wood is also very good, but somehow, not really of the period for me though you often don't mind. For me, the picture hangs on the two male leads, Sturgess and Anderson, with Sturgess carrying most of the burden. Others are quite good too, and it's clear that the director, Taymor (who I will now follow no matter what her next project might be) got high quality performances from all.Probably the best part of the movie is the way they managed to make the Beatles' songs relevant to their storyline. The interpretations are brilliant, and I only wish they had done more along that line. That's no doubt the work of those who wrote the screenplay. But whoever is to be blamed, it's completely mesmerizing. I have never seen a musical I really like, except this one, and I am at a total loss to know whether I will ever like another one, but my guess is no. It's just too unlikely a combination of charismatic people, great music, and captivating ideas. There are some serious short-comings, like an almost complete lack of Hispanics, but I was somewhat quelled by the movie's credits which had a more representative smattering of them listed. I just can't let that ruin the experience of this film which is probably the most memorable and delightful 2 hours plus I've ever had in a theater. The only people I could believe wouldn't love this film is -- Dick Cheney and his ilk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was ready to walk out after first ten minutes - but glad I stayed. I think the last musical I saw on the big screen was "Funny Girl" or "The Sound of Music" when I was a kid. Not sure if "Blazing Saddles" counts as a musical. So I didn't really know what to expect from this. I was pleasantly surprised.The guys who wrote the movie are better known (to me) as UK TV Comedy writers and this is sometimes apparent in the comedy parts of the script.So don't waste time looking for any sort of higher or hidden meaning. Thewriters have been around for donkeys years and are responsible for two of my all time favourites from UK TV Porridge and The Likely Lads.Best thing to do is just sit back and let the story unfold and listen to the music and enjoy the movie. I particularly enjoyed the cameos from Bono, Eddie Izzard with a little bit of help from Joe Cocker. A very easy movie to watch on rainy Sunday afternoon.</fullReview>

The movie brings the lyrical importance of their songs to the forefront and helps us all see how the songs became so meaningful to people of the time. There many layers of symbolism to be taken into consideration, as well as an easy enough to follow love story. Beautiful story and amazing cinematography. Some parts are little strange, yes, but, you are guaranteed to leave the theater feeling a little bit better about life, and respecting the genius of the band much more.

		<fullReview>I saw five movies this weekend; (Silk, Hairspray, Rocket Science, In the Valley of Elah, and Across the Universe) and I have to say Across the Universe blew me away. I wasn't expecting it to be as penetrating or as beautifully executed as it was. Quell Surprise! As musicals go; it made Hairspray (which i also enjoyed) look a little campy and dated. It totally rocked the spirit, the soul and the eyes. Talk about bubblegum to the eyes, those animations from Kyle Sacs were beautiful. I didn't know Kyle did that sort of work, I just thought he was a titles guy. But, it makes sense. Like "Once" which I saw twice, I am sure I will be seeing this movie again. I am not in the industry, but if I were I would be very proud to have made this movie.PS. Though the room burst into applause when the movie was over i noticed the younger kids sitting around me (I grew up in the 60's) weren't unconsciously tapping their legs, or anything else, to the amazing music, as was I. They were just sitting there politely watching it. I felt sorry for them, though they demonstrated their enthusiasm in the end, it couldn't possibly have resonated for them as it does members of my generation who grew up singing the songs, all of them.I wish those kids would get off their polite little a**es and organize a protest against the Iraq war, as their parents did for Vietnam.</fullReview>

I'm not sure if director Taymor intended that or not, but in any case, the film is uneven. You're bound to like some scenes/numbers better than others. (My favorites: I Want You (She's So Heavy) and Strawberry Fields.) However, if you're curious, I would say go and see it, mainly because it's imaginative and entertaining (and the music's good too).

		<fullReview>This was a poor attempt at creating a musical out of a some of the best Beattles songs ever written. First of all, a musical usually consists of a plot-line, which this movie lacked in a serious way. The movie never drawls the viewer into the characters. I felt I had no vested interest in people who are never developed. Secondly, the songs are desecrated by poor lip syncing and bad choreography. My final comment is that what the director may view to be deep, intelligent imagery is just painfully cliché. I would recommend for all of you who have been really wanting to view this see this film, save yourself the time and spare yourself the from the desecration of one of the greatest bands of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>far from perfect but not a disaster either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm pleased to report that "Across the Universe" isn't nearly as insufferable as I had expected it to be. As a die-hard Beatles fan, my initial trepidation was not entirely unwarranted, given that the one previous attempt at crafting a movie around the Fab Four's oeuvre was the kitschy, lamentable "Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band," as bad a film as has ever stunk up the inside of a movie theater. Faced with such an appalling precedent, I certainly did not have high hopes for this latest endeavor, which, from its previews, looked to be another Beatles-inspired travesty in the making.The good news is that "Across the Universe," written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais and directed by Julie Taymor ("Titus"), never sinks to the level of that earlier fiasco, although it does come perilously close a few times - mainly in the second half of the film when it lapses into pseudo-psychedelia of the worst kind. But, luckily, that doesn't happen very often, and much of the film is surprisingly sweet and charming in its intentions and approach.It's the early 1960's, and a scruffy Paul McCartney look-alike named Jude (Jim Sturgess) leaves his home in Liverpool to find meaning, adventure and purpose in America. While there, he falls in love with Lucy (Evan Rachel Ward), a beautiful young blond who becomes actively involved in the antiwar movement when her fiancé is killed in battle and her brother is shipped off to fight in Vietnam. Their love story is played out against the backdrop of the turbulent '60's, a time of free love, flower-power fashions, peace demonstrations, drug use, and anti-establishment radicalism, all of which find their way into the fabric of the film.The Beatles' canon, which served as the perfect soundtrack for that extraordinary era, is so uniquely rich in songwriting material that each fan is sure to find something to carp about regarding which songs the filmmakers have chosen to put into their film and which they've opted to leave out. I would have preferred more selections from the band's earlier period and slightly fewer from their later, even though I realize that the latter provide the kind of narrative richness and thematic depth around which a group of filmmakers can more easily construct a full-bodied story.Most of the songs are seamlessly sewn into the narrative, although there are times when we can sense the scenarists stretching the material to make a certain song fit. For instance, there's a character named Prudence who serves no real function in the story other than to give the other characters a chance to sing "Dear Prudence" to her ("Jude" and "Lucy" are marginally more forgivable since they are at least the names of the main characters in the movie). "Across the Universe" works best when it keeps its vision simple and close to everyday life. Conversely, it runs into the most trouble when it edges towards surrealism and stylization, often slipping over into pretentiousness and self-indulgence when it does so. Taymor exploits her trademark fascination with puppetry and masks, but the visions she creates with them often feel outdated, cheesy and campy. Particularly egregious is an ill-conceived scene featuring Eddie Izzard as a Timothy Leary-inspired Mr. Kite, a sequence that has the "Sgt. Pepper" movie imprimatur stamped all over it. Bono doesn't fare much better as Dr. Robert, trapped as he is in one of the most poorly shot psychedelic nightmares since the Beatles' own "Magical Mystery Tour" movie from 1967.Still, these are minor lapses in a movie that is often funny, touching and captivating in its own right. Most of the credit, of course, goes to the Beatles themselves whose songs are so musically rich and lyrically resonant that they can both define a specific era and literally reach out across the universe at one and the same time. With their film, Taymor and her crew have captured a good deal of that timelessness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I saw it twice! Strange but fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This takes place in the late 60s-early 70s. A British man named Jude (Jim Sturgess) goes to America to find his father. He ends up buddies with Max (Joe Anderson) who goes to Columbia. He falls in love with Joe's sister Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood). They all end up in NYC--Max is sent off to the war and Jude and Lucy fall in love--but her obsession with stopping the war starts to tear them apart. And characters break into song at any given moment--and they sing Beatles songs! The story is VERY familiar but no one is here for the story. You're seeing this for the imagery and to see HOW they fit 33 Beatles songs into this. The last time Beatles songs were used was in 1978 in the camp "classic" "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band". This is nowhere near as bad. The songs work in seamlessly--they just flow out of the characters and it never seems forced. The songs are done very well--everybody on board can sing and the imagery is just incredible. The first song--Sturgees singing the first two stanzas to "Girl" with no music and a dismal setting just won't leave me. The view of a bunch of men being drafted and carrying the Statue of Liberty to "She's So Heavy" is both funny and a slap in the face to the Bush administration. And wait till you see Bono (from U2) singing "I Am the Walrus"! It really blew me away--most of the time I sat there just slack-jawed at what I was seeing. I did enjoy it but there were problems. It was far too long--133 minutes. Also they give characters names from Beatle songs (Lucy, Sadie, Max and JoJo) and then don't even use the songs! Strange. Also one character is introduced coming in through the bathroom window (Get it?). Also there are glaring gaps in the story and characterization--I'm assuming there were cuts in the script or the movie. And Sturgees is OK but doesn't have the charisma to carry the whole film. Still, I saw this film twice in a theatre (I never do that) and liked it even better the second time. I had forgotten some of it. Turning "With a Little Help From My Friends" into a frat house song is LOTS of fun! So--I did like it but the length and story lapses might bother some people. I give it an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not terribly original but what the hey.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is really easy to find out whether or not people will like "Across the Universe". Just put two questions to them: "do you like Beatles music?" and "did you like 'Moulin Rouge'?". If the answer is "yes" to both, then they will; if either is "no" they will doubtless hate it. The film is not very original, a very severe criticism to direct at a director like Julie Taymor. I kept flashing on movies I've seen before - Milos Forman's "Hair", "Apocalypse Now", the Monkey's movie "Head", Taymor's "Titus", and of course "Moulin Rouge". (Fortunately, when "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts' Club Band" came to mind, it was only to note that this film was WAY better than that notorious stink bomb.) We haven't gone very far afield from those films here. There could have been some invention on display, and its lack is disappointing. But the film does not deserve the gripes, voiced here, that it is no more than a glorified music video, or is some kind of festival of self-indulgence. To the extent that the film captures, visually as well as thematically, at least the mythology of what the 60s were supposedly about, it can be put down as a success. Just not an enormous one.</fullReview>

Well, it was everything I hoped it would be and more. Across the Universe is amazing. It is a living, breathing work of art. It's abstract and symbolic with an brilliant visual effects. All the sequences with the overlaying images are just--they're just as if you were at a gallery and the pieces came to life and told you a story. I LOVED this film!! It's a wonderful story with a group of fantastic and endearing characters. It is a moving and realistic portrayal of the sixties and its effects on this group of friends and the use of the Beatles' music makes it truly powerful and moving. Everyone should see this film. I believe it will be the best film we'll see this year. It's beautiful, it's definitely going to be a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Romance Enhanced by Great Music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brilliant, exhilarating fusion of Beatles music and lyrics that is enhanced by the romance and political statement of the sixties and cross-cultural perspectives. An exciting musical, art, and solid script that allows the Beatles to resurrect themselves to a new generation. Each word of the Beatles' music comes reverberates with intensity as the characters sing their musical numbers acting out their lives on screen. The seamless, almost timeless universal phrases ring so true, creating a multi-media, multi-dimensional musical sensation. The hallucinatory, music video echoes to the early Beatles movies, "It's A Hard Days Night" and a "Yellow Submarine" but now the music has been transformed into a much more personal and intimate manner. 5/21/12: The biggest problem or weakness of the movie is that the movie can't be described as a masterpiece, perhaps because of the impossibility of integrating every individual Beatles' song into a universally connected movie script on every level. While Across The Universe does interconnect the love story well, there are filaments of the movie that seem to drift off and become tangent to the movie and the overall impact by the end seems to collapse somewhat on upon itself. The fault, of this movie, if any, was it attempted to be a complex classic, putting more effort and ambition then necessary. The producers and scriptwriters, ironically tried too hard, unlike Chicago (2002) or Moulin Rouge (2001), keep it simple or attempt the near impossible by fusing The Beatles with epic romance drama of Dr. Zhivago (1965).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falls Short of Expectation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Across the Universe starts out with a really great concept, and ends up with a poor execution. First of all, it is at its very core: a musical. Musicals suffer from a very strange conundrum in that you are trying to tell a story almost entirely through music. Across the Universe limits itself by only utilizing the music of The Beatles.This must have been an interesting challenge for the writers and I think, over all, they failed. The song choices are great though the situations they were presented in were, at best, strange and, at worst, horribly contrived and forced. Each individual scene and music number was very well done. However, the overall plot of the movie could have done without several of these scenes which too much time was spent on.Additionally, there were far too many characters than were needed. Several of them could have been effectively combined with a little rewriting of the movie itself. For instance, get rid of the lesbian character and change Sadie's name to Prudence. Give her a scene where she has fallen victim to drugs and the "rocker" lifestyle and JoJo leaves her, she's dropped into an overdose induced coma: NOW the friends sing "Dear Prudence" to bring her back. JoJo returns and sings "I Want To Hold Your Hand".Combine Bono's excellent character with the lame revolution leader. NOW you can believe the charisma. Now the pivotal character actually sings in the musical as he leads the revolutionaries on an acid induced pilgrimage as the Walrus.Fire the sad Joe Cocker. Let Eddie Izzard do all that stuff, and keep him around as a "narrator" type character to help tie together lose ends when you decide to cut between fraying plot lines.This movie was disjointed, had spastic timing, the visuals were grossly inconsistent, and, for a musical, it relied too heavily on forced dialog to allow me to enjoy it as a musical. It was filled with wonderful individual moments and scenes, but they just didn't all fit together comfortably.</fullReview>

However, on the downside, during the movie I found myself going "WTF?" often, with seemingly too random things, it was like an acid trip plus one. Another downside was the lack of character-development of the main characters, where as more time was spent of the second-rate characters.

		<fullReview>I've always been a huge fan of The Beatles, and as far as the music and visuals go, this did 'em justice. The casting was spectacular and popularized many unknown actors. The singing, which is what i was most worried about, was exceptional, but thats where the beauty of the movie ends.The character development was lacking. This seemed like a whole bunch of music videos glued together by a very weak storyline. When Jude went back to Liverpool the audience didn't care that his old girlfriend got a new lover, most probably forgot she existed at all. Sadie and JoJo's temporary infidelity was just a mediocre plot device which allowed the writers to cram a few more Beatles songs in there. Prudence was basically a useless character used to force in the song "Dear Prudence", as the story didn't allow the audience to really care for all for her, except for her lesbianism which was mainly shown in the first half of the movie, and she didn't really belong in the climax. Lucy didn't seem to care that her old boyfriend, her first, just died in war as she took Jude as her boyfriend very shortly after.Many of the songs seemed to be forced in Across the Universe, while others were perfectly blended into the story line. the choreography was amazing to say the least, but still at times i felt like i should just walk out of the theatre because of how random the songs were scattered about the film.To sum it up, the movie had great ideas but unfortunately they were poorly executed. There was very little character development, but what everyone came for was the music which was superior to any other musical i can think of. I wouldn't want to see it again, as a lover of a story line and strong plot, but for those of you who want to see a trippy musical i strongly recommend you see this movie at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Across the Universe" captures the cultural explosion of the Beatles era through vivid, powerful and beautiful sights and sounds. The intersecting story lines begin as seemingly unrelated vignettes that are eventually woven together into a compelling single storyline, with tasty musical selections throughout. The young cast is gorgeous, appealing and believable, and it's a treat to spot the special guest cameos by the likes of Joe Cocker, Eddie Izzard and even Salma Hayek. The fantasy scenes-- some funny, some moving-- are pure art.The trailers really don't do this film justice because they give the impression that the whole movie is nothing but splashy big production scenes. In fact, it is a crazy visual and musical trip, but it has a love story at its core. Very memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Music was good but.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why does every one like this movie?! I saw this movie for my friend's b-day. I asked her b4 we went into the theater "what movie we seeing?" "across the universe." she replied. "all right. cool." But the thing that i never knew was that this movie was a musical. I like some musicals, but not this one. The music was good and the parts when they were singing them were good too. But the movie, as a movie it SUCKED TO HIGH HEAVEN!!! Oh my God! I wanted to rip my face off in the theater, I would rather listen to the soundtrack without seeing the film. The acting was good and so was everything else in the acting. But the movie went no where, it had no plot, it just felt like they were trying to put in as many Beatals hits into a film. The reason i give this movie a 2 rating was b/c my favorite comedian was in the film, Eddie Izzard. That part in the film when he sang Being for the Benifit of Mr. Kite was the only part that was actually cool. But if he wasn't in Across the Universe I would give it a 1 rating. My final conclusion is that this movie wasn't worth a $12 ticket. Not even worth $20 on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, I thought this was awful?but</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I also thought "Hairspray" was awful. So draw your conclusions from that. In fairness, it's the producers that let this project proceed on any given day who are at fault. There is no merit to making this filmStill...the performers are all remarkable. And of course, they're singing some of the best popular music ever written. If you can ignore some of the rest of the stupidity on display, there are great rewards.If you're going to "Mamma Mee-a-fie" the Beatles canon, couldn't you come up with something less inane than this? And if not, copying (in some cases, stealing) the work of others really puts the audience in an uncomfortable position. The people responsible for "Moulin Rouge," "High School Musical," "The Doors," "The Wiz" AND "The Wizard of Oz," "Platoon," "Hair," "Rent," "Grease," "A Hard Day's Night," "Tommy," (although there's nothing as campy fun as Ann-Margaret in a vat of pork 'n beans, "She's So Heavy" comes close) can all claim their work is being, uh, reused here.You'd think someone who is as an original an artist a Julie Taymour could have come up with her own ideas?something besides synchronized bowling? (Now there's a sport the Olympics needs.) I found it offensive to take historical tragedy (like the assassination of Dr. King, the death of soldiers in Vietnam, the Watts riots, the killings at Kent state, the draft protesters, the activities of the Weathermen and Black Panthers, etc.) to score emotional points in a film that's unworthy of any of the material it bastardizes.Most of it made me cringe; some of it was quite effective (the "Let It Be" sequence; "Revolution" is maybe the only song put in its proper context; "Because" is suitably dreamy; "Dear Prudence" is cleverly staged and performed). But you sit there waiting for the next punch in the gut like "When is the awful moment coming when someone says, 'Hey! Jude, ?'?" I don't think you need to name a character Prudence or Jude or Max or Lucy for the songs to work. It assumes, perhaps, we're as stupid as the people who made this. If Taymour and the audience aren't redeemed, the performers are. The Beatles, god bless 'em, can take care of themselves. They're music is not only strong enough to drift across the universe, it can survive tripe like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Across the Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viva la Beatles! We're familiar with the many musicals that have come out of late, either being remade from stage to screen, or updated for today's era, the latest being Hairspray. And a musical made up entirely of songs by the Beatles, but not sung by the Beatles themselves? While it is easy to make a movie based on songs by the "it" group of the time (Spice World anyone?) and starring the singers themselves so that there won't be a nightmare in casting actors who can sing, or worse, start to mutilate the lyrics, how about throwing that mantra out of the window?Across the Universe does exactly that. Who would've thought that the discography of the Beatles, diverse as they may be, could have a multitude of songs chosen, and strung together so nicely that it makes for a coherent musical all through 130 odd minutes of the story? I thought it worked, and worked perfectly, and what came out of it are pretty kooky song and dance sequences that had everything thrown in from slick editing to psychedelic animation. Best of all, the cast members themselves lend their vocals, albeit having the music tweaked a little so that it doesn't sound exactly the same as having a collection of the Beatles' greatest hits being popped into a CD and played ad nauseum.Set during the era of the Beatles themselves, Across the Universe is set mainly across the Atlantic in 60s USA, where the Vietnam War is abound. We're introduced to Jude (convenient name to make you wait up for the inevitable song, as with the other names), played by Jim Sturgess, a Liverpool (heh) dock worker who gets himself to the USA in search of his long lost dad. He meets Max Carrigan (Joe Anderson) with whom he becomes fast friends with, and falls in love with his sister Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood), a schoolgirl who had just lost her first boyfriend to the war.The movie is a simple tale of romance between two lovebirds, and you'd come to expect the usual boy-meets-girl-loses-girl-gets-girl-back routine, but what works is of course, the music by the Beatles. Adding texture and layer to the movie were the various subplots which had another relationship running parallel to that of Jude and Lucy's - their landlady Sadie (Dana Fuchs), who is a rock musician, and her guitarist JoJo (Martin Luther McCoy), as they call Come Together under one big roof, settling in a Bohemien lifestyle, which suits Jude's artistic talents just so nicely. It had plenty of loving, but conspicuously absent, and for the better, is drugs, except for a surreal underwater scene, and some really insane moments inside a big top, complete with wacky animation.What I thought the movie had taken a leaf out of Citizen Dog's was how love progressed and reached the doldrums, against the backdrop of the opposition to the War. While films like Born on the Fourth of July had very powerful statements to make, Across the Universe sort of adopted the stance that Forrest Gump had, with the love of Jude's life joining the opposition cause, much to his displeasure and becomes a barrier, but can't do anything much about it anyway, allowing unnecessary jealousy to come in between them, which became "I told you so".Director Julie Taymor had an excellent cast to work with, not only do they sing well, but they brought out their characters perfectly. Evan Rachel Wood excelled as the teenage wide-eyed schoolgirl to whom we were introduced, who slowly turns to one with steely resolve, Jim Sturgess as the likable English bloke who stands witness to the tumultuous era that the US goes through, and microscopically, turns from a bastardly Dong Juan back home to monogamous Romeo in the US, but the one who takes the cake, is Joe Anderson's Max, who lives life with an immortal, youthful idealism, who goes where the wind takes him, until his dropping out of an ivy league college meant receiving the Draft, in one really hilarious sequence with Uncle Sam.All in, I can't vouch that the story will set to wow, but the songs, thank goodness for the Beatles, more than makes up for the cliché which goes straight through to the end. True Beatles fans will find tons of references not only from the songs, but from the various easter eggs scattered everywhere in the movie. They are really going to have a field day with this one. Viva la Beatles!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Jackson must need money again (he co owns the publishing rights to the Beatles catalog, along with the films distributor Sony to whom he sold a percentage to - hence those Target commercials) This pos also has the nerve to have a "soundtrack album" available. Forget this and go rent some period films, or just put on some real Beatles music and let your mind create the pictures. You'll be glad you did. If your interested in the other historical people in this film, go read the Electric Kool Aid Acid Test by Ken Keesey, and buy some Hendrix albums. Why this even got the green light is beyond me. Oh yea, maybe because music fans today grew up on MTV and need to be shown how to experience music with videos. That and greed. Kill me please.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The makers of this film apparently had absolutely nothing to say, but chose to say it anyways. I had hoped the film would be good, and thought it promising from the development. But this was horrible. Most of the people in my theater were laughing at the film, not because of jokes. Musicals use the songs to advance the plot. In this film, the musical numbers described emotion at best. They rarely had anything to do with anything and were usually not even appropriate for the plot. For instance, "Come Together" has nothing to do with anything depicted in the guitar players arrival to shady NYC. It just has a shady sound to it. That is it. And the Bono and Eddie Izzard numbers? Complete detours from the plot that provide nothing for the rest of the film. It was a nothing of a movie put to Beatles music, which apparently is enough to make it artsy. Easily one of the worst I have seen, on par with "Freddy Got Fingered."</fullReview>

I'm sick of that word, " Master Piece " . Use it when you mean it. How can this be good? How can anyone like this? If your into " Art ", or Beatles rip off music then go ahead and make your day.I read the comments and they all miss the whole point. This movie has no meaning, just colorful sets and ear ripping, crap, degenerate new sucky versions of the classic and original Beatles. This movie makes me sick to my stomach. And the lead actor, I hate him, Paul McCartney wannabe. Prudence? what the hell was that scene anyway? whats it got to do with anything? I hate it I hate it I hate it, and anyone who likes it, you make a bad name for The Beatles. I can go on forever to express my hatred for this awful piece of sh**.Lastly, where the hell is the credit for the Beatles? This movie practically lived off it and not a word of thanks or appreciation to The Beatles? Go to hell Across the Universe. Make a musical out of 50 cent or something next time.</fullReview>

If you saw the previews, read a synopsis, or received a recommendation that caused you to think "that could be terrible" - trust your instincts! If you love the music of the Beatles for what it is, not what it has been interpreted, analyzed, inflated, clichéd, and run through the nauseating filter of unoriginal nostalgia to "be" - avoid this movie like a dead animal in the road. It plays like a Musical-Theater Major's wet-dream. Dramaticized interpretations of over- the-top music numbers, choreography, canned acting, and clichéd plot...oh my! I really wanted to like this film - I wanted "Across the Universe" to rise above the pitfalls of the musical genre as they managed in "Sweeney Todd." And yet, it not only fell right in...it reinforced every single one. This movie has no soul - This movie sucks souls. This movie lacks originality. This movie cheapens every single social movement and era that it portrays. To believe that this pays tribute to the times or the Beatles is to lack any true taste, understanding, or respect for what actually was. Just when you thought that nobody could make the Beatles cornier than Paul McCartney has managed to do these days, "Across the Universe" was released.Excuse me, I need to vomit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite visual invention, it lacks heart and ends up coming off like an expensive piece of pretentious amateur dramatics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Liverpudlian dock worker Jude travels to the US in the 1960's to find his estranged father. Once there he meets Max, which in turn leads him to fall for his sister Lucy. While Lucy and Jude move through the 1960's involved in the peace movement, Max is drafted and ends up in Vietnam.So let me get this straight. I cannot buy The Beatles' music on iTunes but yet somehow permission was given to use that music in this film? If I'm right in that then the message from the owners of the rights is this: access to the original music = bad, music used in corny amateur dramatics = good. I know that is a bit of a simplification but it is difficult to see how this film came about in regards getting the rights to the music it so heavily uses. I can understand why some people love this film because it is visually creative and it aspires to create a large musical and artistic experience in charting America during the 60's and 70's all via the central love story of Jude and Lucy ? few would deny that the film lacks ambition. However ambition is not the making of a film and the problem is here that it is not enough to carry it through all the problems.The film lacks heart. I know many will disagree having been caught up in the creativity of it all but then some people cry and corny school plays so disagreement should not be taken as fact. The characters are one-dimensional and they get lost in the grand sweep of the film. So, OK, perhaps the film is carried on the grand sweep of history and the bigger picture? Well no, because this history is simplified down to Broadway song and dance numbers and none of it has resonance in the way one knows it should. As a result of this the cast are mostly left without anything to work with other than making sure they hit their musical cues and stand in the right spot for the camera. What this ends up meaning is that the entire film feels like high school amateur dramatics where everyone is slightly cheesy but very sincere, the songs are familiar but not as good as the original and the numbers all have a "lots of teeth and glad-hands" feel to them.The film is visually creative in its imagination and its reference points but without heart this again makes it feel am-dram and, in combination with the treatment of the subject, all a bit pretentious. By the end of the film I was grateful for release because it had offered me nothing. I didn't care about the characters, I didn't get drawn into the musical numbers, the sweep of history was delivered with too little meaning and only the pretty pictures distracted me ? but they were hollow as a result of the other failures. Across the Universe is generally well-liked on this site, I genuinely have no idea why because, visuals aside, the film plays like an expensive and pretentious piece of amateur dramatics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surreal, War-Torn Love Story Bridges 33 Beatles Songs in a Most Erratic Manner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the eye-popping clips of this 2007 movie in a preview earlier this year, it became readily apparent that director Julie Taymor has lost none of the visual invention that informs her vivid staging of The Lion King and her Baroque-level approach to 1999's Titus. What I feared most from what I saw was that it would be more like an extended fantasy-laden musical video with the classic Beatles songbook basically providing most of the dialogue. It turns out I am mostly right, though there is a somewhat trite and rather predictable narrative, provided by Taymor and co-screenwriters Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, at the core of the movie. Building a story around thirty-three unrelated Beatles songs is no easy task, and the contrivances are gratefully not as exaggerated as one would expect. At the same time, the characters feel hastily developed to fit the contours of the diverse songs, and most of the resulting performances are not compelling enough to bring it all together in a cohesive manner.Set in the 1960's, the plot revolves around Jude, a working-class bloke from Liverpool going stateside to visit the father he's never met, and Lucy, a product of East Coast privilege who becomes increasingly radicalized after her high school sweetheart dies overseas as the Vietnam War keeps raging on. Jude and Lucy meet through her brother Max, a Princeton undergrad who drops out to live in bohemian style in Greenwich Village but then gets drafted into the military. No surprise that a romance between Jude and Lucy evolves amid the anti-war countercultural movement, including a bus trip through psychedelia. There are other characters in the mix with equally familiar names - Sadie, a raspy-voiced Janis Joplin doppelganger about to break big on the rock music scene; Jo-Jo, her lover and competitor who evokes Jimi Hendrix's looks and individualistic guitar style; and Prudence, a sexually confused Ohio cheerleader who literally comes in through the bathroom window.The love story is strictly by the numbers, but the musical performances can be infectious. Evan Rachel Wood continues to impress even in a role as self-contained as Lucy, and her plaintive rendition of "If I Fell" is surprisingly affecting. The rest are definitely more singers than actors. Jim Sturgess appears to have been cast for his vocal resemblance to Paul McCartney, not a bad reason though he does manage to capture Jude's plot-driven angst with convincing abandon. He gets the lion's share of the classic ballads - "Girl", "I've Just Seen a Face", "Something", "All My Loving", "All You Need Is Love". Joe Anderson delivers a party-hearty "With a Little Help from My Friends" with his Princeton frat brothers and later a somber "Hey Jude" as a postwar-traumatized Max. As budding lesbian Prudence, T.V. Carpio does a doleful version of "I Want to Hold Your Hand" crossing through acrobatic football players during practice. Dana Fuchs brings a soulful thrust to "Helter Skelter", "Why Don't We Do It in the Road?", and "Don't Let Me Down", while Martin Luther McCoy poignantly covers "While My Guitar Gently Weeps".A few of the sequences don't work as well as others, for example, Jude's extended trashing of the protesters' office to the strains of "Revolution", the pin-cushioned strawberries transforming into bombs during the dual-perspective montage of "Strawberry Fields", and the drug-hazed antics of Bono as a Timothy Leary figure on "I Am the Walrus". Some of the more interesting performances come from the surprise guest appearances, such as Eddie Izzard as the ringmaster of a weirdly psychedelic "For the Benefit of Mr. Kite", Carol Woods and Timothy T. Mitchum delivering a powerful "Let It Be" set against the 1967 Detroit riots, and Joe Cocker showing his unmistakable vocal style under three different guises on a rollicking "Come Together". Even Salma Hayek shows up as a coterie of nurses in a roulette-style hospital during "Happiness Is a Warm Gun". There is a very defined audience for this type of confection, and there are more definitive performances of these classic songs elsewhere. At the same time, Taymor has an audacious visual sense well worth experiencing. Proceed with caution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the final credits for this rolled at the Aspen Film Festival tonight, I had to wonder how many people recovering from substance abuse were watching this to relive their glory days of sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll. While I've loved all of Taymor's previous projects, particularly the under-appreciated "Titus," "Universe" for me suffers from a very thorough study of the high points and styles of the 1965 - 1969 period without the benefit of much depth. She also samples extremely intelligently (and therefore extremely derivatively) from "Rent," "Moulin Rouge," Monty Python (her animation leans far more towards MP than her usual excellent work), late '80s-era MTV, and even "Forrest Gump." The actors are all terrific, the design and colors are fantastic, but the end result is one more plasticized remnant of a handed-down '60s experience. And why in the world the songs picked rely so heavily on "Abbey Road" and "The White Album," and without a single nod to "Revolver" or all that many to "Sgt. Pepper" is beyond me. Thank God the climax is a NYC-transfered re-enactment of The Beatles' famous rooftop performance and not our long lost lovers finding themselves at Woodstock. I would have been forced to watch the Rolling Stones 1970 documentary "Gimme Shelter" until that poisonous '60s saccharine had been flushed away.</fullReview>

The war was depicted effortlessly, the 60's era was portrayed extremely accurately, and the realness in the emotions of each actor was amazing. When I first saw the preview for Across the Universe, back in the summer, I knew i wanted to see it the day it comes out. So I did and could not be more pleased with what I saw.

		<shortDescription>Where is the Essence of this Movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When looking at movies, sometimes you have to be willing to suspend your normal conventions and accept something totally off the wall. It is no doubt this reaction that Julie Taymour is looking for with her film "Across the Universe." When watching the trailers, I got a feeling that this film was, at its essence, a film about the protest movement of the 70's, and the free spirits that fueled this movement. Well, having watched it, I have to say that I don't have that sense anymore. In fact, I'm not sure what, at its essence, this film is about.To rehash the plot as I saw it, a young Englishman named Jude ventures over to the USA in search of the father he never knew...the father who as a soldier left his mother with "a bun in the oven," and never saw her again. When he makes it to the USA, he finds out that his father is a janitor who has a wife and children. On this, one could feel for Jude.Then, through "fate," Jude meets a privileged jerk named Max who, having whacked a golf ball through the window of some other students, looks to hide so that he doesn't have to face the consequences of his actions. Privileged jerk is the ONLY thing that seems to sum up Max, though in spite of the obvious differences in their character, Jude and Max become friends.The reality is that this "friendship" is only a smoke screen to bring Lucy into Jude's radar. You see, even though he has a girlfriend in England who he promises to write, once Lucy comes on the scene, Jude forgets all about his girlfriend, and decides to carve out a new life for himself in New York with Lucy.Max is drafted into the army, and tries to get out of serving by telling them he's a "cross dressing homosexual with a spot" on his lung (put there by swallowing a cotton ball), however he is unsuccessful and this prompts Lucy (who lost her first boyfriend to the Vietnam war) to take up a protest cause. And Jude, who once told Lucy that he loved Max, becomes jealous of Lucy's relationship with protest leader Paco.Inject into all of this a litany of images, overexposed colors, colorful characters and the number of times one feels like this is all supposed to be a drug induced haze runs practically from the beginning right through to the end of the movie."Across the Universe" is undoubtedly a musical, looking to work 60's and 70's music over and over into the action of the story. It is impossible not to make comparison's with the other musical released this year, "Hairspray," and yet the truth is that for all the "ground breaking visuals" that Taymour concocts, the film is no where near as fun as "Hairspray," and no where near as effective. The dancing that made sense in "Hairspray" doesn't make near as much sense here! So what does it have going for it? Well, lots of pretty, pretty people, and lots of colorful characters. Jude's first compliment to Lucy is that she has perfect teeth, however so does he. The funny thing is that he shouldn't have perfect teeth- he's neither rich enough to see a dentist on a regular basis, nor disciplined enough (i.e. he's a smoker) to make any sense of his appearance.Jude is also so judgmental of his father for abandoning his mother, however he does pretty much an even more selfish thing in abandoning his girlfriend to carve out some living in the USA, which he technically didn't have a right to do.After having sat through "Across the Universe" for 90 minutes, I'd finally had enough and walked out. If what you're looking for in a film is the feel of an acid trip, then perhaps this is the film for you. If not, I'd recommend you try another film: "Hairspray."</fullReview>

The costumes, sets, and images were very impressive, but it felt like the creators of this film spent too much time making it look good and forgot to work on this story.I happen to like movie/musicals, or whatever you call them, when the characters sing their lines. Being a HUGE Beatles fan this was a no brainer. I was 100% positive I'd love this movie. I didn't. I actually felt bored. The story supposedly was to capture the feel of that era and use song to tell the story. The songs one after the other just didn't seem to make sense. It felt just completely plugged in there serving no purpose; "dear prudence" and the obligatory "hey jude" (which of course was the title characters name).The story itself; the rich family with the passionate daughter protesting the war after her boyfriend is killed and her drop out brother is drafted and her English boyfriend who is a man without a country, and lacks purpose or direction. It all just seems extremely tired. If you want to see (in my opinion) an amazing, fun, and interesting Movie/musical about this time rent "Hair". It's fun, it tells a great story, and the soundtrack is amazing and moves the story forward. The songs are placed appropriately and seem necessary to tell the story and move it forward.I give credit to Taymar for creating a beautiful film, but it just wasn't a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I can say is I am in awe of the high rating of this film... Seems like it tried hard to be another Moulin Rouge and just fell totally flat on its face. I tried to just sit back and watch this with and open mind but it was just a hodge podge mess of a film. The characters lacked depth and warmth. In the end you do not care much if they get together or not you just want the movie to end already. Terrible movie.... I enjoyed Frida that at least had some feeling and depth to it. This was just a shallow mess that had a lot of potential but did not make it there. If you are looking for a good movie to sit down and enjoy I advise you look elsewhere. I wish I could get those two and a half hours of my life back... LAME</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TIFF07, review 2: Either learn French or die?Across the Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Julie Taymor's film Across the Universe has been high up on my most anticipated list for a year now. Taking classic and lesser-known Beatles' tunes, she has crafted a contemporary musical about a group of young adults at the turning point of life during the start of the Vietnam War. While highly ambitious and oftentimes gorgeous to behold, the film ultimately ends up being a failed attempt at genius. Visually stunning, almost every sequence assaults your eyes with beauty and unique splendor. Unfortunately, Taymor may have fallen victim to excess. Trying to jampack every character ever used in their music becomes overkill, adding scenes that add nothing to the story but a way to add more songs.By gleaning each name she could use as a character, Taymor finishes with mixed results. While it worked for Lucy, an effective Evan Rachel Wood; Jude, relative newcomer Jim Sturgess in a great turn as our lead; and Max, Joe Anderson with the best performance of the film, it was too strained for others like Mr. Kite and Dr. Roberts. Sure Bono is fantastic as the psychedelic Roberts, but his sole purpose in the movie is to get the crew over to Kite, who, while played nicely by Eddie Izzard, is totally unnecessary in the grand scheme of things. Along with these moments is a scene that introduces Martin Luther McCoy as JoJo, a guitar player getting away from the tragedies at home. A perfect example of how uneven the film is, this sequence involves a pimp and his whores singing along to "Come Together." Sure the choreography is great, but the pimp is just plain awkward staring into the camera with a stoic face as JoJo keeps walking away. It isn't all a waste, though, because the moment when he walks down the street, through a mob of clone-like worker bees, is fantastic to behold. How she could ruin moments of shear brilliance with those of gaudy frivolities is beyond me. Even when taking the lyrics literally with "I Want You (She's so Heavy)" comes a number that is truly stunning. Having Uncle Sam hijack Max's life, culminating into the troops carrying the Statue of Liberty is somewhat breathtaking if not entirely heavy-handed.It is also this anti-war imagery that causes a bit of a problem. If Taymor kept with the strict stance throughout, I wouldn't have minded so much. A film can go against my beliefs on subjects as long as it is honest with it's own motives. What goes wrong here is the fact that we are allowed a glimpse into a single moment with Lucy and her reactionary boss that completely subverts the peace over violence mantra. By allowing such an easy scene just squeeze in so that the story can smoothly transition into the eventual climax is both lazy and hypocritical. The emotions and viewpoints that Lucy and Jude hold so close to their hearts are too easily changed, but I guess all you need is love.Right from the start we experience what is in store. After our entry-point with Jude on the beach, introducing Lucy's character?very reminiscent of Ewan MacGregor's opening from Moulin Rouge!?comes a lovely collaged montage of waves rumbling over scenes to occur later on in the film. These waves are layered with newspaper clippings helping to give an overview of the political barometer of the time period. After this is a nice juxtaposition of Lucy, Jude, and Prudence's lives as they start their journey in their hometowns, ultimately bringing them together in New York City. It is the event that begins JoJo's trek that solidified my enthrallment into the film and eased me into a wondering at what could happen next. Unfortunately, the scene of prostitutes follows and jarred me out of my trance, making me conscious of the horrible along with the beautiful.All the acting is above average, if not superb, and the set pieces meticulously orchestrated. Despite the seemingly shoddy CGI work at times, especially during an underwater/above the water sequence, the visuals are spectacular. Julie Taymor needs credit for the imagination and fearless mentality to even attempt what she has. Before the film, she spoke about how Evan Rachel Wood was 17 at the time they filmed. Turning 20 a few days ago, the movie finally sees the light of day. A lot of work went into the final project and it shows. It is just a shame that the film's ambitions outweigh what actually shows up on screen?a whole that doesn't succeed past the sum of its parts. In the end, even though a disappointment in overall execution, those parts that work are a sight to behold and highly worth experiencing on the big screen, especially having the opportunity to see the world premiere at the Toronto Film Festival.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I may be the only one, but I wasn't impressed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought Across the Universe was alright, but seriously, nothing to rave about. I felt it dragged on for too long, some of the songs were totally irrelevant to the plot, and almost every actor except for the main 3 were totally pointless, especially Prudence and Bono's character. The acting and singing were both fantastic, but I always get super annoyed when anyone tries to sing Beatles songs. Why mess with perfection? This film also got away with quite a bit for being PG-13... Drugs, nudity, language, etc. It seems to glorify drug use, which I find ignorant. All in all, I felt that this movie would have been much better if they had just gone with the story and not turned it into a musical. Maybe someday I'll come to appreciate more but for now, I'm not impressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed Feelings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just seen the movie, and I came out with very mixed feelings.I think that in this day and age, the traditional "movie musical", where folks keep suddenly bursting into song at odd moments, no longer works. "Chicago" dealt with this problem by putting all the musical numbers into fantasy sequences. "Moulin Rouge" made the whole film look more like a stage play then a movie. Because film has a tendency to "literalize"--in real life I can't walk down a street singing a Beatles song and then suddenly find all the passersby joining in. I think in "Across the Universe" often the musical numbers worked better when the characters were actually performing on stage, or tripping on drugs. But usually (not always, but usually) it seemed awkward when at other times the characters would just start singing in their "normal life". There were times towards the beginning of the film when the songs were so embarrassing I felt like walking out, but gradually the film pulled me in after I stuck with it.Yes, every character is named after a Beatles song. Every time I heard a character's name, I cringed. Because I was afraid that somehow they were going to try to incorporate all those songs into the plot. Thankfully, the only two of these "name" songs that are actually sung are "Dear Prudence" and, yes, "Hey Jude". And these two were not too badly performed (although "Hey Jude" does seem to have all the inhabitants of a Liverpool neighborhood joining in, but at least we are spared too many of the "Nahs"). Additionally, they save "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" for the closing credits.Covering a song is always difficult, because there is always going to be a comparison with the original performance. And sometimes the film's songs are far shot of the original, but sometimes the cover version is quite successful. I think that Eddie Izzard's performance of "For the Benefit of Mr. Kite", which basically becomes a Taymor-designed-and-directed music video, may have been worth the price of admission itself. Bono's cover of "I am the Walrus" is also a high point--Bono also sings "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" in the closing credit. But, for example, I thought the performance of "I want you/she's so heavy" to be a low point, the "I want you" sung by Uncle Sam and caricatured recruiting sergeants (who "want" the young men for Vietnam), the "she's so heavy" referring to Lady Liberty (!).This has all the characters you expect to find in a film set in the Hollywood version of "the sixties". There is the kid who drops out of college to move to Greenwich village, there is the bohemian artist, there is the guitarist strongly reminiscent of Jimmy Hendrix, the female singer who I think is supposed to at least slightly suggest Janis Joplin, there is more than one young man who is drafted to Vietnam, (with the obligatory "medical examination" scene) there is the daughter of middle class parents protesting the war, plus one or two drug gurus reminiscent of Timothy Leary. In some ways, there are too many characters to give them all proper development and still have room for the songs. I would have liked to know a lot more about the character of "Prudence" who seems to have an interesting story of her own, that we are told very little about. Also the relationship between the characters played by Dana Fuchs and Martin Luther McCoy was not very detailed.Plus the usual supporting cast of assorted war protesters, hippies, beatniks, soldiers in Vietnam, and phalanxes of policemen. There is marijuana and LSD, together with the obligatory imagery that feels like a groovy acid trip, and imagery that feels like a really bad acid trip. We've seen it all before, and I don't know that this film has anything new to tell us about this period of history.Go see the film just because some of the performances of Beatles songs are quite good, I thought that although Fuchs and McCoy weren't given much to do with their characters they both did a good job of making the songs they were given "their own". But you will have to also sit through some performances that are almost painful. Maybe your choices about best songs and worst songs will be different from mine, but I don't think anyone will leave saying that the film maintains a consistent high quality throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Hour Glorified Music Video</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the worst I've seen all year. The singing is fine, they did justice to every Beatles song they covered, and the filming of every song was very lovely to watch, so why didn't they just stick with that? The plot that they shoved in between the many songs was contrived and one dimensional. Every character was a bad 60's stereotype and there was little character development for anyone to even care. This is most notable in the fact that there are several characters whos origins, point in the film, and even names (which were all names from Beatles songs, so the joke got old after the 4th or 5th time), aren't revealed until after they sing a few songs that have no relevance to the movie (except, of course, that they're Beatles songs). Some "characters" were introduced just to throw out another song reference, and that was their entire role.But what was most aggravating to me was that it didn't follow the one simple rule of musicals. The songs that are sung must advance the plot. In Across The Universe, the story line would halt, a song would be sung, and then the story line would pick up again where it had been left off. (The only exception is "Revolution" and "I Want You"...but we're talking 30 songs here) I understand that this is a little harder to do when the songs that are being sung wern't written specifically for the musical, but I know it can be done. Songs from Moulin Rouge were almost entirely covers, and the Broadway musicals Mamma Mia and Movin' Out are sung entirely of ABBA and Billy Joel songs, respectively. If someone can make an entire cohesive musical out of ABBA songs then using Beatles music should have been a no brainer.Although I think thats the problem. Taymor knows that it's the Beatles, so no matter what you do to it, it'll be a hit. You don't need a brain to figure that one out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought his movie would never end. It took forever to develop any plot whatsoever, and when it looked as though the film was over, it kept going and going. If you aren't a Beatles fan, or even a casual listenerof their music, you'll miss the contrived dialog to suit the film's needs. This film was very disjointed. It's almost as if Eddie Izzard (whom I love) went to the producers and demanded to be in the movie, so they created a scene with him as Mr. Kite...no relevance to the film at all, like wise Bono's appearance. It seemed that way with many of the songs, simply throwing them in there for the sake of throwing them in there.Some of the songs were well done, I'll grant the film that..."Hold me Tight" (an understated gem by the Beatles) and "Let it Be" come to mind, although I think copying the Beatles rooftop concert from "Let it Be" was lame.Some people went in to this thinking "Sgt. Pepper". I came out thinking "Tommy".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Movies of all Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie musicals are almost always great, but it takes real talent to make an amazing musical like Hairspray, High School Musical 2, Moulin Rouge, or Rent. Across the Universe is one of the best musicals I've seen, becoming a stand-out with some of the best performances and songs in modern film. Director Julie Taymor takes all of these modern clichés and makes everything feel sparkling new. Many things in the film have been done before and in drastically different ways, but never have they come out so perfectly and consistently as in Across the Universe. The movie stars relatively unknown actors, but that is why it works so well. Every actor or actress is simply made for the role that they have been given, and such energy flows through the production that you'd be surprised how great things turn out to be. Evan Rachel Wood stars as Lucy, Jim Sturgess stars as Jude, and Joe Anderson plays Max.Across the Universe tells the story of Jude and Lucy, who meet during the 1960's during times of war and crisis, and each of them have separate desires regarding the war, some of which tear them apart. Nevertheless, the two fall completely head-over-heels for each other and must face the hardships that threaten to ruin their relationship.This film utilizes each song in such a beautiful and seamless fashion that in some cases, you forget that you're listening to Beatles songs that have been reworked, sometimes even with different tunes or melodies. Songs such as 'Strawberry Fields Forever' and 'I am the Walrus' are given luscious and trippy on-screen representations that only makes you appreciate how wonderful the Beatles music really is. Also, there are a few cameos, such as Bono in one of the best scenes in the movie.The cinematography and visuals are probably the best thing about the movie, including the underwater sequence and a crazy scene with Mr. Kite (played by Eddie Izzard). Director Julie Taymor has such a rich vision of the 60's, and she does a great job of bringing it to the big screen. None of the scenes are bland or plain; every shot is unique in some way as song after song is released upon the audience in a spectacular fashion. She captures almost every important political aspect of the 60's briefly, almost making the film a huge collage of 60's references accompanied by an absolutely incredible plot. The visuals are just absolutely insane and revolutionary, and even some of the most minor touches work so effectively. This is the type of film that really pushes the limits of art and creativity and makes something that seems so fresh and new.Another great thing about watching Across the Universe was being witness to the great vocals and acting of the leads. Even the most minor characters like Prudence and Mr. Kite really stand out. Jim Sturgess is, by far, the best up-and-comer in the cast, with a really smooth and flowing voice and lots of charisma. He makes the character of Jude, which could be rather dull and boring under other circumstances, almost instantly likable and very appealing. Evan Rachel Wood is also perfectly cast as Lucy, and she is simply gorgeous in almost all of her scenes. Her on-screen chemistry with Sturgess is nothing short of perfect.Across the Universe is not just a flashy, character-driven romance piece; its design, visuals, acting, and script elevate it to such a higher level than that. The film is basically an instant classic that is very difficult not to like, and its music transcends the film and makes you really feel for the characters and what they're going through. The movie takes some old content and makes it new. Across the Universe perfectly captures the mood and feel of the 60's almost so much so that you feel as if you're living in them. It feels like a revolutionary movie, with all the makings of a cult classic, and yet even that is not giving it enough credit. Oprah is simply raving about this movie, and it has received mostly positive reviews from the critics, especially Roger Ebert, who says that Across the Universe is "an audacious marriage of cutting-edge visual techniques, heart-warming performances, 1960s history and the Beatles songbook," and he gives the movie 4 stars. If you like the Beatles in any way, shape, or form, you absolutely have to see this movie. A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is a hotchpotch of stylistic borrowings, narrative misfires and, it must be said, some arresting visual delights but (and it's a big but...), in setting the movie against a background of of US anti-Vietnam war radicalism and drug culture, Taymor's movie paradoxically contrives to present a version of the 60s in which the Beatles didn't exist! As though the entire Beatles oeuvre had somehow emerged spontaneously from the American 60s youth experience! In so doing, the film makers, including the British screenwriters, Clement and LaFrenais, have unwittingly created a piece of American cultural imperialism no less insidious than the US military imperialism they seek, in part, to depict. Ironic, eh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best parts were in the previews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Visually this movie was amazing, but I had to give it a lower rating because every other element was lacking. The story was thin, and the various characters' journeys barely held together. There was so little character development that I didn't care at all what was going to happen to them. I'm a big fan of musicals, and I love The Beatles, but the story should come first. Several of the songs didn't seem to fit. It felt like they were just plopped in there and connected to the plot by the thinnest thread possible. They didn't flow well either. In a good musical, you aren't jarred by the fact that a song just started. Here, they would pause, then the intro music would start, and I would immediately think, "Oh, they're going to sing another song now." Also, for a musical, I didn't like most of the singing. There were only two voices that I really liked. This, however, is personal preference, and I'm sure others will debate which singers they preferred.On the plus side, as I said at the beginning, the visuals were amazing. If you've seen the previews, you've already seen the best of them. Watching the full sequences is fun, though. Each sequence has a completely different style, so you're bound to find at least a few that will blow you away.In summary, if you're looking for a creative and artistic movie, look no further. If you're looking for a movie with compelling characters and a story line that will draw you in, you might want to go elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not all bad, but not great either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People seem to either be in the camp of "I love the Beatles, therefore this movie is brilliant", or "I love the Beatles, therefore this movie is a bastardization." I enjoy the Beatles, but don't believe that they can do no wrong (I have 7 words for you: Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite. Does anyone really like that song? Really?). I went in hoping for something dazzling and trippy ala Moulin Rouge.The problem is: Moulin Rouge selected songs that would forward its plot, whereas Across the Universe forced songs in where they had no business being; Bono and Eddie Izzard both really got into their characters, as hackneyed as they were, but their scenes were long, pointless, and entirely derailed the plot of the movie. No matter how much I liked a scene, after that interminable foray into psychedelia, I just didn't care anymore.Judging from the trailer, I expected this to be visually stunning. However, the slick CG effects really clashed with the gritty lighting and intimate camera angles. It was like special effects brought to you by the guy who invented the Pink Floyd laser show.That said, this was still overall a fun watch, just not an ingenious one. There are good jokes and great vocal performances, but it suffered from lack of a solid plot and, frankly, lame effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing the trailers and overall score of the film, and predisposed to supporting musicals I saw the film eager to enjoy an application of art that was fresh and did not rely on the "indie" label as its proof of originality.The overall acting and visual impact were excellent but the drawback came from their devotion to only songs written by the Beatles. This heavily detracted from the Aural enjoyment which was the third leg. Why make a Beatles myopic when so much great music is available from that or any period? The storyline started very well, but towards the late middle the religious devotion to only Beatles songs led the story astray causing scenes that stopped enhancing the film.I love Beatles music. Some of the songs were very appropriate TO THE MOVIE while others were just thrown in to fill time. WHY? Why not always use the appropriate song for the movie? Seems a very simple idea that the filmmakers forgot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Across The Universe" A HAIRless Godspell?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Across The Universe" sometimes felt like being caught between a less than dynamic version of the rock musical "Hair" and an updated "urban spaceman's" version of "Godspell" The renditions of songs by The Beatles in "Across The Universe" were conveyed in the confines of the "soul" music genre as T-Bone Burnett arranged them perfectly in, what Yoko Ono would describe as a bevy of action paintings, sometimes but not always beautifully captured by Julie Taymor. The segments that were a joy to embrace at this spectator's first viewing were "Because" and "Come Together" the early songs were done with a sense of Broadway nostalgia ala Grease or Hairspray which lend them to a already developed approach and lackluster style except however for "I Want To Hold Your Hand" sang with a accapella straight forwardness sure to put a smile "on" your heart! But the best "soul" laid open in songs from the "White Album" and "Abbey Road" where the psychedelia of "Sgt. Pepper" period was tainted with overused "trippy" visuals that left to much style unconquered. Although then there is segments like "Let It Be" that mirrored what is now happening in the southern part of America, which brought in a sense of here and now with the "Vietnam" vehicle used to depict that war is always such a "ugly" word! There were songs that also misfired such as the "Uncle Sam" recruitment influence of "I Want You (She So Heavy) which in my opinion should have stuck with the original intent being a song about romantic obsession and used as such for after all the two leads demanded such attention to tell their love story, although "Something" was sung with such bravado and intensity! The editing was sometimes a little lethargic, but pick up with such velocity with segments such as "Oh Darling", "Helter Skelter" and the brilliant "Revolution" that left the rapid fire cuts blazing in your head long after the last "Alright" was shouted! The animations for "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite" were very well done, and Eddie Lizzard was perfect for the song, but however the ad-libs fell sort of a Lennonesque biting wit, which certainly Mr. Lizzard is capable of! All in all in all the music proved once again to be timeless, if only used in this single musical format. Perhaps later in the evolvement of The Beatles legacy a few more musical genres can be or will be tackled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as the mini-genre goes, better than "Sgt. Pepper," "Tommy," and "All This and World War Two," not as good as "Moulin Rouge." Closest in feel &amp; structure to "Tommy," down to the rockstar cameos (Joe Cocker &amp; Bono vs. Elton John &amp; Tina Turner) and bursts of psychedelia.Way too long. Suspect the critics are falling all over this because it's directed by Taymor, rather than for its intrinsic merits. The whole is not equal to some of the pieces.Plot is inconsequential and a cliché. Probably could have shaved off quite a bit of time by ditching all the dialogue and just leaving the music - it's not as though it would be too difficult to follow without spoken exposition.As a way of marketing Beatle music to a younger demographic, it seemed to work at the theatre in which I saw it. Teens and twenty-somethings seemed to be discussing it on the way out more than boomers (my age group).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had such a cool concept and lots of great hype, but my 4 friends and I, all being big Beatles fans, were thoroughly disappointed. The plot was so predictable and cheesy, and the acting was really nothing impressive except for Jim Sturgess, who was actually pretty decent. But really, who sings and fights at the same time? The main characters fall in love way too quickly and without real reason. When they get to California on Bono's bus, it makes no sense at all...they talk about going back to California, but they are already there?!? Some scenes were so cheesy that the whole theater was giggling despite the intent for a "dramatic" moment in the film, i.e. the moment near the end when Jude sees Max in the bar mirror singing to him. So clichéd. And the idea of the police officers dragging Sadie and her band off the rooftop but then letting Jude stay to sing to Lucy? Come on. So ridiculous it made everyone in the theater groan. There were some cool cinematic moments and of course the music was good, but the rest of the movie was a jumbled mish mash of psychedelic special effects, a weak and clichéd plot line, and bad acting. If you must see it, at least save your money and wait for it to come out on DVD.</fullReview>

"why did Prudence leave Ohio?" "Why did Prudence leave New York?" "How did Lucy know where to call Jude's father to get him out of Jail?" "How the hell did Jude return the USA after being deported?" the whole movie was unrealistic, confusing, tons of plot holes, not worth the hype, utter waste of time.it's a shame though, we needed a good movie about Vietnam and the happenings during the 60's. i'd appreciate a movie like that more, than this trash that really had no story. i can't even tell you what the film was about if my life depended on it.</fullReview>

I tried to watch this movie, my wife rented it and i had no idea regarding its content....but after about five minutes of this movie it felt like some long car ride listening to "Breakfast with the Beatless." MORE beatle crap!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frustration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is awful, simply because I HAVE NOT SEEN IT. They wont play it in Omaha where I live and I am furious. I don't know why as I know tons of people here who want to see it, but in order to do so we have to drive 3 hours to the closes city that is playing it. Im not about to do that for a movie. so why the heck is this movie NOT playing everywhere? And furthermore, Omaha is in the top 50 biggest cities in the U.S. so if they are just playing it in major cities, then how come some smaller cities than Omaha are playing it? Also, we have an AMC here in Omaha, which plays independent movies all the time, it is required to, and they aren't even playing it there. Someone please explain why they won't play the movie here? I really don't want to have to wait until it comes out on DVD to see it because by then I'm sure someone will have ruined it all. And that is months away anyways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killing the Immortal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the previews for this movie, all I could think about was the great potential there was to make a great movie using The Beatles songs as a basis. As The Beatles are my favorite band, I became excited to see a movie that was supposed to give an artistic vision to the time period in which they created. What I got was a piece of garbage. It seems impossible to the mere mortal to imagine any scenario under which Beatles songs could be made bad. All you need is good singers and the songs are such classics that they cannot be destroyed. Wrong! These idiots took a bad combination of Beatles songs, threw them together, and selected the wrong parts of individual songs, and tried to form a plot. No one told them that you can't put a plot together by simply using bits of songs. Sometimes, you need to have an original idea that flows as a story. The first thirty minutes put a legitimate setup together for a good story. Then the writers must have said "screw it" and just thrown together a bunch of songs they liked and decided that if they made up some artsy scenes, it would pass for a message. What they made was a bunch of nonsense scenes full of painted people, costumes, and crap. Pick a Beatles song from this movie, any song, and I guarantee you these morons screwed it up. Like "Hey Jude"? Well just wait until you see how they murdered it. Think the rooftop concert was a genius piece of pop culture? Well get ready to cry. If Paul McCartney or Ringo Starr sat down and saw this thing, I think they might go on a murdering rampage. Let it be known that nothing about this movie is better than 2 hour acid trip while listening to the Beatles and being repeatedly beaten. As for people who liked this, just go kill yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I walked out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is only the second movie I have ever walked out on. The first was Orca the killer whale. I love the Beatles and I grew up in those times. This was a gorgeous, yet tedious, experiment, and a really, really bad idea.The Beatles songs don't tell a story they are a soundtrack to a story of a time. To try and make the songs serve the dramatic ends of the trite and predictable story line was laughable.On the other hand, the special effects and the staging were surrealistic and imaginative. The actors were, of course, young and appealing. so that's a plus. Break this up into music videos and maybe it can be watched one number at a time on home video.Here in Chicago it should be a hit at the local night club movie viewing venue , the Brew and View where you can drink beer and scream things at the movie screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't bother crossing this universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry. Because the sky is blue."Staring at a blue sky for two hours is almost required viewing to settle your mind from the visually lost schizophrenia that is Julie Taymor's ACROSS THE UNIVERSE. How else can you undo the damage from being subjected to an exhaustingly lengthy collage of overblown imagery at the hands of an over inflated ego? I can only imagine the horror that must have swept over the executives' faces after screening this film for the first time. It has been widely publicized that Taymor entered a creative war over the final cut of this film with her producers who wanted to release their own cut of the film. They said the film needed more focus, less experimenting as she hid behind the shield of artistic integrity. Ordinarily, I would never side with any form of censorship but perhaps she should have left her bias in the car and taken a few of the tips that were perhaps being given to her in the best interest of her film. Maybe then, ACROSS THE UNIVERSE could have told a functional story that would have captured some attention, given it some ultimate meaning and made this all-Beatles musical the magical journey it so desperately wanted to be and could have been. Or maybe it would have been worse but I can't see how.ACROSS THE UNIVERSE tells the story, and I say that lightly, of a young lad named Jude (Jim Sturgess), who travels across the ocean to find his father. Find him he does in absolutely no time and then he just bounces around from here to there in pursuit of nothing at all. He meets a girl (Evan Rachel Wood) and falls in love; he gets a room in New York City and paints when everybody else is either going to war in Vietnam or protesting it. A bevy of other characters are randomly introduced, bring nothing to the whole (which is paper thin as it is) and then disappear after accomplishing just as much nothing. It is all so aimless; I'm surprised my neck doesn't hurt more from all the shaking my head did in bewilderment. The style, which can only be described as a refusal to commit to any one style, only makes it more difficult to get taken in. As a viewer, the suspended disbelief necessary to enjoy a musical as one should still requires a firm foundation. Taymor tries to establish a gritty reality with Jude working the docks in Liverpool but the leap to where the music happens, and the magic is supposed to, is always different and seldom seems appropriate. I never thought I would be begging for plausibility in a musical but this was just ridiculousWhile I commend Taymor for incorporating 90% on-location singing into this musical in an attempt to pump a more real quality into the practice, I want to sit her down to talk about some other basic concepts like character, meaning and purpose (concepts she so easily incorporated into her far superior FRIDA). Surely she has seen Baz Luhrmann's MOULIN ROUGE. Luhrmann's film employed the same musical technique to appropriate existing lyrical content (including some by the Beatles) and contextualize it within his story of forbidden lovers,. The reason his film worked is because there was a solid story driving it forward and characters that were developed through that story and their songs. ACROSS THE UNIVERSE seems more interested in its high concept usage of the Beatles repertoire that characters seem to be included so that certain songs can be included. It is certainly lovely to see a young high school cheerleader sing a slowed down version of "I Wanna Hold your Hand" to herself about a fellow cheerleader, just as it is heartbreaking to watch a young boy caught in the streets of the Detroit riots singing "Let It Be" amidst the violence but both of these potentially powerful moments and strong performances are hollowed out by their complete lack of context. How can you be expected to care when you have no idea why this story is suddenly being told? And then to find out, there was really no significant point to begin with? Without purpose, all you have are a bunch of people singing old songs on screen.At one point, more specifically when multiple Selma Hayek's in nurse uniforms seductively administered drugs to war patients spinning around a medical ward to "Happiness Is a Warm Gun," I found myself wondering just how many Beatles songs were still left to be sung. When a film has no distinct purpose, it also has no clear ending in sight. I was beginning to fear that Taymor might actually turn me off the Beatles with this disaster but fortunately, the Beatles are timeless and genius and something so laughable as ACROSS THE UNIVERSE is not going to diminish their beauty. It's like bearing witness to a bad karaoke performance of your favorite song; you cringe while it's happening but once you hear it again for yourself, the mastery that was temporarily taken from it comes back in waves of vibrant colour and splashes of insight that touch your soul. The painful experience is easily forgotten and you ask yourself, across what universe?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Good to Be True</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Across the Universe seemed like a dream come true at first; a movie all about the Beatles, encompassing the drugs, the life, the revolution. But, the dream was too good to be true. This movie tried its best, but I don't think any of us could come out saying the movie did the Beatles justice.The movie by itself is definitely an interesting piece and should not be thrown aside with the other failed attempts (See "Sargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"). The characters (most of them) were pretty well developed, although some of them just seemed like they were there to throw in some references to the songs. The singing was pretty good, although some of the songs were just a bit... they really were there once again for the sake of having Beatles tunes in the movie.I think "Across the Universe" had two choices: be a Beatles movie just for the sake of Beatles in the movies, or be a real, quality motion picture. It tried too hard to be a bit of both, and although I hate to say it, that's just too good to be true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See It For The Music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Across the Universe in a preview in Union Square last night. Needless to say, I was absolutely psyched for it. Unfortunately, it wasn't quite up to par. It tries to be both Moulin Rouge and Forrest Gump, and it fails at both. The acting isn't especially good either, nor did I find the visuals to be particularly inspired. However, I would recommend you see it anyway- for the music.The songs in Across the Universe are absolutely amazing. There are one or two that seemed to fall a little flat (Guitar Gently Weeps) and some that were dragged out (Hold My Hand, I Am The Walrus), but for the most part, fresh takes on classics done in a generally rather minimalist style, which is accentuated by the wonderful vocals.Keep in mind, when you go to see Across the Universe, you'll be seeing a fantastic series of music videos connected by a weak plot. Also on the negative side, every lyric of the song is literally performed on the screen, which seems rather forced. See it, but be warned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>:Recycled "Hair"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one is also out in some parts of the country today, rest of the country by the end of the month. Been there, seen this. It's called "Hair." As if we need yet another anti-war movie, like "Hair" this is a musical using Beatles songs. It takes place during the Vietnam war, and the message is that America's wars are bad, America sends its boys to die and get maimed, and we need spoiled, rich left-wing activists to show us the way. Hmmm . . . sound familiar. It's called Hollywood.Marilyn Manson's girlfriend, Evan Rachel Wood plays Lucy, a young girl from a rich family who loses her boyfriend, killed serving in Vietnam. She drops out of school, moves to New York, and becomes an anti-war activist. She also falls for an illegal alien from Britain, Jude. He's the illegitimate son of an American World War II vet who is now a janitor at Princeton. We follow Jude, Lucy (surprise!--the convenient namesakes of Beatles songs), and her brother, who drops out of Princeton and tries to dodge the Vietnam draft--all through a musical journey, which celebrates the '60s counterculture. Because we all know the '60s brought us such great stuff like AIDS, rampant polygamous relationships, drugs, and failed everything. Also features two characters apparently modeled on Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix, and equally as brain-addled.Aside from the plot, equally annoying is the cameo by Bono, who really belonged in that decade and out of ours.Although the singing and sets in this movie are well done (and I'm no musical devotee), the anti-war message grows tinny and tired. What was a 2.25-hour movie seemed like more than four hours.- Debbie Schlussel</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was ready to get up and leave after 10 minutes of this overdone pretentious piece of garbage. As someone who was part of this historical moment of our history I was put off by Taymor's so called vision. Hey I love musicals as much as the next person, but this this thing was dead on arrival. I didn't even find it visually arresting and what Taymor and the actor's did to the great Beatles music is a crime. I hated most of the scenes, the performances and the script, and it saddens me that the younger generation is going to take this fantasy as fact which is really a shame. So finally after nearly 2 hours of this torture, I left.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tremendous Letdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge Beatles nut, and a big fan of musicals as well. I was really looking forward to this movie. Boy, did it ever drop the ball. Granted, I saw an advance screening, but it was only a week before the movie comes out, and I doubt they'll change anything.There are two major problems with this movie; its plot and its characters. The plot itself is wafer-thin at best. The story is incidental to the music, rather than it being the other way around, like a good musical should. It feels like a succession of music videos with weak segue-ways in between. As a result, several of the songs do absolutely nothing to move the story forward in any way, shape, or form.The characters... The protagonist, Jude, and his love interest, Lucy, are two of the most unlikeable leads since Anakin and Padme. Jude, especially, is really terrible. The film does absolutely nothing to endear him to the audience, and by the end of the movie, I found myself rooting against him.Another character, Prudence, should really have been completely cut from the film. She has no real affect on the plot or any other of the characters, and was really only in the movie to allow them to sing "Dear, Prudence." Early in the film, she sings a VERY slow version of "I Want to Hold Your Hand," and it did nothing but slow the movie down. Every time something happens with her character, more questions arise than are answered.If you're up for seeing some occasionally interesting visuals, and halfway decent covers of Beatles songs, then you MIGHT enjoy this movie. But if you're expecting anything else from it, you will be sorely disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Taymor's work. Frida was amazing. This had it's moments too. But it was quite distracting when ever someone would start singing on screen, and everyone around me in the audience would start squirming. It never failed. Over and over again. Except for the Janis Joplin type character. She was great. And of course, the man, Joe Cocker. People jumped when they saw him! Me too! The young girl singers drudged along, taking, it seemed like forever to sing they're song. It was strange using a Beatle song as a narrative. It was just all those Beatle songs. Like Micheal Jackson needs more money. God forbid Paul write something new and original for the film. It had this Broadway overtone. I hate Broadway. People jumping over stuff, and doing high kicks. I didn't know it was a musical. I wish someone had told me. The trailer implied none of that. I was glad when it was over. As I was walking out of the theater, I kept hearing people say, "What a piece of crap." I didn't feel that, I just felt uncomfortable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad idea (minor spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: The Movie was a bad idea then and it's still a bad idea now. I was waiting for Aerosmith or the Bee-Gees to show up throughout this trash fest. It's a wonder Robert Stigwood wasn't involved in it somewhere. Julie Taymor is a pretentious hack. Frida and Titus pretty much give that away. To make matters worse, she made it so completely derivative of Moulin Rouge it even had a pseudo Nichol Kidman and a pseudo Ewan McGreggor in the lead roles. The most laughable scene was her attempt at making "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" into some kind of personal psychedelic head trip. The scene in Detroit moved like an episode of "Cop Rock". Unless you're a die-hard Beatles fan, it's pretty much an embarrassment of excess. 3 stars for the animated sequences, the rest was pretty much drivel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw a preview screening of this title. It was absolutely shocking that the Beatles would allow their music to be slaughtered in such a way. It was basically High School Musical with what should be a much better soundtrack. The acting, particularly from Evan Rachel Wood and Joe Anderson was terrible. The pacing was completely uneven. The singing was worse than an episode of American Idol. The dialogue was almost laughable. The direction was like watching a blind woman going in circles.However what was the most surprising was that you almost regretted every time a song was used. It was so contrived that people were squirming uncomfortably in their seats. The characters were given strange actions so that the lyrics would fit logically in with the scene.Not recommended for any Beatles fan or for anyone who likes good cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow.Let me just start off by saying that NO self-respecting Beatles fan could possibly enjoy this film. (Notice I say "could" and not "will".)I knew ACROSS THE UNIVERSE would be awful, but I could never have guessed it would be this bad. The idea seemed intriguing, the effects (in the trailer) piqued my interests, and I do feel that Julie Taymor has a definite eye for artistry (even though she's yet to find a good script to direct; and this film is no exception). Plus, I thought that ACROSS THE UNIVERSE might be this year's LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE or American BEAUTY: you know, the film the American IDOL crowd will laud as the next big thing. Well, I wouldn't be surprised if ACROSS gets a few (or more) nods from MTV and the Academy/GG, but it's more MOULIN ROUGE than anything else.Obviously, the songs in the movies are all covers--this is to be expected--but I had no idea that it would be a wall-to-wall smorgasborg of mediocre actors doing their best to try to sing some of the greatest songs of all time. I mean, CLOCKWORK ORANGE might make a fun remake (!!), but what's the point? Why not leave it as is, folks? And that was truly the question I kept asking myself: "WHY?!" Why make this movie? What... is... the... point?What most immediately came to mind during my viewing of this hapless commercial for a HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL incarnation of the Beatles is something Dorothy Parker once said: "This is one for the ages (ages 8-12)." What's more to say, really? Don't waste your time and money on this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantasia for the drug crowd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are in that stage of life where you think drugs are a means of rebellion and thus cool, you'll love this movie.The plot is driven forward as with a whip, with nothing following naturally. The plot is forced into contortions to segue into dance and/or music scenes.This movie tries to capture some indie-flick grit and street cred, but it can't shuck its Hollywood origins or its happy Hollywood ending.There are lavish special effects showing the wonders of the drug experience. There is lots of music, including a cameo by Bono that unlike most of the other music scenes is almost entirely close-up face shots. Hey, they got Bono, and they wanted to make the most of it.Actually, there *was* a close-up face shot of Prudence (most of the characters are named from Beatles songs) that showed an unrealistic three ear piercings, making me wonder at that early stage exactly when the movie was supposed to be taking place. Prudence, a repressed lesbian, gazes longingly after a series of women. At one point, in a too-obvious and insufficiently-funny scene, Prudence locks herself in a closet, at which all of her friends ask her to come out - their cue to sing "Dear Prudence". The movie is loaded with that sort of "wit".There was a consistently strange disregard for little details... For instance, there were several street corner scenes where the buildings were painted to look stereotypically "sixties", but the set dressing ignored large swaths of non-foreground scenery.I just can't condone a pro-drug movie like this. This movie is almost an advertisement for LSD, between the tie-dyed dance scenes and the trippy happy computer-generated-and-enhanced graphics. There's no down-side to drugs. In this world, tripping is happy and rewarding and leads to deep insights into life.Another sin here is the trivialization of the horrors of Viet Nam and the impact it had on the folks that came back from it mangled mentally and physically.I think that as an antidote to seeing this film, folks should immediately go out and watch "Requiem for a Dream", a far more accurate look at the impact of drugs. Sure, that's heroin, not LSD, but the lifestyle that includes the one easily leads to the other.From five miles up, I'd have to call this movie very pretty but quite irresponsible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I had a terrible 'across the universe' flashback (no drugs involved!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie's screening about a month ago and had completely blocked the experience from my mind this morning until i was listening to Abbey Road.It would be cruel to call "Across the Universe" a two hour music video because it tries so hard to be more than that, but it wouldn't be entirely inaccurate either. The movie can be summed up as a series of punctuated scenes and characters each represented by a Beatles song and strung together by a boilerplate love story.Of course, these criteria don't preclude the movie from being a true gem. But the real failing of any music video is the inability to explore beyond the literal meaning of a song. Of course, in an ideal world all directors re-imagine an established song or leverage both its nuance and cultural weight. In the best of cases, a movie allows music to transcend its established history. In the worst of cases, music is exploited for its most superficial meaning. Sadly, too often, Across the Universe is guilty of the latter. Unfortunately, any negative review of this movie may seem like a 'book' vs 'movie' comparison. Surely if "the movie's never as great as the book," a movie that utilizes culturally loaded music is equally likely to disappoint. My complaint isn't that "Across the Universe" is unable to explore the depths of Beatles universe because the movie never tries. If you could distill any Beatles song to its most literal meaning, while ignoring all subtlety, then you'd probably make this movie too. Accordingly, the best scenes in the movie were detached from the story and simply indulgent celebrations of the music, full of Taymor's aesthetic. Which brings me back to the summary of this review -- while listening to Abbey Road this morning, Across the Universe all came rushing back and I felt half the album being taken from me. In listening to half of the songs on the album, I was reminded of the predictable and superficial renditions of angsty teens bemoaning lost love, while the other unused half remained as a reminder of the depth of the Beatles' music.</fullReview>
