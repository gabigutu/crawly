		<fullReview>This is the documentary, of the many I saw during the Perth Revelation Film Festival 2012, that has stuck to my memory, and the one that fascinated me the most.The documentary revolves about the vanishing of a 13y.o boy, Nicholas Barclay, for his home in Texas in 1993, to be found in Spain with an apparent amnesia six years later. What happens after the young man call the Spanish Police is the core of the film.The movie mixes interviews with the protagonist Frédéric Bourdin, Nicholas' family, American FBI and Consular officials, and has very atmospheric re-enactments done with Spanish actors and settings narrating the events occurred in Spain. The story is build up like in a thriller, and it will keep you glued to the screen, wanting to know what is going to happen next.Layton has given the documentary the tone of a mystery movie in the re-enactments, but also in the interviews through the use of the chiaroscuro, camera positioning, hues of the film, and the tempo and way the events are presented - everything serves to build up suspense and mystery, and make you doubt and question yourself. Is this a real documentary or a mockumentary? Are we being fooled? The story is fascinating and amazing per se, but the way it is presented, is marvelous from a cinematic point of view as lets the viewer munch on a few philosophical themes: self-identity, reality and perception of reality, the connection between emotion and perception, and the use of cinematic narratives in documentaries based on real events, among other things.One of the main downs of the movie is that Nicholas' family is somewhat ridiculed and vilified for the sake of the storyline. After all, we need of good, bad, stupid and clever characters in a story to create an interesting film. In the first place they are portrayed as ignoramuses; however, they are a suburban family living in a poor area of the USA, with little or none education; you cannot expect much of any person grown in this social environment anywhere in the world. In the second place, they are ridiculed for failing to detach themselves from their emotions and see something really obvious for the spectator; however its a characteristic of human nature and behavior to attach emotion to our thoughts and to interpret what we see according to our own personal individual viewfinder. We do so, all of us, every single day, in our daily lives, so you cannot expect traumatized and emotional people to see things as clearly as we see them from our seat in the cinema. In the third place, the movie implicitly blames the family, by letting some of the characters doing so, for the vanishing of Nicholas, without providing any evidence for it.Still, this is a terrific documentary. The less you know about the whole story at the beginning, the more you will enjoy it. This is a documentary that attracts people to the genre because reinvents it. A proof that a documentary can be amazing, intriguing, entertaining, and thought provoking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film at it's European premiere last night at the Edinburgh Film Festival and I was very surprised. The first 1/3 of the film is a well stylized documentary but then this story, which goes from implausible to downright absurd. If the story wasn't true, you would find yourself thinking that the director was trying to string you along and at the very end pop out and say "naw, I was just kidding". There are so many parts of it the require you to suspend belief only to remind yourself it was reality.While there maybe no new information, the ability to portray complex situations from the perspective of the participant remind us all that truth and the human condition are relative. You are left with unanswered questions, doubts and just shaking your head. Well polished, well executed and well edited, there are few documentaries that can suck you into them and actually wonder what is next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary story, well-told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the first couple of minutes of The Imposter, we hear a recorded call with captions placing the call in time; then the film is rewound and we hear it again. The Imposter is a fairly straightforward tale of identity theft but a tale that needs this constant revision. Everything one hears in its turn requires closer scrutiny. Bart Layton's triumph is to follow each thread of the story through, only increasing the layers of information when the tale demands it.There's more to the composition than this of course. Layton's interviews are impeccably collated so that one has the feeling that at all times the individual telling their story is being honest, even when they might look a bit silly. It's also a great achievement to end with a greater mystery than those that tumble forward as the story rolls on.Frederic Bourdin is the great draw of the show, as candid as Joe Simpson in Touching The Void. The editing helps make the point where others would have resorted to interpolated exposition. There's also a nice, unobtrusive soundtrack by Anne Nikitin which follows almost exactly the emotional temperature of the film. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film at the 2012 Edinburgh Film Festival. The film focuses on the story of Nicholas Barclay who disappeared from his Texas home in 1994. Three years later he's found in France and then re-united with his parents. But it's obvious he cannot be there son. He's an impostor; a 23 year old con-artist. The film explores the unravelling of this story through interviews and very well realised reconstructions of the events. Documentary recreations don't always work and can detract from the interviews but here they work very well.It makes for a strange and compelling film. A deliberation on the nature of truth and lies that had me completely gripped.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On June, 13, 1994, Nicolas Barclay went missing. Last seen playing basketball with his friends in San Antonio, Texas. There was no word of his whereabouts for days, weeks, months, years until it was assumed he would be missing forever, the search having long since died out. Then the incredible happened. He was discovered in Linares, Spain. Or was he? The Nicolas that went missing 3 years earlier had had blue eyes not brown and the new Nicolas had a french accent? This new Nicolas was actually Frederic Bourdin a 22 year old French-Algerian, with an addiction to and talent for deceit and fraud. Nevertheless he managed to fool the Barclay family, US embassy officials, the FBI and most of America, if not the world, into believing that he was indeed Nicolas Barclay. But one man had his doubts. A charismatic Texan private eye, Charlie Parker, originally hired to track down Nicolas for an interview with a local media company, noticed an irregularity between the two Nicolas's ears, which eventually lead to Frederic's discovery and arrest.This captivating and chilling story is beautifully explored by the director Bart Layton. He blurs the boundaries between a documentary and blockbuster. Even though Layton allows you to be aware that Frederic is not the real Nicholas Barclay from the outset, he teasingly feeds you fragments of the story piece by piece from the perspectives of the family members, the officials and Frederic himself. The product is a gripping thriller, heightened by the knowledge that it is a true story and by the mesmerising stylised cinematography, including some eery moving portraits of the family members accepting an obvious stranger into their home. This is just one of the many striking images in this film that will stay with me for a long time. Provoking questions about identity, human nature, society and national security, the Imposter our keeps you eager with anticipation while you bathe in the beauty of the images crafted by Layton. It's a brilliant film - one of the best thrillers, let alone documentaries, I have seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story that needs to be heard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, this film came out of nowhere. I missed its cinematic run and only came across it after it was featured in a copy of Total Film magazine. The Imposter tells the story of French con artist Frederic Bourdin, who manages to trick his way into a small town American family in the belief he is missing family member of 3 years, Nicholas Gibson.Many questions are asked, not all of them are answered. For instance, why would the Gibson's take a complete stranger into their house? Did they believe Bourdin was genuinely Nicholas or did they just want him to be Nicholas? Was there an ulterior motive to the families acceptance of this stranger among them, or were they innocent and Bourdin was just a very convincing liar?Certainly looking from the outside in it's very easy to question the stupidity of the Gibson family for allowing this chameleon into their home and seeing how he managed to concoct so many lies and not get caught sooner. In fact, if it wasn't for the efforts of a private investigator and a suspicious FBI agent, Bourdin may still be living in the United States as Nicholas Gibson and no one would be any the wiser.As we follow the story the mystery grows ever deeper. It's a brilliant feat by the director to be able to build such tension in a film like this, using facts and true life testimonies to build an unbelievable tale where we are completely none the wiser at any point during the film as to who is actually telling the truth.For a documentary, The Imposter is genuinely breathtaking. Moving quicker than a Hollywood thriller and a thousand times more intriguing. This true story is both gripping and shocking and completely worthy of your attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stupefying, 'wtf?' movie, which puts fictional thrillers to shame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considered a dead-cert win at the Academy Awards next year, Bart Layton's documentary The Imposter has rapidly generated a great deal of notoriety and acclaim. The quintessential 'stranger than fiction' tale, it's sensational blend of archive footage, delicate reconstructions and heartrending talking head interviews illustrate that, not only is Layton a masterful, investigative reporter, but moreover a profoundly impressive storyteller.Back in 1994, the blue-collar Barclay family from San Antonio, Texas, was left distraught after the disappearance of their 13-year-old son, Nicholas. Like any teenage boy, Nicholas was a cocksure kid, filled with energy, love for his family, and certainly wouldn't runaway from home for no good reason. Weeks turned into months, and eventually the case was abandoned by the police and press. Three years later, the local Texas police department receives an international call from Spain. On the receiving end is a character claiming to be Nicholas. Putting in a bogus story about how he escaped the clutches of a drug fuelled, pedophilic organization, the police think his story check out, and soon enough Nicholas' sister Carey jets over to Europe to meet her long lost brother. In front of police officials, she takes a good look and identifies him as the legitimate lost brother. Three years ago, Nicholas was a blue-eyed, spunky American teenager, now he's transformed into a dark haired, brown-eyed man with stubble and an irreplaceable French accent.The Imposter, like it's central subject, is not the documentary you expect it to be. With many twists, contortions and moral judgements, your pretty much open-mouth and on the edge of your seat throughout the film's entirety. That's partly down to Layton's craft, particularly the Errol Morris-like interviewing technique ? which sees people gaze directly into the lens of the camera and, vicariously, straight at us. But, even more astounding, is the capricious performer that names the film. Frédéric Bourdin, a then 23-year-old man of French-Algerian descent, is actively impersonating Nicholas the whole time, convincing not only the state officials, but the abandoned boy's own mother. With a shrouded history as a homeless orphan thrown into the life of deception and petty crime, he longed to fit in and have a family of his own. When that opportunity didn't surface, he decided to steal Nicholas's own."How could he get away with it?" I hear you cry. That's something I'll leave for you to answer when you see this documentary. Suffice to say, Bourdin is an intimidatingly convincing, intelligent and charismatic figure. To the point where we sit back and reflect whether we could have been swung by his quick wit. Even if Bourdin is the great pretender, a new revelation in the film's final act suggests that the Barclay family are perhaps keeping up appearances of their own.It may not be my favourite documentary of the year (The Act of Killing, if you were wondering), but The Imposter is the best psychological thriller I've seen in recent memory. It transcends the documentary stratum. A dauntingly universal account of a missing child and false identity, it's stupefying moments will leave you silenced whilst the movie plays out. But, as soon as the credits roll, you'll be talking about this exceptional movie for years to come.Read more reviews at: http://www.366movies.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We Can't Even Trust What We Perceive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Imposter" plays like a particularly good episode of "Unsolved Mysteries," not just because actual documentary footage is interspersed with reenactments, but also because the true story it tells is a thoroughly absorbing combination of intrigue and suspense. As with all good thrillers, fictional or non, what begins as a seemingly simple crime eventually escalates into something much more complicated; it's not so much about who has done something as it is about what has actually happened and why. Truth is always a murky subject, mainly because it depends entirely on perception. In this case, because our sources of information prove to be unreliable, we can't even trust what we perceive. On the one hand, we have a family who may know more than it's letting on. On the other hand, we have the title subject, a notorious pathological liar.The film simultaneously documents and dramatizes the case of Nicholas Barclay, who disappeared in June of 1994 at the age of thirteen. When he was last seen, he was playing basketball with his friends in his native San Antonio. A street smart kid with a history of behavioral problems and a juvenile criminal record, he had run away before, and it was initially assumed that he had run away again. However, when his absence stretched beyond his typical window of one day, it was obvious that something more serious had taken place. It wouldn't be until 1997 that a new chapter of the case would begin. In October of that year, the police in Linares, Spain received a phone call from a tourist reporting a lost, frightened, apparently traumatized teenage boy with no identifying documents. He initially said little to authorities, but eventually, he told them he was an American named Nicholas Barclay.He claimed he had escaped from a child prostitution ring and that his memories of his life back in Texas had grown dim. He also claimed that his originally blonde hair and blue eyes were chemically treated by his abductors to appear brown, and that his distinctly European accent and phrasing was the result of having been away from the U.S. so long. The Barclay family was soon contacted, even though no one in Spain could be sure of the boy's story. Nicholas' older sister, Carey, flew all the way to Spain to retrieve him from a children's shelter, and although she was heartbroken by the profound changes she noticed, she believed that he was in fact her long lost brother. Once embassy officials and U.S. federal agents were satisfied and he was sent back to San Antonio, the rest of the Barclays believed it as well. And so life would go on until March of 1998, when the persistence of a skeptical private investigator named Charlie Parker lead to the discovery that the person living with the Barclays was not sixteen-year-old Nicholas.He was, in fact, twenty-three-year-old Frenchman Frédéric Bourdin, who began impersonating others as a child and by 2005 had assumed nearly forty false identities, three of which were of missing teens. The press has nicknamed Bourdin, now nearly forty, The Chameleon. After pleading guilty to passport fraud and perjury in San Antonio, he was sentenced to six years in prison. He would continue to assume identities in both the U.S. and Europe, until, supposedly 2005, at which point he vowed to retire. Although he's now married with three children, I take his vow about as seriously as I take his claim that he never knew his father, that his mother had tried to abort him and would eventually abandon him, that he was raised in a children's home, that he was sexually abused, and that he did what he did as a way to find the love and affection he never received. His history, coupled with his theoretically candid interview footage, leaves me with no reason to believe him.But that isn't the end of the story. How is it possible that the Barclays were so blind to the obvious physical differences between Nicholas and Bourdin? Why were they so willing to believe his story and let him stay in their home? Could it be that they had something to hide? It eventually came to light that both Nicholas' mother and older half- brother were both in the throes of severe drug addictions, and that the mother failed the second of two polygraph tests when questioned about the disappearance. The half-brother was considered a person of interest, but his death in 1998 as the result of a cocaine overdose effectively stalled the investigation. To this day, the remaining Barclays deny any involvement in Nicholas' disappearance. And Nicholas is still listed as a missing person.The reenactments, deliberately vague in the way they look and sound, feature Adam O'Brien as Bourdin, Anna Ruben as Carey, and Alan Teichman as Parker, the latter starring in a chilling segment where a corner of a relative's back yard is dug up in search of Nicholas' body. According to Wikipedia, these dramatized segments were precisely why a viewer who saw the film at the Seattle International Film Festival objected to its classification as a documentary. I think this person is too focused on labels; the simple fact is, a true story is being told. That the facts of the case are open for debate, that there has been no closure for the Barclay family, is something director Bart Layton cannot be held responsible for. "The Imposter" is about deception, of others and of ourselves, and as such, it makes for an irresistible cinematic experience.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bizarre, chilling, surprising &amp; thoroughly enthralling 99-minute eye-popping experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are far too few documentaries on general release so it's a rare pleasure to sit in a dark screening room with six other people to watch another example of bizarre real life unfold across the screen. The Imposter is one of those documentaries where you sit there with the sense of incredulity growing as every twist in the plot reveals itself. It's not as jaw-droppingly absurd as the excellent Tabloid and it isn't remotely funny, but it is a fascinating and compelling experience. I'll qualify that; the story of The Imposter is fascinating while the manner in which it is presented to us upon the screen is absolutely compelling and worthy of the plaudits it has so far received, including a nomination for the Grand Jury Prize at this year's Sundance Film Festival and a gong in the same category at the Miami Film Festival. In San Antonio, Texas on 13 June 1994, thirteen-year-old Nicholas Barclay disappeared. Three and a half years later, when his family's only hope was to find his remains and gain closure, they received word that Nicholas was alive and had been found in Spain. His elder sister, Carey, flew out to Spain to bring Nicholas home whereupon he unfolded a tale of kidnapping and abuse. However, blonde, blue-eyed American Nicolas had somehow become darker skinned, dark haired and French and now looked out onto the world through brown eyes. Yet the family still accepted him as their own! Told partly through interviews with the players including, incredibly, the imposter himself and dramatized interpretations of events, The Imposter gently reveals the events as private investigator Charlie Parker suspects Frédérick Bourdin's true identity and uncovers his history. It bears some resemblance to Le Retour de Martin Guerre (or Sommersby if you preferred the American adaptation) but there is no sign of altruism or a purity of intent from Bourdin. Just as you think you've understood the situation, another nugget of information widens the eyes even further until 'How could the family not know?' turns to 'Why did they decide not to know?' And still more questions arrive. It's an incredible story where doubt is cast over the sanity and honesty of those at the heart of it. At one point, Nicholas' sister (the real one, not the version played by an actress) says with all sincerity, "Spain? That's, like, across the country!" It is plainly obvious we're not dealing with the brightest sparks. But being educationally challenged does not mean dishonesty is not a factor. Director Bart Layton weaves the tale beautifully, never giving away too much in one go and his use of reconstruction blends perfectly with the genuine interviews. The use of real person and actor for each 'character' so often jars in TV documentaries leaving the viewer confused as to who s/he is watching on the screen. Here, Layton has cast perfectly and the dual appearances compliment each other, blending so it is neither noticeable nor important which version we are watching. Star status is usually reserved for performers in feature films, not factual documentaries, but Bourdin is so relaxed, so matter of fact in the telling of his own version of events that he draws the viewer in and leaves us wanting to climb inside his head an know how his brain turns and how many teeth are missing from each cog. The Imposter, though unlikely to enthuse as wide an audience as last year's Project Nim or Senna, is a bizarre, chilling, surprising and thoroughly enthralling 99-minute eye-opening experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic, intriguing and unsettling even if the events don't give the highs the director has the potential to deliver.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it's fascinating to have a documentary in such detail on both sides of a criminal act, it's most interesting aspect is watching the development of a mad man unfold in just a single shot spread over the whole film. At first, Frederic Bourdin appears charming and approachable as he explains his old thought processes with a smile. Over the film's progression, in which we're treated to Man On Wire-esque re-enactments, it's clear he actually has no remorse and his pride is unsettling, especially as this case is just one of the many. Although the film does underwhelm in the end slightly, that can't be helped for it's a documentary, the best aspect is the slick photography in both the interviews and re-enactments making it look incredibly cinematic. The Imposter is a really well constructed film that makes its unbelievable story work and keeps a consistent level of intrigue and anxiety throughout, even if in an ideal world, it should be building up to a finer payoff.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, atmospheric, slightly stretched out telling of a surprising, twisty story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Imposter (2012)A creatively made documentary about a French man who was able to take on the identity of someone else against all the odds. This isn't a wild tale like the man who was doctor and airplane pilot and so on, but rather just a young man posing as a kid so he could get into a children's home and be taken care of.Or that was step one. When he was about to be discovered he then pulls one charade after another and ends up in Texas. The gullibility of the family who takes him in is part of the talking head zaniness of it all. Or so that's step two. Or four. The movie takes a whole series of twists because of how the story is told to us. (There is a little feeling of being manipulated and tricked which doesn't feel quite fair, actually, but this does keep you interested.) By the end you know exactly what happened (with one major detail up in the air) and there is a satisfying, wow, what a tale feeling.The filming is really elegant, with really brilliant editing. I think it could have been more compact, and more impactful, but it never really slows down. The cast of characters gradually grows as the investigation into the facts changes, too, which is interesting, leading to the best character of all (beyond the French leading man), an old gumshoe driving his Cadillac and getting to the bottom of at least some of the facts the old fashioned way.You might critique this kind of story by simply saying it would make an amazing amazing segment on 60 Minutes. But that would be 20 fabulous minutes. Instead it's stretched and stretched into five times that (five!) and all the extra details and atmospheric filler makes it very long. Boring? No, not really, but when you're done you'll know it could have been more by being less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>British screenwriter, producer and director Bart Layton's feature film debut is based on real events in the life of a French serial impostor named Frédéric Bourdin. It premiered in the World Cinema Documentary section at the 28th Sundance International Film Festival in 2012, was screened in the Zabaltegi-Pearls section at the 60th San Sebastián International Film Festival in 2012, was shot on locations in USA and Spain and is a UK production which was produced by producer Dimitri Doganis. It tells the story about a 13-year old boy named Nicholas Barclay who during a summer in 1994 disappears from his hometown in San Antonio, Texas in USA. More than three years later a traumatized boy is found by the police in the city and municipality of Linares, Spain. He claims to be Nicholas and a family convinced that their missing son has returned welcomes him home. Finely and intimately directed by British filmmaker Bart Layton, this fast-paced fictional documentary/narrative feature which is mostly narrated by and from the protagonist's point of view, draws a remarkable portrayal of an American family's sudden reunion with their young son in the late 1990s. While notable for its colorful milieu depictions, fine production design by production designers Marcia Calosio and Mariona Julbe and cinematography by cinematographers Erik Wilson and Lynda Hall, this narrative-driven and interview-driven crime story where fact and fiction is interlaced depicts a multifaceted study of character about a person's impossible and deceptive attempt to escape from himself and contains a relieving and timely score by composer Anne Nikitin. This somewhat biographical, significantly atmospheric and instantly engaging thriller about identity, the blinding yearning for love, the consequences of one's childhood and upbringing and the wish to be another person who in one's own perception is better and more lovable, is impelled and reinforced by its fragmented narrative structure which reflects the main character's tales and explanations, rhythmic editing by film editor Andrew Hulme, various characters, incredible and interrelated stories and vivid acting performances by theatre actor Adam O'Brian in his debut feature film role and British actress Anna Ruben. In this era it takes a lot for a film to be shocking or sensational, but this strangely humorous, gravely serious and puzzling mystery comes pretty close to being exactly that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fascinating film (almost as good as Man On Wire by the same producer).It tells how a Frenchman bizarrely managed to fool a Texan family, the Spanish authorities, and the FBI, that he was their missing 16-year-old son - even though he was aged 23, looked nothing like their son, and had a French accent! Only a local private investigator saw through it.As well as being gripping, it's pretty funny as well - at various points the whole audience laughed at the apparent stupidity of the family (who for example had little concept of foreign countries).However, the film doesn't tie up all the loose ends, and leaves a strong hint that the family may have known more about the deception than they let on...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1994, a 13-year-old boy disappears from Texas; three years later, he apparently shows up in Spain, disoriented and uncommunicative. The boy's family quickly retrieves him, but it's soon obvious that something is awry. Is it possible this is not their little boy after all? The Imposter's title gives you a strong indication to the answer to that question, but there's much more to the story.This is a documentary, so let us begin with some cold facts. The story is propelled by interviews given by the real-life people at the center of the drama. Right away, we are introduced to one Frederic Bourdin, a 23-year-old Frenchman. His mission: find and steal the identity of a teenager. It turns out to be a little harder than one might imagine, particularly when the boy chosen by Bourdin turns out to be a cause celebre, and thus Bourdin is not able to simply escape the clutches of the Spanish police but instead must continue his ruse as he's taken to the United States.Along the way, he asks himself why the boy's family is so eager to accept him as young Nicholas. Bourdin has beard stubble and dark hair, whereas teenage Nicholas was blonde and a bit too young to shave. But accept them they do. Is this simply a case where the family just wanted so desperately to believe that their boy was back that they overlooked obvious discrepancies? Or did they have something else to hide?In addition to Bourdin himself, interviews with his older sister, his mother, his brother in law, and his brother - along with law-enforcement officials both local and national (including Interpol) - are interspersed throughout the movie. It is only from these subjective interviews that the audience can make any assumptions or deductions, as director Bart Layton doesn't push the plot in any particular direction. Well, not at first. For a good part of the movie, we are led to conclude two things: that Bourdin is certainly not Nicholas and that Nicholas' family is surely aware of this.And then, from almost nowhere, an allegation arises that cannot be revealed here. Does it seem plausible? Yes. Is it supported in the movie as a valid theory? Not entirely. It is at this point where the director introduces the allegations behind which he also throws his own weight, a bit of a departure from the plot to that point. Layton seems to believe this allegation has at least a grain of truth - he is not the only one in the movie to think so, although there appears to be no direct evidence to support it.And that's a shame. Up until then, the movie seems almost amiable: the lovable rogue sneaking into the U.S. by pretending to be someone much younger, fooling officials but not the family, which doesn't care anyway. After the tone shifts (abruptly), the movie itself changes - now it's much more of a mystery, and unfortunately it's one without a satisfying resolution.If this were a work of fiction, the movie could have been effective if it was able to delve into the minds and actions of the Gibson family. Because the movie is nonfiction, throwing in plot devices that may or may not be factual would have been unethical and embarrassing. But it would have been far more entertaining than The Imposter, which promises a lot but cannot deliver on the tone set by its creepy, unsettling premise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film, directed by Bart Layton, to be both riveting and mesmerizing. As the layers of the mystery are peeled off, I had no idea where the movie was going. It is chocked with many twists and turns which only enhanced my interest.It begins in San Antonio, Texas when 13 year old Nicholas Barclay disappears from his home. Nearly, three and a half years later a phone call is placed to the police in Linares, Spain. The police are told that a teenager is alone and scared on the street and needs help.From that point on, a whole series of events occur which links the disappearance of Nicholas Barclay to this telephone call in Spain. I'll let the movie viewer see for themselves what unfurls thereafter.I will say that the events that followed had me totally absorbed and riveted. The film has won numerous awards and I can see why, as it's exceptionally well done in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THE IMPOSTER': Three Stars (Out of Five)Documentary detailing the 1997 impersonation case where a French 23-year-old con artist pretended to be a missing 16-year-old boy and began living with the kid's family (unbeknownst to them amazingly). The film uses interviews with those involved as well as several reenactments (using actors) to tell it's story. It was directed by Bart Layton, who's previous experience is solely in TV documentaries (and it shows). The film has a strong TV crime show feel to it but it's still interesting and somewhat involving. I'm not big fan of acted out reenactments (in documentaries like this) but it does help the film better tell it's story. Not a great documentary (and it doesn't quite live up to it's critical acclaim hype) but it's still an interesting one. The film tells the story of Frederic Bourdin, a French 23-year-old con artist who had a long record of impersonating children. In this case he convinced a Texas family that he was their 16-year-old son (who had been missing for three years) from a missing children's office in Spain. The family buys his story (as does almost everyone else), even after meeting him, despite the fact that he looks nothing like the blond haired, blue eyed kid and speaks with a French accent. He tells authorities that he had been kidnapped by U.S. military and transported to Spain for sexual abuse. A private investigator (Charles Parker) and an FBI agent (Nancy Fisher) begin suspecting something isn't right from the get-go even though everyone else is duped. Suspicions also arise as to why the family was so eager to believe this stranger was undoubtedly their child. The movie is very eerie, disturbing and bizarrely interesting but that's more so just because of the fascinating story than the filmmakers' storytelling methods. I didn't really care for the crime TV format and found it a little emotionally void and uncinematic. Still the events depicted make for a good movie. It's the kind of story that no one would buy if it were known to be fiction. Viewers would totally have a problem with the believability of the film if they thought it came from someone's imagination but because it's based on facts they'll eat it up. Truth is always stranger than fiction and this is one strange story.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8-fGGKVWPc</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally absorbing tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Imposter is one of the most fascinating documentaries you will see this year. The story is so bizarre that if a Hollywood screenwriter had written this story, no producer would touch it!!In 1994,Nicholas Barclay then 13 years old,disappeared from his home in Texas. His family were understandably distraught. Three years later, a teenager claiming to be Nicholas was found in Spain! He looked nothing like Nicholas, and he spoke English with a French accent. Can this person be the Barclay family's lost relative? The clue is in the film's title. He was in fact a French man called Frederic Bourdin.What makes this story compelling is the fact Bourdin hoodwinked both the Spanish and the American authorities. Even more shocking than that is that the Barclay family believed that he was Nicholas and welcomed back into their home!Nicholas's mother, sister,nephew and brother in law are were all deceived.The desire to believe was so strong that they embraced him and his story about his abduction. His story of how he got from Texas to Spain is shocking. We are given insights into what motivated Bourdin, who is an extremely skilled conman. He came from a troubled background, and he wanted to be loved and accepted by a family. The Barclays fit the bill.We also see how a traumatised family that would swallow his lies even when it's clear to us, the audience, that he is clearly a bullshit artist on an epic scale.Special mention must be made to dogged private investigator Charlie Parker, who smelt a rat from the moment "Nicholas" hits the media spotlight. He steals every scene!!!The tragedy of this story is that we are no nearer to the whereabouts of the real Nicholas.This is an amazing documentary that will grip you from start to finish. Go and see it and then tell everyone you know about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read a few reviews which admonished me not to discover too much about this "mysterious and compelling" story beforehand so I didn't.I really enjoy good documentary films so I watched it with an open mind and was ready to be compelled and mystified but I wasn't in the least.I found it all too obvious. A dark-haired French-speaking young man pretends to be a missing blond-haired English-speaking American boy and is apparently welcomed by his clearly dysfunctional family with open arms.So what's going to happen? He is discovered to be a fake(duh)and the family fall under suspicion and we eventually discover that one of them was a junkie and killed himself shortly after the boy went missing.Not much mystery or compulsion there. We are told of the mesmerising abilities and evil nature of the bogus heir apparent but he is no more than a failed chancer,more intelligent than he wants to appear but not as bright as he thinks he is.I've met plenty of those.The only surprise I found was how unbelievably thick and incompetent the relevant American officials were.It was like watching a thriller where you work out the entire plot in the first five minutes and then sit there bored stiff as it unfolds exactly thus. I'm sorry to review this film so negatively when many people obviously enjoyed it but if you are looking for mystery and intellectual challenges,you won't find them here in my opinion. A well-crafted but spuriously sensational film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great story that is structured and delivered very well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched a documentary the other day where the access was so good and the story so engaging that I had to check the thing was not a scripted drama; with The Imposter I had a similar feeling and had only just finished it when I took to the internet to verify that the whole story was not made up. I confirmed that this was not the case and in fairness if you tried to write this story as fiction, nobody would buy it as too much of it would be laughed out of the room as absurd or so unlikely as to be impossible. I shan't say too much but essentially this is the story of a Frenchman in his early 20's who is in Spain and claims to be a boy who went missing a few years earlier as a 13 or 14 year old in San Antonio, Texas. Despite being older, having a French accent, not having the same color eyes or hair, his claim sees the missing boy's sister coming across to Europe, greeting him with open arms and returning him to his home in the US. And it should tell you a lot that this is where the story really starts.As a story it is hard to believe and on this level it is engaging because it is so fantastical that you cannot stop following it but it still needs to be delivered well ? just because you have a good story doesn't make you a good story-teller. In this case though the film does a great job from start to finish. Interviews, reconstructions and archive footage are all used very well to slowly build the story and follow it to the conclusion. It is filmed in a very cinematic way, with effects of thrillers and a sinister air to it that I thought might be a bit forced but actually worked very well indeed ? the cinematography of the reconstructions and the clever editing of the interviews into the film really worked to the film's benefit. The contributors are mostly engaging and quite open ? in particular "The Imposter" himself is a real presence in the film, we may not really understand him (or any of them really) but his contributions really helps us get inside the story.That the Imposter is a great story is one thing, but this film tells it very well indeed. It has weaknesses when it comes to understanding the characters but the thriller-approach works and drives the story forward in a manner that is satisfying and engaging. Excellent documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange But True</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Imposter is one of the best documentaries that I have ever seen. Nicholas Barclay went missing in 1994, and three and a half years later, a man claiming to be Nick appeared in Spain, calling the police from a pay phone. The man convinced the authorities that he was a lost teenager who needed time to tell them who he was. The social service people felt so bad that they let him rest at their office. He used the phone to call different places in America, until he eventually contacted a national missing children's center and somehow was able to able to morph into the Barclay boy. The con man meets his "sister" and is flown to Texas and is introduced to his "mother" who believe that he has changed so radically because of a supposed abduction and sexual abuse. You have to see this to understand where the phrase truth is stranger than fiction came from, because The Imposter is mesmerizing. The main man is one of the most compelling subjects in the annals of crime. I was reminded of Ted Bundy's final interview with James Dobson, the night before his execution. The same type of arrogance is present in both men. In the end, the story is a sad one, but a highly watchable one which is superbly put together by director Bart Layton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This joins a top ten list of films to watch, trust me you will not be able to sleep after watching this. Its unique, complex, disturbing and mind blowing. The story is unbelievable but true. Its a roller coaster ride, the first half of the film absolutely absorbing with its tale of stolen identity, you are mesmerized with the feeling of how the heck does he get away with this? surely at some point he will be exposed. Time and time again he seems to progress but then the story changes and becomes very dark, this is where your catapulted out of your seat and turned inside out! the implications are there and you the viewer right or wrong are left to be judge and jury. Of course our deepest respect to the family and their loss but you are left with a lingering doubt regarding a certain family member now deceased. You almost feel who is the imposter? A story of a circle within a circle,a lesser evil meeting a greater evil.What does not help the family in my opinion is their, almost robotic emotionless scripted comments, surely one would be more emotionally upset and very angry being duped? In fairness to the family how many interviews have they done to make their reactions now and I can see their motive that the film does raise awareness of the missing boy.I would recommend looking at the extras and the making of the documentary, if you don't normally do this I really suggest watch it. There is one new revelation, Fredrick the imposter claims under lie detector he had known Nicholas. What?! also a search on the internet shows Fredrick claims to have had 500 false identities. Yes. Five Hundred.I strongly also recommend showing this film to young people. The message being don't trust strangers, anyone can make things up and pretend to be something else.I hope this film will provide new evidence to solve the tragic case of the missing Nicholas. I hope Fredrick has received serious therapy to stop impersonating. I hope these things never happen but I know that's just wishful thinking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dreadfully provocative picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Imposter is an ingenious documentary that is as thought-provoking in its evaluation of genuine human fallacy, as it is inconceivable in its story. The way of exhibiting the subject matter - and its egregious effect - is greatly enhanced through the engaging, most productive contrast of two contrasting viewpoints.When a young 13-year old goes missing in Texas the whole family is gradually losing faith that they'll see him alive again. However, on one seemingly miraculous day three years later, a mysterious teenager is found in a deserted phone-booth in Linares, Spain. At first, all signs point out that he just might be the long-lost American boy (even when we immediately know that he is not). What's more surprising - given his posture, totally different face, eyes, and French accent - all the Texan relatives seem to be convinced that he is definitely one of their own.Is it just a matter of faith and fake anticipation, or is it a suspenseful intrigue that is supposed to cover up a much bigger, horrible secret? Why should anyone trust a stranger and bring him home, without getting all the facts right? After a while FBI and a lone private investigator are on the case, trying to find out what's really happened in the past and what made the family believe that a 23-year old French con-man is a 16-year old American citizen.It's an astonishing revelation, which demonstrates how a meticulous impostor was able to trick so many people into believing that he is someone else, stealing the identity and finally beginning the live out the precious 'American Dream'. With a most exciting turn of events, The Imposter is able to shock even further, uncovering all the repellent aspects of the perturbed human's behavior. Through its insightful interviews with both the missing boy's family members and the fraud himself, the movie develops a whole new level in the documentary-making scene, brining all that's really offensive and ridiculous at the same time. Undoubtedly, with its fantastically distressing pace, It's a thrill-ride that no one should omit.</fullReview>

Unable to obtain a ride home he made the journey on foot but some misfortune must have befallen him and he never arrived. Fast forward ahead 3 years and the Barclay family receives a call from Spain telling them that Nicholas has been found. But unlike the high-spirited boy they knew this Nicholas Barclay is sullen a result of 3 years of abuse apparently suffered at the hands of his abductors. The true story of Nicholas Barclay's disappearance is the subject of a fascinating documentary film called "The Imposter" which chronicles the history from that fateful night in 1994 through the events in Spain to the ever-widening mystery that followed. I was glued to the screen for the entire 99 minutes as director Bart Layton expertly blends dramatic re-enactments and interviews into a gripping tale that ultimately leads us to question our most cherished assumptions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable story told in a compelling way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1994 a thirteen year old Texan boy called Nicholas Barclay disappeared from San Antonio. Three years later his family received a call from a Spanish official, claiming that Nicholas had been abducted by a sex slave ring but was now with him in Spain. Despite Nicholas leaving as a thirteen year old with almost Aryan colouring and returning tanned with dark hair and eyes along with a foreign accent, the family accepted the boy who returned as their son. This documentary tells the story of Nicholas' disappearance and the extraordinary events in 1997 when it seemed that he had returned.The documentary is created using a mixture of talking heads; achieve home videos and convincing reconstructions which are themselves combined with the talking heads. Almost all of the major players in the story take part which is a little surprising as by the end hardly anyone comes out with any sort of credibility.I went into this film knowing the story having read about it recently in a magazine. I knew very little about the film however and wasn't actually sure if it was a documentary or drama. The film plays its cards very early and it isn't exactly a spoiler, especially given the title, to tell you that the person who returns home in 1997 is not Nicholas Barclay. The real interest for the first half of the film at least, is how on earth this man managed to convince Spanish officials, the American Embassy and most incredibly the family of the missing boy that he was Nicholas. It's almost too unreal to be true. Without giving too much away, the man who claims to be the boy is of French-Algerian descent and several years older than Barclay. He looks nothing like the boy.The second half of the film looks at the possible reasons behind his success and this is where we get into spoiler territory so I'll say no more. The spoilers though aren't on the same level as the likes of Catfish and the ending is fairly open ended, leaving the audience to judge some of the answers for themselves. I personally came to one of the possible conclusions several minutes before the film announced it but what I believe may not actually be so. The second half interested me immensely and I sort of wanted a definitive conclusion but understand that the film makers can only show what they have.For such a sad and distressing story there are a surprisingly large number of laugh out loud moments. Many of these are to do with either the stupidity of people involved or the sheer audacity of the impostor. The first laugh came when one member of Nicholas' Texan family was talking about when she first heard that he was in Spain and exclaimed "Spain? But that's across the country!" She later sounded very surprised to find Coke in another country. This is an extremely insular family, even by American standards. Other laughs arise when the impostor talks about how scared he was about being caught and uses the work f**k repeatedly. The film could have descended into doom and gloom given its delicate subject matter but somehow manages to remain almost light hearted. I'm not sure if this is a particularly good thing but it certainly takes the edge off a terrible tale.As I've previously mentioned it is hard to talk about the film without giving away spoilers so I'll stop here but just finish by saying that The Imposter is a compelling and well made documentary about an unbelievable set of circumstances which has to be seen to be believed. It will have you talking afterwards and there will be a lot of different conclusions made.www.attheback.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I can say is, "wow." Some reviewers described the tale as "fascinating." The only thing fascinating about it is how gullible the people involved are.I mean the story is totally outrageous: A blond, blue-eyed American teenager from Texas goes missing. Three years later, the child's family receives a call that he's been discovered in Spain. Except when they're "reunited" with their child, he's suddenly in his early-20s, with dark hair and dark eyes, has no recollection of his past, and speaks with a thick French accent. But this apparently doesn't raise their suspicions. Basically, I spent the entire time wondering how people could be so dense. I kept watching, thinking that there must be some explanation or crazy plot twist. But sadly there wasn't. I also cringe at the thought of this being aired to international audiences and confirming stereotypes about Americans' lack of sophistication and naivete.This might make a viable 20-minute story for Dateline or Inside Edition, but it really doesn't merit 90 minutes. The whole story is just too . . . stupid?</fullReview>

It is not like the whole town did not know what Nicholas looked like. I don't care what kind of sex slave you were, your eyes do not change from blue to brown and you don't end up with a French accent having been abducted to Spain either.As for the real Nicholas, why does a 13-year-old have so many tattoes and how in less than 24 hours, did the impostor get them made to match with no scarring or anything by the time the sister arrived? And the sister said he had said kiss my ass to the family and run away for a day or two several times before - a little kid?I don't know. I just don't know. But I cannot finish the movie.

		<shortDescription>It offers a dose of enchantment from incredible and improbable facts, coupled with a dubious criminal investigation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To portray historical facts in cinema opens, usually, a delicate tension between the limits of dramatic effect and reliability of past events.Evidently, as the Luis Borges map drew attention, a representation is incapable of disclose the truth nature of a real object. However, a film, per si, do not should be purely objective, but rather pay attention to subjectively dramatic dimension.The issue of balance, therefore, it is stated by the very nature of the movie art. Lapidary carefully the limits of the intelligible and dramatic becomes, therefore, the very craftsmanship of the director. The question becomes more spicy as it brings into play a major limiter of the fictional liberty, that is, the need to narrate the reality without the direct filter of dramaturgy. Within this context, THE IMPOSTER has the exceptional merit of building a charged voltage narrative, which takes a surprisingly suggestive dramatic reversal, concluding with open elements a documentary narrative. More important, everything is just right, without sacrificing the dramatic element. It is to say, extraordinary events combined with a careful and progressive narrative results in a sweeping documentary.As for the actual content of the film, it is, however, the story of a succession of misunderstandings carved by a talented swindler of only 23 years. There is no mention of a great moral or social issue.The incredible story of a master forger do not initiates a deeper debate about immigration policies, or social inequality, the problems of investigative policy of various institutions, etc. It solely ? and with indisputable merit ? offers a dose of enchantment from incredible and improbable facts, coupled with a dubious criminal investigation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(*May contain spoilers*) The Imposter was intriguing and breathtaking as well as one of the best documentaries created in my opinion. It surprised me how well the director Bart Layton was able to keep the viewer gripped to their seat throughout the entire film with such an obvious ending. From the start the viewer was lead on and hinted by the director about how events have unfolded and the truth about Frederic, the con artist who pretends to be a missing boy in America. The director somehow manages to keep the escalating suspense and tension however with what he has to work with. He somehow places you right in the moment of action. He manages to make you feel like you are with Frederic during tense moments in the film, that every decision he makes somehow will affect you and that you will either survive together or go down together. These effects are best achieved through first person views by placing the viewer in Frederic's position. I believe Layton executes this perfectly without having to rely on cliché methods such as first person angles or through dialog. The result is a perfect edge clinging suspense film. One scene which best highlights this is the moment when Frederic receives a photocopy of what the boy he is imposing as looks like. In this scene you share the dread with Frederic as he realizes that he looks nothing like the missing boy yet the American government and the family have already gotten too involved and will soon see that. Bart Layton took a unique story and managed to turn it into something greater. This truly is one of the few documentaries in my experience to be able to suck you deep into the action and leave you stranded there with thousands of questions while trying to find your way back to reality.</fullReview>

An "apparently" French guy who claims to be a missing Texan with a family looking for him for many years. You will know the truth from the get-go. You will know what's going on, but then again you will not have a clue about what's going on because what's going on is far more deep and sinister than what you could imagine. The plot is twisted to a point that you, knowing what's going on, will soon realize that whether the kid is the missing son or not its not so important compared to what is really going on.Storytelling-wise, the director does a great job in letting you in little by little, starting by making you comfortable in thinking that you know what is going on, and then gently but steadily throwing you out of balance.If I have to make a negative remark I would just remove 10% of the music, but that's just a matter of personal taste.Keyphrase: "Good luck".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a stunning documentary movie about the 1997 incident. Tells the story of a Texas boy who returned home after the 3 years of disappearance. Created a lot thrilling excitation that equals to any masterpiece crime-thriller movie. Particularly to say it is what Hitchcock would have chosen to do if he was alive today. Sadly, it was a documentary movie, that does not really stop anyone from a watch. It is one the documentary you should watch if you are a Hitchcock fan, especially if you are interested in the crime-thrillers that deals about identity crises. As it is a true story, it was unbelievable.A 16 year-old Nicolas Barclay from Texas was missing for 3 years. All the sudden one day he appears with the changed personality. That brings joy in his family who was praying for his return. But Nicolas tells the strange story about his disappearance that convince his family, but authorities suspect that something is not right. What is true and what is not is the remaining narration that reveals as it happened.''I saw the opportunity.''This movie is what reminds me the Indian movie 'Naan'. Same kind of narration that does not keep the secret from the viewers, but each other from the movie characters. It was about claiming the fake identity, that was not done perfectly because of the faultless display, but failed to recognize the truth, especially in the modern world with all the facilities are available to detect such flaws. Like saying, all is well when everybody is happy. There are lots of similar incidents happening, but everything won't come into the lights. I am glad this story brought into the silver screen.It was awesome, I thoroughly stuck with it till the end. Yes, the end leaves behind many doubts about the whole structure of the case that could possibly take us to the day since Nicolas was missing. But in another angle it is a kind of offense to believe where the story leaves everything and finger points the other way. Whatever the truth is, it leaves us on a thin border of the two possibilities and we have to take what way we think could possibly would have happened. In the meantime the mystery about Nicolas keeps unanswered. I hope this puzzle will be solved one day in the near future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How to describe this documentary -- your jaw will drop."The Imposter" was done in 2012. A 13-year-old boy, Nicholas, disappeared from his family home in San Antonio, Texas in 1994 and turned up three years later in Spain. The person claiming he was Nicholas was an imposter -- and an obvious one. In fact, his eye color was different from Nicholas. The family, however, welcomed him with open arms and seemed to believe him."Nicholas" -- who spoke English with an accent -- appeared on a TV news show and while filming it, the investigator who had been sent to find him for the interview became suspicious and was convinced that he was not Nicholas.This opened up a new set of questions: Why had this family accepted such an obvious imposter as Nicholas? And if he wasn't Nicholas, who was he? This is a knock your socks off documentary, absolutely fascinating and very well done. See what you think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A captivating story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>13-year-old Nicholas was last seen playing basketball with his friends in San Antonio, Texas on June 13, 1994. He called his mother to pick him up, but she was asleep and Nicholas's older brother refused to wake her up. Nicholas never made it home and hasn't been seen since. In October of 1997, 3 years after Nicholas disappeared, authorities received a phone call from a young man in Linares, Spain, saying that a young boy had been found. This was apparently Nicolas. He managed to weave himself into the States by lying about this identity.This story is one of the most intriguing, captivating and horrific stories any family could possibly imagine. The film was directed perfectly by Bart Layton with the documentary styling to it, with interviews from the family themselves expressing their feelings at the time also to the present day. For those of you whom have never heard of the story at all, I would definitely recommend seeing The Imposter, it's mind blowing! I was never a massive fan of these documentary films until I saw Senna, which gave me a different idea. However The Imposter has changed my mind again, I would happily see plenty more of them as they can be fascinating. Especially with a storyline as powerful as this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This possibly can't be a true story! ... Can it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good, respectfully made documentaries are very difficult to rate, and even more difficult to review! This is what I experience once again after watching Bart Leyton's uniquely jaw-dropping "The Imposter". It would have been so much easier if this were a fictional story? Then we would all be able to write that it's a bunch of implausible and far-fetched nonsense that sprung from the mind of an overly imaginative scriptwriter! But this is a true story and ? believe me ? incredibly hard to fathom! Leyton reconstructs, chronologically and patiently, the story of an unscrupulous French/Algerian fraud who incomprehensibly manages to impersonate a vanished 16-year-old Texan; misleading the boy's devastated family members as well as the authorities and the media. When apprehended in Spain, Frédéric Bourdin sees the opportunity to assume the identity of Nicholas Barclay, who disappeared without a trace in his hometown of San Antonio 3 years and 4 months ago. There's no way back when Nicholas' sister comes to bring him back to Texas, but even though he looks, sounds and acts completely different than Nicholas ever did, the family embraces Bourdin without questioning his grotesque made up testimonies. Only gradually, some people become skeptical and begin to dig a deeper in Bourdin's persona, like a social worker and a private detective. The most praiseworthy aspect about "The Imposter", and I believe this is entirely Bart Leyton's very own accomplishment, is that this documentary isn't manipulative or judgmental at all. The film doesn't condemn the family members for their blindness, naivety or how easily they were brainwashed. Quite important, because this made me ? personally - feel less like a voyeur in observing all the pain these people had to endure. Bourdin himself is also even granted to elaborate on his miserable childhood and his urge to compensate through becoming a phony. Leyton's narrative style is captivating and honest, and you hardly even notice the whole thing gradually turning from documentary into a tense thriller/film-noir. "The Imposter" is something you just have to discover yourself, I can only repeat that it's an incredible story that you don't even fully when you are gazing at it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE IMPOSTER, a much-lauded documentary that was all over the media when it came out last year, tells an intriguing mystery and is a complete surprise, because you honestly don't realise that people can be as gullible as the ones here. It tells an odd tale indeed, and as is the case with these things, to tell much about the story would be to spoil it.Let's be clear, this is not perfectly made; it's nowhere near in the same category as the excellent BLACKFISH or the shocking TALLHOTBLOND I saw last year. The reliance on staged dramatisations is tiresome in the extreme and the story is a little slow to get going, so that the ending feels rushed. However, the flaws can be readily overlooked, purely because the tale told is so outlandish, so remarkable, so unbelievable, that you just know it has to be true. Watch it and see for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Imposter' tells a remarkable a story. A petty criminal survives by impersonating child runaways - eventually, he dares (through necessity) to pass himself off to a family as their long lost son, and they believe him. Which begs the question, why?, and two possible answers. The first is that the will to believe (and the absence of grounds for suspicion) is sufficiently strong to overcome the natural evidence; the second is that the family have a motive of their own for 'finding' their child. Told with the participation of all involved, the story is horrible, and not exactly fun to watch, but compelling nonetheless. I'd like to have known more about the imposter's background, though, and his present; how he got into, and out of, the kind of life he lived, a series of lives, in fact, all belonging to somebody else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first 50 minutes or so are draggy, consisting mostly of interviews with Nicholas Barclay's family and the perpetrator, Frederic Bourdin. The interviews mix significant information with a lot of minutiae, and we see and hear way too much from Bourdin. The second half is much better, bringing some new and interesting players into the story. If you're not already familiar with the details of the Barclay case, there are some surprises and food for speculation toward the end.THE IMPOSTER reveals the specifics of how the Barclay affair happened very well. It would, however, have benefited from less talk and more reenactment of the events (which it uses quite effectively at the very beginning).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thrilling documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Imposter was a thrilling documentary about a Frenchman named Frédéric Bourdin who takes the place of a Texas teen who has been missing; it is one of the best documentaries I've seen. The movie focuses on the Gibson family and their journey to discovering that the person they thought was there son is just there to live the "American dream". The fact that the family was tricked by Bourdin either shows that they were so happy that they had their son back and wanted to believe that it was him, or they were hiding something. When Bourdin accuses the family of killing their son and accepting him as their son in order to hide the homicide is a twist you cant ignore, and creates huge tension between the family. The director Bart Layton uses close up shots, which is important throughout the movie. Since he shoots the family's interviews so close it shows the anger and sadness that you can clearly see through the tears rolling down the mothers face. The film was also enhanced by the reenactments. The reenactments were shot well, even though they were very good, they didn't overshadow the interviews of the family. When you watch the film you are on the edge of your seat the entire time. I would highly recommend this documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A more bizarre scenario would be hard to imagine- and, were this one of those talky low budget independent comedy-dramas, it would've been laughed off the screen (in large part because of the lack of any real resolution to the mystery that sets this string of events in motion). "His disappearance didn't make the news," says one relative of the young boy THE IMPOSTER impersonates; because this kid was considered "white trash," as someone puts it, his disappearance goes all but unnoticed. Unbeliavably, by film's end, only one person is searching for the long-missing child. In fact, the last shot in the movie is of this detective, digging up a yard looking for remains. No one else we meet in this movie seems to have given this mystery a second thought. THAT'S perhaps the most frustrating thing about THE IMPOSTER- it leaves the viewer clueless. (The "imposter" himself is a man of little consequence, a con man who has used the same ploy over and over throughout his lifetime to get over on the gullible.) The fact remains: a murderer apparently got away with murder. Note: there are 200,000 unsolved murders in this country.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enthralling documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When we watch a documentary, we usually view the subject through glass, under a microscope, certainly at a distance; we often already know the outcome of the events, and are watching out of interest in the topic rather than a desire for entertainment, strictly speaking. Even the most accomplished documentaries, in which we are most interested, are regularly little more than a set of talking heads and reconstruction; very rare is the exception to this format.'The Imposter' is one such exception. Taking the story of a young boy who, in 1994 went missing in Texas, and then turned up three years later in Spain, looking and sounding completely different, Bart Layton dissects it with a careful precision, evenly and fairly showing each side of the story, as told from all points of view. The family, the law, and even the man who posed as the titular imposter all have their say. Lacing their interviews together with dramatic reconstruction, the director presents us with an utterly compelling drama, a drama which, if pitched to a studio as a fictional screenplay, would be admired for its audacity, but shot down for the gaping holes in the plot! Seriously difficult to believe, the story goes from strange, to unbelievable, to almost ridiculous, and with every step it is only more gripping. Part of the reason for this is that unless already told otherwise, we could easily believe what we are watching is not a documentary presented as a film, but a film presented as a documentary. Another smart move is that the film makers ensure that we make the discoveries and follow the twists in the tale as they did. There is no foreshadowing, forecasting, or foregone conclusions; the entire thing is as much a mystery for the audience to unravel as they go, as it was to the people involved.Too many reviews elsewhere spoil too much; all I will say is this is absolutely one of the best films of 2012, not to mention one of the most honestly compelling and haunting documentaries I have ever seen, second only, perhaps, to 'Dreams of a Life', which took a similar approach.A strange, creepy tale, very well presented. One to watch, and one to talk about with anyone else who sees it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a stranger-than-fiction tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Imposter is a stranger-than-fiction tale of how a 23 year old Frenchman from Spain claimed the identity of a grieving Texan family's child that has been missing for 3 years. Trust me, that's not even the most baffling part of the story. How did a young adult man who speaks with a French accent convince the Gibsons that he is their missing son? Especially when the child, Nicholas Barclay was 13 when he went missing in 1994, making him supposedly 16 when this Frenchman appeared in 1997.It started with a phone call to the Spanish police one night claiming someone has found an 14-15 year old, abducted child. The "child" was found by the police in a phone booth, scared and without any identification. The child claims that he is American so he was sent to Spanish authorities as they try to find out where he came from and where his family is. Immediately, the documentary presents you the side of the Frenchman as he gives out the full details of his scheme while a reenactment plays on screen. Using only a phone at the station, the Frenchman was able to find cases of missing children in America and takes the identity of Nicholas Barclay, a 13 year old, blue-eyed, blond-haired boy from Texas, characteristics he never knew at first because the fax was in black and white.By changing his hair color and copying similar tattoos found on the identification of the missing kid, the Frenchman became ready to meet the sister who flew all the way from Texas to Spain. The family was informed that Nick underwent tremendous abuse so the child may not look like the same kid they lost or even have memories of the past. Upon meeting, Carey Gibson shares how she thought the grown up Nick looks like an uncle in the family. She proceeds to share pictures of the family, helping "Nick" remember some things.Passing the test of the authorities by luck, "Nick" was given a passport and was sent home with sister Carey back to their family. "Nick" remained quiet of the terrible ordeal he went through when he was abducted. He only started speaking up when FBI agent Nancy Fisher put him under questioning. This is when he relays the sexual abuse done to him and other kids by Mexican, European, and US military personnel before he was brought to Spain. "Nick" even went on national television to discuss his story and cement his identity. This only sparked the interest of private investigator Charles Barker.What comes next is the biggest twist you'll ever see in a documentary.A big part of the film involves interviews from the family of Nick Barclay and an interview with the Imposter himself, Frederic Bourdin. The Frenchman receives more airtime throughout the film making the viewers aware of how he is able to convince people with his deception. The most hair-raising quality of the documentary comes from the interview of Bourdin. How the film portrays him made him look as if he had no remorse at all with what he's done. But the biggest shock is later revealed and it will definitely keep you thinking even after the credits roll.While reenactments are frowned upon in the documentary world, The Imposter used it to give the film a mystery/thriller effect. It gave the picture a cinematic quality, allowing people to feel specific emotions as the story progressed. The treatment of the documentary is what sets it apart from others, some may even name it a much better thriller than what Catfish (2010) achieved. Great work from director Bart Layton although he had to break some laws in presenting a documentary just to create this flick. It is no wonder that it was one of the biggest highlights in the Sundance Film Festival 2012. One of the most talked about pieces of its run, this documentary is a twisted view of lies, secrets, and deception.The Imposter is a gripping, edge-of-your-seat thriller of a true story so bizarre that it will leave you shaken and divided when you try to stand up from your seat in the theater.writelikesundance.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Could This Have Happened</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started watching this film after midnight, thinking that I would stop after a few minutes and maybe come back to it another day. I couldn't stop watching. As the incredible subterfuge takes shape and snowballs into...a monstrosity, you want to say: "this is where it has got to collapse". Yet, it doesn't, until, finally, someone points out the obvious. In this case, it takes an MD and a PhD to come out an state that a boy, who grew up speaking English to the age of thirteen, would not be speaking with a thick French accent -- and somewhat broken English to boot.But, let's roll back for a minute. There's an under-appreciated aspect of the movie that ties into the zeitgeist, the theme, the hysteria of the 90's. In one scene the FBI agent on the case, Nancy Fisher, describes her first impression of "Nicholas" the impostor. She says that he did not look anything at all like the boy in the pictures. His eye color was wrong; he had coarse black (not blonde) stubble, which was indicative of someone much older than a 16yo teenager that Nicholas was supposed to be. Yet, she discards those tell-tale signs of deception and instead describes how fascinated she was with the impostor's outlandish, completely insane story of ritualistic sexual abuse that he claimed to have been subjected to. Why would she disregard the clear signs of deception in favor of pursuing an incredible story of abuse? Let's remember that this is the tail end of the sexual abuse hysteria era. The impostor's story was just right for the mass delusion that had been gripping the country throughout the 80's and into the early and mid- 90's. US AG is Janet Reno, whose claim to fame is prosecuting such dubious cases, so it's easy to see how a lowly FBI agent would be eager to jump on this incredible story. And the impostor, Bourdin, is acutely aware of this environment and knows all the societal sensitive parts. Amazingly, as one deception unravels, another outlandish theory creeps forward: the family killed Nicholas and hid his body and they were trying to get away with the crime by claiming that Nicholas is alive. Of course, this story fails to pass the Occam Razor test as well. Intentionally or not, this film manages to overlay personal tragedy on the background of the societal dysfunction, which makes for a very powerful bit of story-telling. Watch it. It will leave you reeling, confused, and a little sad...because, let's not forget: Nicholas had never been found.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Bart Layton gives a look at one specific case of Frédéric Bourdin who pretended to be a 16-year-old Texas missing teenager Nicolas Barclay - disappeared at the age of 13 from San Antonio, Texas on June 13, 1994. Three years later, Spanish police gets a call of tourists informing about a sixteen-year-old boy who refuses to get into contact with other people. They assumed that he was an American despite the lack of any identity. Police brought the guy in department for more information, but he did not seem to be very talkative. He was transferred to orphanage, where Frederic told everyone that he was kidnapped from the United States and hold as a hostage in Spain more than three years. Bourdin somehow (and you shall see movie to understand that) convinced everyone that, at the actual age of 23, he was a 16- year-old American boy.There is something really mystic - Nicolas was blond, blue-eyed boy and Frederic, on the contrary, was dark-eyed, black hair, French accented fellow, but every single person, including his "family" was sure that he was who he pretended to be. Barclay family took him in Texas and they restarted their lives. But FBI detective was the only one, who truly believed that there was something wrong with Nicolas. She could not understand how a little boy was taken from States to Europe, imperceptibly from FBI or other agencies. The only answer to this question was that Nicolas Barclay was not Nicolas Barclay in fact.You may ask, what I already asked to myself, how could he foolish whole family? Is it real that a mother can not recognize her child? Or maybe they know that a person, who they brought from Spain was not their child at all? - Searching for answers leads to another truth, that explodes to the end of the movie.Besides a very interesting story, that is told in The Imposter, Layton brings whole mystery in very interesting way - all events are told from perspective of Frederic, his "family", FBI agents and every person involved in case. At the end, you get enough information to discuss what really happened to Nicolas Barclay. I believe this truth goes beyond the crime of one French imposter Frederic Bourdin.</fullReview>

But, this is yet another documentary which proves me wrong. A 23 year old kid gets into a US based family as their 15 year old kid Nicholas who was missing from 3-4 years. He doesn't look like Nicholas and he doesn't even speak English well enough but pass through everyone be it Nicholas family, US delegates etc. Documentary tries to cover every aspect of people involved and how it happens. Documentary tries to have mystery aspect of why he does it and was their any hidden agenda of the family to let it happen which all makes it more exciting. This clearly give a message of how everyone needs to be careful and how easy it becomes to believe in something when there are emotions attached. What you can clearly see from cinema screen, is so much difficult to the real people themselves to see and to convince themselves. Movie also try to show that there might be a hidden agenda of their family but I felt its more of director trying to make movie more exciting rather than anything true. Overall, its an amazing documentary to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True or False?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If every detail of this didn't actually happen, it would be a fictional best-seller. Nicholas Barclay, a 13-year-old blonde-haired, blue-eyed Texan boy went missing in 1994. Three years later, on a rainy night in Spain, a person made a call to the police, claiming to be that boy. That person was in fact mentally afflicted con artist Frederic Bourdin, an Algerian orphan, who had a history of impersonating missing and fictional children. What an intriguing story, I hear you say. There's no question that it is. It might have been even more intriguing if the US media hadn't presaged this documentary, and therefore limited its potential impact, by covering the story in minute detail at the time of its unearthing, only 15 years ago. Filmmaker Bart Layton chooses the annoying reconstruction technique, more at home in TV than in cinema; and yet he had the material for a heart-pounding thriller. Frederic Bourdin is allowed too much screen time, which he uses to gloat about how he ingeniously fooled the authorities and Nicholas's family into believing the implausible reason for his radical physical transformation, memory loss and new French accent. This over-familiarity with the villain and his modus operandi helps sanitise him and makes him appear less dangerous. 'The Imposter' was not made purely for entertainment purposes. The documentary asks whether Bourdin's actions were acceptable; after all, he was an orphan whom the authorities didn't care much for. This was his way to be 'reborn' and to be loved by a family who Bourdin still maintains never truly believed he was their son, but nonetheless accepted him because he was willing to be accepted. The twist in the tale came when Bourdin made a full confession to dogged Private Investigator, Charlie Parker (who looks so much like a film PI). Bourdin claimed that the family murdered Nicholas, and embraced him as a way of closing the case. I admit that a cold chill ran down my spine every time Nicholas's mother is interviewed. The black t-shirt she wears with a blank expression, denying her guilt with verbose but carefully delivered sentences, does cause the question to hang. With all their power and their reputation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation fell for a trickster. It beggars belief. FBI agent Nancy Fisher talks at some length to defend her actions. Despite reservations about his true identity, Frederic's correct identification of some family photos (coincidentally showed to him by Nicholas's sister a few days prior) was apparently enough for them to send him to the States. And yet we're reminded of how rare it is for missing people to reappear (they're usually assumed dead). The family may have had their own reasons to be taken in by Bourdin, but the authorities - they couldn't have truly believed Bourdin was Nicholas, could they? Is it not just conceivable that this 'reunion' was allowed to happen because it allowed America to once again be the world's greatest country? Who knows? What we do know is that Nicholas Barclay is still missing, and Bourdin now lives happily in France with a wife and three kids.</fullReview>

I had never heard of this story in the news and it was a complete shock for me to hear about the events that took place.The most surprising element to the film is the fact that the "imposter" could successfully steal the identity of a missing child. You keep asking yourself how could this happen? How can a family make this mistake? The plot is intense and keeps you guessing "what will happen next?" It has some twists in it that I actually gasped while watching it alone and found my self sitting on the edge of my seat. I would absolutely recommend this documentary to anyone I know. I absolutely loved it. It was disturbing and mysterious on so many levels. It is, undoubtedly, a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As soon as I heard about The Imposters premier and Grand Jury award nomination at Sundance Festival I was intrigued, and even more so when it won the same titled award at Miami Film Festival. A documentary on one of histories biggest imposters, Frédéric Bourdin, often referred to as a 'serial liar', this part-documentary, part-live-action film paints an in depth portrait of Frédéric's biggest and best known scam with style. This particular case centres on when Frédéric managed to convince the American and Spanish authorities that he was Nicholas Barclay, a Texas boy who had disappeared at the age of 13 in 1994. This is all the more stranger considering that at the time, 1997, when Nicholas should have been approaching 16, Bourdin was 23, had different colour hair and eyes and a much different stature to that of the young blonde Texan boy. If that's not enough, I should mention he could hardly speak fluent English, let alone without a strong French accent. Bart Layton and Andrew Hulme, the director and editor respectively, combine brilliantly to create a perfect blend of recent interviews, archive footage and film style recreations to give the audience not only a detailed account of what happened during those months in 1997, but also a look into the personalities of the people surrounding it and the American government policies of the late 90's. Frédéric Bourdin's interviews are chilling and surreal. The way he recalls every conversation, movement and thought, however shocking each may be, may seem quite incredible, but what fascinated me was the was he tells each with humour, a smile on his face in some cases, providing some welcoming comic relief throughout. Furthermore, his honesty is really quite unexpected in such a situation ? he admits now, as he knew back then, that he was wrong in his mass spree of unrepentant lying, especially to an extremely vulnerable family (something, its revealed, he did on several occasions), and he also comments on the ridiculousness of the situation, and how he managed to avoid arrest for so long, not even he knows. But at the same time he describes the situation he was faced with and the options available. It makes the audience ask themselves, "what would I have done?".The proximity from camera to person during the interviews is also very interesting, especially with Bourdin who is centred on an extreme close- up, his eyes and facial expressions revealing a more personal dimension to the piece. The two family members who are consulted, Nicholas' mother and sister are placed further from the camera, and seem to be attempting to clear there names in some way, although failing quite badly ? many audience members actually burst out laughing at some of the comments made by the sister, and her role in this tale gets more and more peculiar as the documentary goes on. The FBI agent in question spends the whole 99 minutes attempting to save her own reputation, but again, falls very short, and her distance to the camera speaks volumes. The addition of Charlie Parker, a private investigator who, in 1998, set himself the task of finding out who Frédéric really was, is a welcomed addition, and gives the audience a viewpoint from someone who isn't trying to improve/save their reputation or hide an aspect of their involvement in the case. What impressed me most was the integration of different styles ? this is much more than a documentary, its entertaining and has undertones of a investigation-styled-thriller. Its entertaining and has real moments of comedy without detracting from the eeriness and surreality of the issue at hand ? something many films in this category fail to deliver. Adam O'Brien, who plays Frédéric in the live-action scenes in flawless, the way he cuts off acting mid scene to break the fourth wall and mime Bourdin's words is highly effective, and really gave me the impression that this is Frédéric wanting to tell his story, as much as Layton wanted to create a film on it. What stayed with me afterwards, you may be surprised to read, was not how crazy Bourdin may be, or how naive the officials who were judging the case were. Frédérics discovery is what makes this documentary truly effective ? but I have never been one for spoilers. Although you will, without a doubt, have to keep reminding yourself that this actually happened, this is a must see for any film or documentary lover, and is a top contender for the documentary of 2012.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deception is the juicy game.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1994 a 13-year-old San Antonio boy, Nick Gibson, vanished, setting off a chain of events to rival the most convoluted Hollywood thriller. The Imposter chronicles in re-enacted dramatic scenes, voice-over, and archival footage the strange re-emergence of the boy, the controversy surrounding his initial disappearance and his return, and the surprising theories that slowly emerge. Although the family readily accepts this young man (really 23-year-old Frederic Bourdin, found in Spain as their significantly-changed family member), a private detective notices a physical difference and a doctor determines the improbability of losing his American accent, the story juices up (after a slow first hour of set up) with some startling theories centering on the family's uncritical acceptance of this long-lost child. In fact most of the principals appear to be fabricating, making discovery of truth a challenge but always a delicious imitation of real life's deceptions. Hey, the film is not called "The Imposter" for nothing. At times, the documentary seems like a found footage Blair Witch, at others a B film with artsy angles and moody lighting wishing to snag national attention. Whatever, the actors are sufficiently like trailer-trash Texans to gives us the feeling of authenticity. Disappointingly the film lacks depth when it tries to deconstruct the protagonist's longing for familial love that leads him from Spain to Texas. Some fiction films have challenged viewers with this imposter motif, most notably Six Degrees of Separation and better, The Return of Martin Guerre, in which a man returns from war significantly changed . Perhaps there can be no full understanding of misfits, who can, as this film attests, be fun to watch as long as they Don't invade your family. Therefore, I have found a theme: Strangers bring change, sometimes profound sometimes banal but usually never dull.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A documentary about the locating in Spain of a missing teenage boy from Texas (he was 13 when he went missing), his hard-knocks family and the man impersonating the boy (!) claiming to have been kidnapped, sexually violated, threatened and experimented upon by military officials during the three long years of his absence.The true story unfolded in 1997 before the "modern age" of high-tech, up-to-date computers and so the con artist -- Frederic Bourdin -- was able to pull-off the early stages of the trans-Atlantic identity theft rather easily. It is only when his older sister flies to Spain to retrieve him when things get MORE interesting as she whole-heartedly accepts this brown-eyed man as her long-lost brother (Nicholas had blue eyes). The tale gets stranger when his entire family does ... !?!!? The less one knows about this the more enjoyable the documentary should be to an audience.This documentary is about a stranger-than-fiction true life story that gets stranger and stranger as the story plays out. It becomes a rather jaw-dropping, improbable thriller ... enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was unaware when I watched the movie/documentary that the older Frederic Bourdin - the Imposter - was being played by himself. At the time, I thought that he was an actor (which of course Bourdin is!) and I was most impressed by his narration and his facial expressions as he stared into the camera. His whole delivery was so professional and beguiling - I looked up the cast when I got home to see who the guy was. The fact that it was actually Frederic Bourdin himself was a pleasant surprise. I seem to be the only reviewer - so far - not to have found the movie/documentary compelling. It was brilliantly shot and well directed without a doubt, but it was overly long for the content. It seemed more suited to TV than to the cinema and it certainly was not edge-of -the-seat material, as suggested by others. I did not think that the family of the missing teenager were being set up as being stupid at all. They were honestly portrayed - indeed many of them portrayed themselves; they were relatively poor and uneducated but their humanity was apparent. They were either desperate to believe or hiding something - either is possible. The real star of the movie is Frederic Bourdin himself - a complex, psychopathic liar, whose depths remain a mystery, unfortunately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Imposter" stands out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever wanted something so badly that you'd have believed anything to make it come true? Bart Layton's The Imposter teeters on the border between feature film and documentary. While watching, you'll soon forget that the film is "educational", all connotations with the word considered, and find yourself being pulled in by it the same way a Hollywood production would. Storytelling techniques and seamless transitions create an immersive and thought provoking experience for the viewer, while subtle audio visual layers take your imagination by the hand and lead it into the realm of uncertainty, doubt, and existential questions. All things considered, the darkly curious events depicted in The Imposter among the most compelling you'll learn about in any documentary.Perhaps the most unique and provocative storytelling techniques that Layton uses are the split second, silent close up shots of Bourdin's face, sometimes accompanied by interview recordings, which express feelings of guilt, lament, pride, and joviality. Because of this, despite the number of layers and the depth of importance they hold, Bourdin remains fresh in the viewer's mind as the keystone to the entire story. These images also provide insight to Bourdin's psyche and his attitude towards those events.Everything about the film makes the viewer ask "why"? The "how" is explained to us, but the "why" remains obscure. Very little information is revealed about Bourdin's actual upbringing and several details throughout the film cause us to question his sanity. We question why he would do such a thing, why the San Antonio family allowed him to do it, and if we ourselves have the capacity to replace our own loved ones with strangers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is he or isn't he?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Semi-documentary centered around the unbelievable case of a French con man who posed as a missing American boy and almost got away with it. 13 year old Nick Barclay disappears in Texas in 1994, seemingly reappears a few years later in Spain, but looks nothing like the original (natural ageing not withstanding). Yet on return in the States, he is hailed by "his" family as the actual missing child, until the web of lies on both sides just can't do anything but unravel completely. The imposter is outed as a French swindler who has been passing himself off as missing children before, despite being in his late twenties. The real questions the film then tries to answer revolves around the ease with which the family accepted the con man. As their preferred explanation, the filmmakers suggest the possibility someone in the family was involved with Nick's supposed death, which his relatives tried to cover up. No hard evidence for this theory is presented though. The film consists of interviews with the various parties involved, intercut with re-enactments of what they claim transpired. This movie in a lot of ways emulates the mischievous protagonist himself, posing as a documentary and even being accepted as such, while obviously heavily fictionalized. Still, in many instances it's quite unclear where the truth ends and the fiction begins. This could have made for a more intriguing film were it not for its over-reliance on talking heads, which soon gets tedious (especially when they repeat themselves). The failure to account for what really happened to poor little Nick also makes for a frustrating ending: though this cannot be contributed to the filmmakers, their emphasis on their own speculation regarding Nick's death at the hands of his family, which is investigated quite thoroughly near the end of the film and then briskly discarded as a mere theory, also makes for an unsatisfying climax. This film undeniably applies an interesting format to tell its incredible story, but the number of narrative lies employed to make it more tense end up doing some injustice to its contents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a great story, but not a great documentary? A good documentary is supposed to have a perspective, and then present evidence to support that perspective. Here, it just felt like they had many different scenarios, (the family were idiots/the family were involved/the woman working for the FBI was negligent? ). and just wanted to play with the audience as much as the criminal did? Pick an angle to emphasise, and allow the viewer to determine the merits of the case made, instead of leaving them just as clueless as they were before they started watching. I could have found out everything in the documentary from reading articles and reports; what i want a documentary to do is shape a hypothesis for me, and then I can decide whether I agree with it, or not. If we're judging on the interest value of the story alone, then the events are fascinating, and worthy of high marks? I just think the material could have been better organised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great documentary on a bizarre story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A testament to this great documentary is the fact that I could stop thinking about it all night after watching it and quickly became convinced that I knew what happened. This is more a 'what I think happened' than an actual review as such. But I felt compelled to write it.Spoilers ahead:I became convinced that sometime around the day of Nicholas' disappearance he was either murdered or accidentally killed by his older brother. He was probably then driven to a local woodland/wilderness and buried. I also believe he later confessed to the mother, and whatever happened he probably embellished the story to make it seem a total accident. Of course as the family themselves readily said, there's no real evidence. This is unless a body is found which is unlikely as the older brother is now dead.Of course, I have little to go on other than a gut feeling but here's my reason's.At the start of the documentary two things initially caused my ears to prick up and didn't sit right with me. Firstly, that the last person to speak to Nicholas was his older brother, on the phone, who told him he wouldn't wake his mother up and he'd have to walk home. I remember hearing this and thinking that the older brother must be devastated after knowing that. But later when I found out more about the brother I thought that this phone call was just a weak bluff and probably never happened.The mother never flew to Spain. Apparently this was due to health reasons and they didn't go into that but if my son was found under these circumstances then you try and stop me from taking the first plane out there to him. Unless of course I knew he was already dead and there was no point.The fact that the sister went out there alone is testament to me that she probably didn't know her brother was dead. She may have her suspicions, but wanted to believe they weren't true. Of all the family, although she appears the most ignorant at times, saying things like 'Spain isn't that like the other side of the country?' She also appears to be the one who actually still hopeful Nicholas might still be alive. The fact that nobody says 'What a minute that's not Nicholas!' is also pretty condemning. They all seem to wait for someone else to say and when nobody does, they just go with it despite the obvious differences and the fact that Nicholas is now half Algerian. The only person who seems to question it? The older brother who knew it wasn't him. But he doesn't make a fuss.I can't take Bourdin's word for much as he is a prolific liar but he certainly is a pragmatic man and by the end he seems pretty convinced that the family or some of the family killed Nicholas and he just wants to get Hell out of there.Later an FBI agent speaks to the sister and convinces her not to meet Nicholas as the airport when he arrives back in Texas. She seems to agree at the time, but later she turns up anyway. I think this is because in the time between, the mother twisted her and convinced her that the FBI was lying to her.Soon after the FBI turn up at the family home and again the mother blocks the investigation literally with her body, lying on the floor of her doorway. She denies this but I'm afraid I don't believe a word she says at this point. Why would she do this? Is this a mother desperate to cling on to a lie that her son isn't dead? Or a mother feeling the net closing around her?Then we have perhaps the most damning piece of circumstantial evidence which is the phone call made by the older brother two days after Nicholas' disappearance. This seems to me like a clumsy, drug dealers attempt to say 'Hey my brother's still alive and he's trying to break in. I didn't kill him look?' Again this seems very typical behaviour of a drug abuser. Although admittedly it is possible that the crime had nothing to do with the older brother and he was just concerned the finger might be pointed at him because of his reputation. But then lastly when the FBI finally contact him in a drug rehab facility asking him questions he suddenly goes AWOL and next turns up dead from an overdose. Again it's all circumstantial but it looks to me like he saw the net closing and got out the only way he knew how.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Constantly unsettling, but impossible to switch off once started, The Imposter is a slow burning, but intense documentary that looks into the case of Nicholas Barclay, who went missing in 1994, but was thought to have been found in 1997, unbeknownst to many that he was someone else entirely. The Imposter sets itself apart with the presentation of interviews with reenactments interspersed, both a fascinating and distracting stylistic approach. Still, the strength of the subject material is all so gripping, slowly evolving from simple stolen identity to conspiracy mystery. Specifically, the main subject (whose real name I won't reveal) is a fascinating person. Whether or not anything that he says is actually true, he is a very interesting individual. It's the kind of documentary that makes you question so called "facts".**** / *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a documentary, The Imposter was well shot, but I don't know how well it will do in theatres as the subject matter is based on the success of lying and the gullibility of ordinary people. Frederic Bourdain was not a likable character, and had absolutely no feelings of remorse whatsoever throughout the entire film. There was little information touched on his past, and I felt the documentary was a little sensationalist attempting to lure audiences into the premise that it was more murder-mystery than the "catch me if you can" skill of a career criminal and habitual liar. In fact, I left the theatre feeling that more attention was paid to the cinematics rather than fleshing out the story. Was there any deep investigation into the characters of the family?At least in Man on Wire (produced by the same team), the audience could admire the lead character's skill rather than despise his ability and necessity to lie in The Imposter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ImposterIt is a British film talking about an international fraud.The way of using cameras, the Montages, the quick cuts and the effects of education rather than entertainment, made me feel that I was watching some British TV channels.A boy disappeared in one country and was claimed to be by another person in another country after four years. Then the families of the missing boy accepted the stranger with no doubt. Ultimately, an inspector found the new one could not match the boy's ears and the fraudster was identified by fingerprint.I think some audiences were also wondering that if the family had killed the son as there should be a conclusion. However, the boy's missing was still a mastery in the end.It was a strange psychological thing if it could happen when people wanted their missing loves so much that they could not recognize their details. How could you imagine a mother who doesn't know his son's shapes of ears?The case had been closed as there was no enough evidence. So the missing ones were sacrificed by the flawed society and the limitation of human's brains.As the film's name is Imposter, I guess it wanted to focus on how serious the fraud itself was. If it was adapted from a true story, there comes a question: how many imposters are stealing public resources that they are not entitled to use?Well, to be honest, it is not a film for fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The many theories the film has become too much that the film becomes overly loaded with too much ideas that distract from the main point of this man who pretends to be missing children all over the world" The hell some people can be put through when someone is there family is either murdered or missing can be horrible but when someone pretends to be that person that is just the worst thing someone could do. The documentary centres around a missing child case of a 13 year old boy named Nicholas Barclay who went missing in 1994. Three years later someone in Spain pretends to be Nicholas which turns the film the in much different directions as you don't know whose story to believe in the end.The film is a mix of real interviews from the family of Nicholas but also we get some reenactments of scenes especially when Frédéric Bourdin was in Spain preparing to be Nicholas to get into America. The reenactments didn't work for me because I found them laughable how bad they were. Also the consistent use of Frédéric describing every minor detail in the first part of the film was annoying but it is a documentary. The fact at the end there is no satisfying conclusion because Nicholas has not been found and Frédéric once free continues to act as different people was just strange. The interviews with the family did not convince me if they murdered Nicholas or not because they didn't seem to be telling the truth and just didn't want to come out as the bad guys in the documentary. Frédéric of course comes out as the bad guy when we are told of the many other crimes he committed pulling the same scheme and he never seemed ashamed of hurting people like he did.Frédéric Bourdin was responsible for so much hurt for people and in the end he was not punished enough which made no sense especially since he know lives a normal life after causing such horror for so much people. The family member who was the most honest to me was the sister Carey because everything she recalled about the events seemed truthful and honest even her final thoughts about Frédéric was believable. The use of the law in the film was insightful to listen to because they were the ones telling all the facts about this horrible man.The film was a mess with the reenactments but the truthful interviews from Frédéric Bourdin and Carey Gibson was enough to keep my attention throughout even if I found some of the documentary creepy and laughable.MOVIE GRADE: C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent documentary, which left me open-mouthed in disbelief. What is equally fascinating is that the plot of this real-life drama is that of the rarely-seen "Paranoiac" (1963). In Jimmy Sangster's clever screenplay a man (Alexander Davion) turns up at a country estate claiming to be Tony Ashby, long-lost brother of Simon Ashby (Oliver Reed). Simon has good reason for doubting Tony's claim. It turns out that Simon murdered the real Tony. The implication in "The Imposter" is that something similar happened without the imposter knowing. Someone may be able to quote another example of a piece of fiction that has later become reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange days...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1994 in Texas, a 13 year old boy called Nicholas Barclay vanished. Three years later his family received a call from Spanish authorities informing them that their son had been found loitering over there. The boy was taken across the Atlantic and back to his family. The only trouble was that the boy now spoke with a French accent, was seven years older, was taller, had different coloured eyes and had a completely different face. His personality was completely at odds to before and he didn't recognise anybody or any place from his former home. Nicholas's family accepted him back into the fold with no concern.You often hear the phrase 'reality is stranger than fiction'. It's one that usually annoys me a little as it is virtually never accurate and simply a lazy cliché. However, the story covered by this documentary is one of those rare occasions where it is undoubtedly true. If Hollywood had made a film with this plot the audience would be angered by the liberties being taken. They would think that they were being taken for fools with such a far-fetched story. Having seen The Imposter I still can't really fathom exactly how it came to be that con artist Frédéric Bourdin ever got to first base with his scheme to take on another completely dissimilar boy's identity. Perhaps it was a lethal combination of components, namely a man who wants to con and a family who, subconsciously or otherwise, wish to be conned.The film is structured quite cleverly where we begin by sort of sympathising with Bourdin. At first he seems like a desperate youth who has bit off more than he can chew and has put himself into a situation he simply can no longer get himself out of easily. But as the film enters its final moments we are given the full background on this seemingly likable rogue and by the end we feel like we have been duped by him too to a certain extent. The members of the Barclay family are certainly an odd bunch. Are they really so stupid to have fallen for this ludicrous hoax? Could any group of people be? Or is there more going on than immediately meets the eye? Were they so set on Nicholas's return that they were willing to accept a replacement no matter what? Or was there more sinister reasons? The latter is explored where allegations are made that family members actually were implicated in the death of the boy, so this con man's appearance was something of a gift. The family members of course refute this scenario and it was one promoted by Bourdin who is hardly the most trustworthy source. Whatever the case there were hints at troublesome history within the Barclay family, which seemed to involve serious hard drug taking. The older brother OD'd sometime around the time of this bizarre narrative took place.The story itself is fascinating in itself. You want to know how this could have happened although as I say many questions remain. But at times there is a black absurdist comedy element to proceedings. This is quite often a result of how the participants describe how events unfolded but there are also peripheral characters who add light relief, such as the elderly private investigator who was fixated on ears. Having said all of this, it should never be forgotten that at the heart of this story is the disappearance and almost certain murder of a 13 year old boy. According to the family it never even made the news, which is shocking in itself. So The Imposter is a documentary that details an incident that began with a tragedy and then become absurd. Frédéric Bourdin's actions were cold and heartless in the way he gave false hope to a family and then kicked them when they were down. The Barclays themselves remain a bit of a strange enigma.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An obviously well made and decently budgeted documentary however I couldn't stand watching a documentary that gives a podium to some weasel of a little maggot grinning and bragging on about how clever he thought he was for being so deceptive. However this film could be used as a supreme example of the modern day American affliction of being fluoridated, over medicated, dumb-ucated and vaccine-toxic making so many just plain stoopid. Seriously the weasel looks absolutely nothing like their missing child even given a three year age difference. I hope everyone involved in this case (real life) were given an opportunity to kick the little bastard in the balls several times. 5/10 for production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was all the fuss about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The viewers who gave this a multi-star glowing review must have watched a different film to me.The Imposter had a very simple premise: White skinned, blond, blue- eyed, wimpy framed eleven year old Texan kid goes missing in 1994. Three years later a dark hared, brown eyed, darkish skinned, French accented, muscular youth turns up in Spain and claims to be the missing child.Sitting there, watching this film, the first thought that occurred is that these people are so stupid, the whole thing must be a spoof. But it isn't. According to the blurb and associated information on the internet this is actually a true story and yes the family who took in the 'returnee' were obviously completely stupid. As were the FBI and Social Services who got involved in this.Why was this made into a film? It could have been condensed from its 90 minute running time to a half an hour and shown on the Sky Unwatchable channel at 3am.It's not as if this is a psychological thriller. It was just plain boring.So save yourself a wasted night out and give this one a miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We rent a movie about once a week. some are bad and some are good, a few are awesome. I will rate this movie close to awful due to two main reasons and one purely personal opinion: 1. It is your standard run-of-the-mill-US-tragedy documentary, the type you (if you live in Sweden), can see for free on daytime TV on channel 8, 9 and 10. I do not understand the hyped up ratings on the front. As a documentary it was fairly amateurish with to much interview-face-time and to many chopped up scenes making it hard to really get into the story behind.With this said I realize that it (like any other tragedy involving family members) was a horrible event for the family involved, but I won't raise rating due to pure empathic reasons.2. There was only one place on the DVD-cover that foretold that this was, in fact, a documentary. Unfortunately that spot had a sticker on top of it (courtesy of the place where we rented it) which is why we didn't notice until it was to late. Said spot is one of the reviews on front of the movie. It was not mentioned anywhere on the back. Quite the opposite, the movie was from age 15+ which is usually the group with the most terrifying horror movies, the darkest murder stories and movies where there is a lot of naked skin involved.The story on the back gave a very promising introduction and even though another front-side review mentioned "true story" we never had the impression that this was anything other than a regular movie. One with normal actors doing their job in normal scenes, interacting on set and perhaps a bit of added excitement as spice.Personal reflection. Imagine dropping down on to the sofa, glass of wine in hand, ready to be immersed into an intriguing story just to realize that you sit facing a dull criminal documentary. A documentary in the disguise of a regular movie, a documentary they charged $8 for (50SEK). A documentary which isn't even anything special when compared to what you see on daytime TV.The most personal part of this, one which might paint me out to be a bad person mentioning, was the irritation I felt. Paying $8 to watch a very smug and slimy person boasting about his part in bad events. I don't want to have been part in paying that salary. ---In the future I will remember to watch IMDb on my phone before choosing a movie. Although the process of making the initial choice is usually time-consuming enough as it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was so dull it was the first film I have ever returned to the store I bought it from so the director doesn't get my money for this utter piece of crap.The story is boring and I learnt more about the kidnapping by reading a news article about it. The news article was also better written than the entire film.I really don't know how this was allowed to be released.If you want to be bored out of your mind for two hours then please watch it but if you have any sense you will find all copies of this movie and destroy them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless Exploitation of a Missing Child</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you plan to see this documentary, you likely already know the full story. I hope that the director at least set out to shed light on this case and answer questions as to how it could happen. Sadly, the movie falls short in these two key areas. Instead we are treated to a film where the director mocks the victim's families, promotes the perpetrator and ultimately trivializes the disappearance of a 13 year old boy. Since the director has nothing to add, all we are left with are tasteless attempts at humor and an ill-fitting Wes Anderson soundtrack. I understand the need to recoup costs when making a documentary, but sometimes you just hit a dead end and it should be treated as such.</fullReview>
