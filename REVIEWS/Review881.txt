		<shortDescription>Succeeds in its aims, despite the plot holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set during an unspecified future era on Earth, Westworld features Peter Martin (Richard Benjamin) and John Blane (James Brolin) on their way to a new kind of amusement park, Delos, located way out in the middle of a desert. Delos is divided into three "virtual reality" areas, Roman World, Medieval World, and West World (or Westworld). These are not mere computer simulations, however. Guests are immersed in a complete recreation of the relevant eras--they wear the clothing, sleep in the accommodations, eat the food, and so on, relevant to the era. They also interact with robots that are nearly indistinguishable from humans, and can talk to, have sex with, and even kill some robots. It's an escapist's dream, at least until something goes wrong.Westworld isn't the easiest film to rate. It has its share of faults, and the more one analyzes the plot, the more problems one can find. However, the premise is so fantastic, the atmosphere is so good (even though it's very spartan for a sci-fi film) and the performances from the principle actors are so entertaining that it is very easy to excuse any flaws and just "go with the film". The bottom line is how enjoyable or aesthetically rewarding a film is, not how logically taut the plot is. On those grounds, Westworld certainly deserves a 9 out of 10.A lot of the attraction is the voyeuristic escapism experienced by the viewer. Who wouldn't want to be able to go to an amusement park like Delos? It's a fabulous idea, and a not-too-thinly-veiled satire/extrapolation of Disney World, which had just opened two years before this film was released (remember that Disney World is the Florida location; Disneyland is the California location). Walt Disney had already been talking about his original conception of EPCOT (which was quite different than the Epcot that was eventually opened in 1982) by 1967. Writer/director Michael Crichton's Delos is a rough combination of Disney World's theme parks with an EPCOT-like residency, if only a temporary one. At the same time, computer and robot technology was finally starting to be strongly integrated into industry on an "everyday" level (it was just a bit more than 5 years until the beginning of the home computer revolution). Disney World's operational infrastructure is an extensive behind-the-scenes computer network, which Crichton parallels with his white lab coat-wearing scientists working amidst monitors and banks of flashing lights (and this is even better satirized in the sequel to Westworld, 1976's Futureworld).The premise provides an easy launching pad for a number of ethical, philosophical and scientific dilemmas: What are the implications for killing someone when they seem almost identical to humans? What if they're artificially intelligent? Is it infidelity for married persons to have sex with robots almost identical to humans or artificially intelligent? If machines become sufficiently complex, won't they be prone to the same flaws as humans, such as viruses (or something analogous), and if artificially intelligent, disobedience? All of these questions and more are explored in Westworld, albeit most are not explicitly broached--probably in an attempt to avoid sounding preachy or over-intellectual.Because at the heart of Westworld, at least on a surface level, is a fantastic thriller/suspense story. Once things begin to go wrong, the "play" turns deadly, and the end of the film is a very long, deliberately paced chase sequence. Yul Brynner is a menacing "Robot Gunslinger", in a character that Brynner thought of as an ominous satire on his Chris Adams from The Magnificent Seven (1960), and which eventually seems somewhat prescient of The Terminator (1984). The suspense/horror is based on a classic gambit of machines forcefully taking control of their creators. It may be more modern, but basically the threat is that of the wronged Frankenstein Monster, with all the attendant subtexts, including humans "playing God" as they create other beings in their own image, and dehumanization of the Other.It's best while watching to not dwell on the quagmire of plot problems that aren't dealt with. If the guns in Westworld can't harm humans because of "heat sensors", what's to stop you from being shot if someone aimed at something inanimate that you happened to be standing behind? How do the swords in Medieval World not harm that land's guests? If guests can't be hurt, why are they thrown into tables, the bar, etc. during a brawl? (We could argue that the robots were already going haywire at that point, but the technicians aren't shown being alarmed by this behavior.) How do they fix all of the architectural damage done every day? Where are all the other guests? Wouldn't it cost a lot more than $1000 per day per guest to make all of those repairs and perform routine maintenance on the robots?That's just a small sampling of the questions you could worry about while watching the film, but that would be missing the point. Westworld isn't intended as a blueprint for actually constructing a Delos-like amusement park. The idea is to get the viewer to fantasize about the scenario, enjoy the more visceral, literal suspense story, and at the same time ponder some of the more philosophical questions and subtexts. On those accounts, Westworld greatly succeeds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Boy, have we got a vacation for you...where nothing can go wrong!"Well, as the old saying goes..."famous last words.""Westworld" is supposed to be set in the future (as visualized back in 1973 when the film was made, apparently the computers of the future are really, really big, and the monitors are really, really small, lol), where pampered rich folk can go to a vacation resort named "Delos", where they choose one of three "worlds" to visit and interact in: Medieval World, Roman World, and Westworld. Our protagonists John Blaine and Peter Martin (played by James Brolin and Richard Benjamin, respectively) choose Westworld. John is a Westworld veteran, having visited many times. Peter is his friend and first-timer at the resort; uttering childlike statements such as "Do we get a real gun? Wow!" In the various "worlds", the guests interact with each other and with anatomically-correct, extremely realistic robots. They are able to *ahem* interact very closely with the female robots, and also shoot the mean robots for fun (the guns they are supplied with will not work on real people) as they wish. A real "cowboys and indians" scenario for the child in us all. Roman World is promoted as a big sex resort, and Medieval World is geared towards the romantic, it seems.The film starts out with quite a lot of intentional comedy and satire, and frankly starts out very much like it could have been a 1970's TV "Movie of the Week", but once the robots start to go bad...what we have for the rest of the film is a truly creepy western/sci-fi film. It's a gunfight! Albeit a Sci-Fi one. The last half-hour of the film is essentially a silent movie, as Crichton said he wanted, save for the great soundtrack, which sounds something like a bow being drawn against piano strings, or a cello; anyway it has the same unsettling effect as the out-of-tune piano in another classic, "Wait Until Dark" (1967).Movies with robots/androids...there have been many I have seen and loved. But for this review I will cite examples of what I consider to be scary robots in film, besides "Westworld": "The Stepford Wives" (1974), "Alien" (1979), "Blade Runner" (1982), "The Terminator" (1984), "Aliens", "The Companion" (1995). But "Westworld" was the first scary robot film I ever saw. And even after the others that followed, nothing quite equals Yul Brynner in his role as the gunslinger robot gone bad in "Westworld." His performance is what really makes the movie. Brynner was a good actor, and even (aybe especially) playing a machine, his skill is used to great effect. His performance was anything but wooden (unlike the always wooden Ah-nold in "The Terminator", for instance). When Brynner's robot gunslinger commands "Draw", with the slightest twist at the corner of his mouth, he is completely creepy and scary. Even the way he walks when hunting down Richard Benjamin's character has an element to it that I have never seen again. What's also great about this film is the development of Benjamin's character of Peter Martin. He starts out as the inexperienced nerdy sidekick to Brolin's John Blaine, and ends up showing his true mettle as the going gets rough. The nerdy naive Martin quickly learns how to survive. This was Sci-Fi writer/director Michael Crichton's first foray into big-screen film-making. Crichton has said he made the film in thirty days. I would expect that finding pre-made sets were easy at least; there was bound to be at least a western set sitting around the studio lots. And of course, back then there were fewer and less complicated special effects.If you find a DVD of this to rent, and you've never seen the film before, I recommend that you do not watch the trailer first! It's a real spoiler.Note: Look for Majel Barrett (of "Star Trek-Generations", and she is also Gene Roddenberrys' widow) as the whorehouse madam. Brynner's part was a play on his role in the classic western film "The Magnificent Seven."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jurassic Park Version 1.0</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Westworld was the blueprint for what was later Jurassic Park. Here, Michael Crichton first envisoned Disneyland, if the Hall of presidents ran amuck. It provided many of the inspirations for later sci-fi films, like Terminator. It was a great blend of action, horror, and comedy.Richard Benjamin and James Brolin are the heroes of the film, but Yul Brynner is the star. He portrays a robot, based on his character from "The Magnificent Seven." Brynner is the relentless killing machine who fights until the end. With almost no dialogue, he conveys fear with little more than expression and body language.The film explores old themes, the dark side of technology, but it was ahead of its time in depicting the dangers of computers and automated systems. The effects are dated, but the story holds up well. The sequel, Futureworld, tried to add political intrigue, with less success. Definitely one for the sci-fi fan or collector, or cult movie lover.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic sci-fi thriller of the 70's, Westworld is a film that never fails to be fun and riveting in its own campy way.Two pals go on vacation to a hi-tech resort where they can live out a wild west adventure among human-like robots. Unfortunately, the robots are starting to malfunction and our human guests may be in for more excitement than they bargained for.Michael Crichton delivers a clever and engaging story with this film. It packs plenty of intense action and increasing suspense, that firmly keeps the viewer on edge! Crichton's direction is also solidly well-done, creating a believable feel with the help of some good special FX (especially with the droids).Cast-wise the film is great as well. Yul Brynner does a wonderfully creepy performance as the robotic gunslinger that just won't stop coming! Richard Benjamin does a nice turn as the timid visitor who must fight to survive, as does his friend played by James Brolin.Westworld is truly enjoyable sci-fi/thriller excitement and stands as one of the best genre films of the '70s.*** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Crichton wrote and directed this precursor to "Jurassic Park" that, while showing some of it's age, is still effective and was undeniably influential. The story concerns a unique and expensive vacation resort called Delos in which customers can choose from one of three "worlds"--Roman World, Medieval World or Western World (as it is referred to in the film.) Here, customers can indulge their fantasies of conquest (violent or sexual) among a host of ultra-realistic robots who are programmed to promote the experience while not allowing the participants to become hurt. Benjamin stars as a newcomer to the place with his buddy Brolin along for his second visit. Brolin shows Benjamin the ropes at Western World (how to shoot villains, seduce dance hall girls, etc...) One of the bad guys they encounter is icy Brynner who they dispose of more than once. Eventually, things start to come unglued as the men note that things aren't working as properly as expected and promised. The controllers of the park are unable to prevent the robots from hurting or even killing the guests! The film begins with that once-cutting-edge, but now amusing, sense of high-tech awe as the guys enter the park. Benjamin is an acquired taste and borders on annoying for much of the film. More at ease is Brolin who doesn't have a great deal to do. The most striking performance is that of Brynner. He has almost nothing to say, but he doesn't need to talk. His steely stare and mechanical gait wind up being quite relentless and terrifying. The highlight of the film is his non-stop pursuit of Benjamin. ("The Terminator" owes a lot to this section of the film.) There are several other supporting roles, but, aside from Van Patten, the actors create little interest in their exploits. "Star Trek" fans will note the presence of Barrett as a robot madame. There were rumors of a remake with Arnold Schwarzegger, but Arnie's already done the indestructible robot thing and no one's going to outglare Brynner. His bid as Governor seems to have quashed these plans anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great movie about an amusement park with robots to entertain you and for you to experience life in the three different worlds. Yul Brynner as the gunfighter is truly excellent and yes, scary as hell.To nitpick a movie from the 70s is truly childish. It was interesting, action/sci-fi. Well paced, reasonably written well. Great chase scene at the end, because if the Gunslinger was coming after me, I'd be scared. And, as far as I know, the first movie to mention a 'virus' in the machines.You might as well complain about the bombs in Dark Star having intelligence. Why would a bomb need AI? But if it didn't, the ending wouldn't have been as interesting.It's like complaining about movies from the 50s, like 'War of the Worlds' or 'Forbidden Planet'. They worked with what they had and had no ideal about what would or could be done in the future. OMG, 1984 didn't happen like Orwell said. Guess we should toss his book in the trash. Too many people nitpicking silly things. Ever heard of entertainment?If your a REAL sci-fi fan, watch it. You won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can see the roots both in the plot and the special effects in Michael Crichton's Westworld that can later be found in the incredibly popular Jurassic Park series. Like Jurassic Park the protagonists of Westworld are a pair of wealthy American yuppies who are going to a futuristic vacation resort. The place is called Delos and like Disneyland with its separate theme parks of Fantasyland, Adventureland, Frontierland, and the World of Tomorrow, Delos has three different resort type places to visit, Romanworld, Medievalworld and Westworld.Our two intrepids have chosen the Westworld experience. They get to mix and mingle in an old west frontier town, or at least a Hollywood type version of same and get the feel of western life. Included are gunfights and bar brawls such as you see in any good Hollywood western. This is what Richard Benjamin and James Brolin have chosen for themselves.For reasons unexplained in the story, the whole thing breaks down in all three theme worlds and in the case of Westworld, a very nasty gunslinger robot has shaken loose from his programming and is on the hunt for human targets. Will man with all of his weaknesses defeat an apparently indestructible machine?You can also see some of the themes in the later Terminator films that Arnold Schwarzneggar popularized. Here the relentless hunter is played by Yul Brynner in the familiar black western garb that he made popular in The Magnificent Seven. The VHS copy of Westworld advertises itself as the very first use of computer graphics. If that's the case this is one unique experience for that reason alone and should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Crichton is a versatile man whose career as a novelist would seem to be satisfying enough without trying his hand at the movies. After all, most of his books have been adapted for the screen. This was his first attempt at directing a big feature. He showed in "Westworld" an affinity for the film medium.Mr. Chrichton employed computer technology that was in its infancy at the time. The result is a movie that is entertaining even after more than thirty years after it was released. Most of Mr. Crichton's books deal in science fiction.The best thing in the film is Yul Brynner, without a doubt. His presence dominates everything. As the Gunslinger, he shows intelligence and tenacity in dealing with those that dared to cross him. Richard Benjamin is also effective as the young lawyer who is fascinated by the things he finds in Westworld. James Brolin's character seemed to be on auto pilot as he didn't register much emotion throughout the entire movie.The film merits a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Vacation of the Future Today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a near future, the Delos Company offers the vacation of the future in the present days in the amusement parks Medievalworld, Romanworld and Westworld for U$ 1,000.00 per day. The vacationers can feel in the Middle Age or in the Roman Empire or in the Wild West and have joust, sex, duel against gunslinger and whatever he or she wants interacting with robots. Peter Martin (Richard Benjamin) and John Blane (James Brolin) travel in the hovercraft to Westworld and sooner Peter duels against a Gunslinger (Yul Brynner). However, when there is a malfunctioning of the machinery, the robots get out of control jeopardizing the guests."Westworld" is a very successful sci-fi of my generation and a sort of grandfather of other robots films, such as "The Stepford Wives", "Blade Runner" and mainly "The Terminator". There is a scene in this last franchise that is an updated rip-off of Yul Brynner's character chasing Peter.The story has flaws, but is engaging and suspenseful, holding the attention until the very last scene. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Westworld ? Onde Ninguém Tem Alma" ("Westworld ? Where No One Has Soul")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful mix of Sci-Fi, Western and .... creepiness!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer/director Michael Crichton clearly has an interest in amusement theme parks where things go horribly wrong! His most successful achievement "Jurassic Park" revolves on this ingenious premise, but so does this "Westworld" which predates Spielberg's box-office hit by 20 years! And maybe I don't know anything about cinema, but I sure think this film is at least ten times better and more unsettling than "Jurassic Park". Despite some flaws and script-errors, Crichton's film is a tense milestone that is ultimately compelling and far ahead of its time. In a near future, a couple of slick marketeers have developed a holiday resort where rich tourists are offered imaginative vacations in perfect copies of the ancient Rome, a medieval countryside or the Wild West. The story mainly focuses on Westworld, where robot gunslingers like Yul Brunner (even more brilliant than usual) are programmed to die bloodily whenever a jolly tourist challenges them to a duel. That is, until suddenly the central computer begins the malfunction and the robots stand up for themselves. The last half hour is amazingly suspenseful and contains some grueling images that'll definitely excite horror fans. The set pieces and costumes are excellent and with a great eye for detail. For the legendary actor Yul Brunner, this was an ideal movie to conclude his brilliant career and simultaneously a great opportunity to bring homage his entire repertoire. Slightly negative elements about "Westworld" include the rather goofy choice of music and the abrupt ending. Although this last remark may be a purely personal point of criticism, since I really wanted the film to go on for another hour or so. Great movie...terrific entertainment!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think a lot of later evil robot films including 'The terminator' borrowed a lot of ideas from this film. Even 'The Predator' got a lot of ideas from this. (The robot vision mode, the heat sensing)This film is totally original. i don't see any title that came before this that had the same ideas. Michael Crichton is one of the most creative people in this business. Although i think he did re-use the Westworld amusement park concept with Jurassic Park (Carnosaur). Just replacing androids with dinosaurs. It pretty much the same concept: Man made environment that falls to chaos.And the most bizarre part of the film is the pervasiveness it transmits. Its so pervasive. It really titillates you with its concept. The female droids and how they are used. Its crazy.And the fact that three different cultures (The wild west, Rome, and medieval england) all spill over each other. That is really wild.Great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The age old science fiction question.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What happens when robots are integrated into our society, and they malfunction turning against humans? Westworld is an early attempt at this genre of science fiction, being released in 1973. The subject matter is tackled in a creative way. This film takes place at America's newest and most popular amusement park. Guests are able to choose from a variety of three realistically simulated situations all referred to as worlds; Romanworld, Medievalworld, and of course Westworld. Romanworld is barely in the film at all only showing very brief glimpses. There is actually a decent amount of Medievalworld shown throughout the film. Unfortunately, there was never a big joust sequence even though it was hinted at. Main focus, as if you didn't know from the title, is Westworld. The movie starts off at a slow pace introducing the concept, and effectively giving us a cinematic representation of what it would be like for a first timer at the park. Once the newcomer gets comfortable in his setting with the help of his friend who has lived the experience all ready, the movie picks up the pace and remains rather action oriented throughout the duration. All of the typical things you would expect tourists to do in an old west setting where there are no consequences, start occurring including; shootouts, bar fights, jailbreaks, friendly saloon visits, etc? A little over halfway through a serious problem happens, the scientists are no longer in control of their robots. I will not get into details, as I would hate to ruin the film. The acting all around is decent, but in particular Yul Brynner, as the gunslinger robot, shines in what might be the best portrayal of a robot I have ever seen in film. A true classic, and one of my favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Westworld (1973) ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin my comments, let me admit right from the start that this is one of my very favorite movies of all time. I fell in love with it when I first saw it in the theatre at age 12 and I've never gotten over it. Even though I'm much older today, I maintain beyond personal nostalgic bias that WESTWORLD is a tight, brisk, intense, thrilling, totally satisfying 88 minutes of good fun.Somewhere in the near future, an enterprise called Delos has developed the ultimate vacation resort. For the cost of a mere $1,000 a day, adult guests may choose to live their fantasies out in one of three different environments: Romanworld, Medievalworld, or Westworld. These resorts are each populated by very human-like robots who are programmed to serve every whim of the customer. State of the art computer technology ensures that everything's safe and that nothing can possibly go wrong.Richard Benjamin and James Brolin are two cowboy-wannabe friends who choose the 1880's Westworld for their unusual getaway. They make love to robot saloon women, participate in wild bar room brawls, and frequently get bullied around by a tough humanoid gunslinger dressed all in black (Yul Brynner, spoofing his look from THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN), who is automatically obliged to get riddled up with bullets, repaired by technicians overnight as the guests sleep, and then shot up all over again for the next day.All is pure fun and games until something unidentifiable in the computer system begins to malfunction, and suddenly the world of Disney devolves into a place of horror. No longer taking orders to play dead, the robots are out to kill the guests, and the ominous gunslinger develops a frightening taste for the kill as he becomes an unstoppable walking menace, 10 years before Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator ever hit the screens.Author Michael Crichton (THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN) wrote the screenplay and directed his first film with WESTWORLD, and it's an impressive debut in that he's able to keep the action moving along at a comfortable pace, using a small budget to its full advantage, and fashioning a real good-time movie experience that is at the same time both fun and foreboding. James Brolin and Richard Benjamin are completely likable in their parts, but it is Yul Brynner's multi-layered conception of the gunslinging robot who changes from willing court jester to deadly assassin that's the main draw.Also a major asset is Fred Karlin's versatile music score. Changing from standard period western piano to a violins and whistles shindig, and finally to a weird techno-western mechanical hybrid when moods start to change for the worst, this is a very engaging soundtrack.So why don't you make arrangements to take the Delos hovercraft to Medievalworld, Romanworld or Westworld? Contact them today or see your travel agent. Boy, have they got a vacation for you...!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, some questions. Why are they sophisticated enough in the "control room" to have oxygen sensors (oxygen sensors?), but no provision for emergency escape in case of power failure? Why does the robot-wench at the end (who Richard Benjamin thinks is real) short out when he gives her water, yet the Yul Brenner robot-gunslinger character (among other robots)can pour whiskey down its mouth? Hmmm. Okay, and I'll buy the "pistols have sensors in them so the guests won't get killed" thing, but there are swords and maces in Medieval World. What, when a violent enemy swings a mace at your head, it has a "sensor" to stop it in mid-air just short of splattering your head? And the robot-gunslinger can hear Benjamin's breathing 100 yards away in the desert to locate him, but somehow can't locate his breathing four feet away in the castle--because the fire is distracting him? Come on. Do I have to go on? One more. If the robots don't have a normal body temperature, how good can sex be with them? Cold! Oh yeah. Watch the Black Knight's hand in the castle near the end. He is supposed to be "off," yet when we first see him, his thumb is turned up. The next time, his hand is hanging down.Great story concept, but good science fiction demands more plausibility. And what was supposed to be "authentic" is just every Hollywood cliché about the West. I guess you could make some argument that this is some sort of "meta-thematic" cultural commentary about the authentic West vis-a-vis our conception of it as transmitted to us by Hollywood. But, honestly, the film just isn't that smart. And I'm not going to let it off the hook even if I agreed, since it ignores basic nuts and bolts.</fullReview>

Crichton put down his pen, picked up a camera, and effortlessly made a cinematic masterpiece. Yul Brynner as the renegade cowboy-droid is sinister personified, the soundtrack is eerie as hell, and the action scenes are somewhat Peckinpah-esque, which is always good! MASTERPIECE! 70's movie-making at its peak.... i urge all of you to watch it and bathe in the liquid genius. The two protagonists are geeky and cool respectively and make for highly entertaining watching as they peruse the delights of westworld... and the moment where they realise things are out of control is genius.BEST OF THE 70'S!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Crichton ended up doing himself a good service by slightly re-tooling (or remaking if you'd prefer) the main concept behind Westworld- of an amusement park gone completely and violently awry- for Jurassic Park. With the book as well as the film they were both terrific unto themselves. With Westworld it's a little trickier; the themes and ideas are raw and sometimes spectacular in their results. And, unlike JP, Crichton is interested in how to approach all of this as satire-cum-surrealism, of the nature of man being surrounded by a warped reality that feels much more like the images we get from movies of the past than the actual past itself (a bar fight that breaks in in Westworld, for example, is almost as funny as the climactic fight in Blazing Saddles). If it weren't for a couple of major liabilities it would be one of the best science fiction pictures of its time (early 70s, pre-Star Wars).Very simply, Westworld is about one of three 'worlds' created by a group of scientists looking to give the public a "real-life" experience of being in a) medieval times, b) Roman empire, c) the American old-west. This is done with the use of robots- precisely times, mannered, violent, even sexualized artificial intelligence (or maybe not *that* intelligent, there are robots after all), and the kooky things that happens when the robots start malfunctioning... a lot. For the first half we're immersed into mostly Westworld (once or twice we get a peek at Medieval world, probably more-so than Romanworld, which is a little disappointing not to get some extra time for the other worlds), and it's glorious to see Crichton, wit with and excellent precision as a storyteller, go through the clichés of the old-West: the Gunslinger (Yul Brynner, himself a spoof on Magnificent Seven), the breakout of prison, the sex with the prostitutes, the bar fight, the harsh whiskey, all of it is apart of the fun- and Twilight Zone style curiosity- of the premise.And yet, while Crichton is able to explore this premise well throughout, with many of the scenes in and of themselves excellent, it's also too short to really make a complete impact; at 88 minutes we get just enough to suffice with the Westworld section, but what about the others? We get a quick montage of the Roman empire's destruction (some pun intended) and it's a pretty quick transition from "things are good" to "things are apocalyptic". And yet again, Crichton scores big points for the last 25 minutes, which is, basically, one long chase with the dysfunctional Brynner Gunslinger (one of the coldest and most effective killing machines in movie history alongside Michael Myers and Anton Chigurgh, in this case perfunctory in mission) and Richard Benjamin's bewildered guest who runs all the way from Westworld into the underground lair of the group that manages the park. This is taut, suspenseful film-making, done with some decent visual flair and an satisfying, unconventional soundtrack.It's definitely worth a look again, not just as some relic from the 70s. Like Soylent Green also from 1973, it has something to say about the mania of the human condition and the need to feel pleasure from unnatural sources. In this case it's the past transposed to the present, and the splash-on-the-face moment when the future smacks right back. Westworld isn't a masterpiece, but it's a lot sharp and funny and succinct in its dark message. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a sci-fi movie of the 1970's, "Westworld" is one of the biggest breakthroughs of that year. The use of digital graphics was a first in making this movie. The people look realistic when they are not running. Talking about the live mannequins. Which they are androids who interact with the humans in this adult theme part of the future. When the two men go out and enjoy the life of the past. Peter Martin(Richard Benjamin) makes out with an android prostitute, and that'll make any teenage boy wonder. They need to get their heads into gear. Romanworld, Medevalworld, and Westernworld. "Westworld" is the place to be, as they say. Unknown to the guests, the machines start to malfunction, and they start a murderous rampage on their own, and against the workers as well. The Gunslinger(Yul Brynner) is the worst of all androids who kill without mercy. And the snake strike John Blane(James Brolin) makes the staff wonder what caused this action to happen. Out of all the adult theme parks of the future, "Westworld" is one I must seriously avoid. And they should pull the plug of its commercials, following the sign saying, "CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE" This movie is great, and all sci-fi buffs want to see it in the worst possible way! Rating 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Along with Logan's Run, a definitively seventies view of the future.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WESTWORLD presents a view of the future that seems even more sadly dated than the foolish Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon fantasies of the forties and fifties. The film gets off to a good retro beginning with mentions of the hovercraft that transports the guests to Delos (at least it wasn't a monorail) and a shot of a grim-faced pilot wearing mirror-lensed sunglasses. Then we get Richard Benjamin - was ANY actor more essentially seventies than this man? There he sits with a particularly ill-advised moustache, blow-dried hair, a horrible business suit and a roll-neck sweater, getting a lot of valuable practice in for his future role as Walter Matthau's tetchy nephew in THE SUNSHINE BOYS two years later. Here, he's a recently-divorced lawyer who's both excited and apprehensive about his visit to this autonomous wonderland where you can do all the killing, fighting, eating, screwing and mindless damage you like, because you're doing it to androids, who don't mind a bit. (A similar idea was expressed in one of R.Crumb's early ZAP strips.) By his side is James Brolin, his arrogant, seen-it-all-before friend, who you just know is going to come to a sticky end. Insousciance in the face of technology is never a good idea, as any fool who's seen 2001:A SPACE ODYSSEY will tell you. Anyway, they get to Westworld and have several violent run-ins with Yul Brynner's deranged robot gunslinger, lots of loose sex with 19th-century bar-room floozies (whose blue eye-shadow and Farrah Fawcett hairstyles were something of an anachronism, even then) and finally sense things are going astray when Brolin gets gnawed by an irate robot snake. Rather than getting the hell out of Dodge, to borrow a hackneyed cliche, they stick around for a good old-fashioned bar-room brawl, oblivious to the fact that the other two Delos resorts are fast degenerating into violent mayhem and anarchy, then Brynner decides that their skinny human butts are his. To cut a long (and often tedious) story short, the final scenes where Benjamin stops being such an uptight feeb and takes decisive action are the best in the movie, with a surprisingly downbeat finale that does pull a few reasonable shocks out of the bag. In some ways, it's too little too late, but Crichton has still managed the underhanded trick of tacking a great ending onto a so-so movie, which makes the whole thing look better in retrospect.WESTWORLD is fine as long as you don't think about it, as Crichton's vision of this automated dystopian resort is subject to some glaring plotholes and flaws. I won't reiterate them here, as most of them seem to have been spotted by previous reviewers, but they are intensely irritating, even when you're watching the thing, and they show up the limitations of what could have been a really good idea. The direction, photography and sets are mostly fine, and the bleak, clinical, featureless control rooms and corridors of Delos look scarily similar to just about any corporate or government "official" building you might take a walk around today. But those big, bleeping, flashing computers with spinning tape reels and hypnotic screensaver-type graphics look like they were culled from an old episode of The Goodies or Blake's Seven, and the technicians themselves display similarly disgusting seventies hairstyles and dress-sense to the bickering crew members of John Carpenter's DARK STAR. A few more splashes of primary colour, more orange, beige or brown furnishings and a handful of scenes shot in a modern shopping centre, and this could have been the definitive document of seventies future chic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this flick as a child in the eighties and somehow it staid in my mind, maybe it also had something to do with my favorite band sampling words from this flick in one of their tracks. And now that it finally came out on Blu Ray it was time to pick it up and watch it all over again. And yes, it is still a cult classic for me. Just have a look in the time it was made, 1973. There weren't a lot of effects back then. But this one do has a few effects that worked out fine. The face of the robot being removed is just a wonderful thing because the cast of Yul Brunner's face is well done. And the way Yul played a robot also do work. Even as the computers are well outdated it just didn't mind me at all. The story itself is as simple as it may look but the settings aren't outdated. You can spot that it is a low budget flick but it's just the simple look of the settings that do make it work. Even the opening were they used projection or a blue key just works out fine. As simple as it gets it also works due the score used. And of course the excellent cast used here. Everybody gives the best they can. I know that there are rumors for years to remake this classic. Somehow they did with Futureworld (1976) but Westworld is a must see for all science-fiction geeks made just before the break through of the big effects used in slashers and science-fiction flicks. It doesn't bore one minute even as it takes over half the flick before the robots go berserk. All I can say is what they said in this flick, shut down one shut down two, down one down two...nice job.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Benjamin &amp; James Brolin play two friends who take a vacation in the amusement park called WestWorld, one of three areas populated by androids, who help play out the vacationers' fantasies, so in Westworld for example, the two men can safely shoot the sheriff or other gunfighters, since they are not alive, and can be quickly repaired. Unfortunately, the system breaks down, and the androids turn murderous, especially the gunslinger(Yul Brynner, well cast) who becomes determined to kill both Benjamin &amp; Brolin...Despite the plot not being airtight, this is still an interesting and effective thriller that poses real questions about how much control humans should blithely hand over to machines. Nicely directed by author Michael Crichton; a big hit, and followed by a sequel and brief TV series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Trivia has it that the inspiration for "Westworld" came to Michael Crichton after seeing the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland. And I have to tell you, something about that just tickles me. That some guy's walking around the Happiest Place on Earth? and gins up a story about theme park automatons rising up against their patrons. That's hilarious.And really, who better than to tackle such an idea than Crichton himself, master of man's hubris and technological terror? "Westworld" is just that very inspiration: a theme park for adults and their mature desires, drawing on every boy's dream of shooting it out in the Old West. And everything goes beautifully until Yul Brynner schizes out and starts killing people. The guy just marches along, laser-focused on his human prey. With this movie, you can see the groundwork being laid for both "The Terminator" and "Jurassic Park".And it's not just a trail-blazer. It's also a lot of fun. It's packed with imagination and invention and works especially well as a lean thriller.Very entertaining.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well ahead of its time. Gives greater suspense than later reincarnations of the same theme as "I Robot" comes to mind. Yul Brenner is excellent despite the lack of speaking lines. The art direction is great as it depicts the themed worlds of Delos. You are caught up in the characters despite the obvious limitations in the story. The idea of indulgence in your greatest fantasies and not realizing what it might actually cost you is interesting. There are some interesting trivia tidbits on the supporting cast. Take a good look at who's in this movie. You might be pleasantly surprised and/or amused. The direction doesn't bog us down in minor characters in fact you want to see more of them. That suggests the movie was quite entertaining because you're not so focused on just the major stars in the movie. In other words, rent or watch it now on Netflix. Worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

And this feeling of plausibility is the highest quality factor in a sci-fi movie.No contemporary Hollywood billion dollars extravaganca crammed with clichés, lingering sobbing closeups, ubiquitous romantic side plots, inevitable hero-saves-child tear jerking, can make such a strong impression - all this garbage does not exist in Westworld. It is matter-of-fact in its progression of the story. Hard core story telling!I have a strong feeling of Kubrick when I see Westworld and that is the highest appraisal in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic, but why no re-do?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the record, not saying it needs to be redone, this version is just jim-dandy, but given the fact that the suits in Hollywood make a new Spiderman every few years, just for practise, just to make sure the cameras are working OK, you have to wonder why no one ever took a second run at this gem? Iconic and classic. Written and directed by Crichton, years before the fame and fortune of works like, for example, Jurassic Park. Brynner was not only one of the most unique and identifiable stars of the era ("So it shall be written -- so it shall be done") but one of the least imitated, like Charles Bronson. Although James Brolin is mainly known, today, as the father of Josh, fact is, he was a leading man at one point and had the chops to back it up. Richard Benjamin, believe it or not, represented the "everyman" role of the era (even though he arguably looked and acted like nobody else you could think of) and somehow made an unbelievable story .. believable. But it is Brynner who makes this film the classic it came to be. Years before Terminator, it was this "mechanical man" of his that defined the term "relentless." Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delos is the vacation of the future...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Westworld is written and directed by Michael Crichton and stars Yul Brynner, Richard Benjamin and James Brolin. Story is set in the near future at an amusement park, no ordinary amusement park, tho. Here there are three worlds, Western, Medieval and Roman, where for $1,000 a day the clients can act out their fantasies in worlds alive with androids brilliantly made to look and act like human beings. But one day something goes wrong, there's a glitch and the androids fail to respond to their programming...A monstrously great set up makes for a fine piece of sci-fi cinema. True enough to say that it needed a far better director than Crichton to fully realise the potential on offer, both visually and thematically, but Westworld manages to overcome the directors failings and reward the patient viewer. Seeping with bleak overtones as the scientists force technology to over reach itself, the film is propelled forward by a clinically robotic performance from Bryner as an android gunslinger. Clearly riffing on his character Chris Adams from The Magnificent Seven, Bryner is a perfect fit for a seemingly unstoppable force, cold dead shark eyes and fluid in the walk, he's a memorable sci-fi bad guy. Around him the rest of the cast are only adequate, but in a film revolving around androids looking like humans it's barely an issue. The effects used for the androids POV are effective, as is the reveal of what lays beneath the skin, while the finale plays out with pace and no little excitement.Very much a forerunner to The Terminator, and even Predator, Westworld belies its 70s exterior to reveal an intelligent and potent little shocker. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Firm Concept That Can't Buoy its Aimless, Meandering Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written and directed by Michael Crichton, Westworld revolves around the concept of a distant-future amusement resort. Spending their time in one of three fully-functional, authentic sets, guests are free to live out their life-long fantasies as a wild west cowboy, medieval knight or indulgent Roman elite while a convincing, lifelike cyborg supporting cast absorbs punishment and boosts egos. The big selling points are that anything goes and nobody gets hurt, but when a park-wide malfunction grants free will to the robots, those guarantees are immediately called into question. It's a fun premise, on par with some of the era's better sci-fi concepts, but spends too much time dilly-dallying and vainly soaking up the atmosphere when it should be advancing the plot. That gives the impression that, like so many Philip Dick properties, it doesn't really know what to do with itself after the ground rules are established. Crichton's work in the director's chair leaves a lot to be desired, but he doesn't get much help from the film's hammy, made-for-TV quality special effects. Most of that can be attributed to the age of the picture, but it's tough to take the drama seriously when folks bleed neon red. Yul Brynner turns in some quality work as the ruthless, stone-faced lead cyborg, but the rest of the cast is droll, vanilla and forgettable. Too much frosting, not enough cake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one had a really interesting theme and was a kind of predecessor to Chrichton's own "Jurassic Park", but except for the things that are rather well done (e.g. Yul Bynner's death at the end), there are flaws that make the whole film ridiculous (spoilers...):1.) If the visitors of the park cannot shoot at each other (because of sensors in their guns), why are the robots able to do that? No one would give the robots real ammo, because they are not supposed to shoot at the guests. And why is a robot snake able to bite someone when it should never do so? Construction error? 2.) When they turn off the electricity, all of their computers and monitors still work, but the scientists are not able to open the electric doors and suffocate. How stupid can you be constructing such a trap for yourself?And there are also a lot of minor flaws in the film. It's simply not believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellently creepy cult gem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Westworld is a compelling Sci-Fi film that works from an intriguing premise and features an excellent central performance from Yul Brynner. The film works on the idea of rich people paying a lot of money for a holiday that will offer them something a little different to the norm. The rich men and women in this film are about to get something a little different indeed...but maybe it's a little too different! The corporation offering a new type of holiday is calling itself Delo, and using Androids and computers they have managed to create three areas that look and feel exactly like certain periods in history. There's a medieval world, a roman world and Westworld, a place that mocks the American Wild West, and the 'world' in which most of this film takes place. Of course, Westworld isn't a film about a bunch of holidaymakers that go to this futuristic place, have a good time and go home - no chance! As things start to go awry when the machines malfunction and go on a murderous rampage! Westworld works because it excellently treads the line between Sci-Fi and Western. The way that it creates the western setting, but keeps it fake looking enough to ensure that it looks like it's been manufactured is great, and all the time we are presented with a world that looks just fake enough to be a holiday resort. Yul Brynner gives an outstanding performance as the Terminator-like gunslinger at the centre of the movie. He is malevolent enough to ensure that we always get a foreboding feeling when he's on screen, but it's also obvious that his performance is meant to be something of homage to his earlier western roles. The film takes it's time before anything actually goes wrong, but this is to it's credit as it allows the tension to mount and it also means that we can properly plug into the premise before it unleashes what we know it's going to unleash. The film is excellently sinister throughout, and the horror and Sci-Fi themes bode well with the western style to create a great milestone in all three genres. Westworld is an excellent forgotten cult classic and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing about a machine is that it'll carry on doing what it does, even if you decide you don't want it to. This is the problem with mechanisms with insufficient human feedback.This film is actually a critique of passive entertainment. The idea is that people visit without interaction, and they get entertained.However, the machine doesn't really care what you want, it just does what it does, and it's got a gun. This then becomes a bit of a problem.It's a typical writer's film. He doesn't want to read, he wants to write. He in many ways resents the passivity of the audience, and wants to warn them of the dangers of this approach. This film is early postmodernism. It's a modern consumer utopia being revealed to be a disturbing dystopia. The road to hell is paved with good intentions.A note to other forumisers : Forget the myopic nerdery. It's a film, not a computer game with 'glitches'. Don't troubleshoot it like it's a Quake forum. Same as you can have a few weeks of boring waiting deleted from a film using a changing date on the bottom of the screen, Yul is allowed to reload off camera. Or not reload at all. He's an indiscriminate killing hunting wild west robot. That's it. Great character. There are no holes to pick, other than : It's fiction.Actually, the idolised character of a violent self reliant cowboy, a law unto himself, as portrayed in Leone's films is the antithesis of Westworld. The tourists have lost the ability to fight, and are the victims of a mechanical cowboy incabable of decision making. It highlights America's cultural transformation from gun toting anarchy to consumerism, and the possible risks of such a transformation. It's reverse Leone, but still with the same message. It's just about victims, not heros. Yul's the invincible antihero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Westworld...Where nothing can possibly go worng!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classic sci-fi thriller, written and directed by Michael Crichton, about a futuristic amusement park called Delos where people can role play in fantasy "worlds" based on the Old West, the Roman Empire, and Medieval Europe. Each of these worlds is inhabited by androids who look, talk, and act like real people. You want to have a sword fight with a knight, you can. You want to shoot it out with a gunslinger, you can. You want to bang an attractive prostitute or wench, have right at it. But this fantasy world turns into a nightmare when the robots malfunction and start killing the tourists! Richard Benjamin does a great job as the unlikely hero, a newly-divorced and somewhat nerdy man brought to the park by his macho friend James Brolin. Dick Van Patten and Alan Oppenehimer are good in supporting roles. But it's Yul Brynner, as the black-clad gunfighter out to kill Benjamin, that steals the show with his commanding screen presence. The movie takes its time setting things up and building the suspense, showing one small malfunction at a time. It's an hour in before the killing starts. From that point on the pace never slows down and it becomes an exciting cat-and-mouse chase with Brynner hunting Benjamin. The sets and special effects are terrific, particularly when you consider this was made for $1.25 million (with half of that going to pay the cast and crew). I can't say enough good things about Fred Karlin's effective score. This was Crichton's first theatrical directorial effort (he directed a TV movie prior to this). I think it's his best work as a director, although I hold a special place in my heart for Runaway. His script is smart with nice bits of humor throughout. It's a great film that should appeal to a wide variety of people, so long as they are able to enjoy movies made before CGI. Sadly, there are many who can't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boy have we got a vacation for you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Crichton's directorial debut displays elements that would later be evident in the classic Jurassic Park; the loss of man's control over science, a holiday destination gone rogue, a thriller of an adventure turned into a nightmare. Westworld is doubly interesting because it showcases two layers that we are able to identify: the story of the fictional world which the guests pay to enjoy, and the reality of the malfunctions and the struggle to survive in that rogue world. It's fun t spot these moments which subvert your usual film scenarios, the countless clichéd situations of the genres of westerns, medieval and roman stories. When the visiting pair of John and Peter engage with the resident loose cannon who is set to trigger gun fights in the middle of a packed saloon, they square up and the robots flee and climb over furniture much like a real film shoot-out. Their dialogue is classic western, shaped by cliché and instantly recognisable, adding to the illusion. Later when the rogue gunslinger again challenges Peter, the wide shot of the town street where the duel would usually take place is exactly as planned, only now he is not the title hero, but is scurrying away from the robot who just shot his friend. Before that illusion is shattered however, the guests enjoy a merry and adventurous time. A scheduled bank robbery takes place across the street, and the pair instead elect to go upstairs with the robotic women, the seduction taking place even as the bustling sounds of the hold-up are heard off-screen. Another one of the guests is shown to be fully immersed in the experience; he practices his quick draw in the mirror of his room, accidentally letting off a shot in his excitement. Later he has taken up the role of town sheriff after the exciting escape from Peter and John, and tries putting on a bravado persona, leaning on the door that will not open casually for him. He is not like the moustached Peter or the handsome John; he would look out of place in a western, although everyone is caught out of their depth when the computer virus hits Westworld. The main villain is played to perfection by Yul Brynner. His costume is pedestrian and his expression hardened but not too intimidating in order to allow the guests confidence to shoot him down. Later it becomes terrifying, that slight smile dogging every step of the fleeing Peter as if inquiring a guest: "Are you satisfied with your experience?" That steely robotic glint scans the horizons for heat and human prey, the blocky POV nevertheless clear in its intent. With this menacing turn the score switches from its western influence of mandolins, harmonics, bells and whistles to a electronic sound, cold and indifferent much like the rogue gunslinger. Silence is saved for the tensest of moments; Brynner striding down the main hall, the overhead lights illuminating his hard face, the apprehension as Peter hides behind a torch-fire, and finally it booms loudly like a horror film when he struggles after Peter even having been set on fire. It is even more terrifying half melted, reminiscent of the T-1000 in Terminator 2. I am certain that James Cameron drew from Brynner's character in creating the terminators. Westworld is a solid sci-fi and the humble influence of some greater movies, but it's no shame to be in the shadow of Jurassic Park or the first two Terminators. The world building is authentic, and when it seems shallow, well we can also look at it being just a theme park. It is a robot, not a human, that gives the most convincing and effective screen portrayal, but it is a great and scene stealing one.HBO has an adaptation set to hit the small screen next year, which looks promising.</fullReview>

He also wrote in a way that explained how technology, although good in ways, can be terrible in many others.This is a great movie that precedes "The Terminator" (1984); A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001); and, the TV series "Humans" (2015)...but, it's just as good, only a bit different.If you like robotic/synthetic/cyborgish-type science-fiction, you're sure to like this movie."I Sing The Body Electric!" :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really effective sci-fi/western hybrid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Westworld is one of the most distinctive and original sci-fi films from the 70's. It's hybrid of the western with science fiction is pretty unusual but the combination is very good and works to the strengths of both genres. Its writer and director is Michael Crichton who is mainly known as a novelist. His books have been adapted into other films, like the excellent earlier hard sci-fi movie The Andromeda Strain and the more adventure-orientated later film Jurassic Park. Westworld shares some pretty obvious ground with that latter Steven Spielberg blockbuster, with its story revolving around a fun-park for adults that goes horribly wrong, resulting in the human visitors becoming the prey. For my money though, Westworld is a far superior film and is a lot more involving.Its story is as simple as can be. A couple of friends go to a new high-tech fun-park called Westworld where they can play at being cowboys for a week. Not only are the environs a carefully replicated model of an 1880's Wild West town but it is also populated with androids that look and act like characters from the Wild West. The trouble is that something malfunctions and the robots turn on their human guests.It would only be fair to say that you need to stretch your incredulity a little bit to accept the scientific premises presented. The reasons given for how people cannot be harmed here are fairly ropey to say the least. But, ultimately, this isn't too important as the basic idea of the film is so interesting, so if you just roll with it you will be rewarded. The very fact that the film can play up the pleasures of both distinctive genres is in itself a great start point. What also helps is that the main characters are pretty good and believable. It's interesting how it also goes against audience expectations somewhat too with it being the meek character played by Richard Benjamin who becomes the main figure and hero, whereas the more typical alpha male James Brolin is killed off. Benjamin is pretty good in the role and makes for an engaging enough lead. But it's Yul Brynner that everyone really remembers. His turn as a cold-eyed, black-clad, gun-man android is easily the most iconic in the film. He is perfectly cast really and is excellent throughout. We also get to see the other two worlds too - Medieval World and Roman World ? and it is kind of fun seeing the incongruous crossover of a gunslinger from the old west walking through Roman gardens and a medieval castle, as well as the high-tech corridors of the control area of the park. All this variety is very good, while the effects work is simple but effective with some very effective stuff done with the droids. Overall, this is a great, tense 70's sci-fi flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am giving WestWorld a 9 out of 10 not because it was near perfect film but more because the idea itself was so futuristic and still today the idea of a park of this nature is not too far off in the distant future.The pace of technology means we could eventually be having shoot-outs with robots (sorry! androids! - don't annoy them!), we could eventually be sitting in ancient Rome being fed by slave girls. The possibilities are endless dependent on the technology being there and with films like AI this shows a future in a similar vain.The film was not flawless, it did have as many say, "many holes" but overall the idea was stellar, the cast of actors fairly believable and the sets not too shoddy for the time and the kinds of effects they had in their effect kit were sufficient.Other actors in the roles of the two friends could have made this film a bigger hit but overall they were as I said believable.As for today the effects in sfx box of tricks are much more than in the day, so if any film is screaming out for a remake it is this one. Put Tom Cruise in it, Gwyneth Paltrow, Robert Downey Junior, Johnny Depp and even Mina Suvari as a robot and with all the effects on top, you may have got yourself a winning film.After all this film is every schoolboy and some schoolgirl's fantasy to be in a fake world and live out their fantasies by shooting up the baddies and not going to jail and by making love and not worrying about babies or diseases among other fantasies.Remake, Remake, Remake - Screaming for it and a 10 out of 10 remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Westworld is one of a handful of sci-fi films that seems to never age. Made before Star Wars changed what sci-fi meant, it is more than just an adventure in the future plot: it is a great idea - What if you could go on holiday and be part of another world / time?Wouldn't we all want that?THe clever part is that Westworld puts us in a cowboy setting and then introduces robots too - making the unfamiliar very familiar.The Western kind of plays out just as you would want it to - imagine you were given such a holiday, you'd want gunfights and barfights and loose women, and with the robots around the moral consequences are avoided - until the robots go haywire.Yes the computers look hokey, but in 72 they did look futuristic with their 3D figure modelling, but above all what makes the flimimg stand out is great lighting, costumes (All new enough to look as they a company had made them for the experience), and good, clean directing and grading of film mean that this is far more ageless that you'd expect.Very good entertainment with a brilliant turn by Yul Brynner as the robot cowboy - his eyes may be glazed but his body language is pure dynamite.One of the better films of its genre, and a great film in its own right.Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The holes in this film are too many to try to fill with platitudes and appeals to "suspend your disbelief" so I will point out only one, which I still find so ridiculous that it almost kills the rest of the film for me each time I see it. When James Brolin's character says that you can tell the humans from the robots by their wrinkly hands because "they haven't perfected the hands yet", it begs the question; what was so difficult about making robot hands? They seem to have perfected other, more complicated parts of the android anatomy. The eyes, the central nervous system. No complaints from Brolin and company after a night with two cyborg saloon harlots. Let's face it, if their butts looked like those hands Westworld would be out of business in a week.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun sci-fi comedy of the 70s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Westworld for the first time last week after having heard about it for years, and I must say it was a lot of fun. It's about a futuristic amusement park where people can come (for $1000 a day) and live out their fantasies (violent or sexual) in the Roman Empire, Medieval times, or the Old West. The two main characters (Dick Benjamin and James Brolin) seem to having a great time in the Old West park, complete without shootouts, barroom brawls, and ladies of the evening until, one day, it all goes horribly wrong. More than that I won't tell you about the plot, but I can tell you that cynics and technical sticklers will have a field day with this movie for all the flaws in the story. For one thing, it looks terribly dated and cheap, and I don't understand how you shoot real bullets and no guest ever gets hurt, even with sensors on the guns. What if you miss? What if the robot misses? (Yul Brynner misses shooting Dick Benjamin several times in the final chase scene) What if a bullet ricochets off something and hits a guest? And in the final showdown between Brynner and Benjamin, where are all the other guests? We've just seen two full days in this theme park where the place was full of guests and robots, so where did they all go at the end? Anyway, you just have suspend disbelief to enjoy this movie, which, overall is very good. Yul Brynner is superb as the glassy-eyed robot gunslinger. And my favorite moment in the picture is a small one: the chief technician (Alan Oppenheimer) in the Westworld control room picks up an in-house phone, gets no dial tone and mutters, "Doesn't anything work in this place?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story adequate to illustrate some innovative ideas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To dispose of it quickly, I'll simply say that the plot and acting in Westworld was good enough to hold my attention. If you've seen any Star Trek episode where a holodeck fantasy world suddenly becomes very real and very deadly, then Westworld will seem completely familiar to you, though the movie is better done. For, in typical Crichton fashion, Westworld is more solidly grounded on extrapolations of real science and real technology, with computers and robots instead of the vague and wholly imaginary "holo-technology".Having just this moment seen my Norton anti-virus program nag me for an update, I'm reminded that it no longer seems silly and improbable that a computer "illness" might exist and that it could spread, infecting machine after machine. However, because Crichton's "illness" doesnt' appear to be deliberate and man-made, it seems he drew his inspiration from questions raised by a 1949 paper by Dr. John von Neumann, and that Westworld's computer software disease spontaneously evolved from the complexity of the system. He returned to this theme later with Jurassic Park, after Chaos and Complexity theories had arisen to give some rigor to earlier speculations on the nature of complex systems.A bit of a first in real technology was Crichton's use of computers to digitize the viewpoint of the Gunslinger, using false-color imaging and pixelation of film images. Every previous use of computer images in feature films merely involved showing computer monitors displaying simple graphics. Pixelation and wrong colors might now be just defects in digital imaging, something that simply happens when things go wrong. But in 1973 it was entirely new in feature films and it took an incredible amount of processing time to deliberately create them.All in all, Westworld is a good entertaining film, but more deserving of attention these days for appreciating Crichton's thoughtful forward-looking innovations than as a masterwork of cinematic storytelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shoot To Kill...Literally!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the science fiction genre's most enduring themes, especially since 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY made its central character, the supercomputer HAL, into one of the cinema's most enduring characters, is the theme of Mankind being unable to control its own technology and seeing that technology turn on it. This is at the heart of noted sci-fi author Michael Crichton's film writing/directing debut WESTWORLD, a 1973 film that presages some of the same themes broached in Spielberg's 1993 hit JURASSIC PARK, which was based on Crichton's 1990 novel.Richard Benjamin and James Brolin are the two businessmen who venture to a futuristic theme park called Delos. Delos is laid out in three sections, each recreating a different era of time with robot replicants of human beings: Roman World, Medieval World, and Westworld. Our two protagonists choose Westworld, which recreates the Old West circa the 19th century. There, they have fun getting into barroom brawls, cavorting with prostitutes, and having a showdown with an all-too-realistic looking robot gunman (Yul Brynner, in a malevolent take on his role in THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN).But a malfunction of unknown origin in Delos' power center causes things to go haywire. And where before the gunplay between Brynner and our two protagonists was once fun and games, soon the bullets start getting real. When Brolin is shot and killed by the out-of-control Brynner, Benjamin is stalked relentlessly throughout Delos. Only when he throws acid onto Brynner is Benjamin able to stop the robot cold.Though obviously dated in many ways (clothes, dialogue, etc.), WESTWORLD nevertheless gives us plenty of food for thought. The gunfights between Brynner and Benjamin early on are shot and edited by Crichton in such a way as to almost resemble what Sam Peckinpah pulled off brilliantly in THE WILD BUNCH--a montage mix of slow and fast motion, and even some bloodshed (indeed, WESTWORLD nearly did get an 'R' rating from the MPAA ratings board). The final chase sequence through Delos' underground corridors, in which Benjamin can't run fast enough to outlast Brynner until the very end, was paid an unintentional homage of sorts much later on in HALLOWEEN II.If perhaps not quite a masterpiece, WESTWORLD still manages to get its point across: that making robots and technology work for us for entertainment purposes can be a dangerous thing. It's a premise that is rapidly coming truer with each passing day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made me a Yul Brynner fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film back in 1975 as an 8 year old. I loved it then and it still holds up for me years later. Yul Brynner's role as the robot gunslinger really left an impact on me. He really is the highlight of the film, although there are many other good things to watch Westworld for. It is not the best sci-fi flick ever made, but I still feel that it holds up today as an entertaining movie. The musical score by Fred Karlin is especially disturbing at times and it really added to the excitement of the last part of the movie. Yul Brynner modeled his robot gunslinger after the character he portrayed in The Magnificent Seven. The first part of the movie follows a number of guests as they travel in to the world of their choice in Delos, a theme park of the future where eventually things go terribly wrong and most of the guests are killed off with the last part of the movie dealing with Yul Brynner tracking down Richard Benjamin with only one purpose...to kill him. Suspenseful action, a chilling musical score, good acting and an ending that left me drained when I originally saw it make this a movie worth watching. What are you waiting for...watch this movie today!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why? Well, I admit that I was thrilled to see it originally in the theater at the age of 12. In those days, before Arnold the Terminator came along, it was the coolest thing in the world to see an unstoppable Yul Bryner as a killer robot stalking his prey, especially in that deserted underground complex!This film might be my favorite for sheer FUN. Everybody would love to visit a wild place like WESTWORLD where he can live out his fantasies. But when the fun turns to danger...well, it's...MORE FUN!This film is the perfect example of what you can accomplish in movies with a small budget and a lot of talent. It was Michael Crichton's directorial debut (long before his similar but inferior JURASSIC PARK), and I once read in a "Making Of" paperback that he said "I like to think people have fun with this film. We had fun making it!" Well, you accomplished your goal, sir!This is the type of horror/sci-fi we need today: Fast-paced, tight, not overlong, and not over-blown with too many effects. I hear that Hollywood is planning to re-make this PERFECT adventure...Please, God, send them a plague on their first day of shooting if that would be the case!The sequel to this great movie was the truly frustrating FUTUREWORLD, a real lame attempt at a sequel if ever there was one. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robots ridiculous? Look in the mirror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing that in some of the comments, people say "It's ridiculous for people to go nuts over robots in an amusement park." These are the same people who drool over even less competently simulated life in their CD-ROM computer games. It's obvious that Crichton is talking about those people who lose themselves in fantasy, whether it's an amusement park, a computer game, a role playing game...or a movie theatre.As always, Crichton depicts human beings as idiots who are too stupid to realize the implications of technology. Why he does this, I don't know...but he was a physician, a group of people who are known to have God complexes. But as a person who lives near Disney World, I have seen people not too much brighter than the visitors to Delos, so in this case his cruel judgment is appropriate.I saw "Westworld" recently at a science fiction convention, on film, and was astonished again. Crichton made this film on a budget, but did it cleverly. (If you can find the original paperback of the book, it contains a shooting script of the movie, and Crichton explains his cost-cutting. Some of these facts should have been included on the DVD of the movie.) Notice how as the climax approaches, people talk less and less...we are forced to concentrate on what's happening, not what people say.</fullReview>

Peter has visited before so he exclaims a few things to John about what to expect. Only this time, things will be different.If you've seen Jurassic Park, then you'll know what to expect.

Yeah (as you'd expect for a 70s sci-fi film) its dated a little but its still great fun. I was amazed that I never realised how much Terminator copied Yul Brynner! Also - his heat seeking vision (with the very first computer graphics? yeah it looks dated but we are talking about a 1973 film don't forget) is directly ripped in Predator of course.I thought James Brolin in particular (Im assuming Josh Brolin is his son because the resemblance is unmistakable) was great in this - in a modern film his character would have survived to the end I think! To sum up - great 70s dystopian sci-fi and a must for the collection. Ill certainly be picking this up on blu-ray when it arrives in that format.</fullReview>

Watching again as an adult I'm a little less impressed and the technology is wonderful for some laughs. Looking at the big boxy things with flashing lights and spinning tape reels, my daughter asked if those are computers so I give the obligatory explanation. Westworld is one of the few movies written and directed by Michael Crichton, of whom I've been a big fan even before I knew who he was. Westworld being one of his more popcorny movies, lacking the sophistication of The Andromeda Strain but containing the seeds of Jurassic Park.James Brolin is magnificent as expected. It always strikes me how much Christian Bale resembles him, right down to the smile and mannerisms. If Bale isn't the illegitimate son of Brolin then their family trees must share branches somewhere. I've always thought the same about Robert Redford and Brad Pitt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here we are, a third of a century later, and Westworld is still crackling good entertainment. Michael Crichton wrote and directed this dandy science fiction soufflé that contains some classic Crichton themes--whizbang technology (although it all looks dated now with the computer techs monitoring computer screens with glorified screensavers on them), flesh and blood and warts and all humans, and something unexpected going totally wrong (or "worng" as the tag line states) wherein the humans are up to their arses in prehistoric alligators or killer viruses or being stuck in medieval France.The movie is good, mildly hokey fun. James Brolin, Dick Benjamin, and Yul Brynner are all obviously having a bang-up good time. The technostuff has matured from awesomely cool to quaint and humorous. The best thing about the movie, besides the really interesting premise, is the enjoyment of it in spite of the glaring plot and logic holes and the wheezy and weak ending.Westworld is a winner in spite of its flaws and Crichton has gone on to perfect the high-tech-gone-very-worng premise.

		<fullReview>Michael Crichton, the celebrated science-fiction author, was the writer and director of "Westworld," a tale of a robot-populated amusement park. This is a fascinating story, even if the acting performances aren't up to par. When the robots malfunction and start killing off the human visitors, the suspense starts to build. When you think about it, it makes a kind of sense that Crichton was behind "Westworld." He would go on to write "Jurassic Park," which would become a hit directed by Steven Spielberg. It's logical to start with a history-based amusement park full of robots, and let it evolve into one full of genetically-reconstituted dinosaurs! See "Westworld," and it'll make sense!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I often criticise westerns because they bare no reality on what really happened in the wild west . Unlike the Hollywood version most gunslingers met their end after getting shot in the back , they never stood in the middle of the street telling their opponent to draw , this is a myth that only happened in Hollywood movies , and WESTWORLD is an enjoyable celebration of this myth where ( Rich ) holidaymakers can spend ( For $1000 a day ) their holiday drawing their guns on gunslingers , taking part in bar room brawls and visiting ladies of ill repute and it`s really fun to watch people play up to all the wild west cliches in a film that`s entertaining , funny and a little bit scary too . As good as WESTWORLD is as entertainment it rather flawed . James Brolin and Yul Brynner are fair in their roles but Richard Benjamin is very wooden as Peter Martin . Imagine you`re being chased by an unstoppable killing machine ( And had paid one thousand dollars a day for the privilege ! ) you`d be terrified , or at least upset that you`re not getting value for money , but Benjamin doesn`t seem to convey enough fear . It should also be pointed out that the more you think about WESTWORLD the more it falls apart , and another thing I notice the more I watch it is that you see nothing of Roman World but that theme park probably consists of middle aged housewives taking part in Roman orgies so on second thoughts maybe it`s just as well we learn nothing about the place So if you get the chance watch WESTWORLD and make sure you don`t think about it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Formula: Jurassic Park - Dinosaurs + Robots = Westworld.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Westworld is a great early effort from writer/director Michael Crichton. Westworld is an amusement park where the rich can "vacation" to live out the dangers and lifestyle of the old west. The park is filled with androids who interact with the guests of the resort. They engage in robberies, gun fights, and bar brawls. Of course there's no real danger. That is until the machines take over. It succeeds as an extremely entertaining blend of science fiction and action. It fails at creating an excuse for the machines to go haywire. There really wasn't a clear cut reason. On a good note, the heroes (played by Richard Benjamin and James Brolin) are two likable guys, but the villain really steals the show. Yul Brynner is awesome as the evil gunslinger who just won't quit. He's largely reminiscent of Arnold in The Terminator (wonder if Schwarzenneger was inspired by this film?). In fact, the movie itself reminded me quite a bit of another Crichton adventure flick: Jurassic Park. Westworld and Jurassic Park make good companion pieces (ie: guests visit park, park goes haywire, guests get killed).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Crichton Die-Hards Only</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is easy to detect the beginnings of both "Jurassic Park" and "Timeline" in this early Crichton effort. But it isn't nearly as entertaining as either of these later titles. In the film, as we learn from a mock commercial in the opening scene, a travel company has constructed three realistic historical environments: Westworld, Medievalworld, and Romanworld. In addition to atmosphere, the parks feature human-like robots which permit the tourists to engage in all the sex &amp; violence they can handle. Of course, while no one is looking, the robots transform into sentient beings and decide to embark on their own murderous rampage.Unlike many of Crichton's works, Westworld doesn't feature believable scientific mumbo-jumbo. The transcendent robot phenomenon is simply labeled a glitch, and several other features of the park and its robotic inhabitants are counter-intuitive. It seems to drag on a bit, as well. The scenes in Medievalworld seem unnecessary and aren't terribly interesting. The extended "chase" scene at the end also could have done with some editing.You could certainly do worse, but this isn't a what I would call a sci-fi classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Was So Realistic They Killed Me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:First, the buildup is much faster than FutureWorld. It starts with Benjamin / Brolin in transit to Delos. The pacing of this original is like lightning next to the sequel. Also, what is well done is how slight glitches proceed the breakdown. Little trivial glitches like a refused overture by fat boy to one of the hot medieval women, then a snake bites, they build up to a complete breakdown. Crichton's work is translated fairly well, it is not an accident that Brolin, the brawn part of the dyad, is killed first leaving the more intelligent Benjamin to figure out how to defeat the deadly Gunslinger played well by Brynner. Yul always had limited range, like Arnie in The Terminator, the director uses the actor's natural lack of emotional range to convey an emotionless killing machine. I still think this was the template that Cameron built upon for The Terminator. Notice, the same scanning movements with the head, the seeing from inside of the machine and the cold impassivity. I won't spoil it for you but Benjamin tries many different hypotheses on how to destroy him. The scariness of the movie is that you are kept in the dark, with Benjamin, over the success of his attacks. Usually, you are with Benjamin believing that the Gunslinger is history and you will hear his creepy steps coming towards you.Yes, the detractors are right, the Deus Ex Machina, of the scientists all being locked in the control room and suffocating is where you have to let your brain go off a bit. The fact that every other facet of the park is computerized makes it slightly more believable. Surprisingly violent for such an old movie, the massacre in Roman World is definitely not for kiddies. Brolin and Benjamin were not exactly Brando and Tracy but the acting demands are limited here. Brolin goes bye bye early and the rest of the movie is Benjamin on the run. This is what makes it work so well, we flee with him. There are a few scenes of where the Gunslinger is but, be warned, he pops out on you in a couple of places causing popcorn eruptions or geysers when I saw this with an audience. This towers over the sequel which wasted so much screen time with this far-fetched replace the world's leaders silliness. Jurassic Park did follow this screenplay closely with the park going out of control. The last half hour is plenty suspenseful. The movie's short length is the other great attraction: pacing, it moves quickly. There are zero lectures on playing with nature, the perils of science or any other such coma inducing inanities. Benjamin's intellectual trials, that don't always go so well, give the movie greater realism. From the first few minutes, the robots just seem a bit off. This grows in frequency and intensity which makes the total chaos that ensues more believable. There is a now comical scene of Benjamin bedding a robotic hot babe that is the only scene that will evoke laughter from today's audience. Forty years ago, believe it or not, it was considered controversial and cutting edge. The action and running for your freaking life keep it from ever being boring. I was bored in many parts of FutureWorld but not for a moment here. Brynner may not equal Arnie's Terminator but that creepy ass smile he gets on his face after wasting Brolin was well done. His body language and fast walking strongly convey an insouciant machine. The last five minutes be sure to have a death grip on your refreshments. There is one pop out that will cause choking if you are eating: Don't say I didn't warn you! A Good Old Movie That Cameron Undoubtedly Watched Before Making The Terminator. Q.E.D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cautious tale of sci-fi horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout his career, science fiction novelist Michael Crichton has had a profound influence on the history of film and stories. Although the variety of Crichton's work doesn't differ greatly, much of his ideas bring up intriguing questions about our existence as the human race. Of Crichton's work, the most popular of his films was Jurassic Park (1993) dealing with re-animated dinosaurs running a muck. Yet 20 years earlier, Crichton had wrote and directed another science-fiction film involving other creatures running a muck. The creatures this time are robots. With technology ever increasing in its complexity, people take it for granted more often than before. The question is, do we realize how realistic this technology has become? Everyday that passes, this applied science gets closer and closer to our personal lives to the point where we can interact with it as well. This is no longer a fantasy nowadays and that can be a scary thing. What happens with these machines become self- aware? Will we know how they'll react?Taking place some time in the future, the world has created Delos, the "perfect vacation resort". Consisting of three different time capsules; Romanworld, Medievalworld and Westworld, where each visitor can experience life as it was during that time for $1000 a day (oh yeah, pocket change). Helping make these three settings as realistic as possible, the Delos system uses robots that look like real people. The only way to tell the difference between a real human and these fake ones is by looking at their hands. Audiences will learn this after being introduced to Peter Martin (Richard Benjamin) and John Blane (James Brolin), two visitors to the resort; Blane of which is a returning guest. Martin on the other hand has never been to Delos and is excited to experience the authenticity of it. Behind the curtain of Delos, a sophisticated network of technicians and other workers help keep things moving. If a robot breaks down, it's hauled back for repair. However, things are acting up more than usual lately.According to the Chief Supervisor (Alan Oppenheimer), the robots have been encountering frequent issues for strange reasons. There needs to be answers but no one knows why. How is that? The only answer given is that it's some kind of "disease", which is immediately impeded by another board member saying how could a machine have a disease? But that's as far as it goes. For Jurassic Park (1993), saying that the dinosaurs became smart is somewhat acceptable and if that were the answer that would also work. Nevertheless leaving the inquiry as possibly a disease doesn't solve much. The other noticeable problem with this film is its pacing. As Michael Crichton's first theatrical film he directed, this could be the reason why his direction wasn't on point. There are moments where scenes move slower than usual and some events that take place feel longer than necessary. Plus remembering that he also wrote for this film probably added to the amount of work Crichton had to deal with so it's plausible he was under a lot of pressure.James Brolin and Richard Benjamin as the main two leads help give viewers a better understanding of what there is to expect from Delos. Benjamin plays the role viewers can relate to since any newcomer would have the same initial opinion. Brolin's role is to assist in cementing the new belief. Co-starring with Brolin and Benjamin are also Norman Bartold playing another guest and Yul Brynner only known as the gunslinger. Bartold's role isn't greatly defined but he does play an important part for the viewer to see. Yul Brynner as the gunslinger may not have a lot to say but his appearance as a robot with reflective eyes is dastardly credible. The inflections in Brynner's lines have just the right amount of flare to make him sound fake but dangerous all the same. The action / sci-fi &amp; horror elements that show up throughout work too. Though it was given a PG rating at the time, it is far from it. There are blood squibs and some brutal violence throughout. For 1973, the makeup effects did wonders when it came to robotic creatures.Behind the camera was Gene Polito as the cinematographer. Polito's camera-work is solid in every shot that occurs. That means capturing not only each setting's background but also remaining completely still for action shots. There are also a number of slow motion shots that amplify how much Polito was able to capture in each frame. Looking at his entire career, it's likely that this was the movie that he's most widely regarded for. The same could be said for Fred Karlin, the musical composer. Understanding that the majority of the events featured will be in Westworld would incline that some of the score would include country music themes. This does occur and perhaps too exaggerated at points because sometimes it sounds like hillbilly music. However, what Karlin made efficiently dark and scary was the horror of his music. Relying on prepared piano (which is rare in most scores) and scratchy strings truly makes the horror cues much more intense because the sounds or so uniquely constructed compared to other compositions.Writing in particular is well thought out even though there are unresolved questions. The pacing in some areas may also be a bit slow but it's made up with relatable characters, a twisted film score and well-shot cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Vacation of the Future. Today!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're looking to settle into a movie that behaves like a cross between Jurassic Park, eXistenZ, and The Stepford Wives with the chase scenes of Terminator 2 (almost) and set in the Wild West, the pre-Christian Roman Empire and medieval Europe, then Westworld is for you.While at times a little one-note, that note is stricken hard, and with gusto. The movie really wants to know: what are the limits of simulation, how do we recognize and cope with reality, and where do the two meet? It features some really fun hallmarks of the AI genre, with a slight physical tell that marks the divide between those who are real from those who are simulated, and a heavy eye on the scientists at the helm of the operation, who openly admit that they don't understand the complexities of the AI. It's got good mythos -- the rules of the experience are laid out nicely, so that the viewer can easily tell when things begin to deteriorate. Solid B+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are in Tucson, Arizona, please, don't go to Westworld, you might be shot in the ass by a faulty robot or, if you are lucky, to be raped by a sexy blonde robot woman... You may even be bitten by a rattlesnake, a robot too... But the worst thing that can happen to you, is to be followed by Yul Brynner himself, who wants you dead at any cost... God, and what a beautiful horse he's riding, in any other film I haven't seen a horse so beautiful like Yul Brynner's horse in Westworld... OK, this is a very special film, very original, a science-fiction-western, written and directed by the master Michael Crichton. It can make you think of The Terminator, only here we have a real super actor in the person of Yul Brynner, not just a bag of muscles named Arnie... Richard Benjamin and James Brolin are good actors too, the music is great, everything is great. Simply a masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best sci-fi movies from the 70's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Westworld is beyond doubt one of the best sci-fi movies of the 70's decade, even now it is very interesting, in that time this movie was really revolutionary in its ideas. Westworld was beyond doubt a big influence on future flicks like Blade Runner, Jurrasic Park and Terminator. The cast for the movie was fantastic especially i think on role of Gunslinger played by legendary Yul Brynner, he is just fantastic, his cold scary face, like a real robot ready to shoot and kill you. Rihard Benjanmin and James Brolin are also very good in their roles. Effects were okay for that time, but the most i like about movie was atmosphere, later only feeled in first Terminator movie, also i found the movie to have deep philosophical themes, and had many questions in my head after watching it , what are we, are we living also in some kind of thematic park, is good for human race to make AI or it will be the end of everything human?.This movie is most seen for every lover of science fiction and old science fiction movies.I give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Crichton's best ? a Western-themed Jurassic Park</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Crichton's directorial debut is an excellent SF/Western/Thriller and a precursor to both Jurassic Park and The Terminator. While the script, based on an intelligent (and back then, quite original) premise, and containing all the hallmarks and recurring themes of Crichton's works (Man playing God, technology running amok and turning on its creators), is a little uneven, the film itself is quite possibly Crichton's best effort as a director ? inventive, suspenseful and entertaining throughout, with a masterful transition from the light-hearted, easy-going first half to the increasingly menacing, violent and grim second act.Yul Brynner's chilling performance as the Gunslinger dressed in all black (clearly a nod to his famous role in The Magnificent Seven, and a blueprint for Schwarzenegger's portrayal of the unstoppable killing machine in The Terminator) is especially memorable, but Richard Benjamin is also excellent in the role of the common man, the obvious gun fodder who has to dig deep into his inner reserves and defy the odds in order to survive.The special effects (a groundbreaking first use of digital image processing in a feature film among them) are also quite good for their time, but it is ultimately the great story and the excellent execution of it that makes Westworld an edge-of-your-seat experience and one of the essential SF movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At A Time Before Michael Crichton Became a Household Name</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Way before Michael Crichton wrote his most iconic novel "Jurassic Park", Michael Crichton went out of his way to construct a theme park of the future and like "Jurassic Park", things just don't go as planned. In his directorial debut, Dr. Crichton made "Westworld" which resulted in more credibility that what Steven Spielberg came up with in 1993. With similar vibes to the classics TV series "Wild Wild West", with a touch of killer androids making this movie one of the best of its kind combining science-fiction and Western together and the chemistry was both original and thought-provoking. A highly technologically enhanced fun park has been created for tourist attraction which also has included Medievalworld and Romanworld that were designed to marvel and desire the danger and at times lustful communication with human-like cyborgs. Richard Benjamin stars as Peter Martin who along with his more laid-back friend Jon Blane (James Brolin) venture into Westworld. The setting resembles the old Ponderosa Ranch from "Bonanza" complete with saloon fisticuffs, shooting parties and cyber babes ("cyber sex anyone"?). The fearful Martin has a conflict with a gunfighter who doesn't talk much, likely a cyborg played by the legendary performer Yul Brynner (sporting the same apparel he wore when he did "The Magnificent Seven"), and kills him which gives Martin some fueled up swagger. In some little details fully explained, real bullets were utilized, however with heat sensors installed, the cyborgs are suspended from killing any of the humans. If they did install heat sensors to the swords in Medievalworld is beyond me, however engineers' creation take a turn for a chaotic worst. It starts when Blane gets snake-bitten by a cyborg and then the defeated Yul Brynner bot resurrects to plot revenge first by killing Blane and later stalks Martin and just like Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator, he dies, but he keeps coming back. Then the bots start targeting after the tourists which results in Martin being the last survivor left after the day is done as he's being chased out of Westworld and enters the park's control centres and the remains of Medievalworld in which he was able to take down his adversary. Fatigued and out of breath, Martin hears a P.A. voice-over saying, "Have we got a vacation for you." And then the it fades out.Over the years, Dr. Crichton has spawned a myriad of novels and films throughout his illustrious career and a few obscure goodies even before becoming a household item. His themes would have a person obsessing themselves with technology like "Jurassic Park", only their ideas shift into a full-blown catastrophe. "Westworld" is the pinnacle of Dr. Crichton's direction and his approach towards epic comedy, which means underneath the thrills, there's a lot of subtle comedy and to end with some innocent sounding advertising at the end. The star of the movie Richard Benjamin was the example of the epic comic actor who was like his colleagues Gene Wilder and Charles Grodin his popularity spawned from movies like "Westworld". Benjamin would star in monumental adaptations of films like starring in Philip Roth's adaptation "Goodbye Columbus" and "Portnoy's Complaint". It's films like these where the humour lies upon brainy cynicism rather than cheap laughs. As soon as the decade came to a close, Benjamin's status plummeted to B-movies that lowered him quite substantially. Junk like "Quark", "Saturday the 14th" and "Love at First Bite" was too trashy for an intellectual guy like him to be starring in. But good fortune came his way when he stepped behind the camera to direct the wonderfully awesome Peter O'Toole movie "My Favourite Year". Sure his directing career has been hit- or-miss, but he has directed some great low-budgeted TV movies. Peter Fonda would later star in a rightfully-so obscure god- awful sequel "Futureworld" and the amazing appalling TV series which commenced in the 1980's titled "Beyond Westworld". In 2016 there will a remake series based on "Westworld" which should likely give the modern generation a chance to get to enjoy the ride like their parents and grandparents did in the early 1970's. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy are the creators of the series and serving as producers are J.J. Abrams and Brian Burk. There are big stars in here as well including Anthony Hopkins, Ed Harris and Evan Rachel Wood. "Westworld" stamps its place in the annals of great sci-fi classics of the 1970's like "Silent Running", "Capricorn Run", "THX 1138" and the 1968 classic "Planet of the Apes". All these aforementioned films set the tone involving issues related to the Vietnam War and the paranoia involving the Watergate Scandal. This was a time where sci-fi was becoming less campy and more serious in content which opened up a new appreciation to the king of all sci-fi's "Star Wars."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Robots Really Don't Like You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine Minnie and Mickey at Disney World suddenly pulling out Uzi's and mowing down the guests. Imagine if that animatronic Abraham Lincoln climbs off his platform and goes after you with a harpoon. That is kind of the feeling one gets with Westworld. For all I know there is an underground control room where they monitor all things in Disney World. Fortunately nothing has gone this wrong.Yul Brynner's robot has malfunctioned. Although playing the part of a gunslinger, somehow it has gone rogue. It is not just the gunslinger, although you might think so.What happens after that is fairly predictable. Other things don't really make a lot of sense. It has the inevitable 1973 conception of large computers, complete with reel to reel tapes as storage devices. It was fun seeing all the damaged robots being repaired, robotic animals, robotic dogs, even robotic snakes.The film makes me want to read the book. Maybe it is just me but the film seems over-edited. The fantasy sci-fi aspects of the film did not seem to me to be adequately fleshed out and a more plausible explanation for what went wrong. In short I think it was an entertaining but far from perfect fantasy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic that stands the test of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a little apprehensive about seeing this movie again after so much has advanced in our understanding of AI and consciousness but, except for the banks of tape and tiny crts, the technology of the machine's behavior was pretty plausible. The robots are designed with a certain range of behaviors which they initiate independently while human controllers act as monitors or conciousnesses to keep things from getting out of hand. Another nice touch comes when an operator notes that much of the code was generated by computers, technology that was just being developed at the time. The question of who is conscious and what they want is a lot more complicated than I realized 30 or so years ago when I saw this movie last. This movie and Future World were part of the conciousnesses of a generation that has now seen self driving cars and customer service chat bots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With an incoming TV adaptation from HBO that is being developed by Christopher Nolan's right hand man and brother Jonathon and mastermind J.J Abrams and with a cast that includes Anthony Hopkins, James Marsden and Ed Harris, Westworld the much loved, yet little seen 1973 Sci-Fi directed by renowned writer Michael Crichton is about to get a whole lot more popular. But does that make this effort worth your time? The short answer is yes but the long answer is not really, as Westworld is film with far better ideas than execution and acts as the perfect example of films that deserve to be remade and revisited as if done right, this not too far off HBO production should offer an abundant amount of goodness for Sci-Fi fans, action fans and all connoisseurs of brilliantly unique and bizarre ideas.Crichton who is arguably most famous for his writings of Jurassic Park and The Lost World, fills Westworld with an endless mine of material to delve into, from the at the time high end thoughts regarding robots, computer viruses, modern day theme parks and our fascination with looking back at old worlds like Rome, The Middle Ages and the Wild West and there's an unarguable joy in watching our protagonists Peter Martin played by Richard Benjamin and John Blane played by James Brolin who in this picture looks like a dead ringer for his son Josh, traverse the wild surrounds of a western settlement all the while being hunted by the increasingly determined robot gunslinger played by Yul Brynner. There really isn't much of a narrative drive here more so a serious of events and spectacles and it's where this version of Westworld falls the flattest and stops it becoming the true classic it so easily could've been, not just the fun time cult favourite that it is today.Filled with an endless parade of ideas and possibilities Westworld is perhaps a better film for what it might have been not for actually what it is but it's an undeniably fun 90 or so minutes that marks an interesting moment in Sci-Fi writing regarding the onset of AI and computer technology and with HBO at the helm, I for one am mightily keen to see the TV version of what could just be your new favourite adventure in waiting.3 misbehaving robot rattlesnakes out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Merely satisfying, greatly improved whenever Brynner is on screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late Michael Crichton was a busy man. As well as being a prolific novelist, he has worked in TV and film for three decades, and had more than a few of his books, to varying degrees of quality, adapted for the screen. Some have been enormously successful (Jurassic Park (1993) and its ongoing franchise), and some have been quite diabolical (I'm looking at you, Congo (1995), the film I was subjected to as a child while my older brother went into the next screen to watch Pulp Fiction). One of his most intriguing ideas was his first stint as a feature-film director, Westworld, the tale of a futuristic theme park turned bloodbath.Company Delos have created a trio of parks based on celebrated historical periods, in which their customers are allowed to roam freely to indulge their darkest fantasies. Medieval World and Roman World are self-explanatory, as is West World, their most popular attraction. Park frequenter John Blane (James Brolin) treats his virgin friend Peter Martin (Richard Benjamin) to a fortnight of gun- slingin', whore-frequentin' and whisky-drinkin' in West World, where robots disguised uncannily as humans play out their roles as bandits, saloon owners, and various other Western stereotypes. Peter is at first reluctant to get into the spirit, until he is bad- mouthed by the mechanical 'Gunslinger' (Yul Brynner) and blows the dead-eyed cyborg away. His inner primate is awoken, until the robots start to malfunction and begin to hunt every human in the parks.Although Westworld clearly wasn't written with any sense of grand satire in mind and the film, for the most part, is certainly entertaining, the gaping plot-holes leave much to be explained. The guns are designed not to work when pointed at humans, so they are told that anything goes. Fists-fights and bank robberies are frequent events, so what is to stop someone from being stabbed or bludgeoned to death without the ability to tell human from metal? The men tasked with repairing the damaged and glitch-y robots comment that as the machine were part-created by computers, nobody really understand how they work, and are left scratching their heads as the malfunction incidents rise and rise. It's convenient writing that almost borders on lazy, so it is pleasing that the plot moves at a brisk pace, becoming gradually creepier by the minute.The film, ironically, truly comes alive when Brynner is on screen. The opening third focuses mainly on John, Peter and various other tourists frequenting the other parks as they arrive with bright eyes, introduce us to their holiday destinations, and set about seducing, fighting, or whatever debauchery they have planned. These scenes are most comical, so the tone shifts significantly when the Gunslinger starts shooting people dead for real. Brynner's stoic, emotion-free performance is chilling, and his climactic face-off with Peter is suitably nerve-jangling. Yet I feel an opportunity was missed somewhat, in favour of a more accessible, audience-friendly movie.. The story is full of possibilities and the ingredients were there to create a darker, weightier movie about a fantastical threat that we ponder more today than ever before, but I found it merely satisfying, greatly improved whenever Brynner shows his face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Older than Star Wars or Logans Run, "Westworld" is a concept sci-fi movie ahead of its time. Written and directed well by Michael Crichton , this short but potent sci-fi telegraphs itself fairly poorly, but what it lacks in mystery and intrigue, it makes up in execution and robot realism. The late Yul Bryner was probably an inspiration for Robert Patrick's T2 T1000 machine acting, he does a fabulous job action acting, though he speaks less than 10 lines in the movie in total. No don't go in expecting Magnificent Seven. The only other thing that annoyed a bit was the dirt-poor use of paint as blood. I realize this is a movie filmed in 1972, but they couldv'e done a little better with at least the color, alas. Give it a 7.5/10, and it was probably a doozy on its initial release. I liked even over 40+ years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>interesting concept from Crichton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Delos is an amusement park for rich adult vacationers at $1k/day. There're Medieval World, Roman World and Westworld. Real human looking robots are used to provide the tourists with the perfect fantasy satisfaction. The only way to differentiate are the less-than-perfect hands. John Blane (James Brolin) is a jaded veteran while his friend Peter Martin (Richard Benjamin) is a first timer. They go to Westworld and get into fights with a robotic gunslinger (Yul Brynner). However, robot malfunctions are spreading like a virus.Michael Crichton has an interesting concept but his directions could be better. Of course, it has similarities with his novel 'Jurassic Park'. It takes too long to get the action going. It's a watchable introduction to Westworld but it's not nearly tense enough. The robot prostitute is too sad. There are some unexciting old fashioned western stunts. There is one terrific fire stunt near the end. The movie gains some thrills as the gunslinger pursues Peter Martin. However the character keeps making silly mistakes and the wrong choices. Please, he needs to pick up a weapon. This could be improved with some CG effects and would make a good remake. I don't know about a TV series however. That might be too stretched out. It has possibilities of increased violence and sexuality if they want it. A remake could definitely be darker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit right off the bat that I'm probably not the right target audience for this movie and I was probably expecting something different than what I got. I'm a little bit "hot and cold" when it comes to late 60s/ early 70s sci-fi movies. There are some that I absolutely adore and some that I just cannot tolerate sitting through. I would imagine that there are some hardcore sci-fi acolytes out there that worship this movie, but it just kind of left me unimpressed and unexcited. Perhaps I was expecting more "thrills" or more of a terror factor. I definitely expected a little bit more from the final act.Director Michael Crichton's first attempt at making a movie about an amusement park gone wild. I can't imagine what horrible experience he had at Disney to cause these fears. I believe, in some ways, that you had "to have been there" to truly appreciate this movie. I love classic film, so that's not a comment that it's old, so it's moldy. However, I cannot put myself into a mind frame where robotics where still no new and mysterious and terrifying. Then again, we're still making movies about this human fear, right, so it's not so outdated, but something here really feels like the cheesy Presidential animatronics at Disney going crazy. You can expect lots of the trappings of sci-fi from this era. The park scientists locked in a room with lot of lights and giant computers and beeping noises. The robots highly developed "infrared vision" which looks like your camera phone when you've zoomed in much too far. The silly hovercraft that brings the guests to the island destination, rather than just flying them in on a plane.All that said, I'm not holding those things against the movie. Those are conditions of the time and place in which it was made and should not prevent enjoyment, if the movie can deliver on other grounds, but that's where it just fails. The first hour of the movie is basically two tourists acting out a bunch of western movie clichés. While I get that this would be fun as a tourist, it's not fun to watch because most resorts to scenes you've seen in hundreds of westerns.Things get going when the robots go crazy, but even that is disappointing. Really, you get some quick scenes of Roman robots wrestling women to the ground. The king of Medieval World challenges a guest to the most boring sword fight ever and kills him in the least bloody sword death ever, which is the signal that things are going bad.Then, the Terminator chases...oh wait, wrong movie. Yes, I can see that this influenced Cameron greatly, but it's nowhere near as tense. Yul Bryner basically repeats his MAGNIFICENT SEVEN character and his gunslinger is our main villain, chasing one of our featured tourists for far too long and with no real excitement to the chase, either.I think that the message of the movie is definitely conveyed, but seems to have got in the way of making a great film. I know that many consider this to be a classic and I definitely didn't hate it, but I am also not recommending that you run out and see this any time soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boy, do we have a vacation for you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scene of Westworld sets up the movie very nicely, with its idea of commercialism and consumerism as a group of vacationing tourists are given the chance to talk about their experiences at the many different theme parks that were available. There are a variety of different theme parks that the tourists can go to. One is called Medieval World, which takes place in ancient history. There's Roman World, where the people there are dressed up in period clothing. And then there's Westworld. Westworld is a tourist attraction that takes place in 1880.Everything inside is monitored by the computers and their programmers. But, what's interesting is that the people inside are actually robots. Not just any robots, but genetically programmed robots that can interact with the tourists. At first, everything seems to be okay for now. But, as the tourists become more involved in their daily life inside these theme parks, their vacations are about to take a turn for the worst. After noticing some slight malfunctions on the robots, the scientists behind the theme parks realize that the robots are going haywire. It doesn't take long for the scientists to realize that the robots are starting to terrorize the tourists, scaring them by going on a killing spree.The story of Westworld was written by critically acclaimed sci-fi author Michael Crichton. Crichton took a directing credit as well. His vision of the theme parks are very well done and has some very impressive art direction. But, what I think Crichton would've done in this movie is to cut back on some of the scenes since the movie has a very interesting story. Not only interesting, but serious about what would happened if there was a possible malfunction inside one of the theme parks. Crichton has explored this kind of story in his works such as Jurassic Park. where, In that story, genetically engineered dinosaurs were the main villains. Here, there is only one great villain. Yul Brynner plays the villain in this movie and he definitely delivers his most chilling performance in a long time. In the movie, he plays a western gunslinger, who's preys upon the local tourists, (Richard Benjamin and James Brolin), who are just trying to stay alive while vacationing at Westworld. Brynner's performance really did convinces me that he didn't have to overload on acting like a robot. All he had to do is act with a straight face and especially narrows his glaring eyes toward his victims. Two other objections that I have to the movie is the screenplay, which was written by Crichton himself. The script is somehow standardized, with the human characters saying a lot of standard sci-fi dialogue, especially when Richard Benjamin's character is being chased toward the end of the movie by Brynner's character. That scene is one of the many problems with Westworld. Those scenes in particular, including the barroom fight in Westworld hurt the picture, slightly. But, it doesn't hurt the hardware of the movie. The design of the robots and the special effects are truly amazing and dazzling. I love how the technicians have to repair the robots overnight and have them ready to go in the morning. The set-up of the theme parks are very well done and very well-directed by Crichton.Despite some slow patches and plot holes, Westworld is a joy to watch in wonder and fascination. The art direction is very well done and also interesting. Brynner's character is very terrifying in the movie and even his performance makes him more believable. One thing that I admired about the performance by Yul Brynner and also the supporting actors who plays the androids is that they didn't have to act ridiculous to play a robotic character. All they have to do is wait on their cue and play it out straight. There is no need to act strict and straight up. As for the human characters, I wish Crichton would've done a better job of making his human characters believable just like the robots themselves. I didn't think he put a lot of emphasis on those people, but I simply enjoy what Crichton did for the androids and the hardware.Westworld is no 2001. But, as a enjoyment, it certainly works on a entertainment level. It doesn't go for cheap thrills and it certainly doesn't go for bad laughs.It is just simply good. &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; 3 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entertaining futuristic thriller-drama. Surely the movie that influenced a host of later movies, the most obvious being Terminator and all its sequels.Not perfect - it has a few plot-holes - but you don't mind them too much as you are happy to be swept along by the story.And what a story it is. Set in a believable future, the background and setup are good, and very interesting. The plot is developed well: methodically and piece by piece, without giving much away. You know something is going to happen, but you're not sure what exactly.When the movie does reach its climax, its quite a ride, featuring one of the baddest bad guys ever.That bad guy is played by Yul Brynner. He gives a great performance as an evil robot. No, that's not sarcasm. He is truly scary in the role.Good performances too by Richard Benjamin and James Brolin. Dick Van Patten provides the comedic moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Precursor to "Terminator" and "Jurassic Park"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE PLOT: "Westworld" is about a new amusement park, Delos, which features three themes to enjoy: Roman World, Medieval World and Western world. Guests can go back in time, in a sense, and pretend to be a part of these various worlds. All three are inhabited by very life-like robots whom you can kill or have sex with, according to your whim. Things go awry when the robots malfunction and become deadly.The film features James Brolin and Richard Benjamin as guests and Yul Brynner as the determined black-clad cowboy robot/assassin.ANALYSIS: I didn't see this classic sci-fi flick until fairly recently so I was able to view it without nostalgia-tinged glasses. It's not bad; it's definitely worth picking up if you can find it cheap. It's enjoyable to see old films like this because it's like going back in time. Still, I can't help but point out that it's a tad overrated. Yes, it should be honored as the prototype for better films like "The Terminator" and "Jurassic Park," but "Westworld" itself borrows heavily from other material, such as episodes of the original Star Trek; for instance, the Trek segment "What Are Little Girls Made Of?" (episode #10), which was released a full 7 years before "Westworld." This episode of Trek is an all-around better story.Secondly, "Westworld" doesn't seem like a major-league production; Jeff Shannon describes it as a "low-budget backlot production," and he's fairly accurate. There are some obvious kinks that should have been worked out. For instance, there's a decidedly empty, barren vibe to the pic, especially the last 40 minutes or so. Also, consider the last images of the Brynner robot at the very end, it smacks of cheapness and could have been done in a much more impacting way.BOTTOM LINE: Despite my reality-check criticisms, "Westworld" is worth viewing or including in your video library. Just don't expect to be blown away (in the manner of, say, "The Terminator").GRADE: C+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>for interesting idea. for the Yul Brynner impressive performance. and for splendid manner to transform a SF script in axis of a credible image about present. because this film is, in a deep form, a mirror. all is simple - machines vs. people , need of surrogates for reality, the victorious week character and the atmosphere of many fantastic films of period. a film about measure and survive. nothing else. and, more than genius of director, cultural references ,holes, warning, it is a beautiful movie. it is an interesting exercise to do a smart thriller in skin of dystopia speech. and a slice about limits and role of hedonism in contemporary society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When a robot malfunction occurs at a futuristic theme park, chaos breaks out and its up to one of the few remaining guests to fend off the last, most advanced robot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Likes: Westworld is a very enjoyable movie. From start to finish, it keeps the audience engaged in the storyline. Unlike other sci-fi movies, it doesn't rely on cheesy special effects to keep its audience interested. I liked many things about this movie, here's a few. #1 the movie is appealing to many people. Just imagine if you could be a real life cowboy or even a Roman King. I'm sure that most people would enjoy stepping out of the real world for a few days and pretend to be someone that they are not. #2 the movie is very good at showing the audience the lavish lifestyles that the guests live. Guests at any of the 3 worlds can do as they please. Lets say you chose to go to Medieval world, in this world, you could do things such as have great feasts and even partake in fighting troublesome citizens (robots). #3 Westworld is a very action packed movie. From bar fights to stand offs outside the saloon, this movie has something to offer for everyone.Dislikes: There's not many significant things that I don't like about this movie.Conclusion: Westworld is easily an instant classic and for young writer and director Michael Crichton, he really struck gold with this movie. If you are contemplating on seeing this, don't hesitate, it's a treat to watch, and trust me, you wont be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie is like if Disneyland's Frontierland meets Terminator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To quote from another Michael Crichton novel Jurassic Park, 'all major theme parks have delays. When they opened Disneyland in 1956 nothing worked.' in which Dr. Ian Malcolm reply. 'Yeah, but, John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don't eat the tourists'. This movie is very similar to Jurassic Park in a way. Westworld is Michael Crichton's first foray into the theme park gone to hell genre. The film version of the book has James Brolin as John Blane and Richard Benjamin as Peter Martin. These two bored yuppies wants an adventure at Delios which is bill as the ultimate theme park where nothing can go wrong. Yeah right. Customers burn their wallets for a few days to live in their own real life child hood fantasies. There is Roman world where the vices of sex, lust and violence can come true. If the customer isn't for that, there is Medieval World where knighthood, code of honor and virtue live on. For the extreme adventure customer, there is West World, a lawless world of violence and sex. Each world is closely control by scientists whom runs the androids throughout the day by day activities to make sure everything runs smoothly. John and Peter chose West World and for a few days they have the time of their lives shooting up the Gunslighter (Yul Brynner) and hooking up with androids prostitutes. When a robot rattlesnake (I don't know why they have one. Seems like a waste of money) bites one of the guest, the fun is over as the robots began to act up and started to kill guests. Murphy's Law has strike. One robot 'the Gunslighter' will do anything to kill Peter and John. Yul Brynner is amazing in the role. Yul Brynner does an excellent job as the menacing, devil eyed gunslinger. This movie was pre Terminator, but you can see a bit of influences how a robot is supposed to act that James Cameron might have use for his movie. One good example are the Gunslighter's eyes that tends to grow white in the dark while the body is in shadow. It's remind me of the red eyes of the Terminator. This was the first feature film to use digital image processing to pixellate photography to simulate an android point of view. The way Yul Brynner walk is similar to the way Terminator walks throughout his film as well. Richard Benjamin is just not a very good actor especially in lead roles. Young James Brolin looks like Christian Bale in the film whom plays sidekick to Richard. He probably works better than Richard as the leading man. The chase and action scene is really slow and dated. This film moves from humor to fantasy to horror almost seamlessly. Still the movie has a lot of plot holes and scenes that makes you question way too much. You will be asking yourself these questions such as robots having real weapons, robots can or can't have liquid, or why was there a silly bar fight when people can get hurt? I know the film is saying that the park has some dangers as that is the whole appeal, but really what happen if a guest punch out another guest. That doesn't make any sense. Every film has one plot point or another that can be nitpicked to death, but this film has a good amount of it. Still, rather than obsessing over details, I found this movie to be entertaining. One of my favorite all time Sci Fiction films. Westworld was also the last movie MGM produced before dissolving its releasing company, and was the first theatrical feature directed by Crichton. The film was followed by a sequel film Futureworld and a short lived television series Beyond Westworld. Give the movie a try and you find yourself enjoying the chaos of a theme park goes amok.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May not look like much...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The following year, writer/director Michael Crichton had another of his works adapted for the big screen. Mike Hodges' THE TERMINAL MAN, however, was criminally ignored and just about sank without a trace. WESTWORLD, on the other hand, was popular enough to spawn a sequel (FUTUREWORLD) ? but the less said about that the better.It may not look like much now ? in fact it resembles an early seventies Universal Studios made-for-TV flick ? but WESTWORLD was almost a cutting-edge piece of sci-fi cinema back in the day. The plot revolves around a sort of Disneyland for adults', Delos, a holiday resort of the future. Delos allows for punters to realise their fantasies and act them out in a choice of Roman World, Medieval World or the Westworld of the title. Each world is populated by humanoid robots capable of emulating human behaviour in response to the whims of the customers. They can be fought, "killed" or sexually abused like good and willing slaves. Fail-safes are in place to protect the paying tourists from harm ? like six guns that won't fire at anything with a heat signature. And for the first three-quarters of the movie, all is mostly well. But gradual cracks and anomalies start to show and eventually it all ends in chaos and death as the robots run amok and start to slaughter the holidaymakers. But, you knew that was on the cards, right? So why does it stand out? Well, seventies stalwarts Richard Benjamin and James Brolin feature as friends kicking back in Westworld. Benjamin is a pussy-whipped divorcée and Brolin is his more bachelor-orientated buddy who has been to Westworld before and thinks he knows the ropes. They are two sides of a deadly relationship triangle. The other side is Yul Brynner's robot gunslinger. The three represent an exercise in near perfect casting, but really it's Brynner's film all the way. His character is an inhuman version of his Chris persona from THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. He even ? probably deliberately ? dresses the same. But there the similarities end. He functions purely to provoke gunfights and be killed. But when the technological order breaks down he continues to follow his programming and provoke gunfights but doesn't allow himself to be killed. With the brakes off he becomes an implacable nemesis with only one mission ? to do the killing.Subtle satire taking clever swipes at Hollywood, consumerism and technology are on the menu. Promos for Delos promise an authentic experience, but the three worlds are in fact shallow Hollywood versions of reality bearing no resemblance to their real-life counterparts. It is fakery based on fakery, yet one character describes his experience as "the most real thing I've ever done." Which, when you think about it, is a sad indictment of modern life.Crichton's message seems to be one of mistrust. You can't trust what you're being told, you can't trust technology and you certainly can't trust in what looks like the hero from a classic western movie. This is further reinforced by Brolin's anger and dismay when his illusions start to be dented as a result of an attack by a robot rattlesnake which leaves him with a wounded arm. "This isn't supposed to happen!" he rages. However, he's just too complacent to perceive it as anything other than an isolated glitch and his guard remains down. Which is his undoing.The narrative slowly builds a sense of growing unease as the techno-guys running the show become gradually more perplexed by an increasing number inexplicable malfunctions. Politically, they are like a government who know that things are going wrong, but don't really know why or what to do about it. When all systems fail, they are left to suffocate in their underground basement control centre whilst the robots disobey programming and turn on the humans.The shenanigans ? barroom brawls, jailbreaks, gunfights, human-on-robot sex ? are good fun and served up with good humour, but the film really kicks into a higher and more malevolent gear when the gunslinger blows Brolin away and chases lone survivor Benjamin across the resort, locked into his objective of killing him.Brynner's steel-eyed assassin is always functioning one step ahead as the human protagonist flees aimlessly from Westworld, through Roman World to a climax in Medieval World. Brynner manages to convince on two levels ? as a robotic pre-terminator terminator and as another entity with a sly suggestion of self-awareness and sentient thought going on. He skilfully transforms what must have originally seemed a largely thankless role into one that embodies a rare combination of near human traits and pure mechanical menace.This is a key seventies sci-fi film that conceals some significant level of intelligence beneath a deceptive surface of TV movie veneer. It may not look like much, but it's much more than what it looks like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being middle-aged, I'm still too young to have heard bout this, before it came up on TCM the other night. I knew nothing, except seeing this as a ChrichtonI work, I thought I should heck it out. And was I awarded!?!This is not only an amazing and fun movie, with lots offbeat acting. This is also a remarkable good idea, and turn into a movie which is nothing less than a masterpiece! This caught me right from the start, when we see a couple if guys going on vacation to a dream world. A vacation where you almost go back in time to the wild west, the Roman empire with frivolous sex, or the Europen middle ages. Most of them you meet here are robots, which a looking so human you're afraid to hurt them. Nevertheless, you can kill them if they bother you. At least until something goes wrong..I was SO entertained though this movie, I can only tell I've only once for the last to years felt like it, watching 2020-movie Mr.Nobody. I also recall the same great feeling while watching Matrix. They at all such great ideas, making films which is a true gens to watch if you're into sci-fi.This is Michael Chrichton's masterpiece, both in writing and directing. He's behind the fabulous The Andromeda Strain, Jurasic Park, Coma, The 13th warrior, and the whole E.R. TV-series. Sadly he died in 2008, only 64 years old. With him we lost a great writer nd scriptwriter, as well as producer and director.I now just after watching this, found out this is the very first movie to have used computer generated images, and also gave a follow up in Futureworld as well as a TV-series.Treat yourself to see this! You'll be entertained as well as warned of a thing that will happen in a now even closer future!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Idea-centric science fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't watched "Westworld" for some time and decided to give it a shot again. {pun intended} I found it enormously enjoyable. It is set in a strange theme park which recreates three theme worlds: the Wild West, Rome. and a Medieval Castle. Guests for $1000 a day can live in any of these worlds which are peopled by realistic android-like robots. The adventure you experience is based on your choice of theme park. The two main characters,Peter and John {Richard Benjamin and James Brolin respectively} choose to go to Westworld where they relive the wild west and experience gunfights, saloon brawls, etc. Naturally the are meant to win all their fights and never come to any harm for everything is monitored in a high tech {by the standard of the seventies} control room. What happens when everything goes wrong and a terminator-type gunslinger robot, perfectly played by Yul Brynner goes berserk and decides to hunt down Peter and John? This is one of those science-fiction films that depends on a fantastic premise and analyses the effect of its basic concept on individuals and society. While there are quite significant plot-holes, the film works and works brilliantly on the thematic level. It questions our preconceptions on a number of levels. For instance:Why do people need to experience dream worlds which only feed their egos? Does this stunt our ability to experience real, basic human relationships? Do we place too much trust in technology? Will such trust undermine our existence? Do we undervalue human imagination?Science fiction has always tended to be an idea oriented genre, and this is the case here. A significant problem with this film lies in that orientation. There is nothing in the way of deeper, genuine, emotional relationships. There is no love interest. Strangely, the final act takes place in the medieval world where two robots--one male the other female--sit together on a throne and a third begs for help in a dungeon. It is a such an emotionally cold film. When the ending arrives there is an odd feeling of emptiness. Perhaps this is the final lesson that the film attempts to convey. We learn too late that our humanity can be replaced--and destroyed.By ourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really splendid idea for a vacation that was made in to an OK movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recap: Peter and John are two friends who's going on a really special vacation. They're going to one of Delos amusement parks. Delos has a brand new concept of theme parks, RomanWorld, CastleWorld and WestWorld, staffed by extremely real looking robots. For just a thousand dollars a day you can experience any one of those periods of time, just like it was. Supposedly harmless and safe, management is worried by the increasing number of malfunctions among the robots. Finally the robots go totally crazy and the dream vacation turn into a horrible nightmare.Comments: A sci-fi comedy that gradually turns into a thriller but overall is pretty harmless fun. I found it entertaining and the genre shifting, something that can be tricky, didn't bother me at all. However, that may be because it is somewhat hard to really take seriously. There are just too many plot holes left unanswered. But it is still consistent enough to be entertaining.Yul Brunner is the lead name, but not the lead character, which is played by Richard Benjamin supported mainly by James Brolin. But it is Brunner and his Gunslinger character that has left the biggest mark on time. Supposedly the Gunslinger was partly inspiring to Schwarzenegger's Terminator and the movie has been spoofed by the Simpsons. I'm not sure I was that impressed, as it is supposed to be a stiff character, but he does it well.And now there is a rumor that it will be remade in 2012, I wonder who will carry that legacy. But I don't doubt there is room for improvement. It is a good story, and with overwhelmingly better special and CGI effects, it could be something special in the right hands. The effects in the original isn't bad, it never disturbed me, but let's face it. It was made in the early seventies.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The future is now (or maybe not)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We watched Westworld last night: first time I'd seen it in ages. It's still great fun, all paranoid futurism, macho satire and the insane staring killer-robot eyes of Yul Brynner. Perhaps more surprisingly, it's also clearly a big influence on the Terminator films.My favourite moment is one character explaining to another how you can tell who's a robot and who's not: "The hands," he says. "They haven't managed to perfect those yet." Which begs two questions: what's different about their hands (it might have been the grainy film that denied forensic analysis) and, more importantly, why haven't they? Anyway, despite the fact that it's a classic, what's more fun is of course noting how it Gets The Future Wrong in Entertaining Ways. Thus: 1. All the computer technicians are men in white coats. Clearly the world of the early 70s was more respectful towards its geeks, and would have been shocked at the prospect of dead-white skinned conspiracy freaks getting high on Diet Coke as they shinned up the latest data drainpipe to hack into the NATO mainframe or something.2. The computers themselves all use tapes. Come on, people, let's at least try to imagine the future.3. Everyone travels from place to place in sleek-looking spaceships. And yet the robot repairmen go around in electric buggies that would fall apart at the mere thought of a Sinclair C5. Highly practical for getting around the rocky desert-scape.4. The green-screen lab monitors appear to show little useful information, but do a nifty line in seemingly pointless twisting geometric shapes, a bit like pre-Windows 95 screensavers.And finally, seemingly the first thing all the men do when they arrive in Westworld is seek out the nearest robot prostitute. Completely ridiculous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Westworld-"Boy, have we got a vacation for you!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching perhaps the earliest movie adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel called The Andromeda Strain, I was anxious to see for the first time in its entirety-having previously stumbled into the last hour on a late night showing during the '80s-his first theatrical feature film as writer and director, Westworld. It's part of an adult amusement park from Delos that also provides Roman World and Medieval World. Among the visitors are Peter Martin (Richard Benjamin) and John Blane (James Brolin) who's been there before. They shoot the Gunslinger (Yul Brynner) several times at different places since he's just a robot. They also meet Miss Carrie (Majel Barrett) who provides them with women willing to bed them. Like the Gunslinger, the women are also androids though the only way one could tell is by looking at their hands. I'll stop there and just say what a fun and at times serious thriller this was! I mean the way they go back and forth on the various settings and the men at the computers making all the tourists' dreams come true. But watch out, the machines are going to go berserk with the Gunslinger especially looking for revenge! Kudos to Crichton and the players and also to the music scorer-Fred Karlin. He really does light-hearted and dark melodies really well. Also, Dick Van Patten is also good in his comic relief role as another tourist. So on that note, I highly recommend you go to Westworld-without actually being there, of course-and watch from the safety of the big or small screen. P.S. Besides Crichton, Karlin is also from the Windy City as is Benjamin's character and yours truly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yul Log</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 1960, Yul Brynner played a black-garbed gunslinger named Chris Adams in the classic Hollywood Western "The Magnificent Seven." Flash forward 13 years, and we find Yul looking virtually the same, and portraying another black-garbed gunslinger, in "Westworld." The only real difference: This time he is a Model 406 robot, one of many such programmed mechanisms at the futuristic fantasy resort of Delos, comprised of Roman World, Medieval World and, of course, Westworld. Offering unlimited opportunities for role-playing at a mere $1,000 a day, no wonder the resort proves so irresistible to vacationers Richard Benjamin and James Brolin...until, that is, the system breaks down and the robots revolt! A surprise hit for Warner Bros. back when, "Westworld" takes its time getting started, and its first hour or so amusingly treats us to the usual Western mix of shoot-outs, jailbreaks, bar fights and whorehouses. It is only in the film's final 1/3 that things really pick up, as all heck busts loose in all of Delos' themed sectors. Yul, it must be said, is absolutely marvelous as The Gunslinger, embodying a mechanical killer so seemingly unstoppable that he automatically brings to mind a certain Austrian-inflected, terminating cyborg of 11 years later. The film's FX are better than adequate, the most impressive of which, perhaps, are Yul's glowing eyeballs, shown to great effect in a darkened hallway. Writer/director Michael Crichton acquits himself well on both scores here, although the film never goes quite over the top enough for my tastes, and does end a tad abruptly. Nice to see "Star Trek" favorite Majel Barrett, though, as a robotic bordello madam, as well as Playboy Playmate Anne Randall (May '67, for all you guys out there) as the luscious servant girl Daphne. Ultimately, "Westworld" turns out to be some pretty grim sci-fi indeed; initially lighthearted and becoming increasingly tense, the film serves as a warning to not take those pleasure gizmos for granted. I'm certainly primed for the sequel now: 1976's "Futureworld"....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gray Area</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it's because of Richard Benjamin. He's got this way of making everything he does sort of tongue-in-cheek, like he's smiling secretly at whatever he, the actor, does. Anyway, Benjamin's perfectly cast here. The movie itself belongs to an unusual sci-fi category? it's not just scary or thought provoking, it's also fun. Not that shooting people or running them through with a broadsword is amusing. It's that these episodes are hard to take seriously since the film does feature the droll Benjamin inside an amusement park. Besides Brolin's ultra-cool dude needs some taking down, while Bartold's play-acting knight gets a lesson in real weaponry, as the tables turn and the hunters become the hunted. Of course, there's also Brynner and his computerized Frankenstein, a manic creation that turns on its creators. With that demonic glint, he's like a cold dose of reality among all the game playing. But there's that same weird sense of poetic justice with him too. After all, he's been the fall guy, taking bullets day after day so yuppies like Benjamin can get a macho feel. For me, there's something oddly satisfying about his sudden turning of the tables even if he is just a sophisticated robot. And this raises for me an odd reaction to the revolt as a whole?that somehow it's the working out of an expanded sense of justice that includes even these programmed machines. They're human-like in most every way, but function as nothing more than computerized toys for our destructive amusement. It's like they're saying?"Okay, you've made us as human as possible; now we're going to do what you would do if you were in our place. We're turning on our tormentors". Thus, some sort of line is crossed between man and machine, into a gray area of neither man nor robot. And that raises important questions about ethics, technology and potentials. Anyway, I think this is a worthwhile angle on what is otherwise a darn entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's Not Supposed To Happen !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Delos is a luxury theme park resort where the tourists live out their fantasies in fabricated worlds populated by lifelike robots. Peter and John are holidaying in Westworld, a wild-west frontier town, when suddenly the android programming goes horribly wrong ?Brilliantly written and directed, Crichton's first film is exceptional on multiple levels - as a straight action movie full of dynamic fights, chases and shocks, as an eerily effective blend of ancient and modern film styles (the shot of the body-strewn main street at night as the technicians come out is an astonishingly wrong image), and as a clever social satire of theme parks and decadent consumer leisure gone insane. In a strange way, the robots are almost more sympathetic than the humans - after all, they're only doing what they've been asked to - whereas the people are mostly corpulent pigs who demand what they've paid for. The masterstroke is the casting of iconic Brynner as the indefatigable black-clad gunslinger; not only is his physical performance outstanding, but his presence links this futuristic science-fiction film perfectly to a bygone cinematic age of epics and westerns. The stunning half-hour chase between him and Benjamin which concludes the movie is both great action and a mini-existentialist odyssey. Crichton dispassionately documents the complete failure of the technicians' ability to control their systems, but never at the expense of the ongoing story - his sense of the rhythm of the plot is superb. Featuring much excellent stuntwork and action choreography throughout by the prolific Dick Ziker, including a stunning example of the notoriously dangerous full body burn. This terrific science-fiction cult classic exemplifies my three Golden Rules of good cinema; make it original, make it exciting and make it stylish. Extremely influential on many subsequent sci-fi flicks (notably The Terminator and Jurassic Park), and followed by an enjoyable but unexceptional 1976 sequel, Futureworld.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Boy, have we got a vacation for you!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Does maintain the suspense of the second half, making up for the rather dated, slow-moving first hour. Yul Brynner is still gold in this old sci-fi thriller, directed by bestselling author/director Michael Chrichton, who would later create another "Theme-park" thriller JURASSIC PARK, which would later become a bestseller and much later, a definitive blockbuster. Before that, we had THE TERMINATOR, a movie with the same kind of villain, an emotionless killing machine gone haywire. While dated at most spots, and the pacing quite uneven, WESTWORLD is a clever piece of vintage science fiction. Richard Benjamin and James Brolin play two vacationers who decide to relieve a new experience when they take a vacation on the new adult-oriented theme park of the title where they are able to relieve the old days of the Wild West. Things get tricky when they get a close encounter with a rebellious gunslinger (Brynner) who is among the malfunctioning androids of the seemingly-harmless park. A bit slow when it comes to its pacing, WESTWORLD still charms with inventive set-pieces.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched this movie when I was very young, and just finished watching it again. The premise of a resort where you can kill, steal, fornicate,etc without consequence while playing a role in a make believe world is tempting, to say the least. There are quite a few underlying themes, man vs machine, fidelity, controlling the environment, to name a few. I think that they are all well represented in this film. Its presented in a way that will pull you in and keep you glued to the screen until the end! Are there plot/techinical problems? Sure, as in any film. There are times a deactivated robot is blinking or breathing, a gun that shoot bullets until the battery dies, etc, you could even challenge the idea that power to the robots could be "cut off" since they are not plugged into any thing. I recommend you ignore this small issues and enjoy the film on all of its levels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bemusing new future world park for adult vacation come two vacationers friends(Richard Benjamin, James Brolin). The pleasure resort named Delos(like a futuristic Dineyland) is constituted by three fantastic world, the Roman Empire, Dark Age and Western. It's serviced by lifelike robots that provide anything they want. The customers have the opportunity to live several fantasies, but a computer breakdown and the robots are turning against tourists.The starring are suddenly confronted killer robot on impressive and dazzling scenarios.This Sci-Fi picture made big scale and high budget contains stimulating in parts and is pretty entertaining. Climatic pursuit throughout diverse worlds is chilling mounted and various images seem admirably exciting . A black-suited (the seven magnificent-alike) Yul Brynner is a frightening and cold android gun-slinger who inexorably pursues Richard Benjamin and James Brolin . Appear as secondaries famous television actors: Dick Van Patten(Eight is enough), Majel Barret(Gene Roddenberry wife,Star Trek) and almost extra, Jared Martin(TV War of worlds). Rare and creepy music score by Fred Karlin and atmospheric cinematography by Gene Polito. The motion picture is well written and professionally directed by Michael Crichton during six weeks. Crichton is a famous novelist and screenwriter( Jurassic Park,Congo,Sphere,Andromeda Strain) and occasionally director(Coma,Runaway,First train robbery,Physical evidence).Followed by inferior sequel also produced by Paul Lazarus : Futureworld(1976)directed by Richard T Heffron and with Peter Fonda and Blyte Danner. Plus, a television series titled ¨Beyond Westworld¨ with five episodes where a scientific sending robots around world . Furthermore, ¨Welcome to blood city¨(Peter Sasdy) with similar argument of this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great if somewhat flawed film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one respect the premise of Westworld is Las Vegas, NV taken to its logical conclusion: an 'adult' playground in every sense of the word. The idea that the rich would spend $1000 a day to indulge in their wildest fantasies is not that unrealistic either. Also many of the special effects for the Westworld robots were improved on and showed up again many times in the SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN series of which the 'fembot' episodes (Kill Oscar, Fembots in Las Vegas) copied the face concept seen in this movie.That said there are a few problems with the picture (spoilers past this point). The explanation on how the gun won't kill another guest ignores the idea of the guest or robot missing (Brynner as the amok Gunslinger misses several times). It also fails to deal the swords and daggers that abound in the Roman and Medieval Worlds - what's to prevent two guests from hurting each other in those Worlds? Why would the control room have powered doors? A normal manual door with a rubber seal would have done the same job (used by many University computer rooms today in fact) And why didn't those doors have an way to open them manually (a mandatory fire requirement these days)? Furthermore other than the phone there is no indication that the control room is being effected by the robot malfunctions so why does it go haywire along with the robots? We know from scenes (the bar and dinner) in Westworld that the robots can eat and drink so why does giving the girl robot a drink short her out? Michael Crichton published the script for Westworld in book form - it makes an excellent companion to this movie if you can find it. It also explains one major glitch in the film - how the Gunslinger is able to shoot the guests and the tech. In the book he removes the gun's sensor. Problem is this scene never made it to the final film.Fortunately the film goes at such a pace that you can't really think about such things when they are happening. Yul Brynner as the Gunslinger is so strong that you cannot really see anyone else in that role (as happened in the short lived 'blink and you miss it' series "Beyond Westworld") and he reprices this role in the 'sequel' -Futureworld- which explains in part why the robots went haywire in the first place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this idea was first done (as far as I know) in a Star Trek episode, the premise is good, and the execution is highly enjoyable.Westworld is a robotic theme park, where your fantasies become a reality, but something is awry.Fine performance by Yul Brynner, excellent direction, and some great Western stylized dialog make this highly enjoyable. I do hope they look to the Destry remake with Audie Murphy, when remaking this one in 2008 (2009 release).This is a must see for any western, science fiction, or action fan, but it is also a must see for those who are fans of classic cinema. This work demonstrates a greatness which belies its "B" quality, low budget, and otherwise under-rated status.All in all, this is some GREAT cinema, and as such, it rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>classic sci-fi; inventive, fun, and sometimes, scary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was original back then. It was like total recall without the virtual reality. Westworld starts out as a place that would be fun to visit, but near the end, it's like "You like this place, do ya? Well, you shouldn't because this might happen!", and by this, I mean being chased by the scariest mechanical monster this side of "the terminator". The film starts out a large group of people going to Delos, the most fantastic theme park in the world(In the future, unfortunately). They can chose between 3 worlds(only 3??!): Roman world, Medieval world, and West world. Personally, I'd like to see Pirate World, Egytion World, etc. But I managed.While most critics on here focus on the 2 guys played by Richard Benjamin and James Brolin, I also got a taste about the unnamed old couple who couldn't decide which world to go to. She wanted Roman world and he wanted Medieval World.Ultimely, They split. Y'know if this film would focus more on them, this whole thing would be a fable telling us to be faithful to our wives(You'll have to see this to know what I mean.), but it didn't(Phew!) Meanwhile, when they're in Westworld, We not only get to see what this park has to offer(like the gunslinging' Yul Brynner.), but we get to know Benjamin and Brolins characters: Ones been there before, the other's an everyman on his first trip. The whole thing goes alright; They have robot sex(what????!), kill a sheriff, and have a bar fight. Then the robots start malfunctioning and start killing everyone they see. The film's climax is a long, dialog-lacking chase with the evil android Brynner chasing Richard Benjamin all over the park, with no one to help him(I swear by the time this chase end, everyone within 100 miles are dead!) Although there are some problems with this outdated vision, and the chase goes on for too long, It's great insight into the dangers of the technological world when it's brought into something fun and exciting. It's good concept(even ripped off by Juraissci park), and a fun time, but when it ends, it shows us something that will haunt us when ever we'd go to a ghost town, scaring us to think the gunslinger would appear to hunt us down. Yikes! Overall, 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a GREAT film and I'd give it a rating of 9/10, ahead for it's time, and a film which I think influenced the likes of The Termintor. I have seen this film many times and never tire of it, It doesn't look as if it's ages that much, despite being made in '73.It uses a combination of sci-fi and western that blends bizarrly well. I think this is one of Yul Brynner's best films, especially in his later years.Brynner play's a lifelike robotic gunslinger in an all black outfit (the same one he used in the magnificent seven). Richard Benjamin and James Brolin also star as 2 wealthy men who pay to go to this theme park (which has 3 themed towns/areas).It is Man v Machine in a great battle of wits etc. As there just to much going wrong with the machines for the technitians to handle and of course all hell breaks loose with robots/androinds on the brink, not responding to commands etc.I don't wan't to ruin the film too much, if you may not have seen it, but for me it's well done for the time, stands the test of time, a decent story line to it all. and I think it will be a great film to watch for years to come without it dating badly even in another 15-20 years. It for me is still very much influential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember watching this film when it came out in theatres in the early 70's and also that I found it most original and enjoyable: a huge futuristic amusement park where visitors dreams come true as astronauts, medieval knights or cowboys in realistic sceneries with perfect made robots that look exactly like real people that put them in classical danger situations according to their different choices; the point is that for some reason something goes wrong and the robots go completely out of control and their menaces turn real.For its time, "Westworld" turns out as a truly imaginative and most entertaining film. I know machines went crazy in movies before ("Metropolis", "2001: A Space Odissey" and even some "Twilight Zone" episode with Wally Cox), but this one has androids that look exactly like us and you can't tell who is who.No doubt the more interesting facts occur in the Westworld where a sinister gunfighter (Yul Brynner, repeating his character as Chris in "The Magnificent Seven") is the main menace that can't be stopped in a sort of pre-"Terminator" sequence. Richard Benjamin and James Brolin play a couple of visitors involved in the machines uprising and Dick Van Patten is also there as a funny cowboy who is having the time of his life (at first at least).Don't think much about reality and just take this film as the sci-fi product it is and enjoy! I feel this is one of those movies we cinema fans don't usually admit we liked, but we watch them every time it comes around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The vacation of the future, today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Crichton's admirable precursor to his masterpiece "Jurassic Park" is almost as fresh and original today as when first released over thirty years ago. The standout performance is by Yul Brynner who somewhat parodies his role in the western classic "The Magnificent Seven." Brynner was such an accomplished actor that he is able to put just the right amount of tongue-in-cheek in his gunfighter character to make it all work. The viewer is able to accept Brynner as a robot without having to use much imagination. Even James Brolin is not as wooden as usual. Richard Benjamin, the poor man's Dustin Hoffman of the 70's, is cast by Crichton to match his bland personality with the rather bland lawyer figure he plays in the film. Crichton turns out to be almost as good a director as he is a sci-fi writer. Crichton's story gives a new twist to a plot that was beginning to become trite by 1973, robots getting out of control to take control. I recall a comic book story I read as a child in the 1950's about robots taking over the world and making slaves out of humans. By utilizing a futuristic amusement park via Disney as the setting, Crichton gives the old robot saga a whole new perspective. If you enjoy "Westworld," and most sci-fi fans will, be sure and see its sequel, "Futureworld." Futureworld continues Crichton's story, without Crichton, adding more mystery and suspense to it. Though slower moving than "Westworld," and with the likes of Peter Fonda and Blythe Danner in the lead roles, it still packs a wallop; plus there's some damned good acting by Stuart Margolin as handyman Harry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One look into the future where robots create life-like experiences.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is always interesting now to look back at older movies and see how they predicted the "future." "Westworld" was made over 30 years ago, and depicted a time when robots would be almost life like, and still there is no hint that this will ever happen. This movie depicts a society where smart, capable robots can help create a fantasy vacation experience for the wealthy. Richard Benjamin is Peter Martin, and he chooses a vacation to Westworld (one of several choices) where he can be an old west type of gunslinger. He can gun down the Robot Gunslinger (Yul Brynner) without worry, because there are teams of repair people behind the scenes (shades of Disney World) who fix up the damaged robots and send them out again. Also, the robots are programmed for safety, so they cannot hurt the vacationers.SPOILERS. After several repairs, Robot Gunslinger begins to take on a personality, he is tired of getting shot by Peter, and begins to hunt him down. The climax is in a building, we see through the eyes of the robot, he doesn't actually see as we do, but senses shapes by heat. When Peter gets near bright burning torches, the robot cannot see him. Peter finally prevails by having the robot set on fire.</fullReview>

The place is run by a behind-the-scenes crew of technicians who maintain the robot inhabitants that "live" in the Old West town.The film follows two main characters who are visitors to the park. What they experience is very realistic with bar-fights, shoot-outs, bank-robberies etc. All of this is part of the enjoyment and is the attraction for vacationers.The drama begins when a particularly violent robot begins to act on it's own accord.This film is well made. The script is quite good (for it's time), and even modern audiences will find something exciting or interesting about what plays out in the film.Yul Brynner plays an excellent and flawless role as one of the robot inhabitants of the simulated town. He brings a certain eeriness to the film that no other actor could bring, I believe.There is a good balance between the action/drama that takes place, and the film knows when to cut from the story and bring the physical events to a decent conclusion.</fullReview>

I liked the plot, - I mean, of course, I love the Terminator flicks, and I'd be willing to bet more and just single dimes that James Cameron was more than just a little inspired from Westworld when he wrote The Terminator 11 years later....there are quite a lot of similarities, one can almost say that in many ways it is the same film, only Terminator goes on in a major city in daily life, while Westworld goes on in a holiday resort, but other than that, quite a lot of similarities....watch the film, if you can find it - it's very much worth it, and you'll easily see what I mean..You could debate also that Westworld looks a lot like one of Michael Crichton's more recent successes, Jurassic Park, but here I don't quite agree. Sure, I see the resemblance, but then again I don't think it's THAT much..For the sheer entertainment, and the fact that this film is actually 31 years old: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Part of the continuing Michael Crichton 'science is fallible' continuum, 'Westworld' is the sort of intelligent film that couldn't be made today without elaborate special effects, lots of noise and a loud hip hopping metallic score. It is a straightforward film that slowly exerts a grip, not unlike 'The Andromeda Strain'. The texture is miles away from the lumbering 'Jurassic Park' and subsequent clones. The early scenes are fun with the characters Peter Martin and John Blane immersing themselves into the fantasy of the American West. Richard Benjamin as Peter Martin is very good, an ordinary guy initially sceptical, then plunging into the play with gusto, then frightened as the fantasy and fun turns to terror. He is completely believable. The later scenes are basically a chase but what makes it worst is that he is being chased by a robot played by Yul Brynner. Yes, it's heroic Chris from 'The Magnificent Seven' turned into a relentless inhuman killer! It's a great piece of casting. With atmospheric music to propel the story along this modest film is a real sci-fi jewel and deserves recognition as the fine forerunner of later but not better films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before STAR WARS firmly placed the realm of science fiction to infinity and beyond, 70's sci-fi carried on much as it had done in the 60's. Films like PLANET OF THE APES and SILENT RUNNING kept the genre close to Earth and WESTWORLD continued this tradition with a neat little idea exploiting some keen observations of entertainment in all forms.James Brolin and Richard Benjamin are two tourists who decide to take a trip to Delos, a futuristic amusement park consisting of three virtual reality scenarios, WESTWORLD, MEDIEVAL WORLD and ROMAN WORLD. Benjamin is making his first visit, whilst Brolin is the veteran of the fun. Inevitably the ride starts out fine, but then all of a sudden things begin to go awry in all three places, notably in the case of Yul Brynner in MAGNIFICENT SEVEN mode as he ruthlessly pursues Brolin and Benjamin in the film's electrifying climax.Faithful to it's source material, but classic entertainment in the true spirit of films like this, WESTWORLD remains a truly thrilling metaphor for any time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one cracking Sci Fi movie - OK by todays standards the FX look shoddy, but remember this film was made in 1973. Quick synopsis - a high tech holiday resort reflecting life in the Old West - all your needs catered for (by robots), until the robot staff turn into killers. Fantastic casting of Yul Brynner, who looks exactly like his character 'Chris' in the 'Magnificent Seven', is the lead villain, and acts like a sort of seventies terminator. The two leads (Brolin &amp; Benjamin) spend the rest of the film trying to escape this horror resort. Thoughtful, well executed, and especially well cast - this is one film that definitely needs remaking to bring it bang up to date with the latest FX, it would be a worthwhile moneyspinner if done by a good action director like James Cameron (in saying that I'd like to see George Romero have a crack at it) - I'd like to see Arnie or Dolph as the robot bad guys, and George Clooney &amp; Billy Crystal as the leads.

		<fullReview>The first of it's kind, absolutely amazing, even now over 25 years old, I seen this movie several years ago, and thought it was brilliantly done. Yul Brynner is the robotic gunslinger who has been enhanced and then he goes on the blink, hunting down Brolin as a guest, the chase lasts for some time, and ends up quite gripping, Yul Brynner plays the robotic gunslinger to a tee, and Brolin is the innocent guest. For me the best film of it's kind mixing sci-fi and western to bring an amazing film, which still to this day looks fresh, and inspirational film, I think.</fullReview>

In an amusement park in a near future, where people can buy different historical holidays, like the title, the action of this is in the westworld scenario. cyborg sheriff, robotic hores etc. all living things is actually a robot. But something goes wrong....terrible wrong...If you like demon seed and other sci-fi films from the golden seventies...I would recommend this.

		<shortDescription>West is Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Westworld is a terrific slice of pre-Star Wars science fiction served up by a pre-Jurassic Park Michael Crichton. The film is about a new state of the art amusement park where wealthy tourists can live out their fantasies in three historical environments: Westworld, Medievel World and Roman World. Many of the patrons take on roles within these realms, but most of the population is made up of sophisticated robots, made to look, sound and bleed just like human beings. Those familiar with Michael Crichton's stylings probably can guess where this movie goes. Suffice to say it is a bizarre and terrifying adventure. Westworld does a marvelous job of captivating the audience. The first half of the film simply serves to prove just how safe the guests are inside the faux realities. This contrasts with the behind-the-curtain scientists running the show and futiley trying to avoid catastrophe. Once the violence begins, though not gratuitous, it shocks without mercy. All the safety precations the viewer was fed were all lies. Westworld turns out to be a brutal and unrelenting assault against humanity. From beginning to end Westworld delivers what it promises. It is an intelligent, violent and altogether original Sci- Fi thriller. 8/10. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Crichton does it again (or rather, does it for the first time) with this brilliant thriller. You can see in this the origins of the other films he either directed, or that were based on his books (notably Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain), and yet it is their equal, if not their better. Certainly, Jurassic Park has better SFX, yet it doesn't have that overall suspense that you get during some of the later scenes of this movie, especially when you consider the marvellous acting of Yul Brinner.If you like The Magnificent Seven (Who doesn't?), If you like Jurassic Park (Who doesn't?), If you like The Andromeda Strain (Again, who doesn't?) then you will like Westworld...Add it to your collection. You will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Westworld is one of those films you see as an adult or as a child-and you just never forget it. A predecessor to Crichton's Jurassic park-this really is the master thriller about the original theme park gone wrong. Casting Yul in the role as the gunslinger was a masterstroke of casting-there is no mercy behind that stare! Next time its on TV-watch it again, and it you've never seen it before-I envy you-because you're in for a treat when you do. A must-see sci-fi film of the 70s-and if you like films like Stepford Wives-then this is for you- Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elements of "Westworld" are seen in many movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was recently lucky enough to see the 1973 Michael Crichton film "Westworld", and despite its numerous flaws, I found it to be very interesting. The main reason I watched it was because I wanted to see how similar it would be to "Jurassic Park." I wasn't disappointed. The most obvious similarity was, of course, the whole theme park gone mad thing, but there were more specific ones. While the scientists were discussing the recent increase in robot malfunctions, one of the scientists spoke with an optimistic, almost philosophical tone, similar to Jeff Goldblum's character in "Jurassic Park." They also shut off the power, and though I can't remember why at the moment, the power at Jurassic Park was also shut down. I'm sure there are other examples, but I'd like to mention a few of the movies "Westworld" reminded me of. The first one was the 1972 classic "Deliverance." The two films have the same basic premise; a sort of wimpy guy (Richard Benjamin in "Westworld", Jon Voight in "Deliverance") goes on a vacation with his overly macho, possibly homosexual friend (James Brolin and Burt Reynolds; you could probably switch the two characters and no one would notice) and barely makes it out alive. Another obvious parallel is with "The Terminator," with the almost indestructible glowing-eyed Yul Brynner robot and all. I'm not sure if it was the first movie to do this, but it showed the robot's point of view, and was done so almost exactly the way Arnold's was in "The Terminator", editing-wise. The "heat-vision" also looked a lot like the way the alien villain in "Predator" saw. During the chase scene, there was a cool homage to the Statue of Liberty scene in "Planet of the Apes", when it shows the Roman bust knocked over in a stream. The chase sequence was also visually reminiscent of "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge", a short French film I was forcibly subjected to in a film class. It also hinted at the theme of "Blade Runner." The robots (specifically Anne Randall's servant girl who refused to sleep with a customer, and of course, Brynner's gunslinger), similar to the replicants in Blade Runner, seem to grow tired of being enslaved to their human creators and decide to rebel. I kept waiting for ol' Yul to say, "I want more life, f@#$%r!" But, he never did, and the ending, like the rest of the movie, was kinda dumb. The part where the hero killed the Servant Girl by giving her a drink of water really made no sense, especially since before the hero killed Brynner's character for the first time, Brynner was drinking. To go out on a limb, there are also episodes of "The Simpsons" that seem to parody "Westworld", like when the Itchy and Scratchy robots almost kill them. Anyways, it was a pretty interesting movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Delos Company offers the vacation of the future in the parks Medieval world, Roman world and Western world for a large sum. You get to experience life in the themed period, doing whatever you wants, interacting with the robot inhabitants that populate your destination. Peter Martin and John Blane travel by hovercraft to Western world and soon Peter duels against a Gunslinger. When there are several problems though, the robots go out of control, jeopardising the guests......Crichton directed the film, and later remade it as a novel.....called Jurassic Park, being made twenty years later and becoming the biggest film in the world for a while.This is the more adult version though, with Brolin and Benjamin surrendering to Western world and all that it has to offer....even Yul Brynner.And here in lies the main draw. Walking straight from The Magnificent Seven set, he's hardly in it, but he steals the film from everyone, and he knows it from the minute he walks in the saloon.The action is solid, and the slow motion adds to the movie, but as soon as the robots take over, that's when the film takes its sinister turn, and you realise that James Cameron owes a lot to Crichton.The final act is brilliant, and makes up for any shortcomings the first two acts may have had.Yes it's dated, but its a solid movie.And Brolin looks scarily like Christian Bale, who more than likely will be offered the inevitable remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Westworld</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written and directed by Jurassic Park writer Michael Crichton, I had heard about this film and I recognised that it starred the actor from The King and I, so I was very keen to see what it would be like. Basically, in the near future, the Delos Company has three amusement parks for rich vacationers, Romanworld, Medievalworld and Westworld, all of which offer the people visiting the chance to live out their fantasies in the theme settings, using interactive robot inhabitants. So Romanworld is set in pre-Christian Rome, Westworld is set in the American Old West, and Medievalworld is set in medieval Europe, and all the realistic human looking androids dressed as Romans, cowboys or knights are programmed to play out any scene a vacationer wants, and they have heat sensors to stop them killing the guests. Vacationing in Westworld are previous visitor John Blane (James Brolin, Josh's father) and his first-time visiting friend Peter Martin (Richard Benjamin), who are spending $1,000 per day, but naturally they are enjoying each day being cowboys, having fights, saloon card games, making love to prostitutes and killing local Gunslinger (Yul Brynner). Slowly though the Delos Company technicians are noticing that the robots in the three theme parks, starting in Westworld, are developing problems, they are having systemic failures, including a rattle snake biting a guest, and the Black Knight killing a guest with his sword. They start to solve the problem by stopping other visitors entering any of the three attractions, and then they try to shut down the power throughout, but this only traps the technicians, and the androids have been left with stored power to go berserk towards remaining guests. Peter and John have woken up after a drinking night unaware of the danger they are in, so when the Gunslinger challenges John to a showdown he treats this as a regular battle that he will win, but the robot kills him, and Peter runs for his life with the robot pursuing him. Crossing the border of Westworld park Peter passes through the other two worlds, on his way finding many dead guests and damaged robots, and he manages to find his way into the technicians' area. In the end, after throwing acid in the face of the Gunslinger, setting fire to him, and attacking one last time the robot finally succumbs to damage and shuts down, Peter seems to be the only remaining survivor. Also starring Norman Bartold as Medieval Knight, Alan Oppenheimer as Chief Supervisor, Victoria Shaw as Medieval Queen, Dick Van Patten as Banker, Linda Gaye Scott as Arlette and Steve Franken as Technician. Brolin and Benjamin obviously do their parts as the innocent visitors to the attraction well, and Brynner does rather a good job, dressed like he did in The Magnificent Seven, as the sinister cowboy hunting the victims down, the idea of robots going wrong in a theme park is a clever concept, and with some terrific special effects it works well, this is a most watchable futuristic thriller. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to Delos, nothing can go wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently divorced lawyer (Benjamin) is treated by his buddy (Brolin) to a vacation at a futuristic fantasy park called Delos where the guests are promised to have every whim indulged by compliant robots who look, talk and behave like humans. A return visitor, Brolin enrols the pair in Westworld (Medieval and Roman worlds being the other choices) and while initially uncomfortable with the idea of stoking the loins with a brothel 'machine' ("now how can you say a thing like that about these ladies" crows Brolin as he leads his 'machine' to the star chamber for a grease and oil change), Benjamin soon learns to relax and enjoy the experiences: until gunslinger Yul Brynner takes a dislike. After a number of faults are detected, the machines malfunction, and the fantasy worlds become slaughterhouses, descending into chaos, while Brynner, equipped with state of the art senses, saddles up in relentless pursuit of the hapless Benjamin.Knockout movie with a superb cast, pulsating vibes and intelligent dialogue. Brynner steals the show as the menacing gunslinger, while Benjamin is effective as the timid débutante unwilling to accept his fate. Film buffs should rejoice - Victoria Shaw, Dick Van Patten, Steve Franken, Alan Oppenheimer, Jared Martin, Terry Wilson; the faces are endless. Buxom beauty Anne Randall has a great little part as a frigid servant girl with attitude, unwilling to accept a horny guest's advances in spite of her programming as a sex model.Director Crichton has timed the suspense to perfection and the tension is often palpable; the pace of the scene in which the black knight's (Mikler) tolerance malfunctions while duelling with guest Bartold is chilling. Doesn't possess all the bells and whistles of contemporary sci-fi and consequently, there'll be some audiences for whom this production is dated. If however you're of a vintage to appreciate the real stuff, then "Westworld" will more than likely impress with its colourful array of costumes, sets, humour, quirky cinematography effects and superb storytelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better "cult classic's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to find a good example of a early 1970's low budget sci-fi thriller and one that is entertaining or to say one of the better one's,Then i recommend this film "WestWorld" to you..Westworld is a movie set in a amusement park in the future (the time line not told)This amusement park is split into three zones..Medieval world,Roman world and West world. Inside this park which caters exclusively for adults the guest get the chance to feel the real life presence of the time through the use of androids disguised as humans in the surroundings of the set time or theme the guest have decided to stay at. The best part of this is the park user gets the chance to interact with the androids as if they were actually real. The guest can if they wish live out their fantasises of the west,Things like robbing the bank,shooting people,sleeping with a hoar. Or if the Medieval time is the guest preferred location he or she can live like a King quit literally. The one and most important feature of the park is the fact that the robots cannot harm a human in any such way.(act one) This is until one or two of the robots start malfunctioning and killing the guest in what the guest think is a show fight.Also the scientists and engineers employed at the resort to repair and improve the androids,And to maintain the wellbeing of the guests staying there, Seem to get suffocated to death by gas once the androids start malfunctioning. One robot inparticular gets the real life personality of a wild west gun fighter and starts to hunt and kill two guest who have shoot him a couple of times.First he shoots one of them in a stand off,And then continues to pursue the other main character around the park.(act two).So the first half of the film is a visual of people on holiday at the park living/staying in a western town of the 19th century or staying in a medieval castle. All the guest are shown having a great time mingling with other guest dressed in costume of that particular time period and the androids dressed and built like a human and a person of that time.The second half of the film is a cat and mouse chase between the gunslinger android and one of the last guest's alive.; Richard Benjaimin and Josh Brolin play the parts of Peter and John two guests staying at the park (from who's point of view the film is being told),And Yul Brynner fabulously cast as a gunslinger android. Josh,Richard and Yul play the parts well and all three along with the other actors make the role they are portraying believable. WestWorld is written and directed with great enthusiasm and with a good eye for periodic detail by Micheal Crichton who later in his career penned "JurassicPark".So i guess the director has a keen eye for fantasy theme park films. I found this film to be both entertaining and very imaginative.The story is original and simple to follow, The acting is good.The most notable one role is of that played by the late Yul Brynner playing a robot gunfighter,I bet Mr Brynner had fun with that role which i say was tailor made for him at that stage later in his career due to all the western films he had starred in in the 1950's and 60's</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fabulous early cyberpunk movie with sly underdog elements (mild spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 70s movie that inspired 'Terminator' is still brilliant. The Delos resort is a machine-run paradise for the rich and bored - At $1000 a day, you can shoot people in lawless WestWorld, joust in lovely, historically-authentic MedievalWorld, or just shag everything that moves in debauched RomanWorld.Along come our hero Peter and his friend John, your standard yuppy visitors to WestWorld. At first everything is apparently fine, (albeit gross - what kind of sleazebag would actually sleep with a robot?) but in various vignettes set in the technical support centre, robot maintenance workshops and the Delos corporate boardroom we can see a cascade of malfunctions, and that furthermore, "there's a clear analogy to an infectious disease process!" Delos execs sneer at this ("I find it difficult to believe in... a disease of machinery!") but the board decide to stop accepting new residents and wait for the resort to empty out. Sadly, the machines are by now starting to go quite insane and begin attacking guests. For real.Yul "he's dead now" Brynner is fantastic in this, probably the best robot villain ever made. Although completely amoral (and despite Wild West garb, weirdly reminiscent of Gary Numan's Machmen, probably an inspiration) he starts life as a real-life counterpart to all those video game bad guys that hadn't been invented yet, basically a bullet magnet with a few lousy lines and a gun that doesn't work when pointed at humans. Things change, however when the computer virus finally allows him to shoot back! Bwahahahaha! Now that's what I call an underdog movie! What follows is a fantastic battle royale involving members of the bourgeoisie and their flunkies being variously kebbabed, shot to bits and suffocated before our hero flees for his life through the ruins of the Delos resort complexes. Run, yuppie, run! There are also enough subtle bits which allude to the world of Westworld, such as the multilingual information sign including Cyrillic lettering, hinting at a post-cold war, post-globalisation world, or the callous behaviour of the repair tech who utterly refuses to help the main character, as well as the repeated allusions to sex with robots and the whole sadistic, control-freak premise of the Delos resort - when you think about it, people in the future are really rather unhealthy. This is well-done because it's so understated; part of the film's background psychology rather than a Big Social Statement getting in the way of all the mayhem and fun.This film still thrills, is the inspiration for much of what we might call cyber-culture, and hasn't dated too much - so you haven't seen Westworld, you should. Assuming you like that sort of thing, of course.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In our Image Let's Make Robots for our Slaves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The theme of "Westworld" is one that has formed part of science-fiction since at least the time of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein"- what would happen if mankind could create artificial life and if our creations then turned on us. Think, for example, of Isaac Asimov's "Robot" stories, with their Laws of Robotics designed to prevent such a thing form ever happening or, for that matter, of Hazel O'Connor's song "Eighth Day" (from which the title for this review is taken).The film is set at some indefinite time in the future, a time when robots have been perfected to the point where they are virtually indistinguishable from humans. It doesn't, however, look much like the future. The only other futuristic invention we see is a gigantic hovercraft, and we never see the outside of that. (The film was evidently made on a tight budget). From the inside it looks just like a late twentieth century airliner, even down to the stewardesses uniforms and the passengers' clothes, all of which scream "1970s!", although presumably Richard Benjamin did not realise at the time just how retro his moustache and polo-neck sweater would look thirty years on. (Another thing that dates the film is the assumption that hovercraft would be part of the future; from the viewpoint of 2006, as a recent article in the "Daily Express" pointed out, they seem very much an idea whose time has come and gone). The passengers are on their way to Delos, a hi-tech holiday park where guests can choose, for $1000 a day, one of three resorts, Roman World, Mediaeval World and Westworld, each of which recreates a specific historical period with the aid of robots. The main characters are two friends, Peter Martin and John Blane, who are spending their vacation in Westworld, a recreation of the American West of the 1880s. There they can live the life of a cowboy, complete with "Dodge City"-style bar fights, duels with robot gunfighters and even sex with female robots.A team of technicians oversee everything to repair any damage to the robots and to ensure safety. The robots are supposedly programmed (echoes of Asimov's First Law) not to injure any of the guests; the film explores what happens when the system breaks down and the robots start attacking human beings. John is shot and killed, and Peter is forced to flee for his life from the menacing gunfighter (played by Yul Brynner recreating his character from "The Magnificent Seven") who tracks him across the desert landscape. (Director Michael Crichton is able to generate a lot of tension in these scenes).The philosophical and ethical implications of artificial life were thoroughly explored in another robot film from ten years later, Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner". These issues are only touched on in "Westworld" which does not try and ask questions like "can an intelligent machine have a soul?" Unlike the replicants in "Blade Runner" which seem very human in their thoughts and emotions as well as in their physical appearance, the "Westworld" robots are quite alien. This is particularly true of Brynner's gunfighter, who speaks and moves in a slow, deliberate manner suggestive partly of a half-human machine and partly of a predatory animal tracking its prey. We never get the sense- which makes Brynner's character all the more frightening- that this is a creature motivated by any passions that we could understand.It is never explained exactly why the robots turn on the humans, but such an explanation is not needed. (Indeed, as we are dealing with a futuristic technology far more complex than anything known in the twentieth century, such an explanation would probably not make much sense even if it were given). If there is a philosophical message behind the film, it is perhaps the familiar Luddite one found in Shelley's novel and O'Connor's lyrics, namely that mankind's technological hubris, the lust of knowing what should not be known, will inevitably lead to nemesis. The film also has some satirical points to make. As another reviewer has pointed out, there are similarities between the Delos concept and present-day theme parks such as Disney World. There is also satire at the expense of the "heritage" industry and the way in which it panders to our sense of nostalgia. In Delos, the only use to which the technology of the future is put is to create a replica of an imagined past. "Westworld", however, is best approached not as a satire or as a philosophical "message"film but rather as an exciting thriller which ingeniously combines the science-fiction and Western genres. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A satisfying vacation lure!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a million dollar futuristic theme park resort, which you can either to choose to live your fantasy in the Wild West, Medieval times or the Roman Empire. Your dream comes to life! In this case we mostly follow two friends in Westworld, a lawyer and businessman play it out amongst gunmen and dance-hall girls, who are robots programmed to serve the guest's violent and lustful fantasies - until something goes wrong with their circuity and they malfunction. Now they are no longer under the control of the park and are turning on the humans. Our two visitors are also being prayed on by a berserk gunslinger robot (Yul Brynner is splendidly cast) who has their number on his sights.Michael Crichton who directed this feature and wrote the story has came up with a flawed, but mostly thrilling ride! No wonder where he got his inspiration to write the novel "Jurassic Park". Both are very similar in the idea and finish product, the only difference is one's about dinosaurs running amok in a amusement park, while this one it was the robots turn. It's just "Jurassic Park" got a more grander treatment compared to "Westworld", it would've been great to see what "Westworld" would've been like if it had a bigger budget to throw around. I wouldn't be surprise if a remake pops up. But anyhow, what we did get worked rightly so.Fresh and vastly entertaining for its time, even if the feel of it and effects seem quite dated now, but that hardly hampered my enjoyment. It's under produced and the continuity of the story and characters is untidy and vague, but hey, it makes up for it with the peculiar state, dry humour and air of excitement that streams through it. It may be low budget feature, but its creativity doesn't match that fate! The execution was hugely inventive, with plenty of memorable sequences and a lot of surprises that sneak up on you. Those memorable moments involved Yul Brynner's eerie character. You could say it was Yul's show, even if his screen time was short, but he definitely left an imprint. There's no denying that! Plus the superior script was impressive, with certain touches of satire and it didn't come across as forced. The special effects weren't mind blowing, but technically sound and the score, maybe sometimes tacky, but overall it captured each setting perfectly and knew how to keep your heart pounding during those taut moments. The sensational sets were well crafted and fitted in perfectly, as if you were right there with the guests in those periods. Performances were solid, Richard Benjamin and James Brolin were likable in their roles as the visitors of Westworld, who get more than they bargained for.Crichton engineered a larger than life flick here, where the first hour seems to have the guests meander about their chosen lifestyle, with its small added thrills and amusing jabs of irony. Sure, it was slow going, but also hypnotically good at the same time. When the pace entirely picks in the last twenty minutes, so does the intense nature of it, going hand-to-hand when the faults and cracks appear in the theme park. There's such an underlying sense of dread. While, the scene involving Brynner's character hunting his victim/s remarkably makes you real anxious and keeps you on the edge, as there's no help or solution to stop this happening. Although, when it came to the end it does come across a bit anticlimactic after its build up. I just wished we saw more of the devastation of the park and also the film's length was all too short. When it finishes you'll be wanting more... well for one I did! Limited to its budget, but Michael Crichton's work is ambitiously different, memorably realised and growing with excitement, despite some story continuity issues. This is more than a passable viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original "Terminator"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Cameron should owe royalties to Michael Crichton for stealing the "machines taking over" idea. Indeed, Yul Brynner has that menacing look that Arnie became famous for, except that this movie came out 10 years earlier. This movie, by modern standards, feels like a TV movie, but the cheezy 1970's hair and wardrobe adds to the camp value of this film. The warning of robots becoming autonomous and killing humans still needs to be heeded in these days of armed predator drones killing humans without anyone pushing a button.The setting of a Disney-like fantasyland is a great concept. We also see a Roman-world, and Medieval-world. The guests pay huge sums of money to kill and boink anyone and everyone they please. This is kind of fun to see, but becomes old quick. I especially get a kick out of the generic "guys in labcoats" surrounded with large computer banks. Then comes the "uh oh" as data shows the robots malfunctioning more often. There is a Jurassic Park moment (also written by Crichton) when the management decides whether to keep the park open, despite the risks. In the end, our happy park guests must run for their lives. Crichton never has been a good director, but his screenplay ideas are usually pretty good. His "Andromeda Strain" is still a gripping Sci-Fi classic. This film is still worth a look, although my childhood memories recall more screentime for Brynner stalking. Unfortunately, he makes very quick appearances.This film has camp qualities, and one can appreciate the attempt to warn mankind of giving too much trust to the machines. I give it a 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Westworld' begat a fun parody on "The Simpsons" and the inspiration for Michael Crichton's blockbusting novel (and, of course, the film) of 'Jurassic Park'. Writer/director Crichton might've also been inspired by Kubrick's '2001' from 5 years before by using the "technology will destroy mankind and sap his soul in the process" theme. 'Westworld' is a bit corny and not as thrilling from start to finish as it should be, but it works.Set in the near future, the flick sells the idea that for a big chunk of change, people can go on vacation to theme parks made specifically for adults who want to live out a fantasy. They can enter the 100% authentic "Roman World", "Medieval World" or "Westernworld" (not a typo, the voice-over DOES call it "Westernworld"). The opening scene depicts vacationers returning from their trip, satisfied and thrilled with the experience. So next to head to Delos' fantasyland are Richard Benjamin and James Brolin. They've chosen to enter the wild west, even if Benjamin is reluctant to get into the spirit of the silly venture.The movie takes forever to get going, but it's worth the wait to get to the final chase scene. Yul Brynner, playing a gunslinging robot with eerie precision, has been programmed to pick fights with Benjamin and Brolin. After two early gunfights end in favour of our heroes, Brynner is once again sent back into the park to hunt the men. Even though the controllers underground know that the various robots are starting to malfunction (a fake snake bites Brolin, for instance), the money men don't want to shut down the park for repairs. After a joust in Medieval World ends in death, Brynner has been sent back out with deadly intentions towards his targets. He was programmed not to actually kill anyone before. Now that's exactly what he wants to do.Subtext rules the day as the ideas of amusement parks being false and empty experiences, the motif of corporate enterprises that show disinterest in anything other than the bottom line, and the notion that technology will kill us intersect. Considering this is Crichton's cinematic debut, he made a solid sci-fi/action flick. As I said, he laid the groundwork for others to take the ideas found here and adapt them for their own films.'Westworld' dares to let the last 20 minutes or so play with next to no dialogue. This works perfectly well (as it would in 'Alien' 6 years later) because the movie is just hitting its stride in the final third. When Brynner goes into killer mode, the film feels like 'The Terminator'. To quote Michael Biehn: "He will absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead." I wonder if Jim Cameron saw this film when he was writing his 'Terminator 1 &amp; 2' scripts. He perfected what was tried here. Use the movie star to play the unstoppable villain, give him no dialogue, and let his actions grip the audience. 'Westworld' won't find its way into my DVD player as often as some of the other titles I've mentioned here, but it's worth recommending to the uninitiated.And to quote a friend of mine who often quotes 'Westworld', "Nothing can go wrong". Words like those in movie world guarantee that something smelly is about to hit a fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average science fiction...Yul steals the show. Grade: C</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yul Brynner still haunts my nightmares when he played a robot gunslinger in Michael Crichton's WESTWORLD (1973). It is regarded as one of Yul's best remembered films from the seventies. I don't know if it was his psychotic mannerisms, or his technical garb as a android (thanks to special effects man Charles Schulthies). When his robot gunslinger came up from behind Richard Benjamin's character for a final attempt to kill him, I did jump out of my seat. Yul stole this movie from the other actors (Benjamin and Brolin). Majel Barrett (widow of "Star Trek" creator Gene Roddenberry) has a cameo as an android hooker/madame. Crichton directs well with what material that he has. The atmosphere of the film is similar to a TWILIGHT ZONE episode - eerie. The good cinematography, in widescreen format, proves that it belongs on the big screen. The screenplay combines western, thriller, and science fiction into one film. However, if Yul's android can drink a shot of whiskey at the bar and not be affected, but a female robot takes a sip of water and she blows a gasket??? Was she programmed to have PMS??? The technicians try to escape, but are endangered by suffocation??? They shut everything down, but the robots still function??? Were they programmed to revolt??? Give me a break. The special effects are average. If you've seen an episode of THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN called "Day of the Robot", the technical effects to create a robot weren't all that impressive. The special effects in THE TERMINATOR films were more impressive. In WESTWORLD, they took circuit boards, gadgets, and wires and put them into the body of a mannequin. I wouldn't say that it was original, but okay for it's time period. When Brynner's character catches fire, I thought that it was a VERY impressive stunt! If they remake this movie, I'm sure the technical effects will be MUCH better. Pros: Yul Brynner, cinematography, direction, stuntsCons: Screenplay (average), average special effectsGRADE: C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever been on a bad trip? I mean, a bad vacation? You have? If so, you may have been vacationing at one of DELOS' three fantasylands: Roman World, Medieval World or Westworld. Where nothing can go wrong. Nothing! It says so in the advertising and hostesses escorting the visiting guests repeat the same mantra. And for $1,000. a day (in 1973 bucks), things had BETTER NOT go wrong!In the three above-mentioned "amusement parks," the only way to tell the robots from the real people is by a tell-tale chip on the palms of the hands of the former. And the only other difference is that all the actions of the robots are controlled by computer in DELOS Central. Otherwise, the robots are there to serve the visitors: to fulfill their every fantasy and to see that all their pleasures are ... uh ... pleasured.Enter our two heroes: Richard Benjamin and James Brolin. They've chosen Westworld for their kingdom of fantasy and pleasure, as has Dick Van Patten ("Eight is Enough"). At first, things go splendidly. They keep knocking off the town-too-tough-to-die's robot gunslinger, who looks suspiciously like Yul Brynner. Then, one of the DELOS technicians accidentally spills a glass of chocolate milk into a mainframe computer -- or something bad happens -- and things start to go wrong. Dick Van Patten quickly finds out that in Westworld, eight was much more than enough. And poor Jimmy Brolin. He gets blown clean out of Westworld, all the way into the arms of Barbra Streisand. Which leaves just Richard Benjamin. From that point on, it's between him and -- I could SWEAR that's Yul Brynner! -- and may the best man -- or robot -- win. At the denouement, it's easy to understand why Richard Benjamin made a major career switch from acting to mostly directing after completing "Westworld." Being in a movie like "Westworld" is too scary for ANY actor!Although it was early in his career at the time, "Westworld" is the type of story that screenwriter Michael Crichton ("The Andromeda Strain" and "Jurassic Park") has become known for. And, in this case, he also directed, taking a cue from his father Charles.I've seen "Westworld" many times and never tire of seeing it anew. I love to watch the visitors to the three fantasy worlds of DELOS. But ONLY to watch them! I don't want to actually go there. But if YOU decide that YOU want to go there, please be sure all of your insurance is paid up in full. They say... "nothing can go wrong" ... but ..........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vacation of shooting and sleeping with robots.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1973 flick concerns two guys who go to a futuristic theme park to play cowboys. The entire park is populated (with the exception of the paying guests) by robots that resemble humans, animals etc. The paying guest can live out their fantasies by having shootouts, jailbreaks, saloon fights etc. On the other side of the park two other worlds exist, Roman World and Medieval World. The two played by Richard Benjamin and James Brolin do the cowboy bit but when it comes to picking up a couple of saloon prostitutes and taking them to bed then it seems that the film gets a little goofy. The Richard Benjamin character turns to James Brolin after scoring with the robot and says, `John.....this place is fun!' It would have been more realistic had he said `My god John are we that hard up? We're doing it with robots for crying out loud'! It makes the viewer wonder what kind of weirdo's had chosen Roman World. The bulk of the film stays at the WestWorld location although one guest is shown from time to time at the Medieval camp severely ticking off the computerized nerve system of a knight who is anything but Hymie the good natured robot from the old Get Smart TV series. Yul Brynner is cast as a robot gunslinger that takes a dislike to Richard Benjamin and then becomes a terminator in Tony Lamas and a Stetson. The film is highly entertaining and Richard Benjamin seems perfect as the guy who needed some excitement in his life and gets it at WestWorld. The sequel was not up to par to this one. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crichton's first try at Jurassic Park?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this movie seems awfully similar to Jurassic Park, that is because both movies were created by the same man, Michael Crichton. Apparently, Crichton hit the spot early in his career with this Disneyworld-gone-bad movie.There are several things that Crichton does right with this movie. First, he makes the amusment park, Delos, a desirable place to visit. With three fantasy worlds of Medieval World, Roman World, and Western World, he offers different choices of battle,role-playing, sex, and fun to all visitors.Secondly, he makes the plot realistic. Although he feeds off it in his second amusement park movie, he shows the audience how easy it is to switch from pleasure to terror.And lastly, see if you can find any resemblance of Yul Brynner's gunslinging persona to Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator. I think that it is more than a coincidence. This all gives Crichton and "Westworld" the upper hand considering this movie predates Cameron's "Terminator" by 10 years.This movie is definitely fun and interesting to watch.Pepper Thompson</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Crichton really hates Amusement Parks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suspecting some kind of deep trauma, like his parents brought him to DisneyLand as a child and he wet himself when he found out Mickey was as big as a person and had that vacant look. That would have been my reaction, anyway.So, much like Jurassic Park, the plot here is that an amusement park goes horribly wrong, and the things meant to entertain the guests end up killing them. Again, this was really kind of in line with a lot of other 1970's Sci-Fi, when we were all terrified that machines would either replace us or just kill us. Or kill us and replace us. (which was the plot of the Stepford Wives or the sequel to this film, Futureworld.) In this case, rich people go to a robot amusement park and the robots go nuts and start killing people after a few malfunctions go unnoticed.The climatic scene is with Yul Brenner as the Robotic gunslinger chasing down Richard Benjamin for being a schlub and having a porn-star mustasche.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Crichton gets an early go at trying out the theme park gone murderous idea, later refined in Jurassic Park, as writer/director of Westworld. Richard Benjamin is a nerdy everyman, holidaying in the western town part of the Delos robot-populated theme park, when things go awry and the robots start attacking.Despite the movie looking its age these days, it still entertains, and there are two giant pluses.One, it looks forward by way of a massive amount of trailblazing - it is the direct source of many of the favourite science fiction movies of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.Two, it looks back, in that the Westworld sections trade on the history of the screen western and, especially, Brynner playing a recognisably robotised version of his established western character (Brynner's robot character here is also a clearly identifiable forerunner of Schwarzenegger's original Terminator).</fullReview>

If you made it home in one piece without losing your date somewhere in the deep recesses of the snackbar, you could avoid being visited later that night by Yul Brynner and even get to your seven o'clock class on time.To the detractors of "Westworld," I just have this to say: Picky, picky, picky.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice idea but a predictable story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Things go wrong in a futuristic amusement park where guests can shoot and kill the robot attractions. There's plenty of good ideas here but they aren't executed very well. Oddly, the Simpsons spoof episode of this movie "Itchy &amp; Scratchy Land" is a lot better. It's Michael Crichton (director?) and writer so I didn't expect very much. Even his best writing can be very weak. All of his novels are extremely similar and this screenplay isn't much different than 90% of his material.We're 3/4 into the movie by the time things break down and the chaos isn't very exciting, it involves one long chase scene. I would have liked to see more chaos involving more characters than just one. Also why is only one guest and one robot suddenly left at the end? I suppose Crichton thought this would make the story more tense but it makes it more boring. The chase drags on so long that I wouldn't have cared who won.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very interesting movie but difficult to like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recall seeing this movie when it was released and generally speaking not liking it. It probably doesn't help that the neither of the leads (Benjamin or Brolin) comes off as especially likable or memorable, but that's likely partly due to Crichton's inability to flesh out characters for the screen. I rented this film through Amazon.com a few days ago, and I understand why I didn't think too much of it. Some of the imagery in it is fantastic and way ahead of its time; the lengthy introduction of vacationers entering the resort is great. Also, it's not difficult to see where Cameron got the kernel of an idea for the Terminator movies. But it's difficult to like this film. Large chunks of the movie are vacuously directed and you start loosing attention quickly. I don't know enough history about Michael Crichton to know if he was an experienced director at the time he made this movie, and maybe it's partly a 70's thing, but there seems to be a whole lot of dead space in the movie. Yul Brynner is very good indeed, and Victoria Shaw looks very pretty as the Queen.Based on this film, he was clearly a great writer of interesting stories, but apparently less so the executor of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rather an enjoyable scientific fantasy. Richard Benjamin and James Brolin pay one thousand dollars a day to spend their vacation in a theme part constructed around ages past, populated by exquisitely designed robots who are programmed to please the guests. In Roman World, you can engage in Saturnalian bacchanals and sleep with all the beautiful robots you like. Gender is probably optional. In Medieval World, among the castles, you can turn into a trencherman, joust with villains, drink however much malmsey you feel your system can handle, and boff the queen afterward, if you're able.Benjamin and Brolin choose Westworld, like the others, populated by robots whose only goal is to satisfy the fantasies of the guests. You can get into an argument at a saloon with Yul Brynner. He wears the same black outfit he wore in "The Magnificent Seven." He's insulting and fast on the draw, but not as fast as Benjamin, who shoots him to pieces. The women of low repute are robots too and the two men spend the night with them. Any viewer might be curious enough to want to know more about that.All the robots that have been slaughtered during the day-time exercise of the guests' fantasies are collected quietly at night, taken back to Central Headquarters (or whatever it is) where the technicians repair them under the guidance of techie egg heads. The technicians spot a problem. There seems to be something akin to an infectious disease process spreading among the robots. Nothing to worry about but just today, a generously bosomed castle maid slapped a lavishly costumed guest for making advances. ("M'Lord forgets himself.") She's not supposed to do that. And a mechanical rattlesnake actually bites a guest.Next day the robots go completely berserk, killing guests wholesale. The scientists can do nothing. Early that morning, after a bar room brawl, a field day for the stunt men, Benjamin and Brolin stagger out into the empty street, hung over. Well, the street isn't quite empty. There is Yul Brynner, "fixed," leaning against a post and challenging them to draw. Brolin, fully bored, draws first and is killed. The rest of the movie has the steel-eyed Brynner deliberately stalking the terrified Benjamin. Brynner has enhanced perception and there's no way Benjamin can take him out.The first thing a viewer might notice is that Westworld isn't the real West. It's a boy's version of the Wild West, drawn not from the history books but from the comic books and inexpensive Western movies of the 1940s and 50s. John Wesley Hardin wouldn't know where to turn next in this environment, but Audie Murphy would. All the fictional conventions are adhered to, the ones before realistic and revisionist Westerns began to appear. Everything is stereotypical. There are good guys and bad guys. And you get to kill the bad guys and hump the pretty hookers who are, after all, only trying to earn a living.The second thing is that, at the end, a certain humanity is lent to some of the robots. A girl chained in a Midieval dungeon appeals to Benjamin for help. He releases her and forces her to drink some water -- at which point she shorts out and begins smoking, a robot.And Brynner, after having acid thrown in his face to damage his vision, stands in a room of Medieval World surrounded by flaming torches. He's awestruck by the infrared signatures. His expression changes from a mechanical smirk to one of almost human stupefaction. And still later, after a full and long body burn, he turns up out of nowhere, blackened and shriveled, his palms extended towards Benjamin, as if pleading for help, before he collapses and shorts out for good.The plot is full of holes which I won't go into. It's an enjoyable diversion dealing with the old problem of illusion and reality. If the robots didn't go ape, I don't know which world I'd rather live in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cult favourite sci-fi/action film that just about holds up today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning 'Westworld' is a futuristic amusement park unlike any other. For a hefty price, vacationers can revel in a simulated setting that matches which ever child like fantasy adventure they want to indulge in. Forthright, confident John (James Brolin) has convinced his friend, timid, humble Peter (Richard Benjamin) to come along with him on his chosen, wild west themed adventure. Peter eventually loosens up a bit and joins in the fun with his friend...until a malfunction causes the trip to turn nasty and Peter finds himself in a battle to the death with hay wired android Gunslinger (Yul Brynner.) The late Michael Crichton is already immortalised in Hollywood history as the scribe behind such big screen science fiction classics as Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain, some other, less desirable stuff too like Congo and Timeline, but still the main source of inspiration behind some of the most iconic films in the sci fi genre. In 1973, he ventured into the realm of directing, as well as writing the screenplay to Westworld, a film that still holds a cult status to this day, if not quite regarded as a classic. And this is a fitting enough legacy for it to leave, a film that could be counted as one of the originals in some respects, but nearly forty years after it's release doesn't quite deliver with the maximum impact it could have when it first came out.Performances wise, there is not an awful lot to critique on, centred as the plot is on just three main protagonists, each of whom are suitably convincing in their respective roles, Brolin eliciting an image of Christian Bale before his time in both looks and manner, but possibly the most impressive is the late Brynner as the mean, cold, emotionless killer cyborg, matching Schwarzenegger's Terminator for robotic malice.With his first sci-fi fantasy adventure that skipped the literary route, Chricton here achieved the sort of thing he was nonetheless known for, a far fetched, eccentric madness, with an air of avant garde in both it's concept and it's plot devices. It drags on rather, taking ages to establish the story and get the action running, and I can't say it quite left a 'classic' effect on me. But I could see how it might be regarded as an original, and they're always the hardest to beat. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...like many other titles I've written about, This movie (like many others) ranks as one of my all time favorites!! Released in 1973, Westworld is the story of two regular guys (Richard Benjamin &amp; James Brolin) taking a vacation at a vacation place run by the Delos Co., featuring different vacation "themes" such as Romanworld, Midevil world, and of course, Westworld which have or employ robots to satisfy every need. Anyways, without giving too much away, "Master Control" goes askew and, .....well, you take it from there. The ONE character who stands out in this movie is none other that the legendary Yul Bryner who plays the "Gunslinger" in the movie. Although Mr. Bryner is known for other rolls such as Rameses in The Ten Commandments &amp; the king in The King &amp; I, Yul is Outstanding as The Gunslinger! (Watch as he "cracks a Smile" after the gunfight with Brolin). TOO COOL &amp; COLD!! Also, this is the 1st. work of Michael Crighton. If the name sounds familiar, He was one of the creators of the now famous TV show "ER". Mr. Crighton has many other works to his name, but My Favorite is THIS, His First Works. . . 'nuff said!! Also, watch out for Dick Van Patten as the "sheriff" in a portion of Westworld. Not only did I find this movie Very Entertaining, it makes one think . . . could such a amusement park ever exist . . . ? I was lucky to get an Original VHS of this movie . . . unfortunately in "pan and scan". Wheather or not this title has been released on DVD I have yet to find out. In either case, Excellent Entertainment awaits you in "Westworld" !! Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brynner's dead-eyed Gunslinger elevates cheap paranoid sf thriller to a minor classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen "Westworld" probably 3 or 4 times since the first time I saw it on TV in the late 70s and it never fails to entertain. The plot ought to be known to just about everybody by now, it's been parodied and recycled so many times: a couple of vacationers (James Brolin and Richard Benjamin) take a trip to Delos, the resort of the future, where one can immerse oneself fully in the experience of another time and place: WesternWorld for the American old west of 1880, MedievalWorld gives you a European castle circa 1300, and RomanWorld the villas of the Caesars. Each world is populated by amazingly life-like robots and one can do just about anything with them that one can do with real-life humans, including get into gunfights as Peter (Benjamin) finds out very early on when challenged to draw at a bar by a mysterious Gunslinger (Yul Brynner). After winning the showdown by plugging the Gunslinger three times, John (Brolin) explains to Peter that the guns they carry have sensors that don't allow them to shoot real people, so everything is perfectly safe. Until, of course, the robots go haywire...This tense, economical thriller might be my favorite Michael Crichton work. Though he's nothing special as a director, using Cinemascope with few nods to its visual possibilities (this is his 2nd film), his screenplay cuts out all the fat in favor of building suspense and paranoia. The film alternates in its first hour or so between scenes of Peter and John and their western adventures (barfights, shootouts, hookers), the scientists in their hidden control rooms gradually becoming aware of more and more malfunctions, and occasional shots of MedievalWorld and a bumbling guest there who has been challenged to fight the Black Knight. When that swordfight goes terribly wrong, the scientists know they are too late, and as Peter finds his options rapidly dwindling, he is followed through the last third of movie by the implacable black-garbed Gunslinger who won't quit, won't give up, can't be killed.Somewhat famous now for the first-ever use of CGI in film (Brynner's robot vision) this is really more significant for its paranoia about scientists and technology, a constant theme in Crichton's work from near the beginning of his career. In "Westworld" the cynicism about corporate greed is there as well - interesting because Crichton would later side with business in his protestations against the global warming "scare" - and the combination of the scientist's arrogance and the Delos owners' desires to keep off bad publicity while trying to solve the problems without telling anyone is what ultimately leads to disaster. Even though at the end, Peter manages to stop The Gunslinger with a combination of acid and fire, he is left alone in an apparently dead park, and the close-up on his face at the end doesn't register relief but rather despair.I've never much liked 70s geeky icon Richard Benjamin, and he's rather annoying at the beginning here, constantly acting nervous and unable to enjoy himself, but he does develop into a fairly effective hero. The scientists are poorly developed and the whole behind-the-scenes section seems there mostly just to give us enough information so that we can play along....but Brynner's dead-eyed Gunslinger is unforgettable, and his remorseless hunt at the finish through western streets, Roman gardens, underground corridors and medieval castle is the main reason this film has a deserved reputation as one of the better SF films of its day. And there's no question that Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Terminator" character a decade later owes Brynner's killing machine a conceptual debt. Flawed and silly at times, and maybe a little too short and neat ultimately, this is nevertheless lots of fun and an interesting early example of its writer/director's career-long preoccupations</fullReview>

But it's definitely NOT one of Richard Benjamin's great performances (has he ever had one?) Being primarily a comic actor, he was TOTALLY miscast in this dramatic role.Even with the outdated special effects, Brynner is mesmerizing as a robot...WAAY beyond Arnold in the terminator movies. Kinda thought he'd have a bit more screen time, though. The rest of the acting is mundane by comparison.

		<shortDescription>Good, but WAY too long.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Westworld is a fairly decent western flick. Centered around a futuristic "adult" theme park, Westworld has an intriguing intro and the first ten minutes are pretty good, but from there it gets more than a little tedious until the bots start going haywire. While there's not very many surprises (I mean the first time you see Brynner, its more than a little obvious that he'll wind up as the main villain) and there isn't a heck of a lot of plot, these actually work to the film's advantage. Adding a lot of plot twists and confounding the story would have muddled with the suspense of the flick. And that's really what this movie is. Suspense. Sometimes this suspense may last a half hour longer than it should, but for those who are patient, the last 20 minutes won't disappoint (even though it does end a little abruptly). 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where nothing can possibly go wrong...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If people had a chance to experience different eras, they would probably take it. They would probably want to reconsider after watching "Westworld". It portrays an adult theme park set up to look like the Old West, accompanied by Medieval World and Roman World. Robots play the people in these theme parks. So, Peter Martin (Richard Benjamin) and John Blane (James Brolin) go to Western World and meet a robot gunslinger (Yul Brynner), killing him multiple times. But then, the robots start going crazy and the humans can't kill them anymore.With "Westworld", Michael Crichton reminds us what he reminded us with "Jurassic Park": we shouldn't let science make us too confident. Whether or not we heed that is our decision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vacation Shocker!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They said in the beginning of the advert in the film, "Nothing will go wrong" well we know that machines do go wrong, even this computer has it's off days! This film is absolutely brilliant from start to finish, it is written and directed by the same bloke who gave us Jurrasic Park and Congo! Micheal Chriton. Yul Brenner is a brilliant Gun Slinger. I found that girl nice on the film, that robot one, but she was only on short time love giving, I would of liked 2 hours with her not 10 minutes. that is the one in the cowboy sequence. I also would not of liked that mead evil girl slapping me, like she slapped that king. It was nice to know that the machines could be repaired at the end of the day. I would not want to go on that holiday, as I might of got myself shot! If I was at west world, I would of nicked all the booze off the bars and robbed all the banks! and become sheriff at the same time, just for the fun of it mind. I now have this film on a video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Michael Crichton We Never Knew: A Good Film Nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a great film, don't get me wrong, though it could have been better. Stars James Brolin, Richard Benjanmin and Yul Brynner. The premise: A cyber world built for adult entertainment- the virtual recreation of ancient worlds (Medieval/Renaissance Europe..Pompei in the days of the Roman Empire and The Old West of the 19th century). Human-like robots are used up, killed off and repaired, and some of them function only as vessels in the entertainment of the adult guests (such as sexbots and fake villains/opponents. But, of course, something goes horribly wrong and the robots start to act strangely, refusing to follow their programs and begin to run amok, especially the "brain" central computer and the vicious predator hot in the pursuit of our hero the Gunslinger, played by Yul Brynner. I suppose for someone who grew up in the computer graphic effects in cinema of the 90's and recent years, this type of film pales in comparison and are even a bit dull. But not this one. It managed to hold my interest, and as always with older films I see them for the value it must have had at the time of its release.First off, science fiction in the cinema was barely budding and becoming mainstream. The success of sci-fi was launched when Star Trek was broadcast in the late 60's. Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey was the first real sci fi movie to "break in" to mainstream cinema. Michael Crichton directed this at a time when he was still an obscure director. I found it surprising that he did direct this for it is very amateur when compared to his masterpiece Jurassic Park in 1993 and the subsequent sequels. James Brolin is doing a terrific job. He looks just like a character out of a paperback Western and acts like one too. Opposite Richard Benjamin who plays his friend Peter Martin, they both strike me as figures in a Western film that if I didn't know about the premise to this film first, I'd easily mistake this for an early 70's Western flick. They are playboys, wild and lawless. They represent, even if innocently, the wildness of human nature. That rowdy, ridiculously violent saloon brawl is telling us the viewers that humans can be as bad as vicious robots. At times in the movie, you are confused as to who is a robot and who is human, because the behavior is so much alike, even in its negative, violent and destructive qualities. Yul Brynner as the Gunslinger, an ancestor to the later Predator, is quite thrilling to watch. I was so surprised at the versatility of the actors. James Brolin and Yul Brynner, both serious dramatic actors in a sci fi movie ?? And Brynner, best known as Ramses in Ten Commandments and the King in the musical "The King and I" playing serious, dramatic kings, seems to be taking on a role that is beneath him simply to cater to the 70's masses who by this time were not interested in serious films. This was the first time "pop culture" really began. The ending is very satisfying. After everything goes wrong, and everyone dies, our hero realizes it was such a mistake to go into this vacation. It turned out to be a nightmare. Look for the 1980 sequel Beyond Westworld.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had a very strong story line. but lacked detailed action. With todays special effects they would be able to create a more intense effect. The producers are hedging all around it with Terminator and I Robot but are overlooking the realism aspect of the seventies. When West World was made. two of the goofs in theory or a question rather? would be in the bar fight guests got hurt . And although the guns were heat sensitive what was going to stop ricocheting bullets from hitting a guest. I remember seeing this in the Movies and being disappointed due to the quick scanning over destruction and chaos. One of the best scenes ,subtle but powerful was when James Brolin realized something was wrong and the reality of being shot . In this modern day they could probably do a really good remake. I hope the producers realize this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Terminator's predecessor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The combination between western and sci-fi can be called unique and it works surprising well.It is too bad that "Westworld" looks a bit too much outdated today to be considered a great movie. Still some of the special effects look acceptable even though they are typical seventies (especially the computers, lot's of flashing lights, big silly buttons, etcetera).The story is very original although it takes some time before it gets really started, only halve way through the movie the movie gets really interesting and exciting and some of the story lines are only distracting and needless.But as I said the second halve is really exciting especially because of Yul Brynner who was really convincing and scary as a robot. He really reminded me of an early Terminator and wouldn't it have been great to have seen Yul Brynner as the Terminator or one of the Terminator villains like the T-1000. The ending however was a bit disappointing like often is the case in "old" movies.I really love the way how they portrayed and made the wild West look, it really reminds you of an old classic western, complete with some nice moody music.But what was with James Brolin? He acted so weird like he was drunk all the time and couldn't care what was going on halve of the time. No I didn't liked him and it made the friendship between him and Richard Benjamin's character seem very unlikely. But oh well...Solid sci-fi movie that was ahead of it's time.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

It is at Westworld where two businessmen on vacation live out their "John Wayne" fantasy of being cowboys in the old west. And all is well until the robots suddenly malfunction and take on a life of their own. Then it's man vs. machine as the second half becomes an intense thriller.

		<fullReview>WestworldWhen constructing an Old West inspired amusement park, it is important to be authentic. So, the whores should have syphilis. Unfortunately, the entertainment engineers in this thriller blew their budget on robots.Looking for some fun, Richard (Peter Martin) and John (James Brolin) decide to vacation at Delos: a high-tech, multi-themed, adult resort, where visitors can choose their own adventure.Opting for the Old West treatment, the city slickers live out their boyhood fantasies amongst a cast of western-garbed automatons.However, unbeknownst to them, the robots over in MedievalWorld and RomanWorld have turned murderous.When the short circuit finally hits Westworld, Richard and John find themselves at the mercy of a merciless mechanical gunfighter (Yul Brynner).By juxtaposing our machine-filled future with our barbaric and hedonist past, writer-director Michael Crichton forges an intense, thought-provoking parable.Fortunately, for the patrons of DepressionWorld, when their robots became self-aware...they killed themselves.

		<shortDescription>Great sci-fi concept for the '70s plus Yul Brynner save mediocre "Westworld"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Welcome to Delos, an immersive Disney World for adults featuring three real-life role play worlds: Medieval, Roman and West World. Outfitted with robots, these era-inspired theme parks are there to serve your every desire. You can shoot people, you can have sex with them and you can take their world as seriously as you like for $1000 a day. They're a set of amusement parks and for all intents and purposes, amusement sums up the purpose of the film as well.Oh, the 1970s. There comes a point where every pre-"Star Wars" film can no longer lean on the technological limitations of the era. That's because things like plot and suspense transcend time. Yes, "Westworld" has a plot, but it's extremely one-dimensional. Ironically, the movie focuses on robots, though its human characters come off just as hollow.Richard Benjamin and James Brolin play Peter and John, two pals whom we know little about that venture out to Westworld for a good time. John's been there before, but it's new to Peter, who has a bit of an adjustment period to the whole shooting and committing crime and prostitution thing. On several occasions the two are confronted by a gunslinger robot played expertly by the infamous Yul Brynner. More on him later.It's no wonder Michael Crichton just stuck to writing his books after this movie. He leans on slow motion for action sequences and does odd jump cuts during the suspense climaxes. He also manages to painfully drag out a movie with a runtime of under an hour and half. For all there was in "Westworld" of substance, the film could have been less than an hour. So many shots say absolutely nothing to the viewer who's fully aware things are going to go wrong at some point or another with these robots. Eight different scenes slowly escalate the fact that the robots are exhibiting strange behavior when half that number with a bit more punch a piece would help keep the plot unpredictable and interesting."Westworld" does ride its concept well and manages to find good grace through Brenner's cold, robotic and downright creepy performance as the gunslinger. The character was undoubtedly a precursor and possibly an inspiration for the Terminator, though in comparison he's much less formidable than Arnold. All that considered, "Westworld" would be well-suited for a 20th Century makeover and rarely does a film strike me as such.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brynner is intentionally robotic...what's Brolin's excuse???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I say that YUL BRYNNER makes a good robot, it's a compliment. Indeed, it's his performance that still makes this early James Chrichton tale worth watching. There's something incredibly "right" about the way he acts the robot and it's not just the trick effect of the eyes. It's his whole body language that is molded to the shape of a robot intent on making the kill.Unfortunately, even more robotic is the performance of JAMES BROLIN--and to a lesser extent, RICHARD BENJAMIN.Brolin seems adrift and completely indifferent to his role, as lifeless as one of the robots. Frankly, he gives the impression he'd rather be elsewhere. And there are plenty of other flaws in the script that telegraphs the fact that the robots are about to go amok not long after the opening scene.Richard Benjamin at least tries hard to make us like his character. In the early scenes he's a naive kid who wants to shoot a real gun in WESTWORLD, whereas Brolin is supposed to be the more worldly guest who's been there before. But at a mid-point in the film, when Benjamin's darker side takes over, he gives a much more effective performance.It's also at mid-point that the film gains in suspense and becomes a taut thriller until the conclusion. Unfortunately, the first half of the film remains a flabby piece of satire.Nevertheless, you have to give credit to Chrichton for an original concept that does manage to deliver some final moments of gripping suspense, thanks largely to the sinister gunslinger of Yul Brynner.Yul's stuntman, who catches fire, shows an awful lot of endurance. I hope he was well compensated for the job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great 70's sci-fi, let's see it updated! (Some minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my original review of Westworld from January 2002, with a Post Script. I loved this movie in the 70's and 80's. But it sure could use an updating.REVIEW ON IMDb Back in 1973, this film was awesome. I recently viewed a DVD widescreen version and enjoyed it once again. However, it has begun to show its age. The dated computer sets are at the top of the list, and the foam tables that crunch in on themselves but never break is very clear. Plus, questions start to arise such as; Why don't the guests get more than one set of clothes? Don't you think $1000 a day seems pretty cheap for a resort like this, even in 1973? Where are all the other Delos employees when the robots go crazy? They can't ALL be in that tiny control room, can they? Why would they all suffocate in the control room? Doesn't it have an air vent????????? Couldn't they break the glass on the door? Wouldn't the room be designed to keep intruders out, rather then trapping employees in with no backup for escape? When Richard Benjamin looks into the control room and sees that all the techs are dead, wouldn't they all be piled up by the door as they tried to escape, rather then sitting at their workstations? Also, I can buy (just barely) into the fact that the guns in Westworld won't fire at anything with body heat, so that way a guest cannot kill another guest on accident. However, where is the safeguard in RomanWorld? If two guests each had swords, couldn't they kill each other? How would they know if they were fighting another guest or a robot? Despite these obvious flaws and the fact that the film is now totally dated, I am able to suspend my disbelief enough to enjoy this film. It is still fun and is a GREAT idea for a movie. I would like to see it remade today with a well thought out script and much better special effects. Too bad we couldn't clone Yul Brynner as he was tops!END OF ORIGINAL REVIEW P.S. Since originally posting this review back in January 2002, there is now actually talk of a remake, tentatively scheduled for 2007.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just watched this movie, and I felt it was a bit boring.First of all I don't think the story is possible. I could only see three humans in the "Westworld", how should these three guys finance such a big project. The robots must have been very expensive, and also all the people who are hired to arrange the story in Westworld, it is completely unrealistic. I'm sure that Westworld would suffer from financial troubles.I'm also surprised that the Robot Gunslinger could hear Peter Martin hundreds of meters away in the desert, but it couldn't hear him only a few meters away inside the basement. Details like these are very important.If the movie paid more attention to details, then it had the chance of being an average movie, but instead it was below average. The movie however had some nice ideas which have been seen later in movies like Terminator, RoboCop and Predator.The movie only deserves 5/10, but a remake with more attention to the details could improve the story/plot a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stupid, stupid, BAD movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very stupid sci-fi film about a future amusement park where you can live out your fantasies in a simulation, either in a Medieval world, a Roman world, or Westworld. The two main characters of the film choose Westworld, although we check in from time to time on the other two parts of the park. In these simulations, there are tons of robots with whom you can interact. They look exactly like people, and you can pick fights with them, screw them, or kill them. Within the first five minutes of the heroes' vacation, they blow away a robot played by Yul Brynner. The next day, he comes back and they shoot him again. The next day, well, the robots kind of defy their masters and refuse to obey. The story makes little sense. Plotholes a'plenty, let me assure you. The idea itself is pretty stupid. I find it hard to believe that anyone would want to pay $1000 a day to be at this resort. Sure, you might point at the rampant sex, but let me point this out: the guns in Westworld don't fire at human beings because they are warm-blooded. Yet they fire at robots, presumably because they are not warm. That means all the tail you get is nothing but cold fish! I realize this film was conceived and made in a hurry, but it's hard not to scoff the results. The only pleasure is watching Yul Brynner die multiple times. Crichton would have much better luck with Jurassic Park twenty years later. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny--if sick--one-joke idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite a cramped budget, "Westworld" looks pretty good and is well-cast, with Yul Brynner in particular giving a fabulous performance, a variation on his role in 1960's "The Magnificent Seven", a good in-joke. The plot, about a fantasy vacation resort for grown-ups that goes haywire, is just a set-up for the final two-thirds of the picture, a showdown. There's never much going on behind-the-scenes, only some fleeting details, and then writer-director Michael Crichton gets down to the real business on his agenda: staging lots of deaths (stabbings, shootings, etc.). This would all be much more amusing (in a twisted sense) if Crichton had a sense of playfulness, but some of the killings, particularly the stabbing in the King Arthur segment, are off-putting, grisly and nasty. It's hard to tell if Crichton is in on his own black joke, that if he understands how horrible-funny this all is, why are the killings so realistic and ugly? I liked "Westworld", I think it has stood the test of time, but it toys with the audience for so long and yet seldom gives us much relief. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was too young at age 7 to see this when it came out but for years caught it on TV and as a youth it was a favorite mainly because I didn't know any better. The story by Michael Crichton is still good although his direction is slow paced to a point where you are begging for something to happen. The whole movie has the feeling of a Love Boat episode and the actors are very blasé with more attention paid to dazzling you with the wow factor of robot slaves. The only saving grace is the excellent Yul Brenner who's gunslinger is a film icon, but even he is limited by the story. Yul barely even says a word but that's probably what makes him so creepy. This is supposedly being remade and I hope they do a good job with it, almost anything will be more entertaining. The biggest issue with this film is that it is so dated by it's technology which they seem to like showcasing here, the last 1/4 is the most entertaining but even that is taken down by the over long chase and gunfights. Still an interesting attempt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Westworld is set in a futuristic world where a company called Delos offers a unique holiday experience to it's customers, three recreated worlds including Westworld, Romanworld &amp; Medievalworld which are populated by robots programmed to interact with guest's fantasies &amp; provide an authentic feel. Peter Martin (Richard Benjamin) &amp; John Blane (James Brolin) are paying $1000 a day to stay in Westworld &amp; experience the American Wild West of the 1880's complete with gunslingers, whores &amp; bar-fights. However behind the scenes all is not well at the resort, the robots are starting to develop an alarming numbers of malfunctions &amp; faults &amp; start to act on their own unable to be controlled. Then suddenly all the robots go crazy &amp; start attacking the human guest's killing them one-by-one, John is gunned down by a robotic gunslinger (Yul Brynner) &amp; it then sets it's sights on Peter &amp; purses him relentlessly trying to kill him...Written &amp; directed by Michael Crichton this is a terrific Sci-Fi themed futuristic thriller that I enjoyed a lot. I thought the plot for Westworld was rather clever &amp; quite ingenious, at the time it was made during the early 70's there hadn't been another film like it &amp; I love the ideas here. From the hi-tech theme park that uses robots (not too far from what currently exists) to the idea that you can take a holiday in a specific period of history that would just be so God damned cool &amp; the old American Wild West would probably be high on most people's list. At less than 90 minutes in length the film moves along like a rocket, there's just enough exposition to get to know the character's &amp; flesh them out but not enough to bog it down, the film has plenty of incident &amp; has a nice tense, taught plot &amp; pacing. I suppose the one main plot-hole that is never explained is how the robots get the six shooter guns to fire at people when it's clearly stated at the start the weapons are rigged not to but that's a moot point. There's the whole moral warning against technology &amp; putting too much trust &amp; power in machines without enough safeguards which is as relevant now as ever I suppose so in that respect Westworld hasn't dated too badly at all.The film looks a dated at times, some of the computers with banks of flashing lights look very 70's as do some of the clothes &amp; hairstyles. The sequences where the robots are repaired actually seems to take place in some robot hospital with human doctors in surgical gear operating on them like real people on beds rather than in a workshop, it's quite a striking image actually &amp; these scenes are quite unnerving too. Yul Brynner was cast as the bad &amp; turns a pretty cold &amp; intense performance wearing the same outfit his character wore in The Magnificent Seven (1960). According to the IMDb Westworld was the first ever film to use CGI, for the scenes of the robotic Yul Brynner's point of view which apparently took eight hours per ten seconds of footage!Shot on a lowly $1,250,000 budget Westworld was a big success when released &amp; it still looks very good even now with high production values &amp; a good cast. Apparently to keep the budget down the Wild West scenes were filmed on the studio back-lot on sets already there. The acting is good from all involved.Westworld is a great futuristic thriller that I enjoyed a lot &amp; would recommend it, it hasn't dated badly &amp; the story is still very good. Followed by the sequel Futureworld (1976) for which Yul Brynner returned &amp; subsequently became his last film while a short-lived TV series Beyond Westworld (1980) ran for five or six episodes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2 guys visit an amusement park full of life like robots. The park breaks down and the robots run amok, slaughtering the human visitors in their wake. The film is a project of Michael Crichton who was later to write the book and the screenplay for Jurassic Park. Though I can't remember much of that film, it surely wasn't as flawed as Westworld. The bumbling characters, fossilized acting, unforgivable screenplay and clumsy special effects do occasionally provide some unintended comedy but not nearly enough to entertain all the way through. The idea behind the story is lame and cliché, even back in 1973. 2001, A Space Odyssey was completed 5 years earlier and has the same basic premise of a machine turning evil after a malfunction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this one a long time back at least a couple of times, I liked it back then but rewatching last night all I could remember was the general course of events and one fantastic image in the climax. It follows two rich business types who go to the futuristic amusement resort of Delos, split into Mediaeval World, Roman World and Westworld, where those eras are perfectly recreated with the aid of a multitude of robots for the customers to play out their desires. Our heroes go to Westworld and the film follows them indulging themselves, interspersed with the scientists in charge of the place discovering that things are going awry... Of course, things eventually go completely tits up and this makes for great times with a menacingly impassive Yul Brynner as a virtually unstoppable gunslinger. The film has a great climax,and it is on this that its power as a sci fi thriller rests, since it is a film of serious plot holes. Though there is some explanation of how guests are safe from harm despite the environments seeming dangerous it is pretty clear that there are any number of ways in which guests could be hurt by accident or by each other. Why this is not so is never explained and following on from this point there is no consideration of the vast potential for human animosity arising from an environment in which all the guests are out for their own pleasure. Every one just seems to do their thing though, and the psychological side of things is largely untouched. These issues stop the film from ringing true for around two thirds of its run time, which is a pity since its pretty good fun and certainly influential. Writer/director Michael Crichton moved on to Jurassic Park of course and I can't help thinking that a certain villainous robot favourite of the 80's might have his ancestor here?The whole genre of killer robot films owes something to this movie, and all the rest of the crop of amusement park/games gone wrong films. Perhaps I would have liked Westworld more if I were older or had seen it more times growing up but as it stands on this score I admire rather than truly appreciate it. I do however appreciate the moral philosophical dimension of Westworld, which contains some fascinating, if unstudied questions. Essentially, can any of what goes on in the film be justified on a moral plane? Is the creation of exact replicas of some of history's less salubrious portions solely for the purpose of entertainment anything more than exploitation, and if so can there be any good in it. Is it right to cater to mans baser instincts, even if it is in a supposedly harmless fashion? Both these questions apply to a wide spread of cinema, but also presciently, to computer games. And in such a realistic setting, could it be that the visitors themselves do moral ill by murder or infidelity? Although the film is hardly "deep" in its approach, its interesting stuff to chew over and gives the film rather an effective kick. Technically the film is sound, Crichton keeps things bustling along and shows a keen grasp of suspense in the final block, he knows when to throw in a dash of slow motion, a splash of humour, there's a nice contrast between western themes and technology as well as between the bustling humanity of the various worlds and the antiseptic scientists laboratories. The main characters are played by hardy reliables Richard Benjamin and James Brolin and both are solid without sparkling. Yul Bryner is undoubtedly the highlight though. Altogether I had a fine time rewatching this, but somehow it just falls short of being a really great film. Still a 7/10 or so though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Crichton's evident distrust of technology gets its first theme-park outing in 'Westworld'.'Westworld' is only one third or a theme experience. And even as we see the guests checking-in, we also see behind-the-scenes technology bods becoming increasingly concerned by an almost viral degeneration of control. Although shrieking 1970's in every take, this work is memorable for all of the movie links that it generates. We find Yul Bryner, the star, dressed as his 'Chris' persona from 'The Magnificent Seven'; then the thoughtful goodie, but here a very homicidal baddie. Also, the concept of a star playing an unstoppable assassin was reprised by big Arnie in 'The Terminator' a decade or so later. Plus, of course, there is Crichton's own subsequent 'Jurassic Park', which had a more juvenile theme. Then, the technology that sets the robots loose on the guests also seals-up and kills all the staff - something we observe in 'Resident Evil'. Whilst the final cut, with a sole survivor sitting on the stairs alone with his thoughts, also reminds me of the ending in Speiberg's 'Duel'.The problem with a lot of sci-fi movies is technological congruity. If robots can be so life-like, so subtle and so clever; why aren't they anywhere else? Especially in cheaper, more utilitarian form. And why don't humans have the same technology in their pockets - as they do today?You have to suspend belief, of course. Plot-holes and goofs abound. But if you do, then the slow-slow build-up is worth enduring for the shock finale. I know that getting kids into cinema probably trebles the box-office take, but I think a less sanitised 'Jurassic Park' would also have been much more intelligent - as 'Westworld' was in its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plodding but somewhat entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two friends take a vacation to a simulated western theme park full of robotic people. Just when it is looking to be a fun experience, they are suddenly the target of a malfunctioning robotic gunslinger played by Yul Brynner who wants revenge for being shot down, twice. Westworld shares a similar problem with 'The Andromeda Strain' (one of Michael Crichton's previous stories). It ends up being rather plodding, and the story remains stiff with little sense of adventure until the ending. Instead of having a quick introduction to a longer engaging story, Westworld is more of a slow introduction to a short engaging climax. There are a few two many plot holes, and practically no ending. On the other hand, Westworld is more entertaining than Andromeda Strain, and far more accomplished in visual effects. Westworld is actually the first full length feature to use computer graphics. Yul Brynner's P.O.V. shots are generated with 2-D raster graphics (pixel animation). The graphics are by far the most competent factor in this otherwise weak film. Westworld is stiff, and slow, but it might be enjoyable for movie goers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boy have we got a vacation for you! Westworld could be summed up as a very, very, very, VERY BAD movie if it weren't for our Hollywood King, Yul Bryner. Scenes previous to the climax, when the robots went out of control, were very unsatisfying. Though the effects were great for that time, even considerably decent looking back from the 21st century, the body of the movie seemed to be two grown men acting like kids in a toy store. When things went haywire, Yul Bryner became quite the bone-chilling character. I admit, I was at the edge of my seat during the pursuit, and very pleased (and relieved) when Richard Benjamin's character, which to me had the appearance of an attention-deficient 10-year-old with a mustache, showed that he indeed owned intellect. Overall, I gave this movie a 3 out of 10, salvaged by the effects and Yul Bryner's intimidating performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film based on stupid idea begins badly, then falls flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jurassic Park had dinosaurs. Would you pay to see a dinosaur? -Yes, so would I. Westworld has robots which look exactly like humans pretending to be robots. Would you pay to see one of these robots? -No, neither would I.The whole idea is so fundamentally stupid I am left in awe. If you want to create a phoney American West (or Merrie Old England or whatever), why not just hire actors? If you wanted to visit a phoney American West (or whatever), why not go to a place where at least the people are real? The robots are less convincing and harder to work with than humans would have been; and they offer neither privacy to the client nor monetary savings to the entrepreneur, since there appears to be an army of human operators watching everything from behind the scenes. A whole squadron of technicians is required to get a mechanical prostitute to say, "Yes, squire." This is just ridiculous. Pay a human prostitute her flat fee and she'll most likely throw in a "Yes, squire" for free.Not just the theme park but the whole MOVIE could have been made without robots. In the end the robots rebel (sigh). But humans are capable of rebelling, too. There is, of course, a particular flavour to a robot revolt, but this flavour is absent from the film. The first few incidents that indicate that something is about to go horribly wrong aren't creepy at all - at that stage the audience is still stuck behind the first hurdle of, "What is the POINT of this theme park, anyway?"When things DO go horribly wrong it's curiously difficult to care. Clearly they were trying for the feel later captured by "The Terminator" - just as clearly, they failed. It could be because we have been given no reason to be even mildly interested in the main protagonist. We tend to forget about him entirely when he's not directly before our eyes. I forgot about him myself until just now. Who is he, again?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A robot malfunction creates havoc and terror for unsuspecting vacationers at a futuristic, adult-themed amusement park.Michael Crichton does not only write scientific thrillers, or create emergency room dramas, he also finds time to direct on occasion. Here he has given us what could easily be called the precursor to "Jurassic Park" -- a story about a theme park where the attractions run amok and try to kill the tourists.There is more than a small layer of "cheese" going in to this film, but based on the opening scene, this was clearly intentional. While the potential for a terrifying story exists, it very rarely gets heavy. At one point, a man has been shot and makes a bit of a joke about his condition.James Brolin is here, looking like Christian Bale, which is never a bad thing. Majel Barrett (Gene Roddenberry's wife) plays a part. But the part that is probably most memorable is that of Yul Brynner as a robotic gunslinger. Did Brynner do many westerns? I am not sure. I saw him in one and found it odd to see a completely bald man in a cowboy hat. But now I saw it again. (And again I wonder if he shaves his head or if he has some sort of skin condition.) One could not call this a great film, with the story being decent but the directing only being average. Had another person -- anyone but Crichton -- handled this, it may have been a better film. But the concept is so interesting, the plot so fun, that this clearly falls in the category of the film you invite a few friends over and watch while drinking a case of Milwaukee's Best Ice. No need to pay attention, just let the film be a decent background.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two very stupid, boring characters visit a futuristic amusement park. One of them is terminally smug, the other unbelievably nerdish. The main amusement consists of shooting robots dressed like cowboys. Two other amusements consist of joining in Roman orgies and medieval banquets, plus mayhem. These joys cost $1000 per day. If I had the money, this is what I would pay to stay away. Yul Brynner is a robot cowboy, and he looks seriously fed up. I'm not surprised. Ditto, for me. The action is plodding, the dialogue rock-bottom, the plot loopholes innumerable. Suspend all disbelief, ye who enter this world.The first time I watched this, it was faintly bearable. There was something barely interesting in finding out what unbearably idiotic incident would follow the previous one. However, I was fast-forwarding before the end. I tried again, just now. This time I only managed the first ten minutes before switching off.The best part was when Brynner shot and killed Mr Smug. This did at least make sense. You could sense his irritation. The extra star is for the satisfaction of seeing justice done. Unfortunately, Mr Nerd seems to have survived. It wasn't fair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was very disappointed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read all of Michael Crichton's books (even "A Case of Need" which he wrote under pseudonym in the late sixties) and was extremely disappointed to find his directorial effort on "Westworld" so mediocre. Although some of his other films have been quite good, Crichton is kind of at a loss here."Westworld" is like an early form of "Jurassic Park" - about a theme park out west where tourists can visit and find themselves immersed in the wild west. One of the cool features of the park is that it has robot cowboys who actually interact with the visitors.However when one of the robots (played by Yul Brynner) goes haywire, all hell breaks loose.As a film this isn't particularly well-filmed, well-acted or thrilling. I was quite bored and Crichton's directorial decisions made me raise a few eyebrows.He's a great writer and can be a very good director, but I think he was still learning with this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is set in the unspecified future. There's an adult entertainment park run by Delos. They offer a Medieval World, a Roman World and a West World. In those "worlds" (actually they're all on Earth) the vacationers become kings, queens, emperors or gunslingers and have a bunch of robots (dressed in appropriate costumes) that cater to their every need. This concentrates on two buddies--macho John (James Brolin and timid Peter (Richard Benjamin) visiting West World. Then the robots start to malfunction...I caught this on TV when I was 11 or so. Back then it wowed me--the special effects were pretty impressive for the mid 1970s. Seeing it now it doesn't really work. The idea is intriguing but I had a LOT of questions about how this is supposed to work. Also plot holes popped up pretty early on. To make it worse the two main characters are given no personality whatsoever. Peter is timid--John is macho--that's it! I also don't like westerns and that's what this turned into. The special effects are primitive but amusing in a strange sort of way. The only things this have going for it are the concept, it's brevity (it's only 88 minutes) and Yul Brynner is downright chilling as the Gunslinger. This was a surprise hit in 1973 and lead to an even worse sequel ("Futureworld") three years later. I can only give this a 6. Kids will probably love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Average sci-fi thriller movie back in 1973.But today due to numerous improvements on the ideas presented here,this movie is only likely to be enjoyed by the most avid sci-fi movie completist.The special effects here was ripped off by numerous 1970's sci-fi TV series like those countless Six Million Dollar Man/Bionic Woman shows.If one has seen those TV shows before seeing this movie,nothing comes out new or fresh.Come to think of it,the Six Million Dollar Man pilot episodes came out before this movie!So actually,the special effects here were not too original after all.Also,they were not content with the Six Million Dollar Man rip off,they even stole the actor who plays Dr.Rudy Wells in said TV show!No sirree.They can't pull a fast one on a guy like me who has seen a lot of movies and TV shows so I am NOT IMPRESSED at all and do not buy into the hype.So now what have we got?Story?The story looks to me like a reject script from a 1960's Twilight Zone episode.The story was too full of plot holes it's not funny.Yes indeed. this one makes a great victim for MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE 2000 lampooning fun........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen. This was a unanimous decision between my friends as we watched it the other night on itv1.Where do i begin. Poor character development, weak plot, uninformative dialogue, poor cinematography and the list goes on. Richard Benjamin's solid performance was the only positive to come out of this rubbish.Even more disappointingly was the fact that it was written/directed by Michael Crichton, of who i am a fan for his work with Jurassic Park. The movie was a poorly made, and left us unsatisfied with the in-continuity and inconclusiveness of the films ending.The 10 year boy in me though "hey that's a cool idea", but the adult film-lover in me thought "man that was a waste of 88 minutes". Without being a "spoiler" did it not seem to anyone else that the movie simply ended rather abruptly?? Also, the idea of "robot-prostitutes" so to speak was also a bit disturbing and lame.Lastly, the fact that the technicians provided no sound reasoning as to why the robots simply freaked-out was really the icing on a terrible cake. You should be ashamed Yul Brynner.</fullReview>
