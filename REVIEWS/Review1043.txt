		<fullReview>Are you alone? good. Have you turned off the lights? good.Is there a storm brewing in that dark foreboding sky?Excellent. Do you like brilliant black and white movies? Wonderful.Now, sit back and enjoy the best of the best. This is quite simply the best psychological thriller ever made.Often imitated but never bettered. If you have a problem with subtitled films then don't worry because you will understand this film without reading them. If you want slash and gore, go elsewhere.If you want sophisticated entertainment,you've come to the right place.Georges Cluzot's finest work is a thing of beauty as is his wife Vera, who stars opposite Simone Signoret as the schoolmaster's wife.From the very start it is very clear that all is not as it seems. But why? and who? What is the terrible secret of the swimming pool and later on, the bathtub? As the tension builds to an unbearable climax, we sit and hide behind our hands, peering through the gaps in our fingers.Oh my God!! it can't be!.....it is! Do not confuse this movie with the disgraceful remake starring Sharon Stone. All copies of that disaster should be burned. Watch this movie if you are a serious film buff. Rent something else if you have the attention span of a goldfish.Brilliant. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hold your breath suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Les Diaboliques is one of the tightest, pure suspense movies I have ever seen. The story starts out slowly, but as it moves on, peculiar things start to happen. This movie keeps you guessing in such a way, you are riveted to your seat, hoping for a quick resolution to the suspense. Yet, as the story unfolds, the suspense deepens. The final scene of the movie had me sitting back holding my breath.This movie does not offer cheap, pop out and scare you tactics. Rather, it makes the viewer expect things to happen that don't. You wait on the edge of your seat for the quick jump out and scare you event to take place, but instead, it sneaks up from behind you. What an effect!Les Diaboliques is a classic film that delivers the complete suspense package. It's not surprising that many suspense movies of the modern era have tried to copy the plot. This movie is well worth renting in a video store, if you can find it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Film Hitchcock Did Not Make.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock must have forever wondered how he managed to allow this story to slip out of his hands, but the fact remains: had he filmed CELLE QUI N'ETAIT PAS into his own version of what is known as LES DIABOLIQUES, there very well might not have been a VERTIGO, also an adaptation from the authors of the aforementioned one and D'ENTRE LES MORTES. All in all, this is an excellent horror film that has strong Film Noir overtones and precedes New Wave by a couple of years and its simple yet powerful direction by Jean Georges-Clouzot elevates it from a standard thriller to one to which all others are measured spawning countless imitations with much less satisfying degree. One wonders what treatment Hitchcock would have given it, and interestingly, it's all here: the almost casual presentation of spousal abuse that occurs off-camera in one chilling scene early on, the events that lead the women (Vera Clouzot and Simone Signoret) to make a drastic decision concerning killing Clouzot's husband (Michel DelaSalle), and then the growing, deadly certainty he may not be quite dead after all... and may be after the terrified women. The last 15 minutes are one of the most tension-inducing I've ever seen in any climactic montage (even if it does veer into a certain implausibility but the intent is to tell a suspense story and Hitchcock has often mentioned the "suspension of disbelief" factor) and have long gone into history as one of the most horrific moments in cinema.To those interested in watching LES DIABOLIQUES, please do NOT watch its American remake, DIABOLIQUE, with Sharon Stone and Isabelle Adjani. It pays to read the subtitles in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Thriller - See It As Soon As You Can</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Les Diaboliques" has one of the best plots you will ever find in any mystery or suspense thriller. The excellent directing, acting, and writing combine with the story itself to make it a memorable experience.If you enjoy quality mysteries or thrillers, you will almost certainly enjoy this one - and if you have not seen it yet, you might just want to buy or rent it now, before you read any more reviews. This comment will avoid any discussion at all of the actual plot itself, because the less you know in advance, the more you will enjoy it. The few implausible elements in the story do not detract at all from the enjoyment.A great plot does not all by itself make a good movie, and everything works especially well here because of the expert pacing by director Henri-Georges Clouzot and good, mostly understated acting by the main actors. We are drawn into their world very nicely. Everything about the characters and events is built up perfectly, to give the brilliant climax its full effect. Once again, see it before you find out any more.Even if you do not normally watch black-and-white films or foreign movies (this is in French), if you enjoy thrillers, watch "Les Diaboliques" as soon as you have the chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh wow... this is it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a legend : after reading Pierre Boileau's novel, Alfred Hitchcock phone the editor in the morning to buy the story for making a film. But another great master, Henri-Georges Clouzot, had phone 30 minutes earlier. Mister Hitchcock was angry! But Hitch couldn't have done better than Clouzot. This is P-E-R-F-E-C-T! The black and white, the dialogues, the acting and even the reclusive French scool of the 1950's. And for the suspense... well every viewer of IMDB had said the same things I could said. So, Diaboliques is the best suspense thriller of all time, and also one of the best movie ever made. Please, I really said please, don't ever watch the remake with Isabelle Adjani and Sharon Stone. There are certains movies that you can't make two times. Like all the Hitchcock and Clouzot films, for example...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the greatest suspense film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another terrific suspense film from Henri-Georges Clouzot, Les Diaboliques (also known as "Diabolique") is a tense story of murder, suspicion and revenge. The plot revolves around two women, Christina (Vera Clouzot) and Nicole (Simone Signoret) who conspire to murder the brutish man who is Christina's husband and Nicole's lover Michel, played by the delightfully sullen Paul Meurisse. He is the principal of a boarding school for boys who relies on Vera's money to support his excesses, and the two women are both teachers at the school.Vera has her doubts about committing murder, even though Michel is incredibly abusive. But Nicole convinces her to help drug and then drown Michel. All seems to be going well until Michels body goes missing and the two women turn against each other. The situation is complicated further by the appearance of a retired police inspector who is determined to help Vera find her "missing" husband, despite the poor woman's protests. The tension continues to mount until the hair-raising climax.This movie is on a par with some of Hitchcock's best work, although Clouzot doesn't mix much humor in with the suspense, as Hitch often did. However, Vera's interaction with the droll inspector does provides some chuckles. Unlike his previous film, The Wages Of Fear, Clouzot doesn't spend a whole lot of time on the set-up of the plot, but gets right to the meat of the matter, and from there Diabolique rolls along very quickly with barely a letup in the action.I can't believe it took me so long to see this masterpiece. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mystery Extraordinaire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in a French boarding school for boys, "Les Diaboliques" tells the story of two teachers, Christina (played by Vera Clouzot), and Nicole (played by Simone Signoret), who conspire to kill the sadistic headmaster, a man who also happens to be Christina's abusive husband.Like most murder mysteries, the story is highly improbable; nevertheless, the film is still hugely entertaining, thanks in part to plot twists and turns that even Agatha Christie would admire, and to the film's B&amp;W lighting, that renders a noirish, sinister atmosphere.The first half is interesting and tightly plotted. But the real strength of the film's underlying premise begins at the mid-point plot turn. The second half is riveting, because the tight plot begins to ooze with mystery and suspense. It builds to a final ten minutes that are as frightening as almost any ending in film history; dark interiors, shadows, ominous light at the end of a long hallway, a general absence of sound, a gloved hand, a scream, and an unexpected image. It's the very definition of spine-tingling suspense.There is a clue to help solve the story's mystery in the film's first ten minutes; but like any good mystery, that clue is very subtle. All the film's acting is excellent, even down to the children actors. And, Simone Signoret is as wonderful here as she is in all of her other movies.English subtitles require a little more work for viewers who cannot understand the French dialogue; yet, the story, the acting, and the cinematography should more than offset this minor irritation. Background music occurs only during the film's title sequence and closing credits; this general absence of music thus enhances suspense.Although not strictly speaking a whodunit, "Les Diaboliques" is a classic murder mystery that has earned a well-deserved reputation for setting the standard for cinematic suspense. The story is riveting, and the film is technically well made. More recent films have tried to copy it; but this is the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting in terms of suspense?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clouzot is possibly the cinema's most devout pessimist: no other director has portrayed human vices so persuasively? If his bitter vision of the world is finally limited and unattractive, his status as a major filmmaker, entertaining through suspense while simultaneously expressing his private dismay with cool and detached visual precision, remains intact? "Les Diaboliques" is a mystery set in a shabby boys' boarding school? The plot ? a sadistic headmaster is murdered by his wife and his mistress; ominously and inexplicably, his corpse vanishes is too contrived to survive repeated viewings, but the stark gray images emphasizing physical decay offer a precise, grimly poetic visual correlative for the characters' warped emotions?Clouzot's moral pessimism, shock tactics and readiness to display man's worst excesses suggest parallels with Hitchcock and Fuller, while his focus on cruelty, domination and decay may be compared with that of figures as diverse as Leone, Blier and Fassbinder?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense claustrophobia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Les diaboliques is an unusually intense movie. I believe this is due to the well thought out choice of real locations and the masterful use of spatial entities and textures. Your memory really gets hooked on those things, and it gives the story a sense of reality that makes you feel uneasy.Les diaboliques is as much a horror movie as it is a thriller. When I watch this I perceive an intense mouldy smell throughout. The crumbling boarding school where the main characters live and act is worse than any nightmare ? even the swimming pool filled with murky water appears like a menacing abyss. The stifling crummyness is accentuated by the plot: School teachers sit at the sadistic principal's table in the refectory and have to force unspeakably ghastly meals down their throats (only one glass of wine is allowed). The second location is the principal's lover's apartment in a dead borough somewhere in no man's land. It's stuffy and utterly claustrophobic. The transfer between the two places is made with a "deux chevaux" station wagon ? its characteristic back part of corrugated sheet metal once was a common feature in our parts of the world, as was the snarling sound of the deux chevaux?s engine. In the corrugated iron "box" sits a creaky wicker crate, which on the way back from the lover's apartment contains evidence of the crime, wrapped in a checkered wax tablecloth. So you see shells within shells, not unlike one of those Russian wooden dolls. You don't know what you will find in the innermost until the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DIABOLIQUE (Henri-Georges Clouzot - France 1955). I must admit I found Clouzot's earlier WAGES OF FEAR(1953) slightly disappointing and therefor temporarily held back from watching any other films he made but how wrong I was! This much discussed classic was one of the most frightening and disturbing films I've ever seen. The music theme played during the opening credits with the organ and the singing schoolchildren still makes the hairs in my neck stand up, even at this very moment.The story revolves around the tyrant schoolmaster Delasalle (Paul Meurisse) of a seedy boarding school, his wife (Vera Clouzot) and his mistress (Simone Signoret). An he maltreats them both, they decide to work together to murder him. They drown Delasalle in the bathtub and dump the corpse in the abandoned swimming pool next to the school. But then, eerie things start to happen. When the pool is drained and no body is found, the two women grow increasingly fearful that Delasalle is still alive. When subsequently his suit is returned from the dry-cleaners and the schoolchildren repeatedly testify they've seen Delasalle, they start to panic and the strange occurrences surrounding his supposed resurrection slowly drive them into insanity and complete paranoia.Justifiably hailed as one of the most suspenseful films ever made and often compared to Hitchcock's work. Clouzot lacks the master's wit but as far as suspense goes, he is incomparable. Very much opposed to Hitchcock, this film - like most of his work - has a very cynical and misanthropic feel to it. Perhaps largely due to this very dark tone and Clouzot's excellent eye for detail, even today it still has the power to drive you right up the wall. And Simone Signoret, whom I've never (consciously) seen before in other films, greatly added to my admiration of this film. A sublime actress and an absolutely hypnotizing screen presence. The entire cast is terrific for that matter with Charles Vanel as inspector Fichet another standout.Clouzot takes his time to build up the story very precisely but once the mysterious things start to happen every scene adds to an almost unbearable tension. You'll watch every facial expression and every detail on screen with increasing paranoia yourself, in order to understand what on earth could have happened. And the ending is so surprising that I wasn't quite sure anymore about the things I just saw, even right after the film's ending. A genuinely great movie that more than lives up to its status and has lost none of its impact over the last five decades.Camera Obscura --- 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Macabre and depressing story makes for somber viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Henri Georges Clouzot must not have had a sunny disposition. This movie is painful to watch, the angst-ridden actors bite and hack each other to bloody pieces, and the camera contemplates the action like a vulture, waiting for raw carcasses to dismember. All this, without really showing any violence. It's all in the mind. Les Diaboliques is shot in black and white, but as I remember it, it was all murky grey. Maybe it was just the worn-out print, maybe it was intentional, but it really worked on me. Like the constant drizzle of October rain, the dirty, bedraggled schoolchildren, the delapidated buildings, the rotten school-lunches! I felt deeply suicidal! The movie is full of scary scenes, of something unspeakably bad waiting to happen to the "murderesses". The long-awaited bathroom climax is not the most scary part, yet it is a welcome release for all the pent-up emotion, and Vera Clouzot truly appears to be near death. Her features twisted and tortured,her expressive body wretched and thin like a concentration-camp prisoner. She looks to be in real pain. Les Diaboliques means The Devilish, and the Devil is clearly at work here. I have seldom felt a stronger presence of evil, and Clouzot manages this feat without a single concession to the bloodbath that is the modern horror-movie. This one has influenced everything from "the Exorcist" to "Rosemary's baby", yet still feels like an original, subtle classic. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Devil You Say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The odds against writing and directing two all-time classic thrillers/suspensers back to back must be fairly remote, featuring your wife in both remoter still, and starring Yves Montand in the first (The Wages Of Fear, in case there are any first-time buyers out there) and his wife, Simone Signoret in the second, astronomical. Say hello - and tip your hat while you're about it - to Henri-George Clouzot who pulled off this double whammy with ease. Clouzot made only a handful of films but those he did make were worth seeing, from Le Corbeau thru L'Assassin habite du 21 thru Quai des Orfevres and up to Wages and this one. Again many previous commenters have set the scene and described the plot and most of them are more than positive in their praise. I can only endorse their opinions and raise a glass to all involved especially Paul Meurisse and Charles Vanel who tend to get lost in the shuffle. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a disappointment. (CONTAINS HEAVY SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the kind of movie you hear about for an eternity, but never manage to see, or, as in my case, just see the first half hour of and never get to see completely. And when you finally, after years or decades, see the movie, you mostly either mesmerized - or, like today, in the 'that's all?' kind of feeling. Being a huge Hitchcock fan, and knowing the history of 'Les Diaboliques' and how it propelled Hitch into making masterpieces as 'Vertigo' and 'Psycho', I sadly saw the story's solution coming way too early - namely, the instant one of the male teachers said to the other that Simone Signoret's character had quite a commanding presence (after about two thirds of the movie, as she was giving orders and then rushing up the stairs). The only logical, non-supernatural solution was the one that the movie ended with - that the title-giving diabolical ones where not the two women, but the sadistic headmaster and his mistress. I'd have loved to have a lot more 'signs of the unexplainable' bothering the women (both women, not just the frail wife) - aside from the missing corpse (always a great idea for a story), one of the boys having talked to the headmaster after his supposed death and the matter of the corpse's suit. In my opinion, the women quarreled to soon; and although I liked the performances at first, I soon found that Signoret's character was too obviously dominant, too self-assured, too straightforward and, most of all, a lot (!) too relaxed when the body of a person I just murdered happens to appear hundreds of miles away to be believable. As for Vera Clouzot's character: it was just way too convenient to have a rather young person have a heart condition in a thriller as not to mean something later on. The fact that the 'corpse' was seen standing in the bathtub on the cover of the DVD's German edition didn't help matters, either (in a rather small, but still recognizable picture) ? But what bothered me most was the character of the private investigator. What was the point? So that he could mete out justice in the end? Since he obviously had a hunch who the real victim was, why didn't he warn her??? Bottom line: this is a picture one might (or should even, as a movie fan) have seen once, but unlike a lot of thrillers one knows the ending of, I see no reason to view 'Les Diaboliques' again. The absence of a composer of Bernard Herrmann's stature and the uneven camera worked against my involvement in the story, as well. I prefer 'Wait Until Dark', 'Psycho' or 'The Haunting' and quite a lot of others as far as suspense is concerned. Sorry, M. Clouzot, nice try, but I didn't buy this one. And rest in peace, Mr. Hitchcock, your rank as THE Master of Suspense is undisputed, in my book at least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expect that Criterion films are of certain importance. They are films that have something unique to offer. Even Armageddon deserves a certain amount of recognition. It documents the way that blockbusters are going nowadays.I can honestly say that I think I understand the importance of Diabolique. The film was most likely incredibly innovative for the time period. I am impressed that the only shots that felt dated were the head-on driving shots, and aside from those, the direction is entirely appropriate. It does not call attention to itself, it has grace, and it is not feel like it has been copied since. The script is tightly written, no lines are wasted.On a personal level, I felt a little disappointed. I figured out the ending very quickly. My father, who would have been 16 when this was released, had no idea the ending was coming at all. The originality of this ending has been sacked by modern thrillers, horrors, and dramas. Regardless of deciphering the ending, this is still worth watching, even for historical purposes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The boys' school in Saint Cloud, a suburb of Paris, run by Michel and Christina Delassale, serves as the background for one of the best suspense thrillers of the French cinema. The school belongs to Christina, but it's Michel who has the last word about everything. This penny pinching man insists in giving his students living at the boarding school the worst food money can buy. Michel is also a man who loves to slap his wife, and his mistress, Nicole Horner, who is a teacher at the school. When we first meet them, Nicole has a swollen eye and wears dark glasses to hide her shame. Obviously, everyone guesses what is really going on between Michel and Nicole, even his wife. Christina is aware of the extra-marital goings on between her husband and his mistress. A strong minded Nicole shows how she dominates the weaker Christine. Nicole, who is fed up with the situation convinces Christina something must be done. She sets things in motion to go to her home town during a brief vacation so that Christina and Nicole attract Michel to come after them as they have a plan of their own about how to deal with his abuses.The women's plan is to bring Michel's body back to the school and dump him in the murky swimming pool, where he would be discovered as drowned by accident, or perhaps his own suicide. When the pool is drained, there is no corpse. When one of Michel's suits is sent from a dry cleaner's the women are dumbfounded. When they go to investigate, the owner hands them a key for a nearby hotel room.Christina, who is a fragile woman with what appears to be a weak heart, feels guilty. When she reads in the newspaper about a drowning victim found on the Seine, she has to find out to see if it's her husband. Of course, the dead man is not Michel, which heightens the mystery. What Christina didn't count on is the retired inspector, Alfred Fichet, who watches her outside the viewing room at the morgue. This man will become the key figure to solving Michel's disappearance. "Les Diaboliques" was Clouzot's triumph because the suspense works until the end. He based his screen play in a novel by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejar, who also served as the basis for "Vertigo". In fact, much has been said about the similarities between the two directors, but it is unfortunate because both men approached their work in different ways. Clouzot hints subtly at perhaps a lesbian relationship between Nicole and Christine as it appears both want to be rid of the horrible Michel.The acting is first rate. Simone Signoret, one of the best and most attractive actresses of her era, makes an earthy Nicole. She is calculating because there is a lot at stake. Vera Clouzot plays Christine as a bundle of nerves because of the gravity of her actions. Paul Meurisse is the evil Michel. Charles Vanet is the old inspector Fichet. Also in the cast, a young Michel Serrault, and the singer Johnny Holiday, who appears uncredited as one of the boys in the school.Henri Georges Clouzot was at the top of his craft and he clearly showed he was a master of suspense, bar none.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Diabolique (1955)Slow, unexpected suspense, and gorgeous, understated filming. A pair of women completely different but in love with the same man, who they say they detest equally. A boy's boarding school filled with chatter and mischief and long, dark corridors. And a weirdly clever and intrusive retiring cop who may, or may not, be figuring this thing out as we go.Better than a whodunit mystery, this one actually sucks you in and makes you almost cry out for the victim you see in danger. The twist, the main one, is pretty astonishing, and not completely unreasonable, though you have to just marvel at some of the good luck needed to make it work. And good acting.In charge here is Henri-Georges Clouzot, who is famous mostly for this, and to a lesser degree the fabulous Wages of Fear from two years earlier. There is little here familiar for American audiences, except maybe the Hitchockian tone, paced with a steady build that would make the English director proud (but instead made him jealous, apparently, since Clouzot bought the script hours before Hitchcock was going to). The perfect pitch for dialog, for humor against the ominous background, and for the innocence of a bunch of naughty boys all add up to make a neverending suspense. The famous admonishment at the end not to talk about the film to people who hadn't seen it only emphasizes how good the film is the second time, even when you know what's going to happen. It isn't all about surprise, but about an expert manipulation of the medium, cinema, for maximum effect. It's a film not too different in style from the best of the dark, semi-Gothic dramas of American 1940s cinema (this is later), and even though you are busy reading subtitles at times, it clicks along with visual and gestural ease. Quite an experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Headmaster of a boarding school, Michel Delaselle (Paul Meurisse) is a brooding bully of a man, one day his wife and mistress decide enough is enough and plot to kill him, trouble is that once they murder him, his body disappears and reported sightings of him are adding to the ladies' paranoia.Thus is the setting for director Henri-Georges Clouzot's brilliant suspenser. The pace is stiflingly perfect, he gently racks up the tension, neatly toying with audience expectation, the sense of dread that hangs in the air is palpable. How refreshing it is to see a suspense film actually build its plot for a good hour? In this day and age the MTV generation would be walking out of this after 30 minutes. Armand Thirard's atmospheric photography accentuates the creeping menace like mood, to the point that when we get to the last 15 minutes, nerves are already frayed and we then of course get what is arguably the greatest bath scene ever, and "that" ending... When I first watched it back in 2008 it was on a poor quality DVD, but revisiting it on Blu-ray it still worked me over as the great suspense movie it is, forcing me to seek the solace of daylight ASAP. Great writing, great directing, great acting, the latter thriving due to Simone Signoret's dangerously simmering sexuality and Véra Clouzot's heartfelt vulnerability. It's one of the classic chillers of European cinema. And if you haven't seen it yet? Do what I did last night, get the Blu-ray, turn off the lights and just have a couple of candles flickering away in your peripheral vision. Maybe indulge in some stiff drinks like I did, and most of all, watch it on your own... 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A chilling thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this 50's mystery thriller, and I was surprised. Most movies made in the 50's don't scare me, but this film left me trembling.The film tells the story of two women working for a cruel and abusive boarding school principal. Tired of being hurt, verbally and physically, the women plan and execute the man's murder during the holidays. I don't want to give away too much, for it's vital you see it without knowing the ending. The last fifteen minutes of this film pack a strong and chilling punch with wonderful suspense and subtlety you don't see anymore. It is a masterful thriller with a twist ending matching that of "Psycho" and "The Sixth Sense". I recommend it to anyone who is able to watch older movies. Fans of slasher and killer films that get their scares from gore and shocks, stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a brief period during the 1950s, French director Henri-Georges Clouzot temporarily swiped the title of "The Master of Suspense" from Alfred Hitchcock, owing to a string of well-received suspense thrillers, most notably 'The Wages of Fear (1953)' and 'Les Diaboliques (1955).' The latter was an adaptation of the novel "Celle qui n'était plus (She Who Was No More)" by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac; it was released in the UK as 'The Devils,' and in the United States as 'Diabolique.' Upon its initial release, the film was extensively likened to the work of Hitchcock {who, popular legend tells us, missed out on purchasing the novel rights by a mere few hours}, with its slow-burning, deliberately-paced suspense, and a shocking twist that I never for a moment saw coming. Though, with the notable exception of two scenes ? both involving a murder, with only one of them being real ? the film isn't particularly scary, the tension, the paranoia and the blackened shadows often become overwhelming, and Clouzot deftly toes the line between supernatural evil, and the evil that lurks within all of us.Christina Delassalle (Véra Clouzot) and Nicole Horner (Simone Signoret), both teachers at a boarding school for young boys, have a rather peculiar friendship. Christina is married to Michel (Paul Meurisse), a violent and tyrannical husband who derives pleasure from humiliating his pretty but physically-delicate wife. Nicole, conversely, is Michel's mistress, a proud and independent woman who knows how to take control of a situation. At one point in the film, upon witnessing the two woman quietly conversing, a fellow professor makes a fascinated remark: "I may be reactionary, but this is absolutely astounding - the legal wife consoling the mistress! No, no, and no!" The mere fact that Christina and Nicole have become close should already hint at a sinister situation underlying the surface, and, indeed, it is soon revealed that the two women plan to murder Michel and ridding themselves of his oppression. The "murder" itself ? a sedative in the alcohol, and drowning their unconscious victim in the bathtub, is exceedingly disturbing, as we guiltily and uneasily ask ourselves if we'd have the courage to carry through such a scheme.Alfred Hitchcock often delighted in creating suspense through the audience's subversive empathy for a film's villain, as a murderer attempts frantically to remove all traces of their crime. Clouzot uses a similar technique in his film, though, given the loathsome nature of the murder victim, our sympathy for the two women is almost demanded of us. However, the disappearance of Michel's body from the school swimming pool is completely unexpected, and either hints at a supernatural overtone, or that somebody else is quite obviously aware of their terrible crime. The paranoia from here rarely lets up, and we continually bombard ourselves with an endless stream of questions, unable to provide an answer for any of them. On a weaker note, despite the ever-present air of tension, few scenes actually succeeded in getting my heart pumping at a mile-a-minute, which was a slightly disappointing response that I can't quite explain. Perhaps a few sequences need to have been shortened slightly, just to swipe off ten unnecessary minutes, and allowing for a brisker pace that never gives you a chance to exhale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very suspenseful, but not bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe my expectations were just too high for this, but I have to say it was quite the disappointment. I didn't find Diabolique bad by any means, but hearing people say that it's better than anything Hitchcock ever did is pretty laughable in my eyes. I think it looks worse by comparison to Hitchcock, but in it's own right it's a solid, if not particularly impressive work. Concerning the wife and mistress of a school headmaster who conspire to murder him together, Henri-Georges Clouzot's film took a while to get going for me but once it did I found some solid enjoyment out of it.A lot of what makes it work comes more from the work of the two women at it's core. Simone Signoret, as the mistress, takes charge of the murderous plot and stands firm in her beliefs, cold and calculated. She's always trying to remain in control, remain collected, and when things start to unravel you can see her slowly twist at the idea of potentially suffering the consequences. Vera Clouzot, as the wife, takes on the more unstable, emotional role and she really makes it sing. She is wild, uncontrollable and never at rest. Whereas Signoret is very still and mannered, Clouzot bounces off the walls in her distress and this contrast between them drives the film more than anything the director himself does.There are some nice twists in the narrative that keep the mystery alive in the latter half of the film, along with a stunning final sequence that finally lived up to the hype that had been built around the film. The final sequence was mesmerizing and terrifying, culminating in a twist that I was surprised I didn't see coming. That being said, the resolution itself was disappointingly pedestrian. Overall though, I didn't find much to write home about here, although it was certainly good. This was my first Clouzot film and I'll be sure to check out several more of his works, but if this is a sign of what he has to offer me then I'm afraid I'll never be able to understand those who rank him above his English companion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicole and Christina believe they have committed the perfect murder of a lover and husband who was anything but the tenderhearted, most loving person in the world. That man is Michel, a principal of a male boarding school his wife Christina paid for with her wealth. Michel holds everyone at bay because he has this powerfully vile hold over everyone from his perpetually "walking-on-egg-shells" wife to the teachers under his watch. He is really abusive toward Christina who is weak with an exterior so shaken with fear she suffers from a heart condition. What makes the opening of this film so fascinating is Clouzot doesn't show the building of the set-up for murdering Michel, but we hear through their dialogue this planning of the event for quite some time. What is also jarring is that Nicole and Christina seem to be friendly with one another which is startling since Nicole is Michel's lover. There's an instance when Nicole is about to share what Michel told her in bed regarding his wishes for his wife's demise to Christina! It is quite interesting that Nicole is the instigator of the actions that soon occur regarding how they set-up Michel and kill him. We watch as this whole scenario takes place which leaves little doubt that Nicole and been premeditating how to kill Michel for quite some time. One mistake of course is deciding to include Christina in her plans to the whole set-up and murder since she's so weak-kneed that any little minute ordeal would throw her into a frenzy.Once the deed is indeed over and they toss Michel's body in the nasty, murky pool beside the school, it's all about someone discovering it. That tricky part really ratchets up the true tension in the story. Christina, who is finding it unbearable waiting day after day as that body is supposedly waiting on the bottom undiscovered, has the pool drained but, to her horror, no body is found. Where did that body go? Who removed it? Was he dead? Throughout the film, Nicole and Christina deal with the underlying guilt from their deed and mistrust which starts to loom over their "relationship" like a rain-cloud when going to the police station often becomes a topic of conversation.A detective makes things even worse as he represents a constant reminder that their crime is always on display as awaiting that final axe to chop never goes away. Christina is also a devout catholic which only adds to the luggage of guilt already weighing her down.Good casting, very intelligent story-line(that develops after the "perfect murder" rather than focusing on it as what usually takes place in mysteries), and a suspenseful build-up with questions abound that keeps the viewer guessing at what will happen as that body stays missing. Though clues of his existence as a living man seems possible, the film is slippery at actually showing him while pulsating the theme of Christina's inner strife at what she has done. Great film-making in every possible way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent slow-burn movie which fills you full of tension and anticipation. Véra Clouzot does an excellent job as the naive wife, Christina, who plots with her husband's mistress to kill him. Véra's husband Henri-Georges Clouzot does a great job in the director's chair and keeps the audience in suspense. It is one of those films that keeps you in anticipation until the very last frame. Typically, I hate subtitles but they did not bother me here because the movie was so good. One of the great things about this movie is that none of the main characters are truly innocent. The only weakness I saw was the movie dragged on a little too long. Overall, an excellent film and a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat dawdling and far-fetched murder mystery, though well-performed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two female teachers at a boys' boarding school conspire to bump off the cruel headmaster, who is married to one of the ladies and finishing an affair with the other. French director Henri-Georges Clouzot, whom some have compared to Alfred Hitchcock, is so plot-driven as a filmmaker that he tends to skitter over minute details, such as a forgotten set of keys in a suit or another set of keys at the bottom of a swimming pool. Stray ends such as these tend to linger in the mind after the film is over, lessening the picture's overall impact. Clouzot also produced the film and co-adapted the screenplay from Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac's novel "Celle qui n'était plus", and perhaps got too carried away with a sub-plot involving a retired detective. The finale is mounted beautifully for suspense but, again, Clouzot is so maddeningly tied to the plot mechanisms that there isn't any room for surprises. Remade for American television as "Reflections of Murder" in 1974, and again theatrically as "Diabolique" with Sharon Stone in 1996. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvellous &amp; Memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Les Diaboliques" is a classic murder mystery with a fascinating story, interesting characters, good plot twists and a sensational conclusion. On its release it achieved great commercial success and in the years since has maintained its popularity and served as a major source of inspiration for other filmmakers with many of its original elements being employed to great effect, especially in psychological thrillers. Its story was based on the novel "Celle qui n'etait plus" by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac. These are the same writers who wrote "D'Entre des Morts" which was the source material for Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo". There is a similarity between the two plots in the sense that revelations in the second half of both stories change the audience's perception of what they've seen in the first half.A strong feature of the movie is its characters (particularly those who comprise the menage a trois) and the time taken to explore the dynamic between them and their motivations is particularly pertinent to what happens later in the story. The combination of Henri-Georges Clouzot's skillful direction and Armand Thirard's cinematography contributes powerfully to the ominous atmosphere of the piece and the tension that prevails throughout.The setting for the action is a run down boarding school where the arrogant and abusive Principal Michel Delasalle (Paul Meurisse) is despised by his staff, his pupils, his sickly wife Christina (Vera Clouzot) and his mistress Nicole (Simone Signoret). Christina is a rather timid ex-nun who owns the school and also has a heart condition. She's habitually humiliated by Michel's behaviour, his abuse and the fact that everyone in the school is aware of his infidelity. Nicole is a competent, assertive and rather calculating member of the staff who has been physically abused by Michel and at one stage wears dark glasses to conceal a black eye.Instead of being at loggerheads with each other, the two women become close as they reach the limit of their tolerance and decide that they can't endure their maltreatment any longer. They devise a plan to end their plight and go to Nicole's apartment in a village some distance away from the school during a holiday. Christina lures Michel to the apartment so that they can drown him and transport him back to the school where his body would be deposited in the swimming pool. The plan is successful and the women wait for the corpse to float to the surface so that it'll appear that Michel has died as the result of an accident. When the body fails to surface, the pool is drained but Michel's body has vanished. The events that follow make the women increasingly bewildered and anxious until eventually matters reach their shocking conclusion.Christina's character is particularly interesting because although she's the most financially powerful of the three, she's also the most diffident and the most fragile because of her poor health. Her religious beliefs prevent her from seeing divorce as an acceptable means of escape from her husband's abuse and yet her natural inclination to be compliant leads her into going along with the murder plot suggested by the more forceful Nicole. This in turn also makes her become full of anguish as the threat of discovery grows and more guilt ridden when she has more time to reflect on the part she'd played in what was an extremely wicked act."Les Diaboliques" is a marvellous and memorable movie with great performances from its three main characters, an enjoyable mixture of suspense and moments of black humour and the sort of power and quality which make it totally unforgettable. This is simply one of those movies that should be seen by everyone who enjoys cinema because regardless of their reaction to it, they'll never forget it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie epitomizes for me the reason movies exist. To let you know that somewhere, sometime, someone else was exactly in the same place that you are. They understand you. The words flow from actors mouths as they would from your mind at that very moment.At no point in this film do you ever consider that you are watching a staged, rehearsed, acted scene. Director just behind the camera giving instruction. Hours spent in the editing room piecing it together just right. This is easily one of the most natural feeling movies I have ever seen and contains one of the most suspenseful scenes ever put to tape.I've been watching thriller/horror/suspense movies practically since birth. Used to sneak into the living room after my parents went to sleep to watch them.

		<shortDescription>DIABOLIQUE is Even Darker Than Hitchcock At His Darkest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Stanley Donen's 1963 thriller CHARADE, Henri-Georges Clouzot's DIABOLIQUE is one of the best Hitchcock films that Hitchcock DIDN'T make! The crucial difference is that CHARADE recalls playful, polished, soignée Hitchcock films such as NORTH BY NORTHWEST, while DIABOLIQUE, based on a novel by Boileau &amp; Narcejac of VERTIGO fame, is more like a precursor of Hitch's darker, more sinister PSYCHO. I understand Clouzot snatched up the film rights to the Boileau/Narcejac novel about half an hour before Hitchcock got a crack at it. It would have been fascinating to see Hitch's approach to the material. Darkly magnificent as PSYCHO is, DIABOLIQUE's gloomy, misogynistic take on the story sinks into your gut and haunts your dreams. Even DIABOLIQUE'S opening credit sequence immediately makes us uneasy with its merciless close-up of the run-down DeLassalle Boarding School's murky, mossy swimming pool, accompanied by children shrilly singing Georges Van Parys's music off-key and off-screen. The film starts out at a leisurely pace, but as it goes along, the tension tightens like a noose, helped by skillful use of shadows and light. Without giving away its twists, I'll only say that DIABOLIQUE gives new meaning to the phrase "cruel to be kind." Vera Clouzot (yes, the director's Mrs., or should I say Mme.?) and Simone Signoret are electrifying as, respectively, the long-suffering wife and mistress of manipulative, sadistic headmaster Paul Meurisse. As the women plot to kill the bastard, Clouzot's delicate loveliness and anxious air (her character has a heart condition that contributes to the suspense -- as if the poor gal doesn't have enough problems!) plays beautifully off Signoret's sexy, smoldering intensity. Which is scarier, the water sports in DIABOLIQUE or in PSYCHO? Watch them and decide for yourselves! :-) Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A personal recollection: 'Life' magazine (only those of a certain vintage will remember Life magazine) came out with a heavy-duty spread on this flick when it was released, hailing it as perhaps the most frightening movie ever made (remember the film industry wasn't as old then as it is today). I was nine years old and I begged and pleaded with my parents to be allowed to see it, to no avail. I did not get a chance to see it until much later in life, when it showed up on television. By then 'Psycho' and its successors had pushed the envelope of screen horror beyond what this film gives us. Still, the movie stands up pretty damn well on the creepiness scale. It is interesting to know that Hitchcock wanted the rights to this, and intriguing to imagine what he would have done with it. It's interesting to note that the film makers were not above providing some comic relief, in the form of the landlord and his wife in the boarding house where the murder takes place. Well worth viewing, in spite of the trouble of reading subtitles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is simply amazing on all fronts. It is in fact so amazing, you can't even comprehend how amazing it is until you watch it a 2nd time. Spend the 2nd time looking for plotholes, and then become frustrated when you don't find any. Bothered by the fact that film seems to move slow without a musical score? I was too at first. And then I realized how brilliant it it was. The lack of score helps to create greater tension, adding a Tell-Tale Heart quality to the story.(If you aren't familiar with the Edgar Allen Poe story of the same name, you must live under a rock. Check it out. You won't be disappointed.) The screenplay is airtight, not a single plothole. The acting is all top-notch. Extremely well-directed. If you thought this film was good, let me help persuade you towards my view. Think about when this was made, and think about the other films made at the time. This movie would stand-out as a great film today. The fact that it was made almost fifty (50, the big 5-0) years ago and you see that a true classic never goes out of style. The only reason I can think of anyone not loving this movie is they either can't appreciate a good film or are too closed-minded to watch a film that isn't in their own language. If you understand the intricacies of film-making, you will also realize how simply amazing this film is. Still not convinced? What if I tell you that Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock was heavily influenced by this film when making Psycho, which is regarded as in most circles as the greatest thriller of all time. H.G. Clouzout first employed the practice of not letting anyone into Diabolique after it started. And don't forget about the twist ending so commonly seen and overused in today's cinema. How many times have you seen a twist ending in a thriller? It all started with Diabolique. Do yourself a favor and check this film out. And do your friends a favor and tell them about this suspense masterpiece. Forget about the fact that it is in subtitles. Turn the lights off. ENJOY.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goes hand in hand with "Psycho"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And once you've watched them both, you'll know why. While Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho" may have been dealing with extra thematic material beneath its horrific surface, providing additional dimensions that the French film didn't have, "Diabolique" (or "Les Diaboliques" as it's known in France) is a thriller whose atmosphere and sense of mystery equal that of the great Hitchcock classic. The same dark, threatening black and white cinematography and bizarre, macabre goings-on of "Psycho" meet their French counterpart in "Diabolique", much to the viewer's delight. And while "Psycho" gave the world perhaps the most memorable scene revolving around a shower, "Diabolique" presents the most memorable scene[s] connected with a bathtub. More outstanding than any other bathtub scenes, in my opinon, including the ones from "The Shining".From the tension before the murder to the mysteries that arise afterwards, the suspense mounts to an eerie climax that remains one of the Cinema's most exciting, whether you predicted it or not. If you weren't expecting it, it will truly be a frightening and confusing (in a good way) surprise. If you successfully foretold it, it will satisfy your suspicions and still captivate your attention. The only thing that seems sub-par about the film is the police detective's role in the incidents during the climax and after. You may wonder why he didn't arrive on the scene earlier, or whether he could have prevented certain events from occurring. It seems awkward that he shows up when he did and knows all about what just happened. One gets the idea that perhaps French Production Codes of some kind had an effect on the plot at this point, giving the ending a somewhat forced and artificial flavor.</fullReview>

It is about two women who conspire to murder their lover and the mysterious series of events that occur after his body disappears.The two protagonists', Nicole Horner (Simone Sgnoret), and Christina Delasalle (Véra Clouzot), performances helped add the horror aspect to the movie. They were captivating and navigated skillfully the guilt- determination dilemma. The settings were not that varied yet sufficient to the story's development and the lightning tricks helped fuel the viewer's curiosity and attachment to the story line.The innovative, eventful story line is complemented by the actors' performances and a spot on cinematography to amount to one of the few movies that could compete with Hitchcock in the genre he defined.An appropriate tag-line for the movie would be "things aren't always what they seem"It's a classic masterpiece of the genre that any film aficionado should not miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wife, the Mistress, and the Devil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A slow-burn thriller about the fragile wife of a sadistic boarding school master and his mistress, who hatch a plan to murder their husband/lover to pay him back for all the abuse they've both had to endure.Vera Clouzot, real-life wife of the film's director, Henri-Georges Clouzot, plays the wife in the movie, but Simone Signoret, as the cool-headed and cynical mistress, steals the show. It was hard not to come to the film with a heap of expectations given its reputation, and I have to admit I was a bit let down by it. The real plot of the film begins not with the headmaster's murder, but with his corpse's disappearance and unsettling episodes that begin to lead the wife and mistress to suspect that he may not be dead. I thought the film was going to venture into some interesting psychological terrain, and even began to suspect that it was going to go into Bergman territory and have some sort of twist in which we learn that there aren't really two women at all, but rather two different facets to the same woman's personality -- the cold and cruel strength of the mistress representing what the wife would be if she weren't a near invalid. But the film doesn't get that intellectually complex, and instead tells a literal mystery story with a twist ending that probably seemed much more shocking at the time but is blunted now by the fact that we live in a culture of twist movie endings. It's not exactly a fault of the movie; I can't blame it for not being something it never intended to be. But I can't help my reaction to it either and my disappointment that it didn't end up being more interesting than it was.Still, it's a very good and effective movie and has a great look to it. There are a couple of genuinely creepy scenes, the kind that make it the perfect film to watch on a cold, rainy night.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Diabolique" is a horror movie in which we watch the wife of a cruel and very strict headmaster and his mistress conspire to kill him. After this murder is body is disappeared and some strange events begin to happen and disturb the two women.I liked this movie because of the plot which had much of suspense and mystery in the whole duration of it something that I found very nice and interesting for a movie. It also had many swifts that did not let you even think what will happen next. I also liked it because of the direction which made by Henri - Georges Clouzot and he did a very good job on it. About the interpretations I have to say that the interpretation of Véra Clouzot who played as Christina Delassalle was simply outstanding. Equally good was the interpretation of Simone Signoret who played as Nicole Horner.Finally I have to say that "Diabolique" is a very good and interesting movie to watch because it combines very well mystery with thriller and the result from this combination is success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will do for baths what Psycho did for showers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the film that had the most influence of Psycho, Les Diaboliques centres on 2 women who decide to murder a headmaster who has wronged both of them. However, the corpse disappears and both women start going mad. LD is an older example of a horror film before the days of remake mania and endless gore and screaming. This is one unnerving thriller. Like films such as Touch Of Evil, The Artist or The Prestige it's a good film but it is overrated. It doesn't feel as creepy as Psycho, for example, and the characters are fairly dull. It's also too long and slow. Build up is the key to suspense, but if you keep putting off the catalyst for the story and then keep dragging the story out the suspense dies down on its own. It's not as creepy or suspenseful as it's made out to be but there is still a high scare factor to the film. It's undeniably a chilling and well made horror film which is patient and unpredictable unlike most of its kind.The direction isn't up there with Alfred Hitchcock but it's a well done movie with plenty of suspenseful moments. The script is pretty ordinary but like many screenplays it has some interesting dialogue and gets the job done without being massively interesting. The acting's pretty good and the depictions of characters going mad are frightening and convincing. I guessed the twist ending before the end but it's a powerful ending which just about makes sense. There are many bits where nothing much is happening, but a lot of the time the film is pretty spooky and you never really know what's coming next. The finale is well done and is one of those watch through your fingers moments. This is an effective suspense thriller overall and good enough, but it shouldn't really be compared to Psycho. It's something France can be proud off overall and should certainly be picked over most recent horror flicks.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a great thriller! For me personally it's about 20 minutes too long. Condensed version would be more spectacular and even more enjoyable.Still, the plot of this movie is absolutely amazing!!!!! Plot really is somewhere around a 10 /10.**************SPOILER ALERT******************************************The distractions that you suspect might be the plot twist are just distractions, behind that there is another greater twist awaiting.1st distraction: "oh, how are they going to hide the murder" ; then later 2nd distraction "oh, what, did he actually survive! Wow! He is going to avenge himself!!".. And then later .. the truth is revealed and it's wow!! He was cooperating with Nicole the entire time. And it doesn't end there, because there is one final twist in the one final scene of the movie. It's ambivalent , but it could be that Mrs.Delassalle is actually alive! So yeah, great great plot!The cast was good. But it could be better I must admit. Nicole was very average. Mrs. Delassalle was average. Mr. Delassalle was pretty good. And the detective was pretty good as well. So, basically female roles could be much better. Average just doesn't cut it, when you want to make a great movie.Also, the first 20 minutes of the movie are a bit shaky. It could be so much better. The relationship between Delassalles is not well established.Then, once it starts going it is great. But it should trimmed down some 10-20 minutes. A very good movie.Real rating: 8.3</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, more suspense needed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie boasts a story with a surprising twist. I could see this formula used in later T.V. serials as a solid thrill tale.Despite this, I felt I wasn't left on edge throughout the unfolding events. Though well-written, I felt a sense of being dragged on, up until the final twist, which I honestly did not see coming. But despite the unpredictableness of the ending, I could not connect with the two leads as I was always thinking they did something wrong. They were never developed fully in the protagonists I would've liked to see, and that I have seen in other suspense thrillers.Though for its time, Diabolique enjoyed some mainstream success for being a movie of macabre (something that outside of perhaps Hitchcock films, was not something done too often). I can appreciate the movie for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic of Horror and French Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The wife of a cruel headmaster and his mistress conspire to kill him, but after the murder is committed, his body disappears, and strange events begin to plague the two women.I really feel little need to comment on this film, which has widely been seen as one of the Top 100 horror films ever made, and has been increasingly seen as one of the best films overall. IMDb (as of October 2013) has it in the #150 range, and the relatively recent Criterion special edition certainly did not hurt.The best scene happens later on, so I cannot talk about that in this review. But many good moments happen, including the wife having to identify a body as her husband's. The process is interesting and puts her in a tense position.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Clouzot suspense!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic, psychological thriller with a totally unexpected twist at the end! Diabolique, directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot, the French master of suspense, stars Michel Delassalle as Paul Meurisse, a sadistic and abusive headmaster, Vera Clouzot as Christina Delassalle, his frail, long suffering wife, and Nicole Horner as Simone Signoret, the bitter 'ex' mistress.Signoret is brilliant as Nicole; sultry, sulky and cynical; she 'chums up' with Vera in a plot to dispense with her husband, a nasty character by all accounts, for whom it is very hard to drum up any compassion. Apparently Diaboliques was the inspiration for Hitchcock's Psycho and one soon sees why. Christina and Nicole are diametrically opposite characters with only one thing in common: their hatred for the malicious and cruel Michel. Christina is decisive and clear about what 'must' be done, Nicole is beaten down, world weary and 'ill', one presumes from the emotional abuse and infidelities she has endured throughout her marriage, and 'flip flops' about their diabolical plan. In the end she is persuaded, and they lure Michel to his demise; tranquilizing and drowning him and then dumping his body in the school swimming pool. It is at this point that the plot seems to have been fulfilled and one can only wait in suspense for Michel's bloated corpse to rise to the top of the pool and for the two women to celebrate their freedom and live out the rest of their days in contentment. However, things aren't as they seem, and when reports and sightings of Michel begin, Christina becomes increasingly paranoid and appears to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Nicole has no patience for Christina's panic and anxiety and the two argue, threatening to expose each other as the perpetrator of Michel's murder. Has Michel really arisen from the dead as a taunting, vengeful ghost? Is Christina going insane? How can he possibly be alive when we saw him drowned , weighted down by a heavy object, eyeballs bulging, before he dies? And that's where the unexpected and brilliant twist comes in, which I shan't give away because I want the clever suspense and well crafted plot of Les Diaboliques to be enjoyed by all. If you love Psycho, you'll love Diaboliques and you will see why it caused such a sensation upon its release in 1955.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler? maybe...This is more of a goof on the director, then a spoiler..When the victim is on the bed, he asks his wife to remove his shoes, and we see that she does. Then Simone, as she is running the water in the bathtub, asks the wife to remove his shoes, as she is preparing to carry him into the tub. This time we don't see her doing this. When they carried him into the tub, you can see him still with the shoes on. Other than that goof, a well made suspenseful movie, that outshines Hitchcock. I think there was an American remake which fell far short of this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once in a Lifetime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Diabolique is the kind of film that one should never see more than once, and no film maker should ever try to make it again. My first viewing in the mid 1950s was a great movie experience. I was drawn to the wonderful suspenseful picture that M. Clouzot had made and was blow away by the ending. That should have been the end. Last night after more than 50 years I watched it again. Poor me. I was doomed to watch a great suspense film but I knew how it ended. There's something punishing in that. So all I could do was to be impressed with the acting, the photography, the film sets, and criticize some of its implausibility (What well- off French family would send a kid to this school? Who wouldn't want the two woman to kill off "The Head" someone without any redeeming human values? Why was the ending made so abrupt when it was the key to the picture and needed some digestion?) I must say that Mdm Clouzot's death portrayal was worth seeing again. It's better than anything James Cagney ever did. And the retired police commish could have been good for a series of about four more mysteries.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Teachers run amok</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1955 French film stars Simone Signoret, Vera Clouzot, and Paul Meurisse. It is set in a boarding school which is being run into the ground by Headmaster Michel Delassalle (Meurisse). Delasalle is married (his wife, Christina, is played by Clouzot) and has a mistress (Nicole Horner, played by Signoret) who also teaches at the school. The two other teachers at the school, the doorkeeper, the students, and sundry others can't stand the cad. Delassalle refuses to spend money on maintenance, decent food, and - horror of horrors for the French - good wine.Delassalle is a despicable lout, and his wife and mistress decide to murder him. Signoret takes the lead and comes up with a credible plan giving them an alibi, and it goes off with those little hitches that keep you on the edge of your seat as you wait for various interlopers to discover the secret in the large wicker basket.Once they've successfully carried out their plan, things go horribly wrong. The body disappears. The two murderers can't figure out where it went. Then Delassalle's suit is delivered by the dry cleaners. The two women get hints and clues, but they can't figure out who is out to blackmail them. The tension is really well done, subtly played by the actors and realistic. Signoret would have been perfect in a Hitchcock movie as the cold blooded "ice blonde" that Hitch preferred. As the tension builds, the two conspirators begin to fall to pieces and their relationship frays, then breaks. Everything that can go wrong does: a body is discovered in the Seine, but it's not Delasalle's. When Christina goes to the morgue, a detective sees her and offers to solve the missing husband case for her - and he won't take no for an answer.The three actors were excellent. Meurisse captures the cruel coldness of Delasalle with fleeting expressions across his face that told more than dialogue. Clouzot was small and weak, well-cast as the invalid wife of the headmaster. But Signoret took center stage. While Christina was mousy and dark-haired, Nicole was man-sized and blonde, had plans, and executed them. As the tension mounts and they begin bickering, their relationship takes on overtones of a married couple.The pacing of the film is decidedly Fifties, but bear with it. It soon picks up, and the relationship and tension between to two women is very well done.The plot was based on a novel, and it was later made into 1996's "Diabolique," with Sharon Stone, Isabelle Adjani, and Chazz Palminteri. I haven't seen that version. Instead, I'd recommend "Mademoiselle" with Jeanne Moreau if you like "Les diaboliques." Another teacher at a school in a small town runs amok.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The other Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were two different reasons that led me to Les Diaboliques. One, it was made by the film-maker who was called the French Hitchcock, and two, he had also made the brilliant Wages of Fear. If he was indeed their Hitchcock, this is his Vertigo. A cruel man doesn't foresee trouble coming from both his demure wife and a sultry mistress. The wife and the mistress don't foresee trouble coming from somewhere else. Like good thrillers, much of the film works on the tension that gets created in our minds. We guess every next move by the characters and invariably are left surprised by the actual outcome. For a film that is quite scary when it wants to be, not a drop of blood is spilt. An amazingly tight script keeps you missing a beat every once in a while. This is an extraordinary achievement, and even 50+ years post its release, still is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Diabolically suspenseful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henri-Georges Clouzot's "Diabolique" is a suspense film based on a novel by collaborators Boileau-Narcejac, best known for writing the novel which formed the basis for Hitchcock's "Vertigo". According to film legend, Hitchcock nearly got his hands on this property too but Clouzot beat him to it. While it's interesting to ponder how the film would have turned out in Hitch's hands there's no denying that Clouzot made the most of his material.The film revolves around a pair of women who plot to kill the man who holds a domineering influence over both of them (Paul Meurisse). The fragile wife (Véra Clouzot) doesn't have the nerve but is pressured into co-operating by the strong-willed mistress (Simone Signoret). The murder goes as planned but when the body disappears it introduces an unexpected element into the proceedings.Both actresses turn in standout performances and Meurisse makes for a fine antagonist. The supporting cast is also good but the film's main claim to fame is its twist ending. While the ending's impact has been dulled somewhat by subsequent imitations the film nevertheless maintains a high degree of suspense throughout. Clouzot's mastery of suspense rivals Hitchcock and you probably won't even realize that he's working without the benefit of a mood-enhancing score.In the end, "Diabolique" emerges as a top-notch suspense film. Even if Hitchcock had gotten his hands on the rights I don't know if he could have done any better. It's unfortunate that the big twist has lost some of its sheen over the years but the film remains thoroughly engaging even today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILER ALERT** Suffering for both psychical as well as mental abuse form her tyrannical husband Michael Deassalle, Paul Meurisse, his sensitive and very fragile, from a serious heart condition, wife Christina, Vera Clouzot, who owns that boarding school that Michael is the principal of had just about reached her breaking point. That happened when her cheap skate husband forced the students and herself to gulp down the school's lunch menu of spoiled and rotten fish that he got, who else would want it, free of charge from the local fish market. It just happened that Christina's friend Nicole Horner, Simone Signoret, a teacher at the boarding school, and Michael's former mistress, has also reached her limit in putting up with Michael's abuse. The night before Michael in one of his rare moments when he isn't drunk-and can zero in on his target-let her have it with a straight left to he head and ended up giving Nicole a king-or queen-size shiner! Nicole comes up with a plan to finally put the abusive and somewhat unstable Michael out of her-and Christina- as well as his life.Tricking Michael to come to Nicole's place in Niort, some 50 miles away from the boarding school, both Nicole and a very reluctant Christina plan to get him good and drunk on a combination of cheap wine and barbiturates and then drown him in Nicole's bathtub. It's then that the two plan to drive, with Michael's corpse, back to the Delassalle Boarding School and dump him into the school's swimming pool making it look like Mchael got himself smashed and then, being too drunk to see where he's going, fell into it and drowned himself! Everything went perfectly with Michael drowned in Nicole's bathtub and then disposed off, in the school swimming pool, but the next morning Michael's dead body that was supposed to float to the surface is nowhere to be found!Not knowing what to do in Michael being a no-show at his own murder site, the school swimming pool, both Nicole and Christina panic feeling that the very dead Michael has suddenly come back to life to exact holy revenge on them! Or in fact could it be that Michael wasn't killed at all despite being held under water for at least ten minutes by his two murderers! Still this doesn't explain how Michael could have possibly survived being at the bottom of the swimming pool for, what turned out, five whole days! It's when the pool was finally drained and Michael was nowhere to be found that the shock caused his wife Christina to suffer a massive heart-attack that laid her up in bed for almost the entire movie!***MAJOR SPOILERS*** With the former town police commissioner Alfred Fichet, Charles Vanel, showing up at the scene and offering his services to Christina free of charge, if he doesn't get results, to find her missing husband is when things really started popping in the movie. Acting like a French version, some twenty years earlier, of the famed 1970's TV detective Francis, yes that's really his first name, Columbo Fichet had a lot more on the ball then what he lead Christina as well as Nicoel on too. As it turned out the plot to murder Michael was just a cover for something far bigger and more sinister then even Christina and Nichole could have ever imagined! In both its execution and then its backfiring on those who so cleverly concocted it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Corpse Goes Missing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Meurisse runs a boarding school for boys in 1950s Paris. He's sarcastic and mean. His wife, Vera Clouzot, teaches at the school. (He beats her and rapes her.) His mistress, Simone Signoret, also teaches there, but she hates her lover. Signoret is strong willed, while Clouzot is weak, but they nevertheless join forces to dispose of their mutual tormentor, Meurisse.The two women arrange to be at Signoret's apartment in Noirt, a town hours from Paris, and taunt Meurisse into making an angry, impromptu visit. The conspirators drug him, then drown him in the bath tub. They manage to pack him into a large wicker trunk, haul him down to their car, drive back to the school, dump his corpse into the school's murky swimming pool, and show up on time for their classes.Then the problems begin. A day or two passes and -- no corpse rises to the surface. The women are forced to drain the pool on a pretext and -- nothing but leaves, algae, and mud.Strange incidents keep cropping up. The suit Paul wore is delivered from the dry cleaners but the lead is a dead end. A private investigator shows up and begins poking around. A drowned body in the Seine turns out not to be Paul, as the women had hoped. A student swears that Paul remonstrated with him and confiscated his slingshot, which later turns up in the office.Medical discretion precludes further revelations concerning the plot.It's a well-done murder mystery, full of tension and thrills, a successful commercial enterprise. Inevitably it will be compared to Hitchcock, and it should be. The story is the sort that might have attracted either of them -- murder, guilt, suspense. But the directorial styles are different, with Clouzot's being more traditional. There are few point-of-view shots, for instance. Here we see everything "objectively." The camera doesn't linger over a plate of food. We identify with none of the characters, all of whom are evil in one or another sense. And Clouzot doesn't bash anybody's MOTHER.Nice job by all concerned, including Henri Clouzot's wife, Vera. Imagine if the movie had been made by Herbert J. Yates at Republic, a guy who also insisted on starring his wife Vera.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One cannot imagine a wife (Vera Clouzot) and a mistress (Simone Signoret) knowing each other, much less plotting together to murder the husband (Paul Meurisse), who is abusive, but that is the plot of this thriller that reportedly was snatched from Hitchcock by just 30 minutes. One can imagine it might have been his greatest film, but Henri-Georges Clouzot gets that honor.It's the common case of the wife who has the money, and the abusive husband that is living off her largess, but doing his own thing (think Christie Brinkley and Peter Cook). Nicole (Signoret) is the strong one, and you might even think there are subtle lesbian intentions here. Christina (Clouzot) wavers constantly in her intentions, but a visit from Michel (Meurisse) and more abuse, firms up her resolve.They have a good plan, but something happens when they carry it out. They drown the husband in the bathtub and dump him in the school pool. When the pool is drained, no Michel! Then his suit appears from the dry cleaners. A body shows up in the river the next day.She goes to the morgue to identify him, and meets Colombo. Actually, it is Alfred Finchet (Charles Vanel), but you would swear Peter Falk stole his character from this film. It was not Michel in the morgue! How does this end? The Director requests that we not tell you. But, the last 15 minutes will astound you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinema at its best !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this classic again last night , and while I imagine most people have seen it already, I would urge anyone who hasn't to watch it and appreciate it for what it is , a true masterpiece. Based loosely on the novel "She who was no more" by Boileau- Narcejac , director Clouzot bought the rights to the novel , beating Alfred Hitchcock to it by a matter of hours , so the story goes. Of course , the story goes that they also wrote "D'entre les morts" specifically for Hitchcock , who filmed it as Vertigo. It is true that many aficionados believe that Hitch was strongly influenced and inspired by Diabolique , not least when it came to Psycho. But what the master of suspense achieved with razor-sharp edits and violins , Clouzot managed it without any fancy cutting and hardly any music. Apart from the opening score ( which includes a creepy kids chorus and shows how effective that can be ) , and a little bit of music at the end , there is hardly any music to speak of. What we are given instead , is an account of a diabolical scheme with clinical precision , a step by step storytelling with acting that make it seem real...and that's what draws you in. And this is before the tension even begins !! Perhaps it's fair to make a little comparison . The two main actresses , not those scantily clad scream queens of American or Italian horror , just a bashful Brazilian beauty and frosty 'femme francaise' ( though I must admit at this point, that I was rather surprised at how 'see-through' Chritina's night-gown is at the end of the movie). Special mention for how seriously cool Simone Signoret looks when she first appears on the screen wearing those fabulous sunglasses. She goes on to smoke Gauloises cigarettes and drink whiskey.. Not your usual Hollywood fare. The build-up in the tension/suspense is the work of genius , culminating in a climax which will send shivers down your spine. Remember , this was made in 1955 , one must take into account how 'so far ahead of its time' this film really was.I don't want to give too much away , I would hate to spoil it for anyone who has yet to see it. Instead , I'm going to finish off with a few bits of trivia regarding this film : The director , who shot on closed sets , away from all outsiders , was supposedly so sadistic that if any actor had to swallow poison in one of his films, he made them take a non-lethal dose of the real thing. Paul Meurisse , who plays the husband , had to spend an entire day in a cold bath-tub in a full suit. He also had to keep ice cubes in his mouth while filming the outdoor scenes in the dead of winter to avoid forming steam with his breath. It is rumoured that the director actually gave Chritina fish that was 'off' in order to get a realistic reaction when she ate it. Knowing all of this, it's easy to see why Simone Signoret was constantly in dispute with the director throughout the making of the movie , for various reasons , and never spoke to him again once production had wrapped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The thriller that best defines the word 'heart-pounding' ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1955, "Diaboliques" (translated as 'The Devils') has often been described as the most Hichcockian non-Hitchcock feature film: this assessment is flattering as long as it doesn't diminish the directorial talent of Henri-George Clouzot.It's true that Henri-George Clouzot's psychological thriller features several archetypes that cemented the legend of the droll-profile director. Much more, with a dead man in a bathtub (no spoiler, here), a plot focusing less on the crime committed than its mysterious aftermath, a palpable sexual tension and a spectacular twist ending, the film has the most comparable plot to "Psycho". However, the comparison overlooks that Clouzot was already considered a master in the mystery and thriller genre, to which "Diaboliques" blends both elements. His heart-pounding "Wages of Fear" had already chilled the spine of viewers in all over the world. So, no matter how close "Diaboliques" is to "Psycho", it still was the first comer? and in fact, without "Diaboliques", there wouldn't be "Psycho". Legend had it that Clouzot bought the rights of the novel written by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac a few hours before Hitch. Granted he was already an iconic director, there are chances that without "Psycho", everyone would have praised "Diaboliques" as the most suspenseful and horrific thriller ever instead of any Hitchcock's film, so it's very probable that the Master of Suspense took the case personally. Then "Diaboliques" made a sensation in the United States, became the favorite film of Robert Block, who wrote "Psycho" for Hitch, the rest is history. Using a shower instead of a bathtub, the film borrows many elements from "Diaboliques" including as spectacular climax: Clouzot's thriller is infamous for its anti- spoiler message at the end, begging the viewers not to be devilish and reveal the ending. But the interest of "Diaboliques" doesn't rely on the ending only; the film opens with an intriguing set of relationships that confine to 'triangular hatred'. Vera Clouzot is Christina, a frail, sickly and insecure brunette, wife of Michel Delasalle, the headmaster of a Provincial boarding school, played by the great Paul Meurisse, a tyrant with both kids and the teachers and a bully with his wife: the only area where she can control him is financial, she owns the school. There is the obligatory mistress, played by Simone Signoret, who's everything Christina is not: blonde, sexy and commanding. In this masterstroke of casting it's easy to see in the contrast between the two women, the roots for a genuine attraction, Signoret becomes 'manly' with Christina while Christina is totally passionless regarding her marriage. The talent of Clouzot is to keep a cloud of ambiguity floating within the main atmosphere, thanks to a convincing yet misleading characterization. Vera Clouzot might not be the greatest actress of her era, only remembered for her roles in "Diaboliques" and "Wages of Fear", she magnificently transcends her limited range into one of the most memorable and poignant movie performances with her constant nervousness, accent, and petite frame, towered by Meurisse who's described as a 5'7'' tall man, the typical mistreated woman. When she consents to help Nicole in the murder of her husband with Nicole, the plan itself might be "diabolique" but I refused to tag Christina with such an epithet, because after the murder is committed, the film climbs the ladder from a simple thriller to a masterpiece of horror and mystery.Indeed, never has the word 'heart pounding' been so fitting to describe a thriller. In "Diaboliques", Christina suffers from a heart condition, which ironically meets reality because the real actress died five later of a heart attack. But this device plays a pivotal role in the way her body responses to a series of strange occurrences ensuing the murder. All through the film, the mystery suggests a sort of devilish presence, starting with a body dropped in the swimming pool waiting to float and make it appear like an accident, then disappearing, a silhouette in a photograph's background. The feeling of a set-up, intended to drive Cristina into madness, reminds of another Hitchcockian non-Hitchcock classic: "Gaslight", but with a darker undertone, more macabre, indeed more devilish.I wouldn't go further, out of respect to Clouzot who made his wish explicit at the end of the film, hoping no one would see the film after the dreadful remake, because 80% of the legend -not the quality- that elevated "Diaboliques" to its iconic status, depends on the gripping climax and the heart-pounding four minutes before. But there is much more to say about the film, in terms of entertainment. Many philosophical words are used to describe Clouzot's films: existential, pessimistic, nihilistic etc. I suspect the man was beyond labels, and more eager to create sensational films. He was a craftsman of cinematic experiences, providing the right levels of emotions with never being their slave. Clouzot's films always featured a gallery of colorful characters, whom the viewers could identify with, and "Diaboliques" is no exception: Pierre Larquay, the elderly teacher, a young Michel Serrault, George Poujouly, the kid from "Forbidden Games", Noël Roquevert and on the top of all, the scene-stealing performance of Charles Vanel as Inspecteur Fichet. Coming from nowhere, Vanel is the man who asks the questions with the nonchalance of the friendly routine-guy while his tendency to forget the questions hides his real goal which is to confront the people with their own contradictions. As small as it was, Fichet inspired one of the most beloved TV characters: "Columbo", another reason to thank Clouzot for "Diabioliques".So, if you're a fan of "Columbo", of "Hitchcock", of French cinema, of movies with twist endings, there's no excuse not to see "Diaboliques", one of the best thrillers ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considered a Horror Film, in the Hitchcock mode, has been imitated and ripped-off so many times by now that the unfolding suspense is lessened by now familiar Plot devices, therefore Today, the Surprise Ending will seem familiar, although the Denouement has a few Shots of creative, Cutting-Edge Cinema.The Movie does contain certain realism and reflection of Social and Cultural behavior that was not evident in Mainstream American Cinema for Years.Quite well Acted, however the Children's School is a poor choice for the Setting and is a distraction. Presented with very little Style, until the last Reel, it may not hold up enough for anyone except Film Buffs and Foreign Fans. Sadly, the passage of time and loving, emulating admiration ends up, ironically, leaving this ground-breaker as somewhat of a letdown to some.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very unique but dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Diabolique is a very interesting story, a very interesting idea. It reminds me of another film with a similar premise. Who knows if one inspired the other. Another interesting item to note is Simone Signoret's costume and hairstyle. At the beginning of the film we see her with cropped, bleached blond hair, dark sunglasses even indoors and fairly fashionable clothing. It reminded me of seeing Shelly Winters is some publicity photos.The acting isn't perfect though. At times it seems amateurish or maybe not quite thought out. There is a hesitancy with one of the lead characters that doesn't seem so much the character but the actress herself. And some of the dialog seems very outdated. In fact, a lot of the film seems outdated. I wouldn't dismiss this film at all. As I said before it is very unique but I honestly feel that many people will be put off by the age of the film. The fact that much of it is really rather slow and some of it just hasn't aged well at all. It feels creaky. If you are a fan of older, black &amp; white films you'll probably enjoy this but if more modern films with a polished feel and chase scenes are more your style, I'd skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It says on the DVD that I bought that this is a classic, so I thought it was about time I gave this a try. And boy, it certainly didn't disappoint!I usually only know this kind of nail biting suspense throughout the entire movie from Hitchcock thrillers, but director Clouzot could not have done a better job!This is high tension suspense pure! The viewer - although aware, of course, that killing is a bad thing - finds himself cheering the cruel headmaster's wife and his mistress on as they go about killing him. After all, it does seem like a "good cause". And just as one believes to understand what is going on, the rules of the game change, and one anxiously wonders what turn of events is waiting around the next corner till the very end!An absolute masterpiece, with a brilliant little twist at the end. One cannot do better for a suspense thriller.But be warned - nothing for weak hearts!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story opens in a run-down French boys' school, where the cruel headmaster has made life unbearable for his fragile wife and his mistress (Simone Signoret), both of whom are teachers. The ladies decide to join forces and kill him over a long holiday weekend and their plan goes well...until his body goes missing.This is a very intense and spooky murder mystery that kept me guessing until the wonderfully satisfying end. The actors are all excellent and there is a good contrast between the weakling wife and the domineering mistress. The innocence of the school setting, a couple of humorous male teachers, and a persistent detective add to the mix.Filmed in black and white (mostly black shadows) and in French with English subtitles, this is an excellent film noir that will keep you on the edge of your seat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thriller-drama with something extra.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like so very often is the case with older movies, the second half of the movie is so much better than the first one.The movie begins kind of slow but once the mystery and more thriller elements start to kick in the movie becomes so much better to watch. It actually becomes a tense and effectively mysterious one. It's a movie with a nice story, that provides the movie with some surprises and an end twist.Most people seem to love this movie because of its end twist. But I wasn't too fond of it though. In my opinion it was just too far fetched and it kind of ruined some of the other elements and plot-points of the movie, that it established earlier on. Sometimes movies have twists just for the sake of having them, without taking into consideration anything that got set up earlier. To me this movie was kind of being that way.But it obviously didn't ruin the movie for me. It remains a very effective and well done French film. Still I would had been very interested in seeing Alfred Hitchcock's version of this movie. He lost out the rights of the novel to the film-makers of this movie but it's seriously a type of story that would had suited his special style of suspenseful film-making. Who knows, perhaps it would had made an even better movie.But nevertheless, this remains one fine done and surprising genre movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly perfect horror/thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fed up with the way their man has been treating them, the wife, Christina (Véra Clouzot), and mistress, Nicole (Simone Signoret), plot together to murder the cruel headmaster, Michel (Paul Meurisse), of a boarding school who has been abusing the women in each of their relationships. Things get complicated (and spooky) when the headmaster's body disappears and people begin to see him around town.Les Diaboliques is, simply, one of the best films you'll ever see, and I believe it's one of only four films I'd consider to be perfect (along with Night of the Living Dead, Halloween, and Psycho). From the beginning, you know it's something special. It goes beyond the typical mystery. . . because, it's not really a 'mystery' until about halfway through. We see the deed done. . . but it's the aftermath of the deed itself that creates the suspense and mystery. And once that suspense starts, especially as the 'sightings' move in closer to the women, it's almost impossible to look away for fear you might miss Delassalle hiding in the background waiting for them. Even I became paranoid to the point where each of the 'fake Michel' shots had me on the edge of my seat. As far as technical film-making goes, the film is shot beautifully and really delights the eyes, especially (for me) the outdoor scenes at the school. The acting is superb, especially Charles Vanel as the wily investigator. And, while the film is slow (as many great mysteries are), it's never dull or boring. Beyond this. . . I'm not entirely sure how to describe a film that's perfect. . . once that's said, nothing really needs to be said past it.Final verdict: 10/10. See it, be amazed at it, but... BE QUIET ABOUT IT!

		<shortDescription>Brutally scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a novel by the same authors who were also adapted for Vertigo, this is a dark, scary, and deadly serious thriller with oodles of suspense and a heart-stopping ending. The plot is laid out simply, and it progresses quickly; the tension is soon amped up as the mystery deepens. There's no hint of irony or comedy in its tone; the brutal events and actions are depicted with unflinching solemnity. Its supernatural qualities grow as the story unfolds, but the ending ties all the loose ends up and ends on a distinctly depressing note. Even the final scene, returning some of the mystery with a hint of ambiguity, cannot lift this film's spirits up.I found the macabre tone a bit off-putting at times, but its manner of storytelling and horrific tale cannot be overlooked. The last five minutes or so are truly terrifying, and I would've liked more of that pure horror throughout, but the use of suspense is just as effective. The slow psychological breakdown of the main character is portrayed well, if not too subtly, and the horrific climax is the perfect scene to top it off. I also would've liked a bit more style and expressionism to the camera work and production design, as they utilize the same brutal realism that the plot does, but they are effective nonetheless.A must-see for fans of Hitchcock and horror nuts especially.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This superb psychological thriller ranks right up there with the best of Alfred Hitchcock. Someone posted that Hitchcock tried to get the rights to the story, but Clouzot had already snagged them. Bravo, Monsieur! The story was right up Hitchcock's alley, but I doubt he could have done any better with it than Clouzot does. What makes this film so extraordinary is the ORDINARINESS of the setting, a grim boarding school in the perpetually grey and rainy French countryside, and the everyday naturalness of the characters.Nothing is exaggerated or over-the-top and the cast behaves like regular folks, not movie stars. The banality of these people and their workplace makes the violent story chillingly believable. A big-budget Hitchcock version may have had trouble achieving this believability, if cast with movie stars like Grace Kelly modeling the latest Hollywood fashions, make-up, and hairstyles. (This Hollywood glossiness has made, say, REAR WINDOW date more than it should have.) Simone Signoret drips Star Quality, yet she's still very credible as a provincial schoolteacher. Meurisse makes a fine abusive husband, never becoming too melodramatic. And Vera Clouzot is touchingly effective as his submissive, mistreated wife.Recommend this movie to your friends but DON'T ruin the surprises for them. As with PSYCHO, the film is most enjoyable when you see it for the first time without knowing what's going to happen next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely riveting suspense thriller with plot twists I bet made Hitchcock envious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually avoid going into plot details in my reviews, mainly because you can easily find one on the film's main details page. However, I'm going to be extra careful to give away the plot for this film. Just like "Psycho", "The Usual Suspects", and "Audition", the less you know going into this one, the better. "Diabolique" is full of unpredictable plot twists, especially the memorable denouement. Its clearly influenced by Hitchcock, but much darker and misanthropic than anything the master had made at that point. In some ways, I wouldn't be surprised if this influenced his later work (particularly "Psycho").This is one of those rare films where all the elements are perfect and come together to form an absolutely riveting motion picture. The direction by Henri-Georges Clouzot alternates between a quick and slow pace when needed to convey the dramatic effect perfectly. The man knows how to build tension to nail-biting heights. Even though its fifty years old, "Diabolique" is still very suspenseful, more so than many of Hollywood's recent gimmicky and manipulative entries into the thriller genre.The screenplay is also very impressive. Despite the constant plot twists, the film never becomes unbelievable or dumb. Its written with a degree of intelligence absent from many other thrillers. The characters have complex emotional dilemmas which is even furthered by the superb acting. Simone Signoret combines the right amount of toughness with slight repressed sexuality to make a memorably snide character. Véra Clouzot is very sympathetic despite her actions (not to mention breathtakingly beautiful). And even though his role is rather brief if important, Paul Meurisse plays one of cinema's most despicable and abusive characters. Hes perfect at creating a character with seemingly no redeeming qualities. "Diabolique" is an influential and still tense masterpiece. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dark, Cozy Shocker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing about Les Diaboliques is that it really knows how to surprise. It begins where one doesn't expect a thriller to take place, a strict, repressive boarding school for boys, and leads to an intricate murder plot, then leads to surprise after surprise, all of which surrender any predictions. The movie is not only a fantastic suspense labyrinth but also a very direct film, opening and closing with disclaimers stressing to us to keep secret the film that we see, an interesting device I've never seen before, something that enforces the mystery and secrecy that fuels the themes of the story.The cozily stationary and careful direction of H.G. Clouzot stands by the brilliant performance of his wife, Vera Clouzot, whose juxtaposition of weakness and intensity is overwhelming, especially in contrast to Simone Signoret's stoic, cool, almost butch portrayal. Paul Meurisse is a great highlight of the cast as the sadistic school master, very easily hated. A good companion piece to Clouzot's earlier helming of greatly effective suspense, The Wages of Fear, it is certainly not as well paced and not as moving, but it's also got a much cozier and darker atmosphere, a truly unpredictable story, and a chilling tongue tapping against its cheek.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The key to this movie's effect on the viewer is by dint of the expectations established early on. It appears flat and stagy, uncinematic... Harmless...nothing to contend with...you're lulled into submission. That's when it grabs hold and pulls you under the surface.Most of these things rely on switcheroos and double crosses. You know they're on the way, so they tend to disappoint at the end...you often walk away scoffing. But this one is different. What makes it work is the layered noir construction: that we get one level of intrigue, wrapped within a larger one. But both of those are wrapped within the envelope of the film, a feature, which by itself, is critical. All of these layers play with us as much as they play with the characters within.And... Wrapped around all of that is the realization that the 'end' is not the end, as acknowledged by the written 'P.S.' message to us.</fullReview>

Most of the people who review this movie don't seem to understand what it is about. It is not a horror flick, as many claim. Pure and simple it is a murder mystery, and the best i have ever seen. Hitchcock is the master mystery director. In my view his best was "Psycho". However, "Diabolique" is at another level. What made "Psycho" great was that it used many of the plot and cinematic effects of "Diabolique". Did Hitchcock ever acknowledge Clouzot's contribution? I also think that "Diabolique" was Simone Signoret's best work, of course most critics would strongly disagree.The 90's remake was a travesty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Distinctly Good French Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Diabolique" is a wonderful film in terms of tight suspense, atmospheric camerawork (at times sweeping and ominous, at times clipped and jarring) and a shocking, twisted climax. It is admirable in many other respects; interesting though bizarre characterizations, a double-edged performance by Simone Signoret as Mademoiselle Horner, and many deliciously shot scenes. But though this is a great suspense film, I very much object to director Clouzot being hailed as "the French Alfred Hitchcock", and I imagine that Clouzot would be indignant as well. Though both brilliant, both of these artists have styles, techniques and even basic plots that are extremely distinct from one another. Hitchcock almost never introduced a "surprise ending" to his films, and his techniques of suspense require the audience to know everything the protagonists don't know. This, as anyone who watches "Diabolique" will soon see, is NOT the case with Clouzot. The French director relies on the viewer's uncertainty to stimulate his or her fears. Still, "Diabolique" is a terrific film, though no rival to Hitchcock's very best, and Clouzot clearly displays his virtuosity as a cinematic artist.</fullReview>

The theater manager must have been a real film buff, since he "contributed" to one of the scariest scenes of the film. Near the end, there is a scene at the climax of a long, suspenseful investigation by the wife of the schoolmaster - she has heard mysterious noises in the deserted rooms, through long, dim, creaky corridors in the school building. At this point in the film, the lights in the schoolroom go out. Just at that point, the manager had the projectionist turn off all the house lights (dim as they were), as well! The effect instantly immersed everyone right into the scene! I remember many people yelling . . . I believe I was too frightened to make a sound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The were several possible solutions which occurred to me. One of them was as filmed. Another was the obvious ghost solution.But another possibility was that the body was actually found and quietly reported to the police. Then the ex-commissioner set a trap for the two women, who were obvious suspects because of the abuse. The traps the police used to check the ID of the naked body seemed to support this. It could have easily been the ex-commissioner who had the suit dry-cleaned and sent to the women. It was obvious that the suit was meant to scare the women. And he finally did get a confession, though his reaction showed that this wasn't the solution chosen.SPOILER: Actually, the movie's solution has a flaw, since it depends on the wife not checking that he is really dead, something they could not be certain of.The best part was at the very end, where it seems clear that the wife isn't really dead, and is giving payback. I hope she succeeds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Les Diaboliques is amongst the greatest thrillers of all time without a doubt, right up there with Psycho, Rear Window and Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?. Set and made in France in the 1950's, no other director but Henri-Georges Clouzot himself could have done better, not even the master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock, who intended on making this film via the novel.Although I did see the 1996 remake first starring Sharon Stone as Nicole and Isabelle Adjani as Mia (Christina in the 1955 version), no one can quite describe the magic this film had in comparison to the remake. The evil atmosphere, the foreign feel, the setting and time it was made make this film so enjoyable to watch. It has wonderful scenery and really fine interior settings.If anything I noticed, it was the amazing lack of music which caused heavy suspense and scares one at moments due to the silent vibes, thus creating almost a realistic feel of being there at the time the character is wandering down dark hallways and through spooky rooms at night. Another thing that stands out is the incredibly amazing cinematography. The art and picture quality used in this film is fantastic, not to mention the fact that this film is in black and white causing more of a spooky atmosphere.Acting and character from actress Simone Signoret is amazing. Her character is very mysterious and yet we get to know who she is and what she is like about twenty minutes into the film. Her character is very likable and has its humorous moments, how her character does not care, how her character hides herself up so well. Her acting is superb and almost masterful.The time I waited to see Les Diaboliques was worth it, making this film more than just another movie I bought from the store, but a masterpiece, a classic in film history. Let it be known that Les Diaboliques is one of the most masterful crafted films ever to be made and one day may its superb elements influence hundreds of directors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With "Les Diaboliques",Clouzot offered his beautiful and gifted wife, Mrs. Véra Clouzot,and also Charles Vanel and Mrs. Signoret,an imperishable aesthetic existence.This film is one of the finest instances of a director coming with the right stuff at the right time--making an astonishing masterpiece exactly when he was expected to do it--not out of the blue,not unawares--but a purposeful and deliberate and expected for masterpiece.(To give here only 3 examples:Jean Renoir with The River (1951) ,The Golden Coach ,French Cancan (1954) and Elena and Her Men ;Marcel Carné with Children of Paradise and Juliette Ou La clef Des Songes ;Robert Bresson with Au Hasard Balthazar (1966),Mouchette (1967) ,many others;etc.,etc., etc., etc..But I do not wish to seem to imply that this case is exceptional;many examples could be further given:all the great ones, Bergman,Bunuel, Fellini,Mihalkov, Kitano,Tarkovski,etc.).In other words,these are all instances of directors unvanquished by their previous glory and who continued making masterpieces after they became famous.They knew how to score.The glory did not spoil them."Les Diaboliques" is one of the best,the most perfect movies I've ever seen.Clouzot,the script,the dialogs,the cast,the cinematography,everything is hugely entertaining.Mrs. Signoret is one of the best and finest actresses that ever lived and worked (I share this passion with my mother!),and an ideal cast.Peter Falk,doing his "Columbo",looks almost as if he is a Vanel--wanna-be.Everything is there,in Vanel's Fichet,and Vanel does not need tens of episodes to draw his policeman Falk is good and amusing,etc.,but Vanel did it first,and with genius.Among the most alive policeman roles in movies' history!Mrs. Clouzot is also thrilling to watch,a very accomplished actress....And Clouzot,what a power,what a strength!I would rather see 45 times a Mrs. Signoret movie,than 45 Mrs. Stone movies!(It looks like Mrs. Stone did appear in 70 movies,till now!)I see "Les Diaboliques" was given a weighted average vote of 8.4 / 10. Totally unfair and wrong.(Also,there are only 68 comments, fewer that I expected.A shameful bluff like "Vertigo" has 387 comments !And that "Marnie",106 comments !And even ..."Frenzy",102 comments !)As far as the suspenseful sinister ,the frankness and the mysteries are concerned,"Les Diaboliques" is,indeed,related to writers such as Balzac,Barbey d'Aurevilly and the Barbey d'Aurevilly-minded M. Caragiale;that is,the French and French-minded school of mystery.(Barbey d'Aurevilly was highly appreciated by M. Caragiale,RL Stevenson, Bloy,Bernanos). Is it legitimate to make connections between the film's aesthetics,and literature's?Cosasu,at least,did it all the time.In '93,I was thrilled by two French movies.One of them was "Martin Roumagnac" (by Lacombe),and the other was ..."The Wages of Fear ",made by the same Henri-Georges Clouzot and starring Yves Montand and ...Charles Vanel (that is "Alfred Fichet" from "Les Diaboliques").It looks like the 50's were Henri-Georges Clouzot's decade in the French cinema!(In the '50s,3 years after Clouzot,Hitchcock did also a movie based on a Boileau-Narcejac novel;oh,it is in so many ways inferior to "Les Diaboliques"!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What started out being a mild drama mystery, turned into a horrible murder mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was intrigued by the title when I first saw this movie. At first I thought the acting good and the story a mystery drama. There was plot changes that did not change that did not make the movie less enjoyable, but it took mystery to another level. I enjoyed how the movie challenged my loyalty to the characters. Even the ending which I thought vague, left the ending up to the viewer,a nd left the door open for a sequel which I am surprised no one has attempted to film. The detective role was excellent, even the role of the children added to the suspense of the film. Of all the remake of films this is one that I feel could stand up to being an excellent film on it's own without standing on the reputation of the original film. There have been remakes of the original film, but none which measure up to the quality of the original for me. The title alone gives me chills. The first time I watched this film I thought the first 1/3 of the film was rather mild for such a terrible title, but by the end of the movie it had earned it's title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic suspense film from Clouzot "the French Hitchcock"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Diaboliques, Les (known in the US as Diabolique or also The Devils) is one of the greatest suspense films.The acting is solid.Paul Meurisse plays Michel Delasalle a nasty head master of a boys school. He abuses his wife Christina (Vera Clouzot - wife of the director in real life.). Simone Signoret plays Nicole Horner a teacher at the school. Charles Vanel steals the movie as Alfred Fichet a private detective. Vera Clouzot is beautiful as the abused wife and Simone Signoret is also good as her friend.Made in 1955 it was directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot. His films are similar to Alfred Hitchcock's and he was known as "the French Hitchcock." Clouzot barely beat out Hitch for the rights to The Pierre Boileau novel upon which Dialbolique is based. Hitchcock considered Clouzot a rival and partially made Psycho in order to top Dialbolique. Unfortunately, Clouzot had ill health which diminished his film output. Another great Clouzot film is Wages of Fear (Salaire de la peur, Le (1953) which was remade as Sorcerer by William Friedman. The movie is subtitled but don't let that put you off. You will recognize many scenes in this movie that have been copied over and over in suspense films. This is a film you can see many times and enjoy. By all means avoid the remake of the movie with Sharon Stone which is terrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>outstanding thriller, with minor flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a wonderful thriller about an abused wife and a mistreated mistress who team up to kill the brutal husband. Their plot at first seems like a perfect crime, but then complications start appearing. From the start, the wife's remorse risks revealing the crime, particularly after an inspector shows up. Then the husband's corpse disappears. The mystery and tension build up through the entire film, all the way to the conclusion.The flaws are quite minor, because they don't detract from the suspense at all. One problem is that the ending was a bit too abrupt. An extra minute or two of denouement would have helped.Another problem is that a few early clues in the movie were presented in a way that went a bit too far in misdirecting viewers away from the correct conclusion. A good mystery needs some red herrings, but one should have a bit more chance of recognizing them as misdirection. It would be an inexcusable spoiler to reveal the false clues, avoiding spoilers makes it difficult to explain which clue I mean to those who have seen the movie.A nice touch at the end of the movie is that it has a request on screen asking viewers not to reveal the movie's secrets to people who haven't seen it. It is said to be the first movie to have included such a request.I saw the Criterion DVD version. I'm pleased they selected it, because that's one thing that led me to watch the movie. In spite of the minor flaws I noted, the movie is a suspense classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots to offer for suspense buffs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Les Diaboliques is not only a classic of the genre, it is the blueprint from which so many of today's suspense films use as a guide. Even the great Alfred Hitchcock was inspired by this macabre masterpiece from French director Henri Clouzot. I just finished watching the Criterion DVD of this gem and, although it is not as pristine as some other Criterion offerings, it does represent the best quality you are likely to find of this better than 40-year-old film.There are three reference standard items to watch for in this film. Naturally, the ending is what garners the most attention and the fact that Clouzot originated the idea of asking his audience not to reveal it to other would-be filmgoers. But, the cinematography used here is excellent in all its black and white glory. The opening credit sequence with raindrops splashing on the pavement in the background is captivating. The third item to watch for is the portrayal of the police inspector. Not only is it an uncanny resemblance to Peter Falk in his Columbo character -- this is in fact the very character that inspired Columbo and his idiosyncracies (ie. rumpled look, cigar, seemingly distracted manner).Most people who are students of film or just plain looking for a good suspense flick will not be disappointed in this landmark feature. Don't even think about confusing this with the 90's schlock attempted copy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the roles that Georges Clouzot had his wife Vera play here and in "The Wages of Fear", where her downtrodden character is painfully abused and exploited in just about every scene she's in, I have to wonder just what their home relationship was like. I don't know what she played in GC's "Les Espions", but she doesn't seem to have worked with any other director. There is a very real sadism to "Les Diaboliques"; the merciless twisting of the screws is shown head on, without respite, which makes watching it riveting, but also apalling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You don't have to know anything about film to appreciate this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite simply put, this is one of the best movies ever made. Im not a film expert and i don't know all the fancy terms or technical jargon, I've never taken a film appreciation class or gone to a movie premier. But with this movie, none of that really matters. When i watch movies, very rarely do any emotions manifest themselves physically, and never from horror films. This was different. I was more horrified, disturbed, and awe stricken by this than any other movie. Goosebumps, raised hair, at the climax i actually had to get up and walk around. I was absolutely astounded that a movie could affect me that way. I found this movie interesting from the beginning definition of "les diaboliques" as "little devils," up until the ending. The ending. That fantastically astounding, genius, breathtaking, work of art ending.Whats surprising about this film is the quality of the (special) effects for 1955. If it was made again today there is not one thing i would change about it. Great acting, writing, directing, lighting, scenery, you name it. I love Hitchcock but even his movies have not managed to thrill me like this has, and when i think of Hitchcock i think old, classic movies. This is not a classic, it is timeless, untouched by the gimmicky film effects of the time.You don't have to like old movies to like this. You don't have to like black and whites, or foreigns. You don't have to like reading subtitles. If you like movies, if you watch movies, you will like this one. If it sounds like I'm trying to get you to watch this, its because i am. I have been using IMDb for years, and this is the first review I've ever written. I love this movie so much i felt obligated to review it in hopes to influence at least one person to experience it. This is hands down the best movie I've ever rented. If you watch it, do so alone, and in the dark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic suspense; absolutely riveting story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Les Diaboliques is pure brilliance. Rarely have I ever been so tense in my life. This film is definitely one that must be watched alone and in the dark. It's chilling, especially due to the brilliant cinematography and the beautiful black and white which makes the film extra eerie. Although some of the acting could be a tad overdone, there really isn't anything to complain about in that department.The story is about a Headmaster, Delasalle (Paul Meurisse) and his wife (Vera Clouzot) and mistress (Simone Signoret) looking for a way out of his tyranny. So they both create a plot to murder him.This isn't the type of thriller that involves things jumping out at you followed by loud bangs of music. This is all about the unexpected. There are scenes where I was holding my breath and clenching the couch in nervous tension. When nothing seemed to happen I felt relived, then I saw something and it hit me and scared the hell out of me. And nothing will prepare anyone for the shocker of an ending. I was literally blown away, it was huge and extremely scary.5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Impact of Horror Films on Bathing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The very best really artistic horror film ever. I saw Diabolique on a double date at the Larkin Theatre on a rainy night in San Franciso in '55, while I was at Cal Berkeley. We got into the lobby just before the showing ended. It was the last film I ever saw (if not the last ever) where the ushers (remember them?) enforced a "no one will be seated 15 minutes before the end" rule (in those days you could go in at any time). I remember hearing the screams from the audience from behind the closed doors, and their shaken looks when they exited. Actually, when we were seeing it, about 15 minutes before the end our dates were seated in our laps! Which was great. The only thing was I couldn't go into the bathroom at my dorm alone for the next week. Then, in 1960, to make it worse, Psycho was released, and I couldn't take a shower for a long time. I played Diabolique for my three kids on a Halloween (about 30 years later) and I don't have to tell you what happened. Then Jaws came along . . . If you haven't seen Diabolique, you are in for a real treat, and a really classy scare. See it alone with someone you love (or whatever). The Old Blue Buff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movies don't get much better than this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- I've seen Les Diaboliques with its very high rating on IMDb for a few years. But I thought to myself, it can't be that good - it's French. I finally gave it a chance. How wrong was I? I've never been more happy with a blind purchase in my life.- Michel Delasalle (Paul Meurisse) is the headmaster of an all-boys school. He's an abusive person to both his wife (Vera Clouzot - the director's wife) and his mistress (Simone Signoret) - both of whom work at the school. The wife and mistress decide they can't take it anymore and hatch a plot to kill Michel. The plan is carried out and the body is placed where it can be found. The problem is no one finds the body. It's gone. Things turn from bad to worse (and more horrifying) when students begin reporting that they have seen Michel roaming through the school. Any more of the story would be far too much.- I do my best not to rate a movie 10/10 after a first viewing. But every once in a while, I stumble upon a real classic that I can't help but call perfect. The acting is very impressive, especially Vera Clouzot as the fragile wife. I felt every emotion she expressed. The plot is fantastic. Even though I figured out what was going to happen, it didn't matter. The movie is so well written that it was just a joy to watch it unfold. The sets are about the best I've seen. Everything looked just as I would expect from a French movie made so close to end of the war. Nothing was changed to make things look "pretty". It's dirty and it works. I could go on and on like this, but you get the idea.- Clouzot has been called the "French Hitchcock" and it's easy to see why. He handles a movie with Hitchcockian type themes as well as Hitchcock might have himself. His decision to allow the movie the time necessary to build atmosphere and to allow the audience to get to know the characters is something I find sorely missing in many of today's movies.- I highly recommend this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THE REMAKE!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Les Diabloiques is perhaps the finest of the film noir genre. Simone Signoret is best remembered for her femme fatale role in this stylish, suspenseful film. Henri-Georges Clouzot beat out none other than Alfred Hitchcock for the rights to the novel from which Les Diaboliques was adapted (by Clouzot). Hitchcock could scarcely have done better with the material.Above all, however, I would urge people to see this original version and NOT the 1996 American remake with Sharon Stone taking on Signoret's role. If you have seen the remake but not the original, please go back and see how good this film was with Clouzot's masterful script and direction and shot in glorious black &amp; white. A comparison of the two provides a wonderful illustration of how the script, while certainly of great importance, is not the final determining factor on how a film turns out. Direction and acting make all the difference here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Classic Shocker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac novel CELLE QUI N'ETAIT PLUS, Henri-Georges Clouzot's 1955 DIABOLIQUE is easily among the most influential films of world cinema, leaving its mark on everything from Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO and PSYCHO to William Castle's THE TINGLER--but even so, and while Hitchcock's masterpieces can be said to at least equal the Clouzot original, few if any of the films spawned by DIABOLIQUE ever bested it.Variously known as DIABOLIQUE, LES DIABOLIQUES, and THE DEVILS, the film presents a complex story. Christina Delasalle (Vera Clouzot, wife of director Henri-Georges Clouzot), is a remarkably beautiful and considerably wealthy woman who has the misfortune to suffer from delicate health, personal timidity, and brutish husband Michel (Paul Meurisse.) The two operate a boys' school that Christina owns, and among the teachers is hard-nosed Nicole Horner (Simone Signoret), who has become Michel's mistress but who finds Michel every bit as unpleasant as wife Christina.An unlikely alliance springs up between the two women, and together they conspire to murder Michel and thereafter run the school for themselves. But although the murder seems to go as planned, the body goes missing, and the two women suddenly find themselves taunted by mysterious notes and strange happenings. Has Michel survived the attempt on his life? Or has the murder been discovered and the stage is being set for blackmail?In the wake of DIABOLIQUE's international success, the story has been told in so many variations that many may consider the original has lost some of the shock value it possessed when it first debuted, but even so the film has much to offer. This is particularly true in terms of style and performances. Director Clouzot endows the film with a sense of visual decay and a near-documentary tone that merge to create one of the most chilling atmospheres ever captured on screen. While Signoret's performance of the angry mistress is the more widely celebrated, she is equaled by Vera Clouzot, who has the more complex role and whose performance must carry the weight of the film's most disturbing moments; together they create a truly remarkable synergy of the most lethal kind.I have seen DIABOLIQUE in several different releases, and while the Criterion DVD is somewhat glitchy it is easily the best version available; one should avoid all other releases, particularly the truly atrocious release by Madacy. Strongly recommended, particularly to fans of internation cinema and classic suspense.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently Hitchcock tried to buy the rights for this film after reading the book it is based off of, and as prestigious as Hitchcock is, it's hard to imagine it would be any better than this.The plot is rather simple. Two women, one in an abusive relationship, Christina Delasalle, and one who used to be with the same man, Nicole Horner, attempt to murder the abusive husband, Michel Delasalle. But these murderers aren't cold people, or at least Christina isn't, and if she was, then there would be no tension. Nicole on the other hand, is a bit more mysterious. She is separated from Christina by poles and many other environmental objects in the shots early in the film, but as it progresses Christina begins to trust her a bit more. And so do we. But strange occurrences begin to happen, and as the guilt and paranoia begins to nag at Christina, we begin to feel the same sense of paranoia. Subtle things will happen in this film just to throw you off, even for a second. Such as holding a shot for just a little too long, or switching to another unrelated group of people walking by. And when I say this film constantly keeps you guessing, I mean that. Just when you think you've figured out what's going on, it will send you down another long winding road quickly. Even after the film is practically over (after one of the most suspenseful and surprising endings of all time), the VERY last shot of the film ends on a rather ambiguous note.</fullReview>

I really liked how the two women set up the murder than get into a conflict, how Véra Clouzot's character is slowly getting insane and not to forget the retired inspector's role.

		<shortDescription>Clouzot's Murder-Gone-Ghastly Thriller is A Diabolical Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Diabolique, character and circumstance come together in a twisted concoction more sulphurous than anything ever crafted. The movie is a skillful marriage of ingredients that tread dangerously close to the edge of reasoning while still absorbing them in impeccable artistic standards. The Delasalle Boarding School is one of those provincial French boarding schools where the children of the rich get packed off for months of unenthusiastic instruction, sketchy and arbitrarily stern discipline, and even sketchier meals. Running the place is headmaster Michel (Paul Meurisse), a foul, mean-spirited, cold-eyed bastard of a fellow who cares for his put-upon, mousy wife Christina (Vera Clouzot) even less than the students unfortunate enough to be left to his care. Christina is a sickly, quiet presence who seems to live only to be tormented by Michel. Given that he sees himself as the absolute master of this small realm, Michel thinks nothing of the fact that he's openly carrying on an affair with one of the teachers ? Nicole (Simone Signoret). Although Nicole suffers Michel's advances and occasional beatings at night, she is also Christina's only support and solace as they commiserate about Michel's animalistic nature and near-constant put-downs. Everything seems to be set up for one of those ghastly little psychological tales, when - Bing! -the mischief begins.First off, the wife and the mistress conspire to dispose of their mutual male, on the thoroughly acceptable conclusion that he is fit for nothing else but to be killed. And, in the coziest, clammiest fashion, they go about it, by first drugging the brute with tampered whiskey, then soaking him in a bathtub, and later dumping his soggy body in the school swimming pool. The wife's qualms and the mistress' tenacity add to the sport and the suspense. At first, the plan appears to have gone off without a fault. But when Michel's body doesn't turn up when the pool is drained the next morning, the tension ratchets up to dizzying heights!On the surface, Diabolique is a crackerjack horror-thriller, woven by intricate performances and a chilling narrative filled with twists and turns. But upon closer inspection, you realize that it is instead a character study, forcing its two sympathetic, but morally compromised protagonists beneath the cinematic microscope and watching them squirm and collapse. Henri-Georges Clouzot tracks the proceedings from a dispassionate distance, with a dramatic use of dark shadow that highlights the asymmetric nature of the characters' tangled and triangulated passions. What he does so seamlessly is take a humdrum domestic crime scenario and envelop it with the kind of cool, glassy dread, plunging us into a pool of blood-chilling mystifications and asphyxiating dreads and then lead us into its rug-yanking climax. Diabolique still has the power to scare the heebie-jeebies out of audiences. It is a diabolical masterpiece that is meant to entertain, albeit with a certain spiritual shiver.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Devilishly delicious twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Don't be devils! Don't ruin the interest your friends could take in this film. Don't tell them what you have seen. On their behalf, thank you" is what director Henri-Georges Clouzot put at the beginning of his film Diabolique, basically telling you not to spoil the film to your friends. It's precisely this statement that sums up the entire film. Like many thrillers that succeeded it (The Usual Suspects springs to mind), this film is all about the ending and everything that precedes it is mere foreplay.The action takes place in a boarding school. The headmaster is a bit of an a-hole and so his wife, Christina, and his mistress, Nicole, conspire to kill him. Pretty basic setup, right? The mistress comes up with a plan which they execute to perfection. The wife lures him to Nicole's apartment a few hundred kilometers away from the school. There, Nicole sedates him and they drown him in a bathtub. They then transport his body back to the school and dump it in the school pool. They're confident that when the body floats to the surface, people will think it was an accident of some sort. Well, that was easy, right? Except the body doesn't surface and when the pool is eventually drained, there is no body to be found. Even worse, several of the school's kids claim to have seen the headmaster. This launches a series of events where Nicole and Christina try to get to the bottom of this whole mystery.As I said in the beginning, this film is all about its climactic plot twist. Everything is but the journey towards it. The journey is at its best when presenting you with strange mysteries, like the blurry school photo where the presumed dead headmaster may or not be in. (This may be the scene that provided Antonioni with the inspiration for Blow-Up.) But in many scenes, the film tends to drag which is only worsened by the film's 2-hour length. Another thing that only serves to bore is Véra Clouzot's (Christina's) acting. As the name suggests, she was married to director Clouzot, so that will obviously have played a role in her being cast as Christina, though that was definitely not to the film's benefit. I get she's supposed to play the hysteric, insecure, but I can only handle so much wide-eyed overacting before my interest dials down. All this made me feel like I was watching a thriller that used to be considered cutting-edge, but was now definitely showing its age? ?and then came the climactic plot twist. If you're even reading this review, chances are you must have already seen the film, so consider this the spoiler-ridden paragraph where I explain everything. Read at your own peril. One night at the school, Christina believes she hears someone. She runs to the bathroom, only to find the headmaster lying inside the water-filled bathtub. He stands up with limp hands and pops out his fake eyes. Christina, in shock, dies of heart attack. The headmaster looks upon her body as Nicole(!) walks in and embraces the headmaster. So he and Nicole had already thought out this whole ordeal from the start with the planned end result being Christina's death. I was genuinely surprised by the ending and I instantly took to liking the film. There's nothing worse than watching what you've been told is a classic, only to find you genuinely don't like it. That seemed to be the case here, but the ending rights every wrong. I didn't see it coming at all and was kind of shocked by how hardcore it is from an emotional and psychological standpoint: to stage such an elaborate trap for your wife so she can die of a heart attack so you can be with your mistress. That's pretty darn brutal. I also like how the ending of a film from the fifties holds up even today when theaters are bombarded with torture porn. There's something satisfying about that. With all these cheap attempts to shock audiences nowadays (many of them failing spectacularly), the now sixty-year-old Diabolique ? also designed to shock ? still excites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film Alfred Hitchcock Never Made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blending together the elements of horror &amp; mystery in a seamless manner, cleverly using its available resources to provide a sense of dread &amp; uncertainty, and efficiently sustaining its tense atmosphere from start to finish, Diabolique (also known as Les diaboliques) is one of the finest examples of its genre(s) that simply refuses to age despite being nearly 60 years old.The story concerns the wife of a cruel headmaster who, along with the help of her husband's mistress, devises a plan to murder him, and after careful arrangement manages to successfully execute it without leaving behind any traces. However, things are ultimately set in motion when the body mysteriously disappears from site after which a number of strange occurrences ensue.Ingeniously directed, smartly written, strongly performed, crisply photographed, tightly edited &amp; elegantly scored, Diabolique is an inspiring work of precision craftsmanship that immerses its viewers into its captivating tale from the very beginning, thanks to its expertly staged sequences &amp; careful narration which never gives out its ending until it's time for the final revelation.The contribution by its cast is wonderfully balanced plus it's both Véra Clouzot &amp; Simone Signoret who deliver the most impressive performances here. On an overall scale, Diabolique remains one of world cinema's most influential classics which promises &amp; effectively delivers a cinematic experience one generally finds in Hitchcock's thrillers, and comes as a must for all horror fans out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserving of its classic status.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Les Diaboliques" is a milestone not just in the genre of suspense but in all of cinema. Rarely has a film so successfully manipulated the audience with its memorable twists and final nine minutes of pure terror. It's easy to see how influential it's been: efforts such as the Hammer feature "Taste of Fear", the slasher "The House on Sorority Row", and even the equally legendary "Psycho" have all been inspired by what director Henri-Georges Clouzot does here. It might not appeal to some of the modern audience, as its pace is quite deliberate. It's more of a drama with a neat twist until that aforementioned finale when it gets truly scary. It's got some absolutely great images and beautiful black &amp; white cinematography by Armand Thirard. Use of the Georges Van Parys score is sparing, and in fact you don't hear any music during that final bit of suspense. This only serves to heighten the tension. The resolution is delicious and in fact there is text at the end advising viewers not to spoil it for their friends.Based on the novel "Celle Qui N'Etait Plus" by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac, it tells the story of two long suffering women who band together to rid themselves of the human monster in their lives. They are Christina Delassalle (Vera Clouzot, wife of the director) and Nicole Horner (Simone Signoret), the timid wife and icy mistress of Michel Delassalle (Paul Meurisse), the utterly nasty headmaster of a boarding school. They conspire to murder him, and seem to pull off this task...but after they dump his body into a pool on the school grounds, it disappears.Director Clouzot keeps you utterly engrossed and wondering where this will lead. The acting is top notch from all of the principals, also including Charles Vanel as Alfred Fichet, the savvy police commissioner who takes an interest in the case. Vera Clouzot is terrific as the bedeviled Christina, and it's too bad that she didn't do much acting in film. Meurisse is superb at playing a real piece of work. In addition to the wonderful thrills and chills, there is some humour as well.This would be a great one to watch late at night or early in the morning. Almost 60 years later, this film loses none of its impact.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never thought a movie could end like Diabolique,don't worry,I'm not going to spoil but you have to watch this movie ASAP. To be honest,it seemed very boring,but as minutes passed,the movie became more and more interesting. I watched a movie called Eyes without a face,and a friend recommended Les Diaboliques by saying it has the same feeling and it was true.Both movies are amazing. I gave it a 9 because of Vera's acting and because it bored me at first...and this is just my opinion. At the end I was so shocked,powerful ending,maybe the story wasn't so great,but the movie itself and the screenplay along with all the suspense made a *diabolique film*. Don't read a lot of reviews of this movie because it may ruin the pleasure and you don't want that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best thrillers I've ever seen and for sheer edge-of-the-seat tension the last five minutes is hard to beat. Brilliantly acted by the three leads, the cruel boys' school headmaster, his fragile estranged wife and recently discarded mistress play out an edgy, compelling mystery, right up to again, in my opinion, the best twist I've ever seen in movies. Director Clouzot certainly doesn't bungle his work unlike his comedic namesake and sets up the motive, opportunity and execution of the central murder in a wholly direct and convincing manner, using this as a springboard for a completely involving "missing body" mystery until the final shocking denouement.I guess conventional morality of the day demanded the inclusion of the "Columbo"-like retired old detective who rather punctures the finale, plus the final little addendum of the little boy's second vision takes things a little too far, but in a scene that must have influenced several thrillers down the years, from "The Shining" to "The Ring", as we follow Madame Cassalet's dread after-hours walk around the school, you'll find your heart beating as hard as hers, I'm sure.I'm a huge Hitchcock fan and understand the Master just lost out in buying the screenplay to this film, but I can pay director Clouzot no higher compliment than to say I doubt even Hitch could have improved on the brilliant production served up here.Dark, sexy, thrilling and mind-bending, this really is a film to strap yourself in for, lights out, doors locked. Excuse me now while I go for a bath...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most haunting thrillers that I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of the rare Hitchcock-esque films that actually turns any good. In fact, It is better than most of Hitchcokck works. Is definitely a masterpiece on the genre. This film is wonderfully crafted. Is almost like a dream coming true. Very few thrillers in that time relied so much in development as far as I am concerned. A notable example would be 'Dial M for Murder'. A similar themed film, with similar running time, but which Hitchcok simply couldn't turn into an exciting,moving film as Diabolique because of the lack of powerful characters and a weak story with a weak ending.And when I see Diabolique, I see everything what Hitchcock wanted to do. The atmosphere, the creepy characters, and an outstanding ending. Impeccably crafted. And yes, it's so entertaining, I mean, the first hour is slow, normal, that is due to the great work on development, but then is pure excitement and 'edge of the seat' moments. And yes, there is some really creepy and scary moments, that I doubt it would be allowed if made in the prude Hollywood of the 50s.So behind Psycho, that is much likely my favorite horror-thriller film of all time. It has the seriousness and the atmosphere needed for this kind of film(no wonder, Diabolique served for inspiration to Psycho). So go watch it! 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why I simply find old black and white films from mid 20th century boring. Perhaps it's because, as a human, I'm able to perceive a variety of colors from the visible spectrum and I like to be able to enjoy this sort of stimulus. Maybe it is because I find the soundtrack of those movies cheesy and kind of funny, even when it's supposed to be a suspense movie, for example. Or, could it be, I'm just a 21st century boy (even though I wasn't born in this century at all).In any case, Les Diaboliques has been the first old film in black and white that I've found interesting. Contrary to other American movies I've watched from the same period, the acting is natural and credible. The story could be remade nowadays without changing ANYTHING and it could work perfectly still (as long as you aren't the 96 remake director, of course). The music makes you feel the tension and eeriness of the situation. Even having to listen to the french language didn't bother me! Les Diaboliques is told in a way that makes you get hooked to the mystery of the story from the beginning.I won't even get into the Columbo resemblance, haha!</fullReview>

They knock him out with adulterated wine, drown him in the bathtub, then dump the body in the school's pool. They had hoped that someone would find his body, but when his body disappears, strange events begin to plague the two women.This is not just a french classic but an iconic noir film of all times. The film is based on Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac's novel "Celle qui n'était plus" (She Who Was No More). Alfred Hitchcock also attempted to buy the rights to this novel but Henri-Georges Clouzot beat him to it by hours. Anyone will see a Hitchcockian feel to this story. It's one of the few times when a quick English remake by another director would be incredible. The story is just filled with tension. The over-bearing performance of the husband is frightening.

		<shortDescription>Diabolique - masterful thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a superb thriller, a holistic cliff-hanger directed by H.G. Clouzot, adapted from Bioleau and Narcejac's novel (who later would purvey VERTIGO 1958, 8/10 for Hitchcock to make amends for his vain attempt to acquire LES DIABOLIQUES). Shot in monochrome, the film excels in keeping audiences engaging in the crafty conspiracy of a demure wife colludes with her husband's mistress to murder her horrendous husband, taking almost half of the screen-time to character-building and meticulous plotting, their plan progresses pretty well until an unexpected twist swerves the film into a psychological horror torment, at the end of the day another scam has been uncovered and the final revelation triumphantly wins its trophy for its shock value. The film piques our interest with a peculiar ménage a trois situation, a wife-cum-mistress (Ms. Clouzot and Signoret) alliance plots a punctilious scheme to kill the husband (Meurisse), Clouzot confidently takes a meandering pace at first, set in a rural all-male boarding school, Meurisse is the ill-tempered principle and both Ms. Clouzot and Signoret are the teachers, but a significant but easily overlooked minutia is that it is Ms. Clouzot who brings about the fortune to the school. After steadily details the conflict among the protagonists and cunningly accentuates the two female leads' disparate personality, Ms. Clouzot is a well-heeled, wan, indecisive woman, the victim of mental abuse, hemmed in a dead-water marriage with a traditional mind which means she cannot risk a scandalous divorce, by comparison Signoret is a tough, adamant, subversive doer, the recipient of domestic abuse but doesn't reconcile to the status quo. So the weird affinity of the two may suggest something more radical than the surface, but the film doesn't dare to provoke the controversy (or for the sake of the surprising finale). Clouzot knowingly manufactures several minor hitches to the execution of the murder, the grumpy tenants living upstairs, the drunken soldier-hitchhiker and the bathroom light in the middle of the night, each juices up the tension moderately and finally, when it seems their plan has been conducted successfully, the film inaugurates its great conjuring, starts with the missing corpse, to the involvement of a senior private detective (Vanel) until the disintegration of the two convicts and the truth gradually comes into light, a textbook thriller-horror segment which would inspire many emulators, it is an utterly heart-in-the-throat experience, Ms. Clouzot is ineffably remarkable in the guilty-haunting, soul-crunching trauma of scare, one of the most impressive death scene I've even seen! Signoret and Meurisse both nail their roles with sharp precision. LES DIABOLIQUES is a masterful suspense-establishing film and H.G. Clouzot is a no lesser achiever than Mr. Hitchcock if there is any justice in the world!</fullReview>

And should you have any reservations over watching this 50s, subtitled, noir masterpiece, put them aside. Specifically: If you didn't enjoy Clouzot's "The Wages of Fear", don't worry: this is an entirely different animal. I wasn't a big fan of "Fear", either. If you're put off by the comparisons to Hitchcock, believe me: they are warranted. The point is not that Clouzot is a better director than Hitchcock, the point is that this is the best movie Hitchock never made. And if you think the first 30 minutes lack pace, keep it up: this is a movie that turns the screw slowly but surely - going from interesting to intriguing to suspenseful - with a final 15 minutes that are downright terrifying and pay off in a big way.</fullReview>

Typically when you think horror movie, you think Friday the Thirteenth or Nightmare on Elm Street brand; the slasher film with lots of fake blood and gore. Not that there's anything wrong with those sorts of films but every horror fan has to know there's a flip-side to that coin. It's the sort of horror that just creeps up on you and the next thing you know, you're hiding behind the couch with the remote, debating how sound a plan it was to watch this movie at night.

		<shortDescription>A Taut, Suspenseful Mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More than 50 years after it was made, Diabolique remains a classic mystery/suspense story. What interested me about it is the minimal means employed by director Henri-Georges Clouzot. Shot entirely in black-and-white with no fancy camera work or special effects, the film achieves more than most mystery stories that employ the complete contemporary bag of tricks.The story is cleverly constructed. A wife (Vera Clouzot) and mistress (Simone Signoret) conspire to murder an abusive husband and lover (Paul Meurisse) and a retired detective (Charles Vanel) shows up to investigate the disappearance of the man's body which had been dumped in the swimming pool owned and run by the husband and wife. The acting by Clouzot, Signoret and Vanel is outstanding, though Meurisse is barely satisfactory as the villainous husband.The suspense attending the body's disappearance mounts as the film proceeds and the ending is unexpected. The magnetic Signoret is widely known for other roles. But Mme Clouzot is quite effective and, as others have noted, Vanel plays a detective who's manner seems to foreshadow Peter Falk's Columbo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With many great films in recent years I found this title listed in the pages of the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it was a French film I realised during that I had wanted to see for some time, and I'm glad I watched. Basically at a second-rate boarding school the sadistic headmaster Michel Delassalle (Paul Meurisse) is married to teacher and frail wife Christina Delassalle (Véra Clouzot), but he also having a affair with mistress and fellow teacher Nicole Horner (Simone Signoret) since they first met. Despite knowing what position they are both in with him they do not show animosity towards each other, they actually get on, they are particularly close when it comes to their hatred for the man physically using and emotionally abusing them both. They have both come to the conclusion that they have had enough with Michel, and Nicole suggests a plan, and Christina eventually agrees, he is lead into his mistress's apartment, be sedated by his wife, and they drown him in the bathtub, and they dump his body in the murky school swimming pool. They assume the body will eventually be found and everyone will presume he drowned in an accident, and everything is going according to plan when they ask the pool to be drained and cleaned, but no body surfaces, it has disappeared. Days go by, with Christina being the most worried, then Nicole sees in the newspaper a drowned corpse has been found in another location, but at the morgue it is not Michel's body, but he does meet retired private detective Alfred Fichet (Charles Vanel), and he gets involved with the case. He and Christina return to the school, and a boy has been punished for breaking a window, and he claims this punishment was given to him by the headmaster, none believe him apart from the wife of the missing man who becomes sick and thinks he is seeing things. While worried Nicole leaves the school, Christina tells Alfred everything, he may not believe her but he does investigate more, and she is sure someone is in the school and it is freaking her out. It is one night that she hears noises, and going into the bathroom she is extremely shocked to find Michel's body in the bathtub, and appearing dead he rises out of the water, and she suffers a heart attack and dies. But he removes his fake dead eyes, he did not die from drowning after all, and Christina has been set up by him and Nicole to be shocked and die so that they can be together, but Alfred catches them to arrest them. The end of the film sees the little boy from earlier who has broken another window, and asked how he got his slingshot back, he claims that Christina gave it to him, but we never see or confirm she is alive. It should also be noted the final words at the end tell the audience not to reveal the ending of the film to their friends. Also starring Pierre Larquey as M. Drain, Thér?se Dorny as Mme. Herboux, Jean Brochard as Plantiveau and Michel Serrault as M. Raymond. Clouzot as the emotionally suffering wife, Signoret as the scheming other woman, and of course Meurisse as the nasty piece of work man caught in the middle, all three performances are fantastic, the film is filled with classic film noir ideas, the graveyard gloominess of the story really grips you, and of course the shocking ending (number 48 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments) is one of the greatest ever, and gave inspiration for many imitations, a brilliant thriller. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without remembering the 1996 remake, I watched this and was thrilled till near the end, and yet, I was never sure about the outcome. Not as difficult as Christie's novels, nor easy as nowadays' stereotyped films, you get to feel for the female characters, and hate the psychopathic Michel Delassalle. Seldom have secondary characters be more essential, from nosy underdog Alfred Fichet to Plantiveau, Michel Serrault's guard, the drunkard soldier, the neighbours, teachers... People speak and speak in this movie, it is everybody's business, much like in any small town, but in this movie you feel the "lack of oxygen" and claustrophobia with enough doses of hints and scares to keep you awake, but not too many, and always respecting this rule that "the unusual makes everything more believable". Timing is perfect, tension mounting to the climax that you should never tell (the naive titles in the end are in themselves worth the film).Watch it!PS: Which is your favourite character? Mine is undoubtedly Clouzot's real-life-wife Vera, way better than Adjani in the American remake. She is shot lovingly, and it shows. The film pivots on her.</fullReview>

Is someone pretending to be him? That's the fun of watching this movie. Anyone will be on the edge of their seat, their pulse pounding, in anticipation of the truth.The movie has a creepy atmosphere, it's serious and has little humor, most of which is dark; it has that fatalistic atmosphere of noir movies.

		<fullReview>"Les Diaboliques" is an elegant horror classic directed by French director Henri-Georges Clouzot, and one that is still mind shattering today as it was back in the 50's when it was released. The film looks and feels like a Hithcock movie, and so much so that one could call it the best film Hithcock never made - the French equivalent of "Psycho". From the opening sequence with the creepy demonic chanting, you know you are in for a dazzling experience, and indeed, it keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. Vera Clouzot gives a stunning performance as the fragile, abused wife of a headmaster, and Simone Signouret is cold as ice in the role of Clouzot's partner in crime. For their performances and the script alone the film deserves a 10/10. Still, I have to admit the middle part gets a little slow, but serves as a suspenseful build-up to the mind blowing climax, that still ranks among the scariest scenes ever made. Overall, a definite must-see, even if you're a fan of modern horror, you will certainly be surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christina Delassale (Vera Clouzot) runs a French boarding school for boys. She has a tyrannical husband (Paul Mwurisse) who openly sleeps, and beats up, a sexy teacher in the school named Nicole (Simeone Signoret). Nicole and Christina have had enough of his evil. They kill him, dump the body and slowly come to realize they may have botched the job.This was considered (until "Psycho" came out 5 years later) one of the scariest and best psychological thrillers ever made. It builds slowly but it's never dull and it tightens up the suspense until the final 15 minutes which still scare me no matter how many times I see this. It's done in total quiet and darkness and will have chills running up and down your spine. It's beautifully and atmospherically directed by Henri-Georges Clouzet--he said he wanted to scare the audience silly and he succeeds! It's beautifully acted by the three leads. Meurisse is downright terrifying and repulsive as the vicious husband. Clouzot is sweet and vulnerable. Signoret is sexy and strong. This movies' twist ending has been lessened by being used in many inferior remakes but it's still scary and a must-see. Avoid (at all costs) the 1996 Sharon Stone redo. It's a travesty and actually so incredibly bad it's kind of funny.Older prints of this are 9 minutes shorter. They were cut (I think) because of some minor swearing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to watch this film twice, since, when I read subtitles I don't get to appreciate the cinematography or enjoy the actor's faces as much.I noticed the camera doesn't do anything too complicated, no broad pans or dizzying shots. The visual metaphors are really interesting. When someone confesses a crime, the detective peers through what appear to be bars and says he'll absolve her by morning.The acting is just great - especially by the two leading women.My favorite thing about the movie, though, is that it complicates the good evil dichotomy. Yeah the guy is a jack-ass, but he's running a school, and he's short on cash. The woman is pious, sure, but damn she's ignorant to how her actions have effected her husband's dreams to be a businessman - and at least he does what he does out of love, while she acts mostly out of fear (for god).So thats that, thoroughly entertaining, but its not empty either for those who look.Peace!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Diabolique" (also known as "Les Diaboliques" in it's original French title, or "The Devils") tells the story of Christina Delassalle (Vera Clouzot), a teacher at an all-boys school, in which her husband, Michel (Paul Meurisse) is the headmaster. Michel is abusive and cruel, and is having an open love-affair with another staff member, Nicole Horner (Simone Signoret). But when Christina and Nicole become tired of Michel's cruel acts, they conspire to murder him. One night, while in the city of Niort, they sedate him and drown him in a bathtub in their hotel room, disposing of his body in the school's filthy, unused swimming pool upon their return. But when the pool is drained a few days later, Michel's body has disappeared... and a chain of strange events begin to plague the two women."Diabolique" is an exquisite piece of foreign cinema that has become widely known for inspiring filmmaker Alfred Hitchock, and the influence is evident in his films. The film was adapted from a French novel, and the storyline, while by today's standards may seem a little too familiar, is completely brilliant and quite original. Keep in mind that cinema was in its early stages when this film was made, so something like this was not widely seen. The plot is fairly simple - wife conspires to murder her husband with his lover - and similar set-ups can be seen in cinema still to this day. There are countless elements to this film that are still used in modern day, and that is pretty powerful. The acting is also quite good, Simone Signoret plays the cold, straight-to-the-point Nicole, while Vera Clouzot plays the emotionally-tied Christina. Both women's interaction and screen presence are great, and the dynamic is perfect.Pacing in the film is excellent, and the story takes awhile to get its wheels turning, but once it does, the viewer is completely captivated by what is happening. As the film progresses toward its climax, it winds suspense and tension like a tight-wire. There is plenty of mystery to keep you confused, and desperately wanting to know the truth as the story becomes darker and darker. Atmospheric and somber are two words that describe this film perfectly, because it is just that. The backdrops for the story are great, including the decaying old school where the majority of the film takes place. The black-and-white adds even more to this, and it leaves the viewer with an overall feeling of unease and fright. It leaves you with a strange feeling in the pit of your stomach, and you are uneasy throughout the entire duration.As a seasoned horror film enthusiast, I was quite surprised at how much power this film had, despite its age. I was biting my nails like crazy and was actually quite uncomfortable throughout most of the movie, and horror films now days rarely do that. The entire murder sequence was disturbing because of how cold, calculated, and plainly human that it was. But even more terrifying was the last ten minutes of the movie, where Christina is being terrorized by an unseen assailant in the darkened halls of the boarding school, before having the fright of her life in the bathroom. Then, there's the twist, which is extremely clever and had me thinking "wow, I should have picked up on that!". I still can't shake the final bathroom scene from my head, and if a film can manage to do that to someone who has seen hundreds of horror films, then I have to congratulate it. Therefore, I'd say that this movie can be labeled as timeless - it contains as much power now as it did fifty years ago, which is very admirable.Bottom line is, "Diabolique" is a powerful film that is a must-see for horror/suspense fans, because it laid groundwork for many movies later to come. The story itself is riveting, and the suspense in this film is stunning. Throw in a handful of genuinely frightening scenes, some good acting and atmosphere, and a climax &amp; twist that will have your head spinning, and you have what I'd consider to be one of the best suspense-horror films of all time. My advice is to see this one, especially if you are a fan of the earlier horror films, or those of Hitchcock. Note that the film is in French, but don't let that put you off. This is a masterpiece that shouldn't be overlooked. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite my dad having picked up the DVD years ago,I for some reason have never got round to seeing auteur director Henri-Georges Clouzot's epic Film Noir Horror.With the October Horror Challenge taking place on IMDb's Horror board,I decided that it was the perfect time to finally discover how "Diaboliques" things could get.The plot:Stomping round the second-rate boarding school like he owns the place, Michel Delassalle finds his wife Christina not willing to give up her sole ownership of the school,even when he flaunts fellow teacher/less than secret mistress Nicole Horner in front of Christina.Getting pushed in between them,Horner becomes increasingly frustrated at Michel's behaviour.Getting sick of the mistreatment that Michel inflicts on both of them,Nicole starts devising a plan with Christina to murder Michel.Traveling together to a remote village, Christina gets her husband to come down by threatening to divorce him.Revealing to Michel that she was just messing around in order to get him to come down,Christina gives Michel a drink to calm down.Unknown to Michel,the duo have laced the drink with sleeping sedatives.Getting Michel in a bath,Horner drowns him whilst Christina gets a led weight. Throwing Michel's body in the school's dirty outdoor swimming pool, Christina and Nicole soon discover that their diabolic act won't sink.View on the film:Hating every moment on the set due to co-writer/ (along with Jérôme Géronimi/René Masson &amp; Frédéric Grendel) director Henri-Georges Clouzot only paying her for 8 weeks,despite the shoot overrunning to 16 weeks,the elegant Simone Signoret gives a chilling performance as Nicole Horner,with the behind the scenes issues being strongly suggested by Signoret giving Nicole a frosty femme fatale edge over the pouring with emotion Christina. Circling round Christina and Michel,Signoret gives Nicole a striking masculinity,as Nicole has to grip Christina's fragile nerves over the plan,whilst laying on the brash charm for her lover Michel.Showing that she does not take the role easy despite being married to the director, the stunning Véra Clouzot (who sadly died at age 46) gives an incredible performance as Christina Delassalle .Being far less confident on the plan than Nicole is, Véra Clouzot brilliantly balances Christina's tense excitement over the act,and the burnt nerves that follow an unexpected turn in the plan. Joining Signoret &amp; Véra Clouzot, Paul Meurisse gives an excellent performance as Michel,with Meurisse giving Michel a hard-nosed brittle edge,with Meurisse blunt dialogue delivery building anticipation to Nicole &amp; Christina putting their plan into action.Grabbing the rights to Pierre Boileau &amp; Thomas Narcejac novel just before Hitchcock made an attempt,the writers spend the first 30 minutes pulling up the decaying Film Noir school,with the writers making a satirical comment on the French education system,as Michel has an equal disregard for the education of the children,and the feelings of his lovers.Keeping away from drying the title up with social dissection,the writers paint a superb Film Noir galley of dread,as Christina &amp; Nicole's mutual mistrust crashes against Michel,with the cold and calculating femme fatale Nicole having to keep the terrified out of her wits Christina on track at all cost. Striking the title with a deliciously macabre twist ending,the writers delicately place the clues to the ending with a real precision, which allows the viewer to see the relationships between Michel.Nicole &amp; Christina from a completely different angle.Placing a tar pit swimming pool by the school,director Henri-Georges Clouzot and cinematographer Armand Thirard sink the trio into murky Film Noir waters,with Clouzot &amp; Thirard covering the screen in long, looming shadows hiding deceit and betrayal. Highlighting the horror elements,Clouzot uses dazzling close-ups on Christina's face to capture the shock of terror being cast across her face,as the ruins start to crumble.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock in French ? even better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is it that makes a film a bona fide classic or even a landmark in cinema? It's the fact that it continues to endear new and much younger target audiences, in spite of being more than half a century old. It has to do with timeless story-telling, stylistic trademarks and unequalled suspense. But most of all it's about being authentic. Henri-Georges Clouzot's "Les Diaboliques" is an authentic pioneer of murder mysteries/conspiracy thrillers. By this I mean that we've all seen numerous movies like it, so over the years we have seen all the plot twists, red herrings and clichés you can possibly imagine yourself, but in this case they honestly come across as derivative or predictable. This film is authentic while all the others copied stuff from it, but your cinematic mind ability separates the pioneers from the copycats. Fundamentally speaking, "Les Diaboliques" is a simple thriller with a logical set-up and only a limited cast of characters, but the professional elaboration elevates it to a near-perfect masterpiece. The rich but both mentally and physically weak Christina Delassalle is petrified of her tyrannical husband Michel, with whom she runs a private boarding school near Paris. Even Michel's cocky mistress Nicole is sick and tired of his cruel and dominant attitude, and thus she tries hard to convince Christina to murder their mutual bed partner and make it look like an accident. When the women finally decide to execute their perfect assassination plan, it's the start of a truly tense and nail-biting puzzle. I deliberately prefer to cease with describing the plot at this point. Most reviews, and even the synopsis on the back of the DVD box, go quite a bit further in describing the two women's further ordeals, but I think the less you know, the more you'll be overwhelmed. The used the word a couple of sentences ago already, but will do it again? "Les Diaboliques" is pretty much close to perfection. The pace of the film is slow but incredibly moody and it doesn't feature a single moment of boredom. Quite the contrary, I personally had the impression that I was continuously moving more and more towards the edge of my seat. The tone is serious and unsettling, but there's nevertheless room for small portions of subtle comedy, like the two school teachers worrying about their wine and the interlude with the drunken soldier. The inescapable suspense is often built up through very simplistic yet effective tricks, like ingenious cinematography, and patient editing. The acting performances are phenomenal. I can't even pick a favorite performance, because they were all so different but equally mesmerizing. I've read some articles which stated that "Les Diaboliques" is the best Hitchcock film Hitchcock never made. Personally I think even that is still an understatement, as this is much better than most of Hitchcock's films I've seen already (excluding "Psycho", "Strangers on a Train" and "The Birds").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately I saw the 1974 TV movie remake in 1974 with Joan Hackett, Tuesday Weld and Sam Waterston. Good remake, though, and it really creeped me out. A few years later, saw Les Diaboliques in a theater and, even though I knew what to expect, still loved it and still felt creeped out. Just watched the Criterion DVD tonight and am so glad I have it. Watched the last part of the film twice, because it's such a brilliant study in suspense. This is all atmosphere, camerawork, editing, pacing, writing and acting. No loud noises, gore and the other cheap gimmicks we've come to expect in suspense films today. A true original. A classic. Should be on any serious cinephile's shelf.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Diabolique is a good psychological thriller. The performances are, for the most part, excellent, and the director has a sense for where to put his camera in order to create the most suspense possible. The story involves an abused woman who is convinced to kill her husband by her husband's mistress. The most notable thing in the film is the violence towards women displayed by the husband. He is truly an awful guy. Of course, since it is 1955 and the director is the actress' husband, he is never really taken to task for his acts of domestic violence. The mental pressure builds and builds on the poor woman until the inevitable climax. Thankfully, a nice old man comes along and catches the bad guys. Of course, this is only after he has "watched" her sleep in her thin nightgown. Still, if read as an impression of the situation that women could find themselves in and the inescapability of domestic violence in the 1950's, it is an effective statement.</fullReview>

Of course, most of the suspense is deadened if you happened to view the inferior 1995 re-make.

		<fullReview>I believe that those over 35 might enjoy Diabolique. It does start off slowly, but I believe that this helps the audience to appreciate the motive to make the headmaster disappear. The director did pick up the pace after the first 23 minutes of film. I found this movie to be more suspenseful than horror-like. I believe that the movie is in French so you get a chance to freshen up on your understanding. It does have English subtitles so that we can all understand all that is taking place. I find it difficult to watch both the English subtitles and watch the film. I am sure that if I did not have to struggle with both that I would have rated the movie a bit higher. This is a popcorn cruncher instead of a popcorn muncher (more relaxed) due to suspense. Three thumbs up.</fullReview>

It's creepy, disturbing, brilliant, and terrifying. It'll have you cowering behind your hands. The tension is almost unbearable at parts. I found myself short of breath several times. It's reminiscent of Hitchcock's The Trouble With Harry and Rope. The creepy factor is highger than What Lies Beneath, Vertigo, and The Ring. It starts out slow but after maybe 20 minutes or so things start to happen, and that's when the story picks up. Strange occurrences begin to happen, increasing the intensity and sending chills down your spine. Rent it now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even after half a century, it is still unethical to review the twist. Therefore, even when I have clicked the spoiler warning automatically, there's no spoiler herein. I won't even name the movie I have in mind that "borrowed" the general plot from Les Diaboliques for fear that it may be recognised. And I'm not talking about Sharon Stone's 1996 remake, the existence of which I wasn't even aware of when I watched the French original last night, the first of a series of revivals under the umbrella of "Rendezvous with French Cinema". I guessed the twist about two-third through, not because I was clever, but because the general idea of the plot has since been "borrowed" subsequently by quite a few English-speaking movies, with different variations in details.Enough about clever plot twists. And I'm not even going to say anything about the story. It's simple enough to follow easily and they didn't have the habit of telling a story backwards, which is a trendy thing to do these days. Let me move right on to making some sense of my summary line.The movies is shot (beautifully shot, I hasten to add) in black and white. For some movies, particularly psychological thrillers such as this one, having it in colour only goes to destroy some of the moods and subtleties that are essential. Just compare the remake of "Psycho" to the original and you'll need no further elaboration.Slightly underplaying the suspense may have actually achieved the desired result of intensifying the chill, because the events feel more realistic, less "cinematically" manipulative. But that's only possible if there's good acting which can carry the movie. And when it comes to good acting, Les Diaboliques has in abundunce.The contrast of Simone Signoret's icy control and Vera Clouzot's nervous tension will have you spellbound. Paul Meurisse's tyrannical schoolmaster jumps out of the screen. Charles Vanel's inquisitive private detective and Pierre Larquey's comical school teacher each has its own charm. Even minor characters such as the disturbed upstairs neighbours and the attendee of the morgue are quite memorable.Not all progress are bad, and while I jest about movies such as "Memento" and "5x2", I do appreciate their ingenuity. Movies such as Les Diaboliques, however, provides excellent alternatives for viewer who have the capacity to appreciate a broad spectrum of cinematic experience, old and new.</fullReview>

And it is in just this world that people are driven to murder, or something even worse. Yes, the subtitles suck, and the only available prints are awful, but not to see this film would be a real tragedy. What a marvelous piece of work. And it is the little scenes that build the big ones: the dialogues between the two women, the wife and the mistress. Just when thinks the school is its own little hell, the women visit the hometown of one. What a depressing place.

		<fullReview>Diabolique (1955) **** (out of 4) French masterpiece about a wife (Vera Clouzot) and her husband's mistress (Simone Signoret) who plan on killing the husband. After the murder the two women dump his body in a swimming pool so that someone else can discover it but when the pool is drained the body is gone. What's so great about this film is that the described plot isn't the story but instead just the set up as director Clouzot uses this to build tension from the start of the film to its end. The funny thing is that the wife in the movie has a heart condition that is constantly troubling her whenever more mystery surrounds her husband's death and the tension she is feeling is also what the viewing is feeling. I saw the remake when it was first released but couldn't remember a thing about it so this all came as a new viewing for me and I think the movie's reputation of being one of the most suspenseful films ever made rings true and then some. Starting with the beautiful murder sequence, the movie has an unnerving and unsettling mood and feel that last the entire movie. The director builds up a wonderful, tense atmosphere and never lets it go. A lot of filmmakers go for various jump scares but that's not the case here as the movie instead just builds a minor tension and slowly keeps it rising. There aren't any humor scenes to calm things down because the subject matter is handled very seriously and the terror of the wife is what comes across. Everything she feels in the movie is the same thing the viewer is feeling so it's refreshing not having fake humor thrown in. What really makes the film move are the wonderful performances with Clouzot, the director's wife, leading the way. A lot of actresses have had to play being terrified but I must admit that I think this is one of the best. I won't ruin her scene at the end but it's quite breathtaking just watching her work. Signoret makes the perfect mistress as she comes across as quite the bitch yet also gains some sympathy of her own. Paul Meurisse is also very good in the role of the husband and has no trouble coming across as someone you want to see the women kill. I've heard some complain that the ending is silly but I have to disagree as the movie really keeps you guessing from start to finish. The level of suspense is top-notch throughout and I think the ending delivers as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains a surprise ending that is the film's notorious moment. Perhaps one of the ten greatest endings in the cinema. Great acting and great direction help make a classic out of Les Diaboliques(1955). Has a compelling beginning, middle , and end. The settings of the film gives it a gothic look. Inspired by the Alfred Hitchcock films of the 1940s.Based on a novel by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac, Les Diaboliques(1955) turns the knob on suspense and tension. There are hints at a homosexual relationship between Nicole and Christana in the early parts of Les Diaboliques. Henri Georges Clouzot followed up his masterpiece The Wages of Fear(1953) with another masterpiece in Les Diabolique. The remake is such a bad film that it doesn't deserve any comparison with the original. Simone Signoret is icy and cool as the sinsiter and mysterious Nicole.Alfred Hitchcock wanted to direct this film but was too late in making a deal with the story's authors. This resulted in the authors writing a novel just for the master of suspense that would become Vertigo(1958). The Character of Inspector Fichet seems to be the blue print for LT. Columbo. Major influence stylishticly on films such as Orson Welles's Touch of Evil(1958), and Alfred Hithcock's Psycho(1960). Les Diaboliques(1955) did for bathtubs what Psycho(1960) did for showers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>French thrillers always feature a strong social background:see Claude Chabrol's movies for instance.Such is the case with "Diabolique".In ,say,"Vertigo" (which,like"Diabolique,was inspired by a Boileau-Narcejac novel),the social background is nowhere to be seen;that doesn't prevent Hitchcock 's movie from being a masterpiece though.Clouzot's screenplay is much different from the original novel.The action doesn't take place in a lousy school on the paper.Clouzot wanted to be "realistic" ,that's why he literally created the two-bit boarding-school and the grotesque teachers.The actors were so good they survived their unbelievable characters.Another significant difference between Clouzot and Hitchcock:the former saves the "surprise" for a final that leaves you on the edge of your seat,the latter-in "Vertigo"- tells the audience the whole truth before the last third,and studies his character -who does not know- and his psychological reactions.Generally,in France ,critics favor Hitch over Clouzot,but the two directors can't be compared because their approaches are diametrically opposite.This is not legend.It is fact:this is the greatest French thriller ever.I'm overjoyed when I read all those enthusiastic reviews from abroad after all the negative ones I 've read in my native France.Thanks to you,all IMDb users!!</fullReview>

Yes, apparently. It got a ton of PR and certain critics raved. "Life" magazine, for one, did a spread on how "shocking" it was. The "don't reveal the ending" title card predated Hitchcock's "Psycho's" marketing gimmick by a few years -- when audiences routinely walked in during the middle of a film.But there's a reason "Psycho" has withstood the test of time and rewards repeated viewings, and "Diabolique" is a cinema footnote.With "Diabolique," you know EXACTLY what's coming -- and you're right. It's just a matter of seeing how cleverly, or not, Clouzot works it out. The "suspense," such as it is, lies not in any real emotional involvement with the characters and situation (because you already know where the film is going), but rather in how thrillingly it's going to be depicted.Answer? Not very.In other words, the plot was stale even in 1955. So the "suspense" lies in seeing if Clouzot can bring new life to a tale as old as Euripides.Answer? No.The actors? Wonderful. Particularly the young Simone Signoret. Vera Clouzot, the director's wife, borders on Garboesque beauty and is fine, except when she veers off into bug-eyed terror (too often)."Psycho" has been criticized for its final "explanation" scene by the psychiatrist. By contrast, that's Shakespeare compare to this claptrap quickie ending.What REALLY drives a stake through the heart of "Diabolique" is the schoolboy's last line, "I saw her, I know I saw her." Huh? This pseudo-profundity is supposed to make us imagine that maybe the lovers DIDN'T scare the wife to death? That she's actually still alive? To do WHAT? Get a divorce from this abusive husband like she should have done all along? "HAUNT" them from beyond the grave? What? Answer? Nothing.A lot of talent is wasted here on a third-rate plot with an insulting payoff.Amazing this was ever considered much of anything.It's not. "Diabolique" is a B-move posing as a French art-film "shocker."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AMAZING!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is perhaps one of the greatest suspense thrillers of all time!! Of course, it runs a close tie with Hitchcock's Vertigo, of which I am particularly fond, but this film has a Hitchcock feel to it. It definatly strikes me as a film that Hitchcock would have done had Clouzot not gotten to it first!! This film leads you in one direction then when you least expect it, it just totally changes the course of action. It's the ultimate in suspense films, and completely unpredictable. I have this on DVD and would say that no matter how many times I watch it, I still can't get over how well written the story is!! And Simone Signoret acts her role beautifully, Clouzot couldn't have chosen a better actress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... because the crap will be scared out of you.I watched this years ago, home alone, in the middle of the night right before Thanksgiving day. Needless to say I didn't sleep all that well, in fact, my hands were still shaking the next day as I tried to choke down some turkey and mashed.No, it's not for people who have short attention spans or limited imaginations and need their "horror" whacked over their heads with an ax and gallon of ketchup. But if you're the type of person who jumps when you hear that "bump in the night", then you will LOVE (or hate) this movie because it's not a bump, it's a fricken house falling down from the sky and landing on top of you with a horrifying SPLAT.There's that last five minutes that will scare you witless, yes, and then, THEN, there's a moment after that will make you cry for your mama like a tiny baby that just pooped itself. Except you will be the baby and you'll probably be frantically trying to jam yourself under the couch like I was.Awesome. Unforgettable. Amazing. And I hope I never see it again because my old heart might give out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bathtubs over Showers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read with great enjoyment all the fully-warranted praise lavished on this fantastic movie and just had to throw in my own two cents worth. My only experience with Diabolique came more than 35 years ago while visiting my great aunt's home in Knoxville, IA; she would go to bed early and me and my brothers would watch late movies on TV. For whatever reason I wound up alone that night and tuned in just in time to see the lead up to and payoff of the shock scene of the movie (in the bathtub). Even making allowance for my youth (11-12 years old), this scene burned an INDELIBLE impression on me and for the rest of my life I wondered "what the heck was that movie?!?" None of the horror movies I EVER thrived on at that age packed anything close to a punch as that did! Of course I didn't recognize any of the actors, and the best I could come up with was to guess that it was Jose Ferrer playing the husband; for years I looked at plot synopses of his movies to see if I could identify it. This of course yielded me nothing--he wasn't in Diabolique. Then several months ago, on a whim, I picked up a $3 used copy of the Sharon Stone remake, and my jaw dropped when I saw the same climax re-enacted--my 35 year personal little mystery solved.With the possible exception of last year's "The Manchurian Candidate," remakes can never equal their source material, and having seen only such a small slice of the original "Diabolique" I'm really not qualified to comment, except to say that I do NOT think the remake is as bad as it's represented by others here. Still I don't doubt that it pales in comparison with the original that shivers me still after seeing only the last reel on network TV 35 years ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suberb noir. Finely crafted, edgy, sparse, haunting . One of the few noir films that hasn't dated - partly due to the almost total lack of music. If you enjoyed this film you'll probably like Hitchcock's Rebecca.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shows what people outside Hollywood can create</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In years to come this will remain the best french thriller made and this can compete with the best of movies in Hollywood. Please don't watch the diaboliques of Hollywood by Sharon Stone.The English version has unwanted glamor in a movie like this. The french version is what I call a perfect movie, the facial expressions of the artists are too good and the suspense is mind blowing, considering the fact that it was made in 1955.Get a good DVD with subtitles and you will understand the movie very well even without knowing any french at all.Direction is classic and I really love the old detective who plays a cameo in the end.too good, this is one quality movie and I never saw the end coming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost good enough for a 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure that if I had seen Diabolique when it was first released in the 1950s, it would have been the best film I had ever seen, and I would likely have continued to regard it in that way until I died.Diabolique's only problem is that to a new viewer, it seems rather unoriginal. The very ending that makes Diabolique so wonderful is an ending that has been used in at least a dozen other major films in the past 10 years. In addition, being from the 1950s, it's paced far slower than what modern film watchers are accustomed to. And, the subtitles in the Criterion Collection version are distractingly pixellated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally got to see this movie that I have tried to see for many years but the prints on TV were unwatchable. I bought the DVD and it was well worth it. I don't want to tell anyone the storyline but I do wish that the DVD with all its abilities could have had an english speaking version as well as the french with english subtitles. There are several other foreign movies out there that I would like to see but not enough to struggle through the subitles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film, but stop the hype, please !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film a number of times and do have it on VHS. Whilst I do agree that it is a good film, I think a lot of the comments on IMDb are going over the top about it and carrying it to heights that it doesn't really deserve. Also, the American remake is not half as bad as people make out and whilst I do prefer the original ( mainly because I like Meurisse/Signoret/Clouzot as actors and Don't like Sharon Stone !! ), the quality of the remake is more than honorable and I think the criticism with regards to it is more due to the fact that it's "fashionable to criticize Hollywood Remakes" rather than something that the criticism is really justified with regard to the film in question.I think that would-be film buffs and so-called intellectuals are lending qualities to this film that it doesn't really possess. The picture quality is lousy and the sound abominable. I really do hope the thing will be remastered and issued with a stereo soundtrack. This bad sound/picture quality detracts from a story which, I fully agree is very well crafted and very well acted. But Hitchcock made films that were far better than this one and also had better picture and sound quality despite their age. So what's new ???? So please, a little moderation. It IS a good film and the plot is very well constructed and is certainly worth viewing if you like Hitchcock-type films. Also, in my opinion, it is the best of the HG Clouzot films. Apparently, Clouzot's wife, Vera, actually did suffer from a heart condition in real life !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>*****POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD*****Would have been even better with the Hitchcock touch...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much as I admire the morbid and fascinating melodrama of DIABOLIQUE--and it IS "morbid", an adjective I don't find among these many reviews here at IMDb--I am convinced that the film would have been even more enjoyable under Alfred Hitchcock's direction, since he would have injected some ironic and much needed humor among all the plot contrivances of the dark story. There is hardly a trace of humor in the entire film, so bleak is the storyline and so intense are the performances of SIMONE SIGNORET and VERA CLOUZOT.*****POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD***** Don't read the following paragraph if you haven't yet seen the film.And there are flaws in the ending, especially the bathtub sequence where perfect timing had to be of utmost importance to make us believe the scene could have actually gone off so perfectly. I can't say more without revealing a key plot element that would spoil the film for anyone not familiar with the story.*****END OF SPOILER ALERT***** The French atmosphere of the boarding school where Signoret and Clouzot teach is well realized, as are all the darker elements of the story which begins when Clouzot's wish to get away from the harsh cruelty of her husband develops into a conspiracy plot with Signoret to set up a murder by drowning him in a tub and disposing of the body in the school's swimming pool.Naturally, nothing goes according to plan and the suspense lies in watching how Clouzot suffers agonies of fear over discovery of the act, especially when an inquisitive police inspector gets onto the case after she visits a morgue to check on the deceased man's identification. After that, he doggedly follows her around trying to solve the man's disappearance.It's all morbidly fascinating and you won't be able to turn away from the last fifteen minutes, during which time the director toys with the audience expectations to the nth degree and provides a final twist that you may or may not find acceptable as far as logic goes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just in time for Halloween</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Diabolique is an excellent film. It has terrific actors like Simone Signoret. What makes it terrific is the suspense and horror that goes with it. From beginning to end, it is a film in time for Halloween. It will make you shiver with suspense. That the truth is stranger than fiction. It is a twisted version of the Children's Hour. The Black and white version is better than any colorized version. I watched a dubbed English version. To see it is to believe the "diabolique." I would have loved to have seen the French version without subtitles to improve my French but this tape was worth the price and it's frighteningly good beyond belief. The ending is worth watching again and again. The film is well-written and acted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Child Can Figure It Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoy great movies, and LES DIABOLIQUES is not one of them. It is a great idea, story, and plot. But it lacked the needed suspense and mystery, as the only possible solution is too easily figured out minutes into the film. The only real excitement comes in the last fifteen minutes, but it takes you ninety minutes to get there. Not worth it.Paul Meurisse's acting was dreadful, Vera Clouzot's was only adequate. The exception in all this was Simone Signoret who gives a brilliant performance; the only main character offering any believability, and in her case it was total and absolute. Watch for Charles Vanel's performance as a "Columbo"-like Inspector Fichet.A good but not great movie, LES DIABOLIQUES is only worth a rental if all the Hitchcock films are already checked out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Snipe hunt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another of those "snipe hunt" movies. I don't know how people pick them to play jokes on others, and I don't care, because the people who rave about piles of crap like this are totally psychotic.It's the story that takes forever to tell, and just wastes your time. A man has a gorgeous young super model wife he wants to kill so he can beat up a pale, homely mistress. The two women conspire to kill him, but you'll fall asleep long before anything ever happens. Yes, you're right. This movie makes no sense, and it makes no sense that a bunch of yokels rave about it, but after watching it, you'll know that those yokels were laughing at you all the time, tricking you into watching this ordeal.I could elaborate more, but suffice to say this is beyond boring. For the first 40 minutes, absolutely NOTHING happens, and you just want to get your hands on the jerk who tricked you into watching this, holding your bag for the snipe that doesn't exist.There simply isn't a single saving grace to this pile of trash. Be forewarned, you will realize you went on a snipe hunt if you try to watch it. I doubt you can stay awake through it in one sitting, though, unless you're a complete masochist.</fullReview>

The dialogue was French, with English subtitles. Not much of a plot, so it's easy to follow, if you can read fast enough.</fullReview>
