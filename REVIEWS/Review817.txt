		<shortDescription>What Book Did They Read ???????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember reading this book and thinking what an amazing Movie it would make. With the right cast and script I knew this could be a winner. I waited for someone to make it and finally they did.We were getting John Cusack and Samuel L Jackson. How could they not make an amazing movie.I waited eagerly to view this long anticipated adventure and thought the day would never arrive when I could get the chance to see it.Then I did.Firstly it has very little in common with the book I read. the book is very clever and draws you into the story. The movie is not clever and the story is thrown at us.In The book we care about all the characters. In the movie we don't.I have to admit I walked out before the end. I just couldn't take anymore.Why oh why did they not just stick to the books narrative.I know you have to cut corners but they didn't cut corners, they invented new corners that had nothing to do with the story.I love Stephen King and have read all of his books but I'm tired of seeing them butchered by Movie makers who just don't understand the story.Save your money. Don't even bother renting this movie.Watch TV instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Adaptation Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First... I did not know anything about this awesome, and I can't say that enough, awesome book becoming a movie. I have had to read this book at least 10 times over the last few years and some of my most favorite life quotes came from this book. So when I saw this as a movie and John as the main role I knew it was going to be amazing. I mean if I could cast the main character myself it would be John.BUT... Well, if the director had made a movie out of the book, it would have been amazing. If the movie had any of the most notable and required pieces of the plot it would have been amazing. If the director had even read anything to do with the book, even the dust jacket, it would have been amazing. But he didn't, he didn't, he didn't.SO... The movie sucked. I don't like to use that type of "language" when reviewing anything, but there is no other choices here. Everything about the movie was wrong and I gave it a lot of room, a lot of space to make errors and not flow the same. Because ultimately you want to be surprised by the movie. You ultimately want the director to make it his own just a little bit, put his spin on something and have it shine even more. And I did, I watched the movie to the very end. Checked behind the credits and everything. And now I wish I would have gone on for the rest of my life without knowing this movie existed. IF... Now one might think by my review that had you not read the book, you might have liked it but sadly that is not true. This is not only the worst adaptation of a book ever, but it is also just poorly put together, scripted, acted, and there is no redeemable quality anywhere.Such as... The sound effects were horrible, the video tried to be dark and creepy, but it was just bland. There was very little action or scare factor other than some BOO moments from the "zombies type people." If you didn't see something coming from a mile away it is because it made no sense. The ending was a little baffling on how horrible it was. I mean I am actually trying to think of one thing. Just one that I can say and would take this movie from a 1 star to at least a 1.5 star. But I can't. I can't think of a single thing that I can look back on and say that was cool/nice/awesome/not terrible.Lastly... So I will leave you with this. I am actually praying that I reach you before you watched this movie. I am hoping one of your not nice friends didn't play a prank on you and made you pay for this movie. It is my desire that this review has reached you before you have wasted one single heartbeat within the vicinity of this horrible, horrible film mistake. And I thank you for reading my review and I am sorry to those that I did not reach in time.Joshua Kyte</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense start but lazy end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This variation of the zombie apocalypse borrows from films like 28 Weeks Later or Kaufman's Invasion of the Body Snatchers. That is to say, it relies more on psychological tension than on graphic violence (but still contains some graphic violence.) The first act is pretty good, intense, sharp, adopting a fast pace that dispenses us of the genre's clichés. That won't last as it will turn into standard fare. Finally, in the 3rd act, the writer completely drops the ball and doesn't even bother ending his story properly. He just takes the easiest way out and deserves some boos for it.Bad storytelling is enough to make a movie bad and a rating low. Here however, I balance it with the impressive beginning and the excellent visuals. Also worth mentioning is Samuel L. Jackson who, for the first time in 20 years, portrays a human being instead of his perpetual annoying caricature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was not expecting this bad a movie with John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is nothing that has not be seen before including poor camera work ,irritating sound effects and aimless story telling. I could not go past 40 minutes of this movie and I have seen all earlier Cusack movies. The cell phone triggering some sort of RF wave induced madness is a novice idea and the execution is amateurish as best. What sucks is the fact that it appears as if Cusack was intentionally directed to ham all the way and Jackson was made to overact. A B movies by any standards. A bad attempt at making a modern zombie movie. Better pass on this or wait for the time when a Day is 25.38 hours with margin to just waste on this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed Book Reader</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first read Cell many years ago, I instantly thought it could be transferred to an amazing movie. (And funnily enough, even cast the same actors in my eyes for both Clay and Tom.)However, the final product for the big screen was such a let down.. Though the scenes they took from the book were fairly accurate, they cut out at least 40% of the content. (Most of which is integral to the story telling and explaining what has actually happened.. The Raggedy Man / Red Hoodie Guy being one major oversight.)I feel like if you hadn't read the book to begin with, you'll probably find yourself getting lost too easily.. There was a severe lack of pacing simply jumping from scene to scene and some changes which in my opinion were for the worst.Overall I did still enjoy the movie, has a fairly unique concept and some very disturbing imagery, but had I have not read the book prior I don't think it'd be getting anywhere near 6/10 from me.SUMMARY: GO READ THE BOOK INSTEAD, AN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING READ.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Might be more of a psychological thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, this is NOT a zombie movie. I don't know what the book was like, but the movie is not zombies, it is people who are being manipulated by a cellphone signal to be violent, and nothing but violent. We get a glimpse at the end as to what is really going through their minds while being controlled.This was an excellent movie but for one thing, it doesn't actually explain why it all happened. So, with a few other clues scattered around, I am pretty sure it is a psychological breakdown of one person. In either case, the ride is fun and with good performances. If you must have all questions answered, and don't like the idea of one person having a breakdown, it will not work for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You may drive a truck through them and they will not even notice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though the movie is not completely accurate to the Book, it's still delivers the same basic message.And the message is this - Modern "Smart-phone" culture turns people into mindless zombies, who are fed through their mobile-phones with information. This information completely overtakes any personal reasoning abilities and turns people into a hive-minded flock who obey.This is not a horror movie. It's not really a thriller.This movie is a philosophical reflection of our modern culture.There is not a lot of action in this movie. The movie is quite straight forward. No mystery or anything like that.Its a bit too long for it's purpose but the actors did fine.The movie is not a sci-fi either. And it's not really a drama.I'd recommend people watch this movie since it might give you something to think about. About how people submerge themselves in their cell-phones, facebooks, and general online feed of informational stream that is being transferred into their brain 24\7It's kind of ironic how this story reflects the already present reality. We already have a bunch of "phoners" on the street.We are all one of them in one way or another.So this movie is a reflection of what is, not of what is to come. As I said - this is not sci-fi, not horror, not thriller and not a drama. It's a philosophical reflection of reality"You may drive a truck through them and they will not even notice"I give it 7 out of 10 since its way too long for such an obvious message. But i'd say, its one of the few King's screen adaptations that are nicely done. It's not boring to watch at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie based on the book, rather than an accurate adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say I don't really understand the negative reviews. I've read and loved the book, but I was always aware that the movie was not going to be an exact copy of it. Yes, people who expected it to be will be disappointed, but don't spoil the fun for others who just want to see a good movie - because it is still a good movie in itself. Giving a movie a bad rating just because it didn't meet your personal expectations is kind of stupid. You should always try to see the movie and book separately. Some scenes, when translated to a movie screen, just don't come out the same way. What sounds amazing in a novel doesn't need to look fantastic in theaters. And that's coming from a writer.Of course, it is a lot harder to make you feel for the characters on a screen than when you read about them in detail. I still felt for the characters. I like that the movie changed a couple of things, but still kept stuff that will remind you of the book (Alice's white dress, the ice cream truck etc....) Some of those book references were used in a different way, but it made me smile. The new ideas were pretty unique and I don't want to spoil the experience. I think the most important parts were still well performed and - last but not least - it was entertaining, interesting, different, suspenseful. 8 Stars - I take two stars away, because some improvements could have been made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent film, despite itself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a purist when it comes to adaptations, and I didn't hate this, at the same time I didn't love it.It almost would've worked better as a miniseries.Cell is a quasi zombie story by Stephen King, circa 2005, it's basically the thing Kirkman ripped off while developing The Walking Dead. The novel is a lumbering, melancholy at and times humorous take on the zombie genre and the mass market emergence of mobile communication devices. The filmmakers do their damnedest at placing it into a modern timeframe, but it's almost too well adapted. While I'm not against changes and remakes, they almost would've been better off just sticking to the material and going all in.Either way, I don't hate, it's just that the noncommittal to either the source material or the new take left the movie in a sort of state of limbo.Overall, I'm glad I saw the film, I just wish it was willing to pick a side and just run with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I had read the first few reviews, I would not have seen this! I'm lazy and prefer eyesight stimulation over mind stimulus. - film over book! Sooooooooo! I never read the book, nor am I much of a reader. Film wise, I also need to watch something that will captivate me , and this did. Had no idea what the film was about, kinda downloaded from a mates computer , cough, cough! There I was at the airport , thinking somekinda of terrorist plot film. And then all hell breaks loose. This is not a Zombie film, this is more scary if you were to compare, a very unusual plot . Yep! I enjoyed it , definitely worth watching , and hey, books can cover, say anything, props are more costly and not so easy to convey to a book. I will not use a phone from now on, maybe texting is safer - ha! It seems all the slagging off, is coming from the read the book colony and they would moan :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of those films I couldn't wait to see - the book is immense, then the casting was announced and I couldn't have been happier. I have seen a most of SK adapted novels and overall I've always been quite pleased, Tommy knockers, dream catcher, the stand, IT, to name but a few. Unfortunately whoever has written the screen adaption on Cell seems to have firstly decided that character development was unnecessary, and secondly appears to have decided to borrow the general idea of the book, however drop all the bits that made it such a great read. Even if I considered this as a stand alone movie - it felt rushed throughout, and you kinda get the feeling they ran out of budget/time at the end. Very worried for the IT remake,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow.. just wow. WTF!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a horrible film. It makes literally no f***ing sense whatsoever. Do watch! So the premise is John Cusack is at an airport and all of a sudden a signal administered through cell phones turns people all kinds of crazy and murderous. And that's where my understanding of this film ends. Initially it's pretty damn funny watching some fat guy with his pants around his ankles beat the living sh** out of some teenage girl but I doubt laughter was the emotional response expected of me. If you are at all familiar with movies or the process of making one you will have a blast watching this! It's comedy gold. Every second of the acting feels forced. Only Sam L. Jackson kind of blends in, though that's mostly to the fact that he basically just hags out. The editing is really off-putting. Really. The camera work is kind of okay but overall there doesn't appear to be any cinematography. They should have called it On The Fly. The scrip is terrifyingly stupid but then has those tiny glimpses of dedication. What happened!? There is not a single second of suspense or anything that could even scare off a toddler. The action-sequences are so incredibly boring and confusing, which is a weird emotion to feel in the first place, but it also shows such a disgusting lack of effort. If you want to see a good movie. Don't watch this! If you want to see a bad movie. I dare you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any movie set to star John Cusack is bound to be a flop. Due to horrible amounts of cosmetic surgery Cusacks range of facial expressions range from a strange open mouth look to occasional movements of his eyelids. Jackson does his B-grade best in his support role but the real issue of this nonsense movie is its complete lack of anything that makes a great book to movie adaption happen.Cell was my first King book and it was enjoyable, with a light hearted message about conformity and mass consumption in the digital age. Characters were likable and the story flowed at a good pace.The movie jumps from one chapter of the book to the next. With large variations and huge plot gaps, mostly for budget reasons I imagine. The plot is slapped together with no obvious direction and characters come and go without any feeling of attachment/likability or explanation of who they are or why they are there. I only knew who was who, because I had read the book, had I not it would have made no sense.I had my hopes up when I read this movie was happening many years ago now. Once again Kings book has not been done justice. The ending made no sense but at that point I didn't care and was happy it had finished.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not talking about it being just a bad adaptation either, the book wasn't exactly King's best work, it was just his jab at a zombie story. However, even a King book that isn't great by his standards is still a good book. He always writes a good narrative and he always has some good and fleshed out characters that grow on you throughout the story.The characters in this movie aren't fleshed out, and they don't grow on you at all. The book was heavily driven by dialogue and through the viewpoint of Clay, the protagonist. There was very little in the way of good dialogue in this movie, there was practically nothing in the way of character development.The plot moved way too quickly to be good, as if they were just checking a list of locations from a list. As a result, the plot felt like a convoluted nightmare where it was impossible to care. I won't spoil the ending but if you watch it, just know it's perfectly normal to feel angry.The movie also had a level of technical ineptitude I thought impossible, with shitty CGI and worse sound effects. I could write for hours and hours about how bad this movie is, but that would be a bigger wall of text than I've written already. Watch at your own risk, but if you want an enjoyable apocalypse story just read the book instead.If you're gonna watch, get a few shots of vodka down you first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well it's a Stephen King movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big Stephen King fan and have read many of his books, but Cell was one I had never read. When I heard of it, the concept sounded kind of neat but I just never got around to it. After seeing the movie though, maybe I was in the right not reading it. They're some good King movies(Shawshank, Green Mile, e.t.c), and countless laugh-out-loud terrible ones. Cell is on a completely new level of crap. Clay (John Cusack) is an artist waiting at an airport to fly home to see his family. All of the sudden, everyone in the airport receives a strange sound from their phones. This turns then into crazed maniacs that know practically nothing except death. They're not technically zombies, they only beat and kill people. In all the chaos, Clay runs into Tom (Samuel L. Jackson). The two decide to stick together to find Clay's family. The only redeeming thing about this movie is the acting is just barely passable. Most things in this movie just make 0 sense. Clay's paintings of a man who is basically a prophet is the guy behind all of the chaos which they never explain. The crazed people are only active in the day, and at night they recharge just by laying there. You can't expect the audience to just understand what's going on just by one piece of dialogue. THE CGI AND EFFECTS SUCK SO BAD, MY STICKY NOTE BALL ANIMATION LOOKS MORE REALISTIC THAN THIS GARBAGE! How were these effects allowed! The first 10 minutes a plane crashes and it is the absolute worst! It looked like it ran at 15 fps. It's inexcusable and makes me regret being born. In the end is it the worst movie ever?: No. Is it one of THE WORST Stephen King movies?: YES TIMES TEN. And with all the terrible King movies, that's saying a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can someone explain the end of the film? I wished I read the book because Stephen King is one of my favorite writers. I don't think Stephen King saw the script himself. He would never approved this motion picture. I thought with that cast I would see a good movie. The characters plaid with without any inspiration and what did John Cusack to himself? To much plastic surgery? Pity. To see this film without reading the book was a bad mistake. The story line, especially the end, needed more additional information. I think that during editing a few important things were edited out. The start of the film promises a lot but as it continues it spirals down. Waste of time and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been waiting for this movie for a long time because I loved the book. The story was fantastic and would have made a great movie but sadly it turned into a great disappointment. I'd say the movie is loosely based on the book Cell, the screenplay is a weak imitation. I know it's not possible to adapt all of the book because of time concerns but most of the original story must be kept intact. They cut crucial events, added pointless ones and the events they decided to keep they totally changed. With these cuts, additions and changes they destroyed the integrity of the story. The characters are so reduced and one-dimensional even John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson couldn't make them work.I'm sorry for Mr.King for his wasted story, he's a great writer.

		<fullReview>Although I wasn't personally a fan of the book, and had little hope for this adaption, the result has been so offensively bad that I just had to give some kind of warning to anybody who is thinking of braving this film.Cell chronicles the adventures of Riddell (Cusack) and McCourt (Jackson) as they attempt to survive Stephen King's story of apocalyptic terror. These are usually fairly difficult to get wrong in achieving at least a thrill or two. Unfortunately, Cell seems to fail in so many ways that any interest is rapidly exhausted after the first 10 minutes.Cusack is appallingly emotionless, Jackson has little to offer thanks to the atrocious script, and the acting is generally poor all round. The soundtrack is obnoxiously minimal and dull along with the addition of songs which feel completely out of place. Both the antagonists and protagonists are unconvincing in either of their roles. And the editing is on par with a student's first grapple of an attempt.What is the culprit behind this? The script, which is devoid of competence and control. From front to back, the film plays like the nightmare it was designed to be, but the sheer absurdity of the characters and the superficiality of the story ensures that most of the horror is effectively nullified. Even the attempts at humour are not dry or cool - they are arid and sterile. And the journey of the film is trapped in an almost episodic rhythm, possibly suggesting that a series of TV episodes may have been more desirable outcome.As it stands, this inept and absolutely appalling excuse for a film is just so bad that it cannot be understated. Worse for King, it is not improbable to say that it will struggle recovering even 30% of its budget. It seems extreme to rate a movie 1 star out of ten. But the rating of 1/10 exists for a reason - unlike this garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Infuriating Title-Grab</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was maddened in 2013 by the harsh truth behind World War Z. It seemed that the producers, in trying to really do what they wanted to do, used nothing from the iconic Max Brooks novel but the title and then made it up as they went along.Cell, based on the Stephen King novel, does the same to a great extent. It does attempt to recreate key scenes and it does feature key characters, but botches them instead where it bothers to try. Nothing about this movie does the novel justice, not even the poor choices in casting.The writing is another level of bad, omitting essential storytelling and dialogue for a bit of running around in the woods and grumbling about life. King's novel had volumes of great work to take from and it's now completely lost in translation.From the opening scene it's laughably executed. The "Phoners" are not the same zombie-like flocks. They're running zombies performed by amateur dramatics students who all have their own interpretations rather than following the right concept (like a flock).John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson are too old to convince us of their characters. Jackson's (Tom McCourt) is reduced from a charming but sarcastic gay, white and balding Boston office worker with a weariness for organised religion, to an apathetic rail worker who was also handily in Vietnam and yet has the strength to outrun running zombies and walk without a hitch across an entire state.Cell also replaces an overlying sense of building dread with formulated urgency and loses suspense as a result. And in ditching the chemistry established between characters - which is how we originally endeared to them - you can't even care about them.Gone are the co-survivors learning to travel by night as the "Phoners" go to sleep. Gone are the several nights learning between Jordan and Professor Ardai about how the Pulse likely works and how they might stop it.And gone is the original purpose of the Raggedy Man, the representative of the flock leading the remains of humanity to their doom in Kashwakamak. Now he's just a white kid in a hoodie and the Phoners aren't developing extra sensory powers as they reboot.For what it is, this adaptation of Cell should have changed its name and come with the note: "loosely based..." In that it would be what it is, otherwise; a really poorly budgeted and executed zombie movie starring two old guys running around the woods a bit until the inevitable crap ending.Samuel L. Jackson will recover with another Avengers movie. John Cusack has now entered the Wicker Man stage of Nicolas Cage's career.Tod Williams was not experienced enough to direct Cell or to take on such a highly anticipated project. All drama is toned down and all action is poorly executed, with much of the suggested good stuff happening off-screen at the best of times. And before you know it, you don't know what's happening and the movie has ended.And don't get me started on the ending. I loved the novel's ending. All because most readers couldn't grasp it, King rewrote it for the movie and it's devastatingly risible.Do yourself a favour if you were interested in this. Just go and buy the book and save yourself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's just get down to it: This is not a good movie. If there was anything I could compare it to, it would be The Happening (except slightly less idiotic). During the entire length of the movie, I couldn't help but keep asking "What happened to John Cusack??". Now Samuel L Jackson makes his share of schlocky B-movies, but he also makes some good ones in between. Lately it seems that John Cusack has taken the Nicolas Cage route of becoming insignificant in cinema. Where Cusack used to make memorable and crowd-pleasing movies, his catalog of recent movies have been average at best - and unwatchable at worst. But enough reminiscing, let's talk about Cell. I never read the Stephen King book, but I knew of the general concept. However, I didn't realize going into this movie that it was basically a zombie film disguised as a tech-horror film. It starts pretty immediately with little to no character development for Cusack's character. All we know is that he has a strained relationship with his wife and that he wants to see his son. Then all hell breaks loose. People transform into angry zombies after a weird signal is transmitted through their phones. There were some fairly shocking scenes of horror, such as a woman ramming her head into a wall continuously - but overall, we've all seen this before in much much better movies.Cusack eventually befriends Jackson's character and they go on a journey to find his wife and son, while picking up characters along the way. Cell would have been a lot better if the characters were actually interesting, but there are no redeeming qualities about any of them. They're as exciting as cardboard, with even duller personalities. Cusack seems to be chugging along and speaking all his lines in a low raspy voice, I guess to seem more dramatic - but his lines have no significance, so it's the opposite of dramatic. It's boring. There are also plot holes galore, with everything important left unexplained. Who's the man in the red hoodie? Why does he pop-up everywhere? There is some gibberish about what the zombies are and how they get created, but there isn't any payoff - and there doesn't seem to be any rules. How come some people become cell phone zombies and some people don't? They're all hearing the same signal. I can understand if this movie was trying to symbolically represent our modern day society and over-reliance on technology, but it doesn't do that well at all. There are no parallels drawn or even characters that care. They all just chug along with no purpose. Just like this movie.And if you make it to the end, prepare to be disappointed even more. This movie feels incomplete and lazy. Like everyone making it just wanted to finish it and get on with their lives. I would not recommend it. Watch 2007's The Signal instead (a somewhat similar tech-horror anthology movie, but much much better done).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cell reception faulty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my review of Cell (spoiler free)* (1/5)Cast: John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson, Isabelle Furhman, Clark SarulloPlot: When a mysterious cell phone signal causes apocalyptic chaos, an artist is determined to reunite with his young son in New England.Oh John Cusack, what has your career come to? There was a time when he was a big star on the brink of awards glory, until it all went wrong for him and he started being in low budget films like this with barely any or none at all making it better. This is just one of those films that seems good but really isn't. Based on the novel by Stephen King a cell-phone apocalyptic horror which looks like it has an influence from the millennium bug which is quite an original concept that has never been done in horrors before, unfortunately in this it turns out that people who use their mobile too much turn psychopathic which is what normally happens when you take someone who is addicted to their phone off them. Not in the case of Cell original name too. The things this film does right is that it quite a starry cast there is John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson who are the main characters, Cusack plays Clay Riddell a graphic novel artist on the way to New England to find his son. Then he meets Jackson who plays McCourt who is a train driver who knows how to use a gun strangely. Unfortunately that is all you learn about the characters and then they meet Alice (Furhman also known for the 2009 horror Orphan) who is Clay's neighbor again we don't learn much about her, the film is very muddled and there isn't much time to get to know new characters because they end up getting killed off. See it's all very original but it's the lack in actual depth that really lets this film down also the really poor acting style oh and the really directing. In a desperate attempt to make this a decent watch-able horror director Tod Williams who's known for Paranormal Activity 2 he tries his hardest to make the characters likable but they are not, well they would be if they were actually good. At the start and when the film gets to it's slow dynamic parts it's okay but still barely watch-able but the thing that really makes this film weird is, that when the people use their phone too much they turn into phoners, just ordinary people with a habit of attacking other poor soles and they end up being conventional cannon fodder. The makeup effects that make the phoners look like zombies (weird) are dreadful in fact they are stomach churning effects and they just worse and worse, in one scene where they find some phoners on a field and decide to napalm them with really horrible fire effects also in desperate attempt to make the movie better.The weirdest part is a dream sequence when Clay is having a dream he finds that the drawing from his graphic novel, he first gets a glimpse of that character in a dream and he has woman on her knees performing fellatio that's about as weird as it gets. There are some funny moments but not enough to actually make this film better than it really is. Clay does show emotion though in a rather poor when he finds that his son isn't where he thought, it just turns clichéd when he finds him at the phoners hive. Interesting horror done really poorly and the fact that it's original makes it slightly better well not really but the lack of character development and no physical attachment, it essential just turns into a messed up Zombieland horror but doesn't have the charm and well wit. Even Sam L. Jackson's charm is missing this horror was just lazy and very stupid just like Cabin Fever 2016. Unwatch-able mess.Verdict: A sort of horror with an original concept but lacks in everything else. Even putting in stomach churning effects into the mix one of the most stupid films this year.2/10 why? Was this even made?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would have been a lot more horrific, if I did not love me cell so much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the poster for the movie, and thought it was an action movie starring John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson about a splinter cell. For some reason I find that appealing, Although Gross Point Blank is an amazing film and if John Cusack's role in this action movie I dreamed up was similar to his role in Con Air and he's just on the poster to sell tickets, that would have been OK.As it turns out, it's a Sci-fi horror story by Stephen King who co- wrote the script based on his story. Still sounds worth seeing. It's not the first time Cusack, Jackson and King did a movie together (in a movie called 1408), so it got me interested.The movie starts out in an airport where Cusack's character, Clay is talking to his ex-wife on a cell phone. When she puts his son on the phone it runs out of juice forcing Clay to use a payphone (lucky him)Suddenly every one using their Cell is hit with a pulse that turns them into raging lunatics, killing everyone who did not hear the pulse.Clay figures out pretty early during the insanity that it's the cell phones causing it. Clay (with the help of a cool cameo from Troma's Lloyd Kaufman) try to convince a girl not to use her cell to call for help, but she does and goes berserk.Running for his life, Clay meets Tom, played by Samuel L. Jackson and the two make a plan to go find Clay's family.So it turned out to be an action movie with Cusack and Jackson going up against....well....Zombies. Not the traditional ones similar to George Ramero's version, but more so like 28 Days Later or something. The zombies start out as raging savages killing anyone not under the spell but soon they develop a way to convert the unconverted.Stacy Keach is in the movie as the character that gives the best explanation of what's going on, some plan by persons unknown to unify us into a hive mind. He seems to be up for the kind of peace that would bring, while Clay, a pacifist graphic novelist is not. This pulse attack also has a weird effect on Clay's mind who has a strange connection to it.It was a good movie, how could it not be as it's based on a Stephen King story, right? It seems that Mr. King may have a thing about cell phones, this is were the story's purpose kind of fails. It was cool watching Cusack and Jackson brave though the apocalypse, meeting some allies on the way and trying to figure out where to go and what's going on. That works, but the horror does not, at least not for me.When the movie ended and the credits rolled the first thing I did was pull out my cellphone. I love my Cellphone (sorry, I'm not gonna lie about it). If you love your cellphone or are so use to it it's like water to you, then the Horror this movie tries to lay on you will fail.Visually, it's a great King story told. there are images in the movie, where we watch the Zombies act like a hive mind that are creepy in the King style of creepy, but most of that was lost on me cause like I said, I like my cell too much. Plus, I have AT&amp;T, so most likely I would never get the pulse signal that turns people into zombies.So it's a decent movie, not will not change the world but cool to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Us, It's a Horror Film. For Our Grandparents, It's a Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, people are going to tell you that this movie is dumb and corny and frustrating. Don't listen to them. Admittedly, they're absolutely right, but don't listen to them anyway.This movie is the closest we're going to get to a sequel to Maximum Overdrive from Stephen King, and it's actually pretty close. Instead of a bunch of disparate stragglers surviving in a world where humanity is overrun by machines being controlled by an alien force, we get a bunch of disparate stragglers surviving in a world where humanity is overrun by people being controlled by an alien force. So it also dips into Walking Dead knock-off territory, where everyone who uses basically becomes a fast zombies, but on the plus side, this still has a lot of King vibes in it.Do you ever think about horror movies after seeing them and realize, if you view the film from the evil supernatural side of things, its motives make no sense. Like, "if the demon spirit wanted to possess the little girl before anyone could figure out what was going on and stop it, why did it spend the first 45 minutes terrorizing the babysitter and attracting needless attention to itself?" Well, this movie is like that: if you think about whatever mysterious intelligence is behind what's happening, what it's having the people it controls do doesn't really add up. But this movie goes the extra step, where you don't even have to shift perspectives and do a thought experiment to see that this movie regularly makes no sense.It's like King wrote down his dream and these people filmed it. And that's kinda cool if you're prepared to view this film like Kurosawa's Dreams or Fulci's The Beyond. If broken and contradictory logic is going to bother you, you're going to be kicking a hole in your monitor. And for all the fun King brings to his work, there's also his usual flaws. In this case: hokey characters. DJ Liquid? The "you're cute" lady? The King Of the Internet? But it's also kind of charming in "King's our lovable grandpa who writes these crazy stories" kinda way, and this film gets past them easily enough with lots of fast paced action and shocking violence.Other pros: Sam Jackson and John Cusack give their roles more weight than the script deserves. You actually care if they survive and worry for them in a way most lesser films don't manage. Stacy Keach shows up for a pretty fun spell, too. The story's also ambitious, playing with big ideas and isn't afraid to get pretty dark and cynical, which is nice to see in a more mainstream horror film with a name cast.Other cons: Most of the down to Earth effects are fine (zombies, gore), but it tries to depict some very big things that clearly just aren't in its budget. There's a scene right in the very beginning where an airplane explodes, which they really should've left off-camera, because it really looks fake. And some shots in the film's climax look like a cartoon.Look, this is a heavy-handed movie for technophobes. Everyone who uses their cellphone turns into a mindless zombie. Characters walk through a brand new movie theater with a giant sign advertising "now with digital Projection," and then immediately into a drive-in movie lot. Keach gives a big dramatic reading to the line, "you can't stop progress, but you're never too old to fight it" before firing a bow and arrow. There's nothing subtle for miles around, and I'm sure we all know someone, probably older, who'll applaud the scene where people throw their smart phones into a fire, thinking finally someone else understands that change and technology are evil.But for the rest of us, it's a pretty fun, entertaining time so long as you're willing not to question everything it throws at you. Fast paced, plenty of thrills, our protagonists walk around with lots of weapons and ammo, and yet the film takes itself seriously enough that it never starts to feel like a bad joke. Silly sure, but earnest. All it needed was a rockin' AC/DC soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved the book, so when I found that a movie was already made, I was thrilled! But realizing I had heard no publicity or hype behind it....I was cautious.Now after watching it, I'm regretful.Not just some, but literally ALL of the best parts of this book have been excluded. ANY of the subtleties and details that made this story shine as a horror have been neglected. The girl who bangs her head at the beginning of the story? She was supposed to have received 'part' of the pulse and only partially had her mind wiped, driving her insane. Instead? They just have her pick up the pulse, then have her bang her head into the wall and smile at the camera?And the ending! If they had at LEAST followed the ending of the book, it would have redeemed a few extra stars. But instead they just take an entirely different B-film route for an ending with strangely out of place music? WTF!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read this book first and it was really good. I'm a big Stephen King fan. Sometimes I watch a movie that was based on a book, sometimes I don't want to spoil the image I have in my head of the characters. I was excited to see this movie because it seemed like it would actually get a fair shake (unlike a few of King's other books that were made into movies), and enough time to tell the story. I like Sam Jackson a lot, and John Cusack. They did a great job in this movie, but they cut SO MANY things out when converting it from the book. Normally this is OK to save time, but I feel like they also cut out the slowly building dread and fear that the book creates.So if you've not read the book, watch the movie, it's a great "condensed" version. If you HAVE read the book, be prepared for a "quickie". Overall a good movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>confusing beginning; sloppy direction yet builds nicely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Samuel L Jackson does his best to hold the movie together, John Cusack doesn't really impress but holds his part well, I don't think the actors fault for lacking real depth, what was given didn't feel robust enough for them to have a strong impact. Unfortunately all of the other actors felt a little bland and two dimensional. Stacy Keach also unfortunately also had a weak role; his part (spoiler) seemed forced and his character felt too well informed for the amount of time given to understand the situation they were in. If you wanted to empathise with any of the characters; it's not easy as everyone but Cusack gets bumped off before you can really connect with them; even Samuel gets left behind as Cusack takes the lead in the last ten minutes. Although the plot was weak; the story line or concept was intriguing (if a bit confusing) and even though I have no problem with low rent movies or something done on the cheap, it did have a feel to it that built from a sluggish beginning to a creepy end. I think Stephen King would be best honoured if this movie was remade in a decade or so when someone has a little more patience and cash to give it the depth it deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm used to movie makers butchering amazing books and crapping out the remains, but when it's done to your favourite author's work, it grates a little deeper. Let's get the obvious point out of the way; this is nothing like the book, there's basically nothing in it whatsoever that actually matches up with the events of the book. It starts differently, we meet Tom differently, we meet Alice differently, the story itself is COMPLETELY missing, vital interactions that make us care about the characters are gone, pivotal characters are watered down to basically nothing, it's a jumbled mess that makes little sense to those who've read the book and will make none at all to those who haven't. Truly a shame, I put off reading the book as the synopsis on the back always made it sound like it would be awful (phones are making people go crazy, Clay is on a race against time before his son switches on his phone...), but when I eventually did pick it up I picked up one of Kings best stories. This is not that story. Dear god in heaven, The Dark Tower is next, and my soul weeps...</fullReview>

You will get to a point when you realize there is no way they are going to be able to wrap this up satisfactorily with 20 minutes left and at least 8 of those have to be the ending credits, the ending credits being the best part of this film.

I liked the fact that it was a Stephen King book, though I never read it, and the idea of technology leading to some sort of downfall is scary in its possibility. All of the excitement started to slowly fade away when the movie fell into what it really was? another zombie movie.

		<fullReview>I really, really loved this movie. At least up until the end.It starts out as a mystery/zombie movie. Everyone's gone crazy, and the hero's family needs saving.There are plenty of points of interest which could have made for an excellent movie. Who created the signal? Who is the man in red? Why did the protagonist predict the events through his comics.None of these are answered. The ending is even worse. Never have I watched a movie spoiled in such a way that I simply choose to disregard the last 15 minutes and make up my own ending.This movie has so much potential. The main character could be dying and the whole story is his conscience over not seeing his son playing out. The antagonist could actually mean something to the plot.This movie seems like Stephen King wrote the first 70 minutes, then M. Night Shyamalan took over the rest, and King forgot to mention the loose ends he should probably tie up before ending it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen King, one of the most successful writers in History, has had variable luck when having his books adapted into movies. Some ones have been excellent (The Dead Zone, The Shawshank Redemption, Carrie); other ones, only good (Christine, Silver Bullet, Misery); and other ones varying between mediocre and intolerable (Firestarter, The Running Man, Dreamcatcher). The most recent one, Cell, belongs to the last group. One of the main problems I found with this film is the fact that it never explains what the "infected" ones are, or what their arbitrary behaviour is due to. More or less at the half of the movie, one of the characters says: "It's too early to know the rules"; and that forced ignorance is extended until the ending. I think that the only rule was: "I can do whatever I want because I'm Stephen King". And then, we have Tod Williams' weak and lazy direction, which doesn't wake the slightest tension or interest. As for the cast, John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson seem to be there just for the paycheck, while the other actors are given the ungrateful roles of generic victims, human mcguffins or forced generators of instantaneous drama whenever it is needed an introspective moment to portray the personal side of this catastrophe which is... local? national? global? We don't know! That's one of the many questions whose answer would have made the film more attractive, or at least, less boring. As for the "horror" and special effects, this is definitely not a gory movie, or an apocalyptic tale on a big scale; it's just a diffuse story about a survivor traveling through the desolated country in search of his family or some purpose behind the tragedy. At least, that's what I think; another problem of Cell is the fact that I could never find a sense of time or distance. Have days or weeks gone by since the arrival of the mysterious signal? I don't know either! But somehow, we must accept that the survivors bathe, shave themselves and keep a tidy appearance during the end of the world. It might be possible the fact that the book Cell (which I haven't read) had a satirical intention, as a rancid denounce against the global obsession for mobile phones and the saturation of "communications" which end up saturating people more. That doesn't excuse the tremendous laziness with which this film was written, but that might explain why the central mystery of the premise is never solved. When dealing with social criticism, there is no need to offer answers, because the point is only pointing out problems, right? Finally, I have to mention the excellent movie The Signal (2007), which told a similar story, but in a much more creative and substantial way. So, I recommend you not to waste your time on Cell, specially when there are much better satires of our technological addiction, such as the previously mentioned The Signal or some episodes of Black Mirror. And I wish better luck to the fans of King's (I used to be an obsessive one during the '70s and '80s) for the next time. The Dark Tower might end up being one of those remarkable adaptations of this author's work; or it might end up being another fiasco like Cell. Anyway... there are still many other novels or short stories to adapt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie out of curiosity, the plot seem pretty good and I found it very interesting but it was way better on paper. The execution in this movie was....an execution I could see people killing their careers after this movie, John Cusak is slowly becoming Nicholas Cage each time his movies are getting worst and you can see how uninterested he was in this one. For the most part this movie was boring I just kept at it to see how bad it got and surprisingly it did specially in the end to me it was one of the most confusing endings ever shot and edited. I know this is based on a Stephen King novel and judging but it's reviews it's as bad as Thinner, I can't recommend this one only if your in the mood for mediocre entertainment with bad CGI, if you do agree on watching this be aware your questions won't be answered.There is a reason this was never seen on theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not horror neither thriller. While watching "Cell" no pulse will be raised, Nothing scary shown on screen, the plot of this movie is so unoriginal, It begins with a father at an airport and he is talking to his son on his phone, he puts his phone away and all of a sudden, everyone around him starts foaming at the mouth and turn into zombies or cell freaks. Most of the things are left undescribed or unexplained in the movie, who was the man in red hoodies.? why he showed up every where.? how they become cell freaks or zombies by just hearing a signal.? Ending is illogical and not understandable. Giving 3 out of 10 just because of Samuel L. Jackson and John Cusack, both carried it well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sadly, I have never read this short story by Stephen King, but intend to do so now, as i found this whole concept very interesting. So i have no idea if it was loyal to the book or not, but maybe that is not the point? Perhaps this film was meant to take it in a totally different direction, and it obviously does, or it would not of upset quite so many reviewers!As one of the few people who still refuses to own or use a mobile phone (or a 'cell' as the Americans call them), it made me smile to read some of the other reviews. I wonder how many people were just annoyed by this film because it challenged the fact they they would be one of the bad guys in this particular scenario? One of the 'Talking Dead' in this techno-zombie movie? I see people using their phones every single day, and most are used so totally unconsciously, which is why perhaps i never have. The idea that our technology can turn against us is hardly a new plot angle for a film, or a book; in fact we seem to be totally obsessed with this idea in many respects, but this was at least a little different &amp; required the viewer to think outside the box, or outside the screen of their cell or smart phone at least.I often see people responding automatically to the electronic call of their phones (one ring to rule you all!), which now appears such a natural response in our modern society, especially for younger people, who grew up when they were already so widely in use. Maybe because i did not, i can see a difference. Without trying to spoil the early part of the film, even when people know that the problem originates from using their phone, they still go ahead &amp; use it, which in an emergency situation I can understand to some extent, but it naturally begs the question, what would you do?As for the lead actors, they were both excellent as ever, and if you enjoy post apocalyptic films, this one might just fit the bill. Someone else referred to it as being like 'The Happening', which i also loved, and i think maybe it is in a way, as it makes you think, and that can never be a bad thing surely? We get so used to watching the well used Hollywood formulas most films are based upon, but for me, it was very refreshing to watch something that is not so formulaic or predictable. The end was excellent &amp; left you wondering, which perhaps was the whole point. How far do we have to go before our technology actually begins to controls us? The fact the you never find out what caused this problem in the first place or why is also excellent. We get to use our own personal on board organic computer, and let our imaginations run wild. Even if why is not really the issue here, it is why we trust so much to this little electronic box of tricks in our pocket that really makes me wonder?I will still read the book and have not see a film adaption yet that lives up to the wonder of a well crafted written story, so i am well prepared for the difference.Love it or hate it, i still recommend it as a good film and one that makes you, the audience actually think. It might be worth considering how much power you are giving to this very new technology, and to the ones ultimately in control of it.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am giving this a 2 out of sympathy, I remember the novel from this film and am shocked that it turned out this bad. Quite possibly the worst film I ever seen...!The start was quite good but it went down hill at an alarming rate and my missus told me I want to watch a real zombie film, now that is bad.It was confusing to figure out what was going on at times (aside from the fact everyone had picked up a virus). Not enough time was spent getting to know other actors outside of the main characters, meaning the film lacked cohesion and it lost the grip of the viewer. Great films have great story lines and hook the viewer in, this film did not.Its a shame really because it had the guts of a good film what with this day and age of the IOT and everyone brainwashed by mobile phones, with more effort and work it could have been a cracker.poor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bizarre horror/thriller destined for cult status</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the many year's movies have existed there's been a large number of questions raised by movies with answers non-forthcoming. These are questions that have been at the forefront of many a coffee date discussion, movie club forum or family dinner. Questions like who exactly is/was the "thing" (The Thing), is it a dream or reality (Inception), what was in the briefcase (Pulp Fiction) and now with this long completed and finally just released Stephen King adaptation we can add why exactly was John Cusack's in danger graphic novelist Clay Riddell so keen to pop on his beanie in the midst of a do or die cell phone lead apocalypse? It's a question we may sadly never have answered and probably the only thing that will stick with you once Tod William's (where has the director who made The Door in the Floor gone?) film reaches its credit sequence, as this adaptation of one of King's least regarded books is one of those films just waiting to join the likes of The Wicker Man remake as a film that's just so bizarre and random it's hard to know who did and why they decided this was a film the public wanted.In all its random glory however, if I was being totally honest, after all the negative press and jokes being made at its expense, Cell is not nearly as bad as it could've been when watched with the right mindset.A seriously daft idea that induces a large amount of unintended laughter, Cell has its fair share of "what the" moments and it's a little sad seeing the likes of John Cusack (although he seems to have sold his movie soul some time ago now) and Samuel L. Jackson act through some insanely bizarre situations; I truly can't even begin to explain a scene involving a field of sleeping cell phone zombies, the film actually has some decent scenes and ideas that make this a B grade experience you can sit back and laugh at or with and an experience best watched with a room full of friends all up to witness a film that should never have made it to the cold light of day.Through the history of movies we've been treated to King adaptation gold, from experiences like The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, The Shining and The Mist, Cell is certainly not one of those and is certainly not a film of cinematic virtue but it's an experience that deserves to be seen as even if you hate every minute of this oddball ride its likely you've never seen anything like it before and if you solve the beanie mystery, please let me know.2 troll lol lol's out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was eagerly looking forward to this one. It wasn't what I expected ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I thought when you get older, the nightmares go away. No, they still happen. They just grow up, too."Aren't you a real Stephen King fan or a zombie fanatic? Best you avoid this film. Something the majority in this movie better had done, when receiving a call. "Cell" is an adaptation of a Stephen King book. And I was eagerly looking forward to this one. Unfortunately I stopped reading halfway the book. Not because it was bad (After all, it's still a Stephen King book), but due to a lack of time. That's the biggest drawback when reading a book. You have to have some free time. And that's just something I don't have unfortunately. The advantage of a book is that the build-up goes gradually, there's room for in-depth descriptions and the characters of different personages can be explored in detail. This creates a unique empathy rarely matched by the corresponding film. And that's exactly where it went wrong in this movie.It's as if King is becoming a glitzy, modern version of Jules Verne. He wrote this story more than ten years ago. In those days mobile telephony was already used on a large scale, but it wasn't as widespread as today. Nowadays an entire generation is hooked to these electronic telecommunication gadgets. I'm convinced that in the evening a majority goes to bed with a sore thumb and exhausted, red eyes. And this because they were sending messages constantly while staring neurotically at the flickering screen of their smartphone. Enter any random public place and you can admire a flock of avid swiping techno junkies.Clay Riddell (John Cusack), a graphic designer aka fantasy artist, experiences something similar as he arrives at the Boston airport. The only difference is that the digital addicts act rather aggressive. A mysterious signal has transformed all of those who communicated with their mobile phone into a bunch of mouth-foaming, murderous psychopaths. Clay flees headlong and succeeds in escaping from these angry zombies. With the help of train conductor Tom McCourt (Samuel L. Jackson), he manages to get to his apartment. This is the starting point of a survival trip to Kent Pond where he hopes to find his wife and son unharmed. And when the girl next door Alice (Isabelle Fuhrman), who also survived the chaos unscathed (but had a traumatic experience), joins this duo they are off on a road-trip through an apocalyptic society.My first disappointment was the opening scene that took place at an airport. I rather wished they had used the location from King's book. Although this setting was perfect to gather a multitude of cellphone users who end up as victims of the so-called pulse. The result is a collection of sometimes hallucinatory images. Such as the security guard who tears apart his four-legged friend. Or that frenzied teenage girl who runs head-on against a wall, with a toothless, bloody smile as a result. And as icing on the cake there's a destructive plane crash (unfortunately with the use of some lousy-looking special effects). Sadly enough there is not much exciting to see after this beginning. The film looks just like a standard zombie flick afterwards, with some survivors hopping around who are being chased by a horde of frenzied "phoners". The only thing still worth mentioning is the scene with the football field. Further it's just a mixture of "The Day" with a sort of "Dark Skies".The biggest reason why I wanted to watch it anyway, was on the one hand because it's a Stephen King story anyway. And on the other hand the cast of course. I readily admit that a collaboration between Samuel L. Jackson and John Cusack is a huge incentive. Even though they both played on autopilot and it seemed at times as if it was reluctantly. For once, I want to put the lesser known cast in the spotlights. In particular those who portray the crazed, violent and mentally ill zombies. These aren't Oscar-worthy performances, but there are some brilliant characters amongst them. For example the eerie-looking cook with his bulging eyes who kills every bystander with his huge kitchen knife. But especially the one who was part of the first wave of zombies marching through the streets. A fairly disturbed type. First laughing manically. And next looking around in amazement. So magnificent that I had to re-watch it four times.Eventually "Cell" didn't meet my high expectations. It's not really exciting. Not for a bit. And as a zombie-like film, it lacks the necessary gore nevertheless. And the precise meaning of this figure "The Night Traveller" also eluded me completely. The end of the movie on the other hand, wasn't so bad, I thought. It highlights the hopelessness of the whole situation. From what I could read, it's quite different from the original ending of the book. Oh well, as I said in the beginning, I've never read it completely. So I can't comment on that. As for myself, I'd feel at home in between those brainwashed creatures, because these smartphones drive me nuts just by looking at them. The warning message from King is obvious. But again, this film is proof that there aren't many adaptations that can match the magic of the written version.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horrible Horror! As an avid Stephen constant reader, I know it is not always easy to transform a book into a movie, and I always give it the benefit of the doubt. There were some great, and then decent movies made from Stephen's books...but this one was utterly shocking. I definitely thought that having John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson as the main cast, we could expect a decent movie at least, but this one was unfortunately not one of those movies. What concerns me is that Stephen co-wrote the screenplay, and allowed this quality of movie to be released? One of his best books were diluted to basically a desperate attempt to mildly entertain you for an hour and a half. This is a time killer movie on a Sunday at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An okay movie, but don't expect to see an adaptation of the book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back when this novel was released, the only thing that went through my head as I read it was "Damn, this would be so good as a movie. Literally just follow the book as a movie script and it would be an amazing movie". And here it is: 2016's "Cell".If you have not read the novel, I think you should try this movie out. It's a totally okay movie, and if you like post-apocalyptic stories this might be right down your alley. The special effects aren't exactly cutting-edge, but I think they worked alright.If you HAVE read the novel though: do NOT except to see the same story. Lots and LOTS of things have changed, and the movie only glances over things which had detailed descriptions in the novel and were important to the story. The first half was kind of like the book, only a LOT faster (which is understandable due to the length of the novel), though the second half was an absolute mess. Entire parts were cut away, and the ending.... oh lord the ending. The ending is not even CLOSE to being the same as in the novel. It takes place in the same location, but literally everything else has changed, and it disappointed me a lot since the ending of the novel showed some very interesting characteristics of the main character's enemies. Overall, the ending of the movie was just lazy.Might be fun to see with friends, but don't expect a masterpiece, and don't expect a perfect adaptation. It's a shame, with such talented actors and such a brilliant novel it must've actually been hard to make it into such an underwhelming movie. A shame.5/10 (this rating is entirely a rating of the quality of the movie, not how good of an adaptation it was.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not read the book by Stephen King, so I watched this film as a stand alone. It is softly paced, in a very similar vein to 'The Happening' which I consider another vastly underrated film.It is as much a zombie film as Walking Dead,(slightly less so, I suppose) being far more about the survivors. The slow post-apocalyptic pace gives all the time you need to get to know the characters and to appreciate the dynamic between Samuel L Jackson and John Cusack. There is plenty left to the viewers own deduction in this, and it takes a far more Phillip K Dick approach to the end, leaving plenty to talk about afterwards.I found the average reaction to it disappointing and would recommend anyone who doesn't need a spoon fed plot line to give it a go for yourself!

		<fullReview>So let me start off that this review is by someone that did not read the book first - I jumped right in to watch the movie.Here again we see the shaky-cam right from the beginning. I really wish filmmakers would stop this, it doesn't add to the movie, just hire a good cinematographer - simple fix. It actually detracts from everything that is trying to be told. Nausea and dizziness are not something you want when watching a feature film.The acting by the extras for the most part is pretty bad. You have to ask, do we really know how humans turning into "zombies" would act? Of course not, but I do know poor acting when I see it and the initial airport scene shows it. And then throughout all these zombie actors have the worst expressions it is actually laughable.Another important point is, just because the name Cusack or Jackson is in it does not mean that they are going to do any stellar acting either. It just isn't in this film.I won't go in to great detail about the story line since most here have already done that. However, I am curious now about the book since this movie is so clearly bad - and I have always enjoyed everything by Stephen King.I would not recommend this film to anyone - not even as background noise while playing games.</fullReview>

It seemed disjointed with no real notion of why the characters were doing what they did. The ending has to be worst I've seen in a while with a lame attempt to be ambiguous. You never really care about the characters either, and while the beginning of the movie showed promise it quickly went downhill and hit rock bottom about 10 minutes from the end.Very very disappointing. In our house, we call lame dumb endings a 'Fin' ending, in homage to those incomprehensible foreign art films that used to end suddenly and without meaning.</fullReview>

When the pulse event happens at the beginning of the movie, the director fails to show that the event is global. We should have seen it happening around the world, it's important to know that the whole world has come undone. After having waited so long for the movie, I can't believe what we got. Stephen King should be ashamed to be associated with this garbage, it's shocking that he co-wrote the screenplay. Lamest Stephen King movie ever. While the concept of the book is brought forth through the movie, it's in a way that has very limited vision. The look of the movie is so dark that it's hard to see what the hell is going on. This book needs to be remade into a movie that doesn't suck. The movie I imagined in my mind when I read the book is an immense movie with an awesome soundtrack, not this sad outcome.

The plot could use improvement, as it's more of a series of events put together on a string, but I watched the whole thing and liked it.

		<shortDescription>Badly done from the outset - not even for fans of the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hello. I am a big fan of Stephen King and a massive fan of the Cell novel which I read in 2007. I have waited years for them to make a screen version of this and have had to endure seriously bad variations on the story such as The Signal to name but one.I am well aware of how difficult Stephen King's long stories convert to video compared to his short stories, and definitely the way to go is to make them into mini-series in order get everything in. The Stand is a good example of how to do this properly. Although not everyone is a fan of The Stand it as pretty well done and starred some famous faces of the time. The Langoliers was another. The Langoliers book scared the heck out of me and although the mini series was often difficult to follow because of the complicated story they managed to get everything in - especially the 'silence', the main scary part of the story. A great example of a short story which made the extraordinarily successful jump to screen was The Mist, in my opinion the best that has yet been done.(I have clicked the box for spoilers) The problem with The Cell is that there is far too much going on in the book to fit into a short motion picture. Yes folks, that book (if you've read it) that took a week to get through is reproduced here quite poorly, in one and a half hours.Clearly, to shorten it down back stories would obviously have to be changed or shortened down but come on, removing them completely and having no back stories whatsoever for most of the characters makes it difficult to bond with them. There are scenes in the film where the characters seem to be very close to each other, and have a strong bond with each other but the movie moves at such an accelerated pace even someone just casually watching this would struggle to find the close relationships plausible as none of the people portrayed have had long enough to get to know each other. The main character, 'Clay', portrayed here by John Cusack is an extremely likable character in the novel. In this adaptation we barely get to know him.Because the novel mostly consists of what Clay is observing, thinking or dreaming, therein is the explanation for the distinct lack of dialogue in the film, and what exists is difficult to understand. Also, the gaps between big events are not filled in for the movie and you will struggle to work out how long the events in the movie will have actually supposed to have been going on for.The Raggedy Man, ONE OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS IN THE STORY is changed from a black man into a white man, and his name has been changed to The King Of The Internet. Sorry to disappoint everyone but the words Raggedy Man aren't mentioned once here. The novel isn't that old and you might wonder why on Earth they did this as the internet is mentioned in the novel so it's hardly that they need to bring the story 'up to date'. This is a contemporary story set in the last decade and they didn't need to do this. John Cusack, Samuel L Jackson and to a degree Stacy Keach are all completely miscast in this production. I do not know what possessed SLJ to feature in this poor film as I've rarely seen him a bad film but he just seemed so out of place here (in the novel he is white, and is also gay - something not mentioned or explored in the movie)The novel consisted of several main settings where the characters settled for longer periods. One important one is missing (I won't tell you which one but it spoiled the film further)Oh dear. I'm ranting so much you, the reader, will probably be having problems following what I am saying. Well, that is the film right there. They should have made this into a mini-series. They should have had some more suitable actors. They should have stuck to the story like glue. It worked for The Langoliers and The Mist. They should have included the levitation and telekinesis elements. They were frightfully important to the story. They should have either ended it the same way as the book (open but you can close it in your mind) or ended it the same way they did The Mist (open, but with some closure). The ending in this was just ridiculous and got me no-where. It was a real WTFF ending.Very disappointed. I initially would have said it was for fans of the book only but if you are a fan of the book you will likely be extremely irritated by the time the end credits roll, or if you haven't read the book you will be completely confused. I'd like to think someone else will have another go at this story within the next 30 years and do a better job. My rating, 3/10. Don't go into this with high hopes like I did. It wasn't a fun ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What were you expecting, an epic movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, let me state that I am not a fan of Stephen King's writing style, although I am in a minority. So, I have not read the book. However, I guess the reviewers who commented on this movie were expecting to get some more bang for their buck (it cost me $9.99 on Amazon). Have they not noticed that Sharknado is in its 4th incarnation at the time this movie came out? The CGI in Sharknado is of similar quality to Cell but that does not stop people from watching the Sharknado franchise. Maybe a classical soundtrack would make the movie a better one for them. For me, this movie is a passable cheaply made horror thriller. I enjoy campy horror films, I guess I'm nuts or stupid. Maybe if they had waited until it came out on Netflix they wouldn't feel ripped off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you read any Stephen King books or seen many of his movies? If so, I'm sorry. "Cell" is best summed-up as an abbreviated version of The Stand - or, at least it includes many of the same thematic elements: a man who represents evil incarnate, a small band of misfits who band together to fight a not-so-epic battle that will determine the fate of humanity for all time, bad taste in classic rock-and-roll music, and a strangely familiar yet confusing and alienating feeling. IDK, it seemed so very "Stephen King" by about 25 minutes into it - it was just boring and seemed like a lot of his other work. As you can tell, I'm not a big fan. Sadly, that is because I have read too many of his boring books.I'm looking forward to The Gunslinger series being made into a movie - but I'm afraid it's going to feel like a longer version of this movie, stretched out into a trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vague nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been tempted to write a movie review but this one angered me enough to the point of doing so. There is very little character development. The film felt rushed and the acting was not very good. I had a feeling that the actors felt that this movie would never see the light of day but since they were getting paid they would just read their lines so they could leave and act in a better movie.Pointless and meaningless gibberish with an ending viewers are left to figure out on their own. The novel Cell ended without answering the question of "What the hell happened". Unfortunately, the revised ending by King leaves viewers asking the same question. Bad editing left me wondering if this production ran out of money after filming.I will say this, I look forward to seeing more from Owen Teague. He wasn't bad in this but not even a decent up and comer could save this stinker.By the way, what was up with those opening credits? That was just bad and annoying, much like the next hour and a half of Cell.Let's hope the forthcoming IT and Dark Tower films are better than this mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best horror movie in a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I dunno what's with these hipster reviews trashing this film, but I highly disagree with every word they've said.The horror genre has been GARBAGE for a long time, with Hollywood spitting out cheesy jump scare 'blockbuster' films that are 99 times out of 100 just BAD films and sometimes completely unwatchable. Literally like 1 good horror film coming out every other year IF THAT. That's why, while watching this film, I was saying to myself 'holy crap this is actually really good for a horror film'. I dunno what these horror films these reviewers are watching are that are so good, but I'd love to see the list. Because the horror genre as a whole has the lowest set bar of any genre out there. Trying to write up reviews comparing this genre to films like Shawshank redemption is just a joke. Reading the premise of the story, they should've known right off the bat what they were getting into, and to complain that it was too campy, is just a jokeThat said, this film was a great watch. Never was there a moment where I was saying 'oh god that is so bad'. It was actually really good. The special fx and camera work were mediocre, but it didn't really hurt the film that much. This would've made a great theater film, but Hollywood no longer supports rated R films, and this is just too gruesome to sneak by with a pg-13 rating. Right from the opening scene we are thrown into complete chaos. No cheesy buildups like most disaster/horror movies. The only gripe i had with the film was no explanation of why any of this is happening, but the film was good enough that it didn't ruin it for me.If you're a fan of actual horror films, and not just some hipster film critic, I definitely recommend watching this film. If 'cheesy' horror/scifi films make you want to write angry reviews on IMDb, you should avoid this film like the plague</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>28 missed calls later.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though 1408 wasn't the best King adaptation made, the presence of Cusack and Sam Jackson gave it that little bit more class than it should have had.Now even though Cusack has gone by the direct to DVD route just of late, and Jackson stars in almost every film ever made since Pulp Fiction, it was always on my to watch list from the moment I heard it had been green lit.A desperate New England artist searches for his son following the broadcast of a mysterious cell-phone signal that transforms people into rampaging maniacs. In time, he and two other survivors attempt to find safety as society disintegrates.....It starts off interesting enough. Almost everybody in the opening scene are talking on mobile phones, which is feasible seeing as the scene is set in an airport. Luckily for Cusack, his phone runs out of juice just as the signal reaches others phones and turns them into extras from 28 Days Later.This opening scene is really tense, and if this was the foreshadowing the rest of the film, it could have been one of the surprise horror films of the year.Then we leave the airport, meet Jackson (who is still in his Kingsman glasses), and the film goes downhill rapidly from there.It's main problem is that it's lazily written (by King), and although we follow the small group of survivors as they meet other random survivors, they have no characterisation about them, apart from the odd trait, and it soon becomes as tiresome as the films lighting.Stacey Keach has an interesting cameo, but without giving too much away, his character and his motivation just reminded me how the Martians were killed in Mars Attacks!!Cusack and Jackson are as watchable as always, but even they struggle with the cliché riddled script, and cannot inject the much needed tension that the opening scene provided.I haven't read the book, but I've read various sources that much of the film is very different to the source material, and the final ten minutes might be very baffling to some, as it could be very easy to lose concentration during the more boring parts of the film, of which there are many.It's a shame, because this could really have been a good solid horror, but instead it reminds you just how great 28 days later is and just how Cusack and Jackson are so much better than this.One of the biggest disappointments of the year.Especially after the opening scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie Manc Review - "Wasted Potential"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read this book, what must be, around 8 years ago. I loved it. LOVED IT. When I heard they were developing a film with Eli Roth directing I couldn't wait. The little he said about his vision sounded great. Yes it differed from my own vision of how the film adaptation of the book should be BUT it sounded exciting. Fast forward 8 years and my sister mentions she saw it on VOD. This didn't fill me with confidence as I was expecting a full wide release but John Cusack and Sam Jackson gave me hope. I finally watched the film and within 20 minutes I knew this wasn't the film I was hoping for. Book adaptations are very hit and miss and it is much harder to please those that have read the book than those that haven't. In the past year or so I've seen Gone Girl and The Martian and both did fantastic jobs of adapting their source material. There were definitely changes here and there but they managed to remain faithful to the book pleasing both readers and non-readers alike. (The trailer for The Girl with All The Gifts also looks fantastic.) This film doesn't do that. I'm not even sure it tried. The things I remember being most excited about making it to the big screen from the book were completely axed. Basically anything that made us care about the characters and would build tension and intrigued. You know, all the things you want in a film.OK so that is my disappointment as a reader. As a film lover though this is also just poorly made. The direction is just plain bad and because of this the story doesn't flow, the camera work is awful and the editing...the less said the better. At one point in the film characters talk about observations made about the 'zombies' and you realise "oh we're definitely a few days maybe even a week into this thing" and you remember the days and nights they have shown but honestly it feels like only about half an hour of these characters lives have gone by because the pacing is terrible. It is the hat-trick of crap (Script, Direction, Editing) that buries it.I know this is a long review and I'm shitting on the movie but it had so much potential that it really disappoints me. There is nothing wrong with any of the actors really and the exact same cast with a better script and better director could have turned the amazing premise found in the book into something that could have made World War Z money very easily but as it is I can see why it didn't get a wide release.</fullReview>

But the supporting actors and actresses were a refreshingly good show too. Isabelle Fuhrman gives genuinely moving performance! Win all round.My fear when turning this on was to see a slapped together, low budget Stephen King TV movie. I wanted to like it, and I wanted it to be good. Thankfully it was! Well constructed.

		<shortDescription>Pretty good zombie film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off... I didn't read the book and don't care if the movie differs, is better/worse, about actually about magical ponies or whatever. Second... I LIKED the ending. It was damn near perfect. This is a HORROR movie! Not some Power Rangers fantasy flick... go watch more of the churned out Marvel drivel if that's what you yearn for. So, from what I can see... that covers the two main complaints I've seen... that it doesn't have a happy ending and it's not exactly like the book (as if any movie ever is). Things I liked about this movie: 1. It's pretty brutal. Unlike stuff like The Walking Dead, these characters don't waste time wringing their hands over stuff. No long conversations in faux-dramatic tones. 2. Samuel Jackson plays a regular guy... no speechifying or witty turns of phrase or jacked up angry rants. He's almost boring. Good for him. 3. A character I thought unlikely to die... died. That always makes me happy. Horror shouldn't play favorites. Also, it was a realistic portrayal of what one good blow to the head can do to a person... none of this 'just knocked out' nonsense. 4. Like I already mentioned... the end. It was bleak. It was sad. It was horrifying. Good. 5. It never made much of an attempt to explain what was going on. Weird stuff happened, kept happening, then it was over. No big scene of exposition where it was all made clear. Good.Things I didn't like about this movie: 1. I think it could have been a bit longer... it seemed like it needed a bit more time for us to cozy up to the characters. Not a big complaint... just... it was pretty fast paced and felt like it could have been slower. That's it... 5 to 1 in favor. I enjoyed it all the way through, some parts were tense and had me going, the end was creepy and weird and bleak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THAT'S NOT AN END, STEPHEN! you shouldn't re write the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen King is one of my favorite writers I couldn't wait to see "Cell" as a feature film. Oh! I wished so hard!With John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson I thought it would be awesome. Even King write the screenplay with a whole new end.You shouldn't have, King! It was unnecessary because the end of the book was intense and got the reader in a cliffhanger.This end is illogical, not good in the narrative, and you must see it more than once to understand it. People ask: Can someone explain me the end? When that happens is not a good movie.There are all the same elements of the book, basically the same story, but is not at the same time. And: why they didn't explain Raggedy Man?? Why??Is a film narrative, I know... but you can make it work and have the audience involved, in the same way the book did (it happened to me with Carrie-1976, and with Firestarter)I would recommend just for rent a weekend when nothing is on TV, but do not expect the greatness of others King's adaptation: is not that good.THE BEST: John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson are awesome, and the carry the movie pretty well.THE WORST: the ending. (but the signal after credits was an awesome touch)6/10 for me.</fullReview>

It starts off as a standard raging horde movie (I won't say zombies due to the fact that the infected are still alive) with a character who has to find his loved ones and some others who tag along because they seemingly have nothing better to do, and devolves quickly. There are no real questions asked about what has happened, with people seemingly going with the flow, and characters barely fleshed out, giving you no reason to care about what happens to them, and in the end you still have no idea what the heck you just watched. And that is my main problem with this movie, the writing is atrocious. Mine is but one opinion in a sea of opinions, however I recommend giving this movie a miss, as you will hopefully save the time I wasted watching this mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The lower-budget "Cell" (2016) wasn't quite the spectacular horror movie that I was hoping for. (A Stephen King zombie film?!) But it was still pretty good ? I'd give it an 8 out of 10.The screen writing and directing are average. The acting seems uneven too. And, yes, that includes its curiously low-key performances by John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson. But the opening action set piece was well done, and it succeeds in capturing the creepiness and originality of King's 2006 novel. What a neat genre- buster too ? this is zombie movie meets sci-fi film meets supernatural horror epic meets art-house road movie. It really is an interesting (and quite divergent) variation of the zombie subgenre.I'll go ahead and answer the million dollar question for those who have read the book. Yes, that widely unpopular ambiguous ending has been changed, and what we are shown is far more conclusive and satisfying.By the way, this isn't King's first venture into zombie horror. He wrote an excellent short story entitled "Home Delivery," which I cheerfully recommend. It's far closer to mainstream zombie horror, and I think would appeal to "The Walking Dead" fans. I first read it in a worn copy of 1989's "Book of the Dead" zombie anthology; it also appears in 1993's "Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite probably, right here, the entire problem consisted on the lack of awareness of the movie itself.Who knew about Cell? Or that a movie with Cusak or Samuel Jackson was about to hit the market? I mean, maybe I'm over reacting with World War Z, but all the propaganda it got, and the fact that it had Brad Pitt in it, assured a success. And I think it would have worked here too.Was it a better zombie movie? In my honest opinion, for sure, it did had a different approach, some new elements brought to the table, but I don't think the big names on the screen made an impact. The acting was average and that's it.Overall, I do recommend this, to a horror fan, a zombie fan or a fan of the actors.

		<fullReview>This is my first review in here and I have to write something to defend this film.As a die hard Stephen King fan, and a huge fan of the original book this movie was based on I have to admit that it is a solid attempt at making this story come to life.For the most time the whole movie is well-paced and sticks quite good to the original concept of the novel. To me, that is a plus, since most of the time, Mr. King's works hadn't had the best of luck in that department. There are a few jump scares but for the most part the movie is just feeding you with the creepiness and the feel of unease. Like the book did to me. Seriously. That does not happen often at all, let alone in King's adaptations (the only exception being "The Mist").The performances were decent, although I felt like the movie could have gone on for a while longer giving us some more background on all of the main characters. That way we would have felt more connected with them, or understood why they make some of their decisions (ie. the lady in the bar). I feel like the movie speaks more to the folk who read the book, which is both a positive and a negative thing. Positive, in a way that us - fans of the book - feel like we are being fed the right amount of Mr. King's genius. Negative in a way that people who missed out on the book tend to feel like they are a bit left out on some of the details. And then there are the special effects - I seriously don't understand why some of the reviewers bash the movie's special effects. They are not there to create the atmosphere, but rather, to bump it up by filling in the gaps. To make it all seem more whole. I don't want to go into details as to not to spoil anything, but I just want to give everyone heads up to NOT rely on the movie's CGI to reel you in. It's not that kind of film.In summation:Just give it time, keep your mind open, switch the lights off and put on a good set of headphones. And don't forget to switch your cellphone off..</fullReview>

It was entertaining and just as good as Carrie, cujo, dead zone, etc. I mean, not the best movie based on Stephen King's work, but a very decent one. Nowadays, every John Doe feels an expert with exquisite tastes when writing a review, so I don't put too much attention in other's bashing opinions, but I'm writing one because I feel bad about there nerds ruining other's work and jobs by ranting insanely and making a few ones avoid certain films. IT'S NOT AS BAD AS TO GIVE IT 2 STARS, come on! Samuel L. Jackson was underused, but did a good work regarding his character. The plot is inconclusive, there's really no explanation of what's going on or what caused the pulse, but that is the same case with the book, so I didn't expect much about that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very interesting Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, like many on IMDb, am a Stephen King fan and I read this book. I did so a couple of years back so cannot remember a lot of it. I remember them held up in the hotel but to be honest I keep on thinking of World War Z when I try to remember the Cell as a book. So I cannot really comment on how close it was but suffice to say it is a departure from the novel. I do not think that is a bad thing because the themes in the movie are still very interesting. The flock and the influence of modern communications in Zombifying us as a people is a very scary one. The movie touched on enough to stay with me and I watch a lot of movies and I cannot say that about many. I enjoyed this movie and I thought it was clever in ways. At times I thought it was predictable and clichéd. it was like I was watching an episode of the Walking Dead or Z Nation as the story line followed in a similar vein. It is not as bad as some make out. As with all movies it all depends on your expectations and frame of mind when watching it. I had no expectations and generally my frame of mind was open so I really enjoyed it.I thought the closing sequence, although somewhat predictable, was quite poignant and I can still see it in my mind's eye. For this alone I give it full marks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not the same story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cell by Stephen King in its printed format was one of the best stories I've read. The character development and the constant tension, and despair, were some of King's best of all time. As for the movie.... I thought I was watching a different story! There are two events from the book, that I remember, out of about 25 at least. This is not a movie adaptation of a book, this is someone pulling a few pages from a book and trying to make a movie from it. Jackson and Cusack are good actors but are wasted in this film and I don't even think they have been cast according to the books characters. They make the best out of their parts, but even fine acting cannot shade your eyes from how incomplete the story is. There's a fair amount of action and gore in the movie but it needed to be 3 hours long like other King films so they could at least include more than a few pages of the book. If you've read the book then avoid this movie as you will be left bitterly disappointed like me. If you have not read the book then watching this movie is like watching a trailer for the book - please go read it and see how great it is! The ending of this movie is just totally ridiculous and let me wishing I never watched it. The end of the book makes much more sense and I have no idea why they did not stick to it! All in all, this is one to avoid and definitely the worse King adaptation to date.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cell is a rather unremarkable film but, in my opinion, so was the novel of the same name, by Stephen King. Its small wonder then, that whilst Cell is quite watchable, its really nothing special either. The film adaptation diverges from the ending found in the book and its not hard to see why. A lot of background content, that helps explain what is happening, is left out. The revised ending avoids some of the questions that would otherwise arise but still results in a film that is far too open ended, for my liking. The cast are well chosen and the pace is about right but because so much back story is omitted, the experience feels convoluted and somewhat disjointed at times, too. All in all, a moderately watchable film but really not a lot else. Five out of ten from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>such a disaster of a film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cell (2016) is quite possibly the worst film made in more than a decade, even worse than The Expendables. I've always known that movies can be good, they can be bad; but I didn't think they could be this bad; it's like this film was made on the lowest budget with a ton of people who knew nothing about what they were doing.Let's start with the camera staff, 90% of the film the camera operators couldn't hold the camera still, then of course the film editing team couldn't cover the splice work. The audio team was of such a quality it is as if they didn't have anyone to cover that part of things. The script writers, oh my god they butchered this Stephen King story, it's actually worse than the book. Last but not least, they picked a great pair of actors Samuel L. Jackson and John Cusack which is what sold the film. The ending outcome of having these well established actors in this film was, I'm not sure I ever want to watch a film with them in it anymore.Talk about a film gone completely wrong, this is a 100% flop that didn't seem like the people making it had any concern for it going anywhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frustrating and Dumb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. First third of the movie was strong and promising but after that it was all downhill and sunk pretty low. The later half of the movie was as if they knew it was so terrible they just stopped trying and gave up.The visual effects are mediocre and unprofessional, the lighting and filters are off, the composites aren't well done. To mask how bad the visual effects are they literally just made them blurry in a lazy attempt to "blend" them during compositing. They wasted a good cast, minus the child actors--they were terrible. I ended up not caring at all about any of the characters because they weren't developed enough, acted unnaturally, weren't believable, given a terrible script and put in ridiculous weak scenarios, and so over the top in certain scenes that it literally made the movie look clownish. Many of the personal situations related to the main characters were too internalized that the larger scope of the movie suffered, and this world in the movie with all the atmosphere they created in the first 20 minutes of the movie just went to waste.The last thing I wanted to see was internalized emotional trash of John Cusacks character regurgitated from Room 1408, seriously if I wanted to watch him weak at his knees with a truly pathetic character I would have looped his scenes from that movie. Room 1408 was a great movie I have watched many times and still enjoy, minus those scenes.Samuel L. Jackson seems out of place throughout this entire movie and his role here makes him seem like an overrated actor.The last third of the movie I stopped caring about what happened entirely and just wished everyone would die already. There is no resolution in the end and nothing gained, it wasn't entertaining and I wish I could get my time back. The choices and characters, script... etc. there was nothing good about any of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"What the hell am I watching?" is definitely the most asked question by this movie's viewers. You are gonna be asking yourself that from the very first 3 minutes of this movie until the end (that's if you can actually make it to the end).If I could give a realistic vote for this movie, it would be -3/10. I am really sorry for rating it 1/10 but I had no other choice.This just made me believe anyone can make a movie nowadays. I have been a member of IMDb for the past 8 years or so and I have never EVER bothered making a review here before this movie. But people need to know it.I write this review sincerely hoping this movie's director will be reading this someday and reconsidering his life's choice and try to do something else with your life. This is terrible, honestly, and I am not even trying to offend anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disjointed and Confusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of the novel and have read it several times. I was excited when I learned they were doing a film adaptation, especially after seeing some big names involved. There have been some Stephen King adaptations that were executed poorly but this has to be one of the worst.Even though I had read the book several times, this film was confusing. The story was severely disjointed and very hard to follow. They followed some of the parts of the book but strayed very far off on most elements of the story. This film never seemed to figure out where they wanted to go with the story. Even the elements that should have been easy to make clear were muddled. I cannot recommend this movie at all. If you're a fan of the novel, just steer clear of this movie. You will be disappointed. Stick with the book, it was much, much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Talk about a film version of "Cell" has been going around for quite some time. Based on Stephen King's novel, "Cell" did not translate very well into a movie--at least a movie of such short length. I will admit it's been (what seems like) eons since I read "Cell," so my review will be based solely on the movie.Any movie that appears on "On-Demand" well before its schedule release date, can assure its viewers of a couple of things: (a) it will NEVER appear on a large screen; and (b) it probably sucks. "Cell" had a promising start. Everyone talking, texting, whatever on his/her cell phone receives some sort of signal and then turns into raving maniacs hell-bent on the destruction of each other and, I suppose, the world. If memory serves me correctly, in the novel, the "signal" sent via cell phones was actually alien in origin. Here, you never know. Clay (played by John Cusack) is disconnected from a call to his ex-wife and his son seconds before this calamity strikes. Thus, he now is on a quest to see if his wife and son are still alive. Along the way, he teams with Tom McCourt (played by Samuel Jackson), and Alice Maxwell (played by Isabelle Fuhrman). During their foray, they start encountering the villain, a/k/a Raggedy. After this, the movie basically collapses into a heap of dung.It was nice to see that Samuel Jackson is able to play an actual "person," as opposed to his usual kick-ass, take-no-prisoners goons he usually is cast to play. This is the first thing I have seen Isabelle Fuhrman in since she totally creeped me out in "The Orphan." Given the chance, this little gal has the potential to become a much better-than-average actress. She has the acting chops; she just needs better roles.I will not spoil anything regarding the "end." Suffice it to say, I was more than disappointed and, actually, left quite confused. I do not remember how the novel ended; however, it is stated that King (who also adapted his novel for the film) changed the ending to "better fit the movie." Rated "R" for violence and language, "Cell" is another prime example of how sometimes a novel simply cannot translate well into a movie. I will not completely pan the movie, but I will not recommend it either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cell,another bad King thing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Opening scene of this movie was actually still pretty good but sadly it is the best scene of the film. After this point it goes downhill and although it gets saved a little by the interaction between Jackson and Cusack the rest of the film just does not deliver.It is obvious the movie had budget problems and it feels like a movie that has been on the shelf for some time and that should have been released 5 to 10 years ago. Another problem was the direction it was going in,because at first they seem to be going for a zombie type of apocalypse but in the end it becomes more like an "invasion of the body snatchers"type of thing. It felt very gimmicky and took the continuation out of the story and it made the movie very uneven.The supporting cast had very limited roles and all the focus seem to go to Jackson and Cusack.Jackson delivers the most and Cusack is playing his best Cusack.It's always a hit or miss situation when it comes to Stephen King based movies and this is definitely one for the miss department.The sets,effects and cinematography were pretty well handled but not enough to cover up the incoherent story or the messy direction of it.I don't recommend it.Put a dome over it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>passable entertainment, until the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen King can write good sentences here and there, even paragraphs, but god does he not understand anything else. He certainly doesn't have anything interesting to say. As usual with a King based script, be prepared for some of the most awkward characters and dialog you've ever heard. This was a passable apocalypse movie until it started taking itself seriously. Yes, this is a "zombie" movie, but the "zombies" here are not actually dead, which was a relief. There is no excuse anyone can conceive of that would enable dead creatures to be walking about, let alone eating things, and not getting consumed by, well, all the things on this earth that consume dead things very efficiently and quickly. Anyway, the film meanders around for about 90 minutes and then it ends. And the ending is so terrible one wonders why they even made this. King never knows how to end anything, so he goes for the cheapest shot imaginable. So long as it's "unexpected" King thinks it's good. The problem is, King always tries for the shock or unexpected ending and most always it has nothing to do with the story or is some revelation that is introduced just to end the movie, out of nowhere. It's not good. Don't bother watching this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a massive Stephen King and was so excited about this film. Sadly it was diabolical. It seemed cheap - not sure what the budget was - perhaps they spent it all on Samuel L Jackson, because the effects were shoddy, the directing and filming were crap and the whole thing was disjointed. What a complete disappointment. Early on in 2007 or so, Eli Roth was going to make this movie. Something went wrong and he stopped. I can only imagine his version of it would have been far superior - but then 12 year olds with iPhone cameras could have possibly created a better version. It honestly was bad, but by all means, watch it and find out. Save it for a night when there's sod all on TV and you can't sleep though.</fullReview>

I was sadly mistaken and was left, at the end feeling a little peeved at a lazy adaptation of what could have been so much more. The entire story seems to sail by at such an alarming pace, that character building and plot were too loosely stitched together.The evolution of the effected, which plays probably the largest role in the story telling was lazily skimmed over between scenes and left the entire affair feeling confusing and lackluster. Jackson and Cusack's performances were fine, but I feel that the movie could have achieved the same level of disappointment without having 2 well known actors in the credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stephen King Should Be Ashamed - Pontypool Ripoff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is a bad riff on the film Pontypool (2008) which was based on the book Pontypool Changes Everything (1995). I don't want to give anything away, but where this film is laughable, Pontypool is down right terrifying. It is well worth the view. Cell is an American film set in an all too familiar setting with all too familiar cast members with nary an original concept presented throughout the entire film. The location setting actually detracts from the ambiance because it is simply too familiar and too normal, which in effect makes it unremarkable. Sadly, it stands out in that regard because the acting was even less remarkable which made the rest of the flaws glare off the screen. In contrast, Pontypool is a Canadian film set in an unfamiliar, yet somewhat familiar setting that is both isolating and eerie yet could be the next town over. The location setting is almost a character unto itself, although not quite. But, it does make the film work.. well. And unlike Cell, the acting is superb. The lead is likely the only familiar cast member to most film fans, yet, everyone carries their weight and their matter of fact, everyday style makes us believe this is a real town, real people, and a real situation. If you liked Cell, you'll love Pontypool. If you hated cell, you'll really love Pontypool. I think it's better to presume that King attempted a bad knock-off of Pontypool than to think he birthed this stinker as an original idea. Pontypool is one of the unsung and under-rated scary films of the last decade. Give it a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No spoilers, would have had to write 40 pages if I went that route. Terrible film. I wouldn't recommend Cell to anyone except perhaps if you want practice writing critiques of bad films. Initially hard to understand when supplied with veteran actors and a novel by Steven King the screenwriter and director should have been boatloads of material available to create a decent film. I thought I noticed that Steven King was listed with screenplay credits but if thats true it just makes this mess all the more difficult to understand. And before go any further I want to point out that I don't have any problem with the stories premise, it could have worked. And I have read the book from back in 2006 which I thought worked better in every way than does the film. For me the problems start early, once the 'event' begins the directors choice of shots removed me from the events he shows on the screen. A technique he employed throughout the film to eliminate tension, so you can forget about anything like horror. Often films today rely too heavily on CGI rather than story but I can't blame these guys for that because in Cell the CGI sucked. If you're going to write it into the story then spring for enough to make it look real or do everybody a favor and edit it out. Could have used a strong dose of character development? or at minimum try and get the audience to like, relate to or care about the characters but that didn't happen. Another issue,the city of Boston has like 650K people yet 20 minutes after the start of the event the streets are deserted and remain so, really? That premise might have worked in some suburb but not in downtown Boston. Too many scenes didn't add anything to the story, seemed like they were written just an excuse to off a few characters, throw in some bad CGI or just waste time. All in all it make for poor scene selection and worse storytelling. Then there's the ending... like out of a bad 70's TV movie, dreadful.Really seemed like the screenwriter and the director were totally unprepared to develop this type of film. Like it was a film project they had to write, shoot and edit in a single weekend. I'd suggest both the writer and the director watch a classic like 'The Birds' or for a more recent film that was infinitely better in that same genre, 'World War Z'. I'd suggest the same for anyone thinking of renting this dog</fullReview>

Jackson, Kingsman: The Secret Service.The end of the movie had me saying "What?" If a movie can do that with style, hell yeah I'm giving it a "10" rating. The ones who don't like this movie are probably zombies already.Sep. 2014, Mount Ontake in central Japan: confirmed that of the 56 people who died when the volcano erupted on--people found with cellphones in their hands.</fullReview>

It's basically The Walking Dead except The Walking Dead is a character-driven thrill ride whereas Cell is a low budget borefest. It begins with a father at an airport and he is talking to his son on his phone, he puts his phone away and all of a sudden, everyone around him starts foaming at the mouth and turn into zombies. He escapes and meets Tom mccourt, a very annoying and cliché'd character. Together, the both of them form a strong friendship.I lost interest in this film about 20 minutes in, because i knew exactly how it was going to turn out. I wont give away any spoilers but it's exactly what you think will happen. The script was so predictable. It tries so hard at character development but it ends up cliché'd and annoying. There is no plot twists or any level of shock that would make you care enough to actually be shocked. I am a fan of Stephen King's work, but i have not read Cell. I would imagine the book is a lot better than the movie. 95% of the time, that is the case with most book to movie adaptations.Overall, this was a sad attempt at the low budget zombie flick as the special effects were poor and the make up on the "zombies" was pathetic. The ending was okay and it was for this reason i gave it a 3 out of 10. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, even if you are a fan of Stephen king, do not go and see this movie but instead, spend your money on something more worth your time.3/10</fullReview>
