		<shortDescription>No western has ever come close to this one....and no western ever will.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't quite find the words to even come close to describing the pure brilliance of this movie. When this movie was made, the western genre was dominated by the big hollywood studios. The western was taken by these studios and transformed into an opportunity to portray classic superheroes like John Wayne and Burt Lancaster in their fight against all sorts of smalltime crooks and outlaws in smalltime stories and smalltime towns. It was a genuine effort to portray 'Americanism', the American Way, along with a romanticised view of the west as 'Frontier country' where good always triumphed over bad and where the life was hard but honest. It was the American Way.And then came this film. The title, 'Once Upon A Time In The West' must have seemed to mean nothing more than 'just another western' to the unexpecting viewers at the time. Oh boy were they wrong. With this movie, Sergio Leone singlehandedly redefined the western genre and no American western would ever match the brilliant spirit in which it was made. While the story is basically the same as in any other western, it is the WAY in which it is presented that so clearly distances this western from others. Whereas other westerns are simply stories that are designed to entertain, this movie is an emotional masterpiece that will move your heart. Sergio Leone takes the ordinary western and replaces words with looks, and conversations with feelings and emotions. With his brutal but honest portrayal of the sheer hardness of life and death in those times he thoroughly destroys the old romantic idea of the west as a 'generally-hunky-dory-kind-of-scene with the occasional bad guy and indian' and replaces it with an eerie, dark, hot and dry place where life is cheap and only the strongest will survive.I cannot adequately convey in words the way in which Sergio Leone deepens and defines the characters by pure means of visual persuasion. It starts with the three gunman in the beginning of the movie, waiting for some reason at a train station for someone or something that obviously is going to be on the next train. No explanation, no conversation; not a word is said. Even the stationmaster is ushered into captivity without a single audible threat. Then comes the waiting... Any other director would have skipped directly to the moment of arrival, but Sergio Leone takes minutes of boredom and translates it into a visual feast, deepening the characters that are portrayed and making them more human, more real to the viewer, while at the same time encompassing us with a deep dark sense of foreboding. This way in which the story is not just augmented but in times completely replaced by the sheer visual drama, is perfected by the absolute fantastic music, directed by Ennio Morricone. Who needs words and explanations when the combined forces of cinematic mastery and heart-tearing music are not just able to carry the story, but pick it up and push it up to such heights of excellence that it has no equal in it's genre?Another great feat that adds to the power of this movie is the minimalistic way of portrayal of the characters as real, emotional people. Not a single word is said that isn't required for the understanding of the story, yet the characters feel more true than those in movies where whole conversations are added merely to explain their motives. Instead of words, the camera focuses on the characters...so that you can simply read the emotion off their faces. Often no explanation is given other than than a mere facial expression. No superheroes or supercriminals, just real, desire-laden, traumatised, obsessed people that act upon motives inherently understood by the viewer.All in all this is without a single doubt in my mind the greatest western of all times, and even though Sergio Leone has made many more mindblowing, heart-shattering westerns like this one, like 'A Fistful of Dynamite', 'The Good The Bad and The Ugly', and 'For a Few Dollars More', none could equal 'Once Upon A Time In The West' in sheer magnitude of perfection. Western has never been the same since....I only wish I'd have been there in 1969 when the movie was new and see it, for the first time with fresh innocent eyes and an unexpecting mind..just like 2001: A Space Odyssey (also of 1969, a year of legends).A tip for those who have never seen this movie: Bribe, beg, borrow, or steal yourself into possession of a Videobeam and Hifi-audio equipment if you can't find a cinema that is showing this movie. Turn the audio up WAY HIGH (never mind the neighbors) and prepare never to be the same again.........I (obviously) gave this movie a 10 because no matter how hard I try I can't find anything less than perfect about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's two things that stand out to me always about this movie, and indeed about all of Sergio Leone's movies. One is his understanding of pacing events, and the other is using his actors/actresses to actually act. When you see Claudia Cardinale riding up to the ranch, all you see is her face, but you can tell instantly what she is looking at and everything she's feeling. You know Henry Fonda's the bad guy, but when he smiles faintly at the young boy, you feel there's something more to him, a personality and human qualities, even if he is evil. The final shoot-out itself is a masterpiece. The two protagonists say nothing, but as they face off the music lets you know the moment as come. As they stand ready the scene that's been hinted at throughout the movie plays out like a dream, revealing what the whole story was about. Then, without warning, they draw and fire. Just as in real life, it's over before you notice it. What today's movies lack is how quickly they cater to MTV video inspired nonstop action and endless clichés. The bad and good guy duke it it out, the violence is so extreme that no human could actually survive it, and always just when you think the bad guy is dead he gets back up for one last shot. How much I wish today's film makers would learn Leone's lesson about TIMING, and let suspense build rather than force it in. The music score, which had certain pieces and sections for various moods and to signify the main characters, is one of my favorites. Even if Clint Eastwood wasn't in it, Charles Bronson fills the role of the mysterious stranger and adds his own elements to the character. How I wish they still made movies like this</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Something To Do With Death"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio goes Hollywood for this big-name, big-budget Spaghetti Western. Fonda, Bronson, Robards and Cardinale queue up and take Leone's choreographic direction in an epic tale of blood and revenge.Frank is a bad guy who has killed a lot of people. He now works for a railroad entrepreneur whose ruthless sterile tracks are spreading ever westward. The time has come for the real Americans to confront both the railroad and Frank.Leone sat down with film intellectuals Bernardo Bertolucci and Dario Argento and watched dozens of Hollywood westerns. From this saturation-viewing emerged a 300-page treatment which was eventually distilled into the script, penned by Leone and Sergio Donati. There are conscious echoes of "Shane" and "High Noon" in the meticulously-plotted screenplay. Ennio Morricone apparently sat in on the planning stage and had composed the score in toto before shooting began, the reverese of the usual process of fitting music to existing footage. The result is a tight matching of soundtrack and visuals. Robards, Bronson and Cardinale each have musical 'signatures' which play whenever their characters are onscreen. Bronson's is an eerily-wailing harmonica, Robards has the plonking banjo and Cardinale the lush strings. So intricately was everything structured that the themes were available to be played on set, so that the actors could co-ordinate every nuance of gesture to fit with the score.The film is a grandiose lament to the death of the Wild West. Decay is everywhere to be seen. Streets, bars, buildings and people all have a beat-up, grungy look. When Cheyenne (Robards) pauses beside a rough-hewn wooden post, there is little difference in texture between his face and the post. Morton the cripple is killing the romantic West of open spaces with his "snail trail" of railroad tracks, leaving the fine adventurous men (Cheyenne and Harmonica) nowhere to go.There can be few opening scenes with the visual and aural brilliance of this one. Three bad guys stake out Flagstone's railroad depot in a High Noon pastiche. Jack Elam (who was actually in "High Noon") leads the villains. The only spoken words throughout this long (but totally gripping) scene are uttered by the old station clerk. Haunting rhythms raise the tension to an unbearable pitch ... the squeaking windmill, the chattering tickertape, the creaking bench. This wonderful crescendo climaxes with the appearance of Bronson, a sequence as stylised and choreographed as a Shinto ceremony, all the more effective for the absence of spontaneity.Equal to and counterbalancing this scene is the very next one, the introduction of Frank. This time it is "Shane" that gets the treatment as the McBain boy spots five men in yellow duster topcoats. A growing sense of unease on the McBain homestead is beautifully conveyed (was the stopping of a cicada chirp ever so effective?) A cinematic multiple orgasm ensues, with the musical theme crashing in as the boy sees the devastation, and the camera swoops round to reveal the baddie to be none other than Henry Fonda as Morricone's trademark solitary tubular bell peals out.Cheyenne's entrance is also a piece of impressive cinema. Inside Lionel Stander's strange labyrinthine tavern, quite unlike any saloon ever filmed before, the violence which hovers around Cheyenne like a dustcloud is heard but not seen, preparing us for his appearance in person. The sliding of the lamp towards Bronson works brilliantly, the film's two good men sharing the light of humour, the symbolic forging of a meaningful friendship.By a slow accretion, the plot reveals itself. The leviathan of the railroad must be stopped, and there must be a reckoning with Frank. Gradually the fates of the main characters converge, and swim into sharp focus for the shoot-out.It is not the story, excellent though that is, which lingers in the memory, but rather a hundred individual flashes of brilliance: Claudia Cardinale (are those eyes for real?) filmed on the bed, viewed vertically downward, through a lace canopy: Cheyenne's surprise method of concealing himself on the train: Morton ("when you're not on that train, you're like a turtle out of its shell") imprisoned by the armature that helps him walk: the 'heartbeat' of the train's engine during the cardgame: the tension of the ambush preparations against Frank: the eruption of guitar music as Bronson enters the frame: Bronson's stillness and self-possession, the emblem of his righteousness: Fonda's eyes flickering rapidly in his motionless head, denoting the waning of his self-confidence: the amazing super-close-ups of Bronson: and the weird brick arch, the only man-made intrusion into the entire terrain, and the focus of human depravity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank god that I'm a Bronson fan. This was my first Leone movie, and dumb kid that I was, I actually watched it thinking I was in for a typical Bronson "vehicle"! Looking back I'm thankful, because if it wasn't for his involvement, I would never have discovered the beauty and majesty that is Once Upon a Time in the West.I absolutely love this movie. It's probably my all time favourite, certainly one of the few that I can watch OVER and OVER again without losing interest. I love the way Leone creates intrigue and mystery around what is a relatively thin plot. He can make even the smallest twist of fate seem like an epic turn of events, with that amazing sense of revelation that he generates out of old hackneyed situations (something Argento has since picked up). Leone proves in this film that he could seemingly take anyone, even peripheral characters, and give them screen charisma without using dialogue as a crutch.OUATITW features the most tense two man stand-offs ever, with some serious deja-vu in the direction of his "Dollars" trilogy. In fact, it does feel like those three movies were warm ups, practice sessions in the build up to OUATITW. Here though, he perfected everything; despite the long running time, it's all focused, and without a single irrelevant scene. For me, the two hours plus just fly by, I wish it would never end. Leone was without question at his artistic peak when he made this, that's not to say that he went downhill from then on, but I honestly don't think he ever did another film where everything came together so perfectly.The cast is flawless. Fonda eclipsed every good guy he ever did in one fell swoop, truly chilling. Robards is a great comic character, the lovable rogue with an edge. And Cardinale is more than just (incredible) window dressing; she switches between passionate, angry, delicate and sentimental at all the right moments.Which leaves the hero; I'm a huge Eastwood fan, but I honestly don't believe he could have done the role justice. His "man with no name" was a cool, sly character with hidden complexities. Eastwood always does these layered personalities, with some kind of mental baggage. Bronson, on the other hand, mostly does himself; simple, uncomplicated figures with only one state of mind, that's why he's put in so many revenge flicks. Plus, he looks like he's been seriously wronged at some point in his life, Eastwood doesn't have that quality. Bronson is the genuine hard-as-nails article. You can readily imagine that, had he been born decades earlier and been put in the same situation, he would resolve the problem in much the same way as his character in the movie (sometimes I affectionately refer to this movie as Deathwish part 0- could Harmonica be the great granddaddy of Paul Kersey?).Of course the other great contribution is the music. I still think that the main theme is one of the most breathtaking pieces of music I have ever heard. It affects me deeply whenever I hear it, regardless of the mood I'm in. Maybe I should listen to more opera or something, I don't know, but that's the way I feel. And the individual character themes are just so well integrated into the film, it's unbelievable. Leone replaces words with music, and it conveys so much more in return. Bronson just plays that melancholy tune on the harmonica instead of answering people back, it consistently cracks me up.High Noon, Naked Spur, Shane, The Searchers, etc. are all classics of the genre, but I really don't think it's possible to compare those "traditional" westerns with OUATITW. For me, it exists on a plane of it's own, it's the kind of film experience that you let wash over you, a waking dream. I recommend this movie to anyone, if you're on the right wavelength you'll be greatly rewarded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one only gets better with each viewing. Leone's masterful storytelling and Morricone's crazy, beautiful, epic soundtrack; desperate, haunted faces which look like the barren landscapes the story is set in and a plot that unfolds with impeccable pacing to culminate in THE ultimate western finale.As in Leone's previous films, music isn't just used to add to the atmosphere but is essential to the story, or perhaps even more: Morricone's main musical theme plays the actual role of a (or rather: the) protagonist in the film. Anyone who thought that the so called "Spaghetti westerns" were nothing but cheap, violent B-movies had to reconsider after seeing this film. It doesn't get any better than this: this is movie history; iconic, classic, unforgettable, epic. For this film, I just run out of superlatives.My vote: 10 out of 10Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought I knew westerns, I'd seen John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, Glen Ford, Audie Murphy, Richard Widmark, Alan Ladd, all of them save the day many times. I was wrong, I was 14 yrs old when I went to the local movie house to see this movie in 1969. My grandmother took me, she had always been a huge fan of Henry Fonda's, and even though she didn't care for western's, she dragged me to this one. I'll never forget how engrossed I was from beginning to end. And this one movie was the basis for all my future wish's to have been born a cowboy. Everything about this movie impressed me one way or the other.Simply put, this movie is the most visually stimulating and engrossing movie I have ever watched. I have seen plenty of great movies in my in my fifty years of life, but this one, is in my opinion more than a movie, it's a piece of history unfolding in front of your eyes with no censorship or BS added for flavor. True, the movie has been chopped up some for TV and other forms of presentation, but when I was in that theater in 1969, the movie was, to use a semi modern term "AWESOME".No one, not even if you dislike westerns, should pass on this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone's film unfolds across the screen in time and space with all the mellowness and majesty of such great Westerns as "Shane," "The Searchers," and "The Magnificent Seven."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Once upon a Time in the West" is Leone's masterpiece and certainly one of the best Westerns of all time... It is beautifully shot, perfectly cast, ambitious, erotic, humorous and wonderfully scored by Leone's regular composer Ennio Morricone, whose haunting melodies are just as important as the widely separated dialog occurring on the action..The film opens with an extreme close-ups of Jack Elam, Woody Strode and Lionel Stander waiting at a station for Charles Bronson... Henry Fonda has sent them to kill him...The railroad wants a property for its water well belonging to the newly widowed Claudia Cardinale, a fancy lady from New Orleans who just arrived in Flagstone and learns about the tragedy... We would come to understand, much later, Claudia Cardinale's role as the bearer of water, life, and continuity to the civilization of the New West...Fonda, a despicable hired gun, kills her husband and orders, without a twinge of guilt, the slaughter of the entire family, innocents women and children...Henry Fonda, in a chilling performance, plays the cold-blooded murderer, the most vicious villain in Westerns history to ever ride the big country... the blue ice-eyed child killer, gunning down a 9-year old boy...Bronson as 'The Man' is like Clint Eastwood 'The Man With No Name,' with only one thing in common: they are the most ruthless heroes in Westerns history sharing the same character in their quality 'not' to say much in their need of emotions, in their fast draw, in their disinterest in women, in their air of mystery and in their macabre sense of humor...Their differences are also very clear: 'The Man With No Name' has no past whatsoever, and 'The Man' is motivated by revenge to settle an old personal score... Claudia Cardinale plays Jill, the well-proportioned, husky-voiced beauty, the lady, the businesswoman, the maker of coffee involved with Fonda in an incredible perverse erotic sequence...The blood, the violence, the humor, the several gunfights and the final showdown have been constants in Leone's Westerns since "A Fistful of Dollars"...The highlights of his movie are so many: Leone's overwhelming shot when he raises his camera over the Flagstone train station office revealing the sprawling town; when he replaces a shot of a smoking gun with a shot of a smoking train; when he uses close-ups instead of dialog to reveal what a character is thinking; and the striking use of his extreme close-up in the final shootout... Leone builds up tension by slowly circling his two characters, focusing with his camera on their eyes, hands and guns while the level of the music is raised to evoke the action... Leone's film is a brave epic Western, extremely violent, immensely powerful... It's above all fable and fantasy, as the desire for revenge is childish and fruitless... It is the essence of a great filmmaker...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sergio Leone:I salute you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have recently commented on Leone's GBU and was intending on reviewing AFOD and FAFDM as well as this one - OUATITW, but after reading a number of the comments about these from all the avid fans on this great site, I will simply give you a short account of how these films have affected my life. I am 55years young and saw all these films on their first release in Sydney.(late '60's) They were cut, but it didn't stop me seeing the brilliance in them. I would imagine that a lot of the members of this site are much younger than myself and have only watched these films on DVD or TV quite recently. (Stood the test of time, eh!!) (WideScreen is a must for these.) Leone's films exhibit an idealism in art that surpassed his Hollywood models (eg: Ford). Although, at the time of creation, I doubt he would have thought he was. He simply had a vision.From film to film he improved on this. Like most artists, I don't think he was too concerned with the financial gains that might or might not be realized.(This was probably his downfall). That these little films can impress all you younger fans so much says a lot about good taste and the sad lack of it in American films of recent times.Great directors, like Leone, don't come along every day and it saddens me greatly to know he died before he was recognised for the genius he surely was. Morricone must be 75 now, soon we will loose him too. I am a successful composer in Australia and can tell you, without bias, that Morricone is in the top five best ever film composers just from these four films alone, if not one of the best composers in general (yes, this includes Stravinsky, Bartok, Debussy and Schoenberg.) of the 20th century. Eastwood is also reaching the end of his life and although I'm not a huge fan of his recent work, he is one of the last living greats. Without the inspirations put forth by these men, I might not still be writing and recording my music these days. Plenty of times I could have stopped when things got tough but all I had to do was revisit these gems of modern art to realise that greatness does still exhist , all you have to have is the love and desire and guts to make your visions a reality. Leone, Morricone and Eastwood: I salute you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one true masterpiece, I can't remember any other movie (and I have seen a lot of movies) that is so powerful like this one. This movie has everything great ambient, scenes larger then life, hypnotic Morricone music and what is most important great acting. In this move Sergio Leone proved that he is one of the most unique directors in movie history. If you saw this movie you know that almost every scene is great piece of art in almost every scene you are amazed by visual style of Leone. In all other great movies (like: Godfather, Casablanca, Citizen Cane, Notorious,Big Sleep, The Third Man, etc.), you won't find these many great scenes like in this one. This is an ultimate Western and i want to say: Thank you Sergio Leone for your great vision and this masterpiece, after this one there is no need for any other western, in compare to this one John Fords westerns are movies for kids and women.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are few movies that can combine great directing, acting ,music, cinematography, and writing into one movie, but this one does. There are no weak points. Every scene is a piece of art. I know of no other film that affects the senses as this one. Henry Fonda said this was his favorite film and role. It's easy to see why. He created 1 of the great "bad guy" roles in history. In a side note, Leone wanted to put brown contacts in Fonda's eyes,("who ever saw a villain with blue eyes", Leone said), but Fonda wouldn't have it, and the effect is magic in the famous Leone close-ups. Bronson, Cardinale, and Robards are equally powerful, all have great lines and the camera loves them. Speaking of cameras, the visuals are stunning. There is nothing fancy about this movie. Raw power is what you see and feel. Simply the best western if not film ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once Upon A Time.......................There was Sergio Leone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No other films in the world have produced such sharp, raw, gritty and atmospheric yet absolutely beautiful cinematography as those directed by the Italian director, the great Sergio Leone. Audiences around the world saw first hand the power and influence "A Fistful Of Dollars" bought to the world. It made a director famous, a young Clint Eastwood a household name and the Western more popular than it had ever hoped to be since the master works of John Ford. However, Sergio Leone bought with him a whole new sub-genre - a whole new style - and the Western had never looked darker and grittier. 'The Man With No Name' bought with it a whole new meaning to a heroic protagonist. There was no more good guy/bad guy, but only a survivalist type - ignorant and self indulgent, yet still moral and fair, tough and smart and damn good with a gun. The world fell in love with him and anticipated its sequels which only became more violent, atmospheric and realistic and gave the authentic true feeling of the West.It is why I consider 'Once Upon A Time In The West' to be Sergio's definitive masterpiece. He took everything that he ever felt about the West and made some of the most intriguing 3 hours of film ever produced. The budget had never been bigger. The plot had never been more riveting. The music and setting had never been more epic and the cinematography had never been more powerful. This film is perfect, start to finish!This time our premise intersects the stories of five people - yes five people - and it is brilliantly crafted. And this time it isn't a chain smoking son of a gun without a name that carries the film, but rather a female prostitute. This isn't the 'Rocky Horror Picture Show', so please continue reading. The plot revolves around a certain family and its moist establishment in the middle of a desert with hopes for it to one day be a thriving town with a railway station. It is this future town that brings our five protagonists into relation. The family is murdered by a gang led by Frank (Henry Fonda) who works the hit-man for a corrupt railway boss who wants the town out of the way so he can reach the coast and view the sea before he dies. However, unaware of her arrival, Jill (Claudia Cardinale) - the family's patriarch's fiancée - comes to claim her property and therefore possesses a threat to the railway boss. Meanwhile a man with no name nicknamed 'Harmonica' (he always plays a Harmonica before making a kill) has come to town looking for Frank for personal reasons. Charles Bronson nails the role with extreme prejudice. Also a fugitive going by the name of Cheyenne (Jason Robards) assists in his journey to prove his innocence regarding being the wrongly accused murderer.No spoilers, but just an assurance that this film will blow you away. It is impossible to comprehend the overwhelming powerful epic experience in one sitting. This is what motion pictures are meant to be. Masterful storytelling, a larger than life score by the brilliant Ennio Morricone, cinematography yet unmatched and a cast made in heaven. Performances from all the actors are some of the best you will ever see.It is films like these that redefine genres and that honorable of all words, a 'classic'. Prove me wrong. For those who experienced it, I hope it has impacted you in much the same way it has me. Upon its release, this film was unsuccessful, because the world wanted another Clint Eastwood picture. But they couldn't see for a mile what was coming. Sergio Leone is platinum. May the force be with him...........always!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: A piquant cocktail of style and substance in equal parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once Upon a Time in the West (OUTW) is a piquant cocktail of style and substance in equal parts, potent enough to catapult the viewer into a whirlpool of incessant excitement transcending him beyond the usual realms of an adrenaline rush. Vintage Leone, OUTW is inarguably the best Western ever made and undoubtedly features amongst the very best works of cinema, period. Leone incredibly surpasses the brilliance of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (TGTBTU) with OUTW by blending his favorite theme of Greed with that of Revenge. The only thing that TGTBTU lacked was the presence of a strong female character and Leone more than makes up for it in OUTW. Its eccentric yet consummate plot revolves around a female protagonist, thereby revolutionizing the very tenets associated with the genre where machismo and chivalry had solely held sway, hitherto. OUTW is a juxtaposition of the lives of five individuals, viz. Harmonica - a mysterious stranger, Cheyenne ? a notorious desperado, Frank ? a ruthless assassin, Jill ? a beautiful widow with an obscure past, and Morton ? a railroad baron, whose motives inevitably make them cross each other's paths albeit through an act of fate. Henry Fonda is a revelation as the cold-blooded assassin, a portrayal that is remarkably contrasting to his usual 'good guy' on-screen image. He goes about his business with a sublime touch of feral grandeur that makes him equally chilling and fascinating as 'Frank'. Charles Bronson plays his part with utmost conviction and incredibly manages to conjure up an element of mystery in his portrayal that not only brings 'Harmonica' to life, but also gives it a very distinct identity despite Harmonica's conspicuous similarities with Eastwood's 'Man with no name'. The role of 'Cheyenne' is played with equal brilliance by Jason Robards. He has taken care of the various subtleties and nuances to such an extent that he perfectly fits into the shoes of notorious, yet likable, 'Cheyenne'. Claudia Cardinale is ravishing as the beautiful, yet vulnerable, 'Jill McBain'. She has fully justified the trust shown by Leone in casting her and by Bertolucci in penning down a strong feminine part in a Western. She truly entrances the viewers with her mystifying pulchritude and enigmatic charm. She meticulously highlights the flaws in Jill's character while also managing to depict the elements of tenacity and grit which represent the true spirit of femininity. Gabriele Ferzetti is quite effective in his cameo as the crippled railroad baron, 'Morton'. He suffers from the tuberculosis of bones and each passing day brings him closer to his end, thereby further intensifying his desperate urge to fulfill his far-fetched ambition of taking the railroad to the Atlantic. He truly represents a man worthy of achieving the impossible, unfortunately cut short by his haplessness. Despite the inhuman and unjust means adopted by him to fulfill his naked ambition, one finds it excruciatingly hard to derive pleasure from his perpetual plight and eventual doom. Contrary to the popular belief, the slow pace of the movie and laconism in dialogue pose no impediment to the viewing and in fact this deliberate pacing enormously adds to the detail and beauty of the movie, and also helps in brewing the desired level of tension before it is finally punctuated suddenly with quick bursts of action. Tonino Delli Colli's cinematography is vividly descriptive and has elements which have become his and Leone's trademarks like the extreme close-ups, the quick panning of the terrain, the rotating camera shots etc.The haunting score written yet again by the master composer, Ennio Morricone enhances the grandeur of the movie tenfold. If Leone's direction and Colli's cinematography are the backbone of the movie, then undoubtedly Morricone's plaintive score is its heart and soul. The surreal score has shades of melancholy, intrigue, and romance that become more obvious with each passing moment. The music features leitmotifs (a melodic phrase that accompanies the reappearance of a character) that relate to each of the main characters (each with their own unique theme music). The soundtrack to the opening scene is a creative orchestration of ordinary sounds like that of the dripping water, the clicking of a telegraph, a buzzing fly, and the screech of a windmill after Morricone experienced a musical performance created by the medley of these sounds. This created an exaggerated version of what had come to be known as 'Spaghetti sound'.OUTW is a magnum opus unparalleled in direction, screenplay, cinematography and music. With its slower pace and relatively somber theme (compared to Leon's previous works), Leone managed to transform his image of a satirical showman into that of an accomplished auteur capable of producing much profound works. OUTW also served as the harbinger for Leone's surrealistic masterpiece, 'Once Upon a Time in America'. P.S: OUTW is an absorbing masterpiece; an absolute gem of a movie and a must watch for those who understand the true meaning of 'A Timeless Masterpiece', and are willing to indulge themselves completely through the whole length of the movie. 10/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Western of All Time bar none!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "fourth" and best of Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy, 'Once Upon A Time In The West' is a sprawling, operatic masterpiece of cinematography. The languid pacing only accentuates the meticulously presented scenes and the Ennio Morricone score is powerful, poignant and haunting. Each major character has his own musical theme. Henry Fonda's character has a menacing and jarring score which chills and thrills me every time I hear it (I bought the soundtrack too!). Fonda as Frank is the "coldest villain in screen history" as I have read in other reviews and was cast against type in this film. When the camera pans up into his passionless blue eyes early in the movie, one sees what a brilliant piece of casting it was to have him as the villain. This movie is a metaphor on the death of The Old West and the final word on how a (spaghetti) Western should be. Not to be missed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once Upon A Time In The West is directed by Sergio Leone and stars Charles Bronson, Claudia Cardinale, Jason Robards &amp; Henry Fonda. Leone co-wrote the screenplay with Sergio Donati, while the story was provided by Dario Argento and Bernardo Bertolucci. Ennio Morricone scores the music and cinematography is from Tonino Delli Colli.After finishing The Good, the Bad and the Ugly in 1966, Sergio Leone felt he had done all he wanted to do with the Western genre. Thankfully that wasn't to be the case as he was lured back into Oaterville to make the unique and quite superb C'era una volta il West in 1968. Greeted with negative reviews on its release in America, it was a financial flop. But in Europe the film was richly received and took the box offices by storm. Time has showed the film to have risen above cult status to be widely acknowledged as one of the finest Western film's of all time.Everything about the film is bigger and bolder than previous Leone works. Opening with an almost silent ten minute sequence that has become legendary, the film follows four characters as they dovetail towards the reckoning. Harmonica (Bronson), Frank (Fonda), Jill McBain (Cardinale) &amp; Cheyenne (Robards), all linked by death, and with each one represented in the narrative by a piece of music. Leone clinically weaves the four stories into one operatic whole. Not all of it makes perfect sense, which stops it being the masterpiece many consider it being. But its observations of Western mysticism, capitalism and progression of time; and with scores to of course be settled too, it makes for a fine story nestling in amongst the beautiful treats for the eyes and ears.While Leone clearly homages the genre and pays tribute to the old America (you will lose count spotting the Western film steals), his film is ultimately very much a pastiche piece. But he gets away with that lack of freshness (the story at the core mirrors Johnny Guitar for example) due to the unique structure. It's meticulously paced as the characters are fleshed out to the max, sometimes even without dialogue. Smart directing as Leone makes the story more richer and weightier in substance. Morricone's score is magnificent and so is Colli's photography, with the latter's shooting of Monument Valley good enough to have featured in John Ford oeuvre. While the casting is inspiring, notably Fonda as a villain (the impact shocked many back in the day).I can't call it a masterpiece because it does lift from many other sources, but it's darn close to being a perfect movie. One thing is for sure, that in it's uncut form the film is a work of art. Where repeat viewings keep rewarding and never dilute the enjoyment. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the annals of western film lore, there are good and bad films. This is one of the finest. Because "Once Upon A Time in The West" is such a remarkable film, it is hard to define what makes it so memorable. The story centers on a beautiful former prostitute called Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) who arrives to assume the role of wife to a stubborn, crazy, red-headed Irishman with a dream. Waiting, instead is tragedy and 'Mr. Morton' who is a powerful, but ailing land grabbing baron (Gabriele Ferzetti) who desires to crush everything and everyone who stands in his way to reach the Pacific ocean with his railroad. To help him is an equally ruthless gunfighter named Frank (Henry Fonda; the success of this movie owes much to Fonda who plays a very convincing heavy) who has been removing obstacles for years and now targets the McBain family for death and that includes Jill. Unfortunately for Frank, he has accrued many enemies over the years with one particular, mysterious and deadly Harmonica playing stranger seeking revenge. Frank arranges for three of his best and fastest gun hands to meet and eliminate the stranger at the train-station. Joining the instrument playing stranger is an unpredictable, half-breed, renegade, who is a notorious gunfighter called 'Cheyenne.' ( Jason Robards ) The entire film is a triumph to the superb direction of Sergio Leone, who christens each major character with their own theme song. Each theme was created by Ennio Morricone and when the character makes an entrance, the theme prepares the audience for mood change, drama, action, and lifelong memories. Special guest appearances, by Woody Strode, Jack Elam, Keenan Wynn and Lionel Stander add to the classic nature of this excellent story. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most westerns are actually about the death of the old, wild, west; and 'Once Upon a Time in the West', with its story centred on the coming of the railroad, is no exception. One thing that Sergio Leone has done in this movie is to make a truly cinematic film: it's hard to imagine how the script read, as so much of the meaning is conveyed in the facial expressions of the actors or by Enrico Morricone's score - there's a balletic quality to Leone's work. Unfortunately, I found the music intrusive, the exaggerated grimacing of the characters merely comic, and the plot contrived, difficult to follow and arbitrarily bloody; I don't believe that even in the wildest west, six people would be killed outside a bar and everyone inside would just carry on drinking as if nothing had happened. Personally, I prefer Robert Altman's treatment of a similar storyline in 'McCabe and Mrs. Miller', a film that uses rather fewer of the conventions of the western, but which seems closer to life as a result.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really not my kind of film. I thought my tastes were quite broad, but apparently not broad enough to encompass this one. The best writers and directors can make a point quickly and effectively without seeming to hurry. Sergio Leone, it seems, can't do that - at least, not in this movie. He takes his time over every scene, whether it has a point to make or not.It takes ages to get started (whatever happened to grabbing the attention of the audience to make them want to find out more?!) and ages for anything to actually happen once it has started. The word "lean" cannot be applied here; I suppose the best phrase I can offer is "elegantly lumbering".I saw the director's edition rather than the theatrical release, and as far as I could tell, the long scenes didn't achieve anything that ones half or even a tenth of the duration could have achieved (boredom aside).Yes, there were some "pretty" camera angles. Yes, there were one or two clever lines of dialogue. But the impression I came away with was, I'm sorry to say, that the director put his self-indulgence firmly above the audience's entertainment. The music was noticeably repetitive; the sound-effects intrusive beyond the point of distraction; and the dialogue invariably too quiet.I suppose I must be missing something given the absurdly high (IMHO) position of this film in the top 250. I really can't imagine what that might be!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone has already told all about the movie contents. I concur with: "Simply put, this movie is the most visually stimulating and engrossing movie I have ever watched." I #1 found it to convey graphic reality in a way I have never experienced in any other film - and that came across on a crummy black and white TV that I first viewed it on when stumbling upon a late night showing in 1973. The next day in high school, I was reeling from what I had experienced - it cast a difference on plain 'ole mundane life - it is definitely an ART Flick - not mere entertainment. There are some elements that make it even more intensely valuable to us here still in 2012. It is somewhat of an overlooked legacy. The actors are nearly all dead. They truly lived and died and now very few of the current "Sweetwater" community knows of them what went on before we took over... The soundtrack is real- the sounds throughout the movie and the musical score is real - not sampler generated - the horns are horns, the chorus is people, the windmill is a windmill, the gunfire is amplified guns, Leone used a technique of amplifying real sound- bigger than life - for effect- works wonderfully- even the plate re-verb used on the guitar tracks is plate, a large cumbersome device, but not digital emulation...The length is perfect.. those who find it slow or long don't get it.. I would that it had been a 40-60 hour film, as it almost turned out to be before Leone got help shortening it - he captured reality with intense close ups and overextended meditation-like shots and sequences... Longer? Yes. Leone is gone now, the actors are gone now, the sets are long forgotten, the locales and even the story, is set in the unchangeable past - I would that we had all the hours of it that Leone struggled to shorten, like other extinctions, to only have available to see and hear and touch. A Bored of the Rings trilogy might have ruined it though, so OK. But sadly, there is no more. Perhaps it's like the possession of a single 200 year old bottle of wine. Of note - I am a musician; the players/singers of the score - are amazing - every contribution from the whistling to the exacting guitar passages, are perfectly executed - they set standard, that which comes after seeks to come up to the bar they set - the vocals and the musical passages are one time, one of a kind; anyone else can only hope to match - saying, you cannot surpass what they did- it was perfect as original, and any flaws are like the dust in the film and become that which others try to duplicate - they nailed it. As you live and the world you grew up in changes around you, until the people and places and events replace that which was, with only remnant artifacts, largely unrecognized or esteemed by the contemporary occupants, you will experience your own : "Once Upon a Time in (insert your own place)" as things move on and YOU become history. The movie extras show you what the actual scene locations look like NOW and you realize that it's that way where you live: you've been living in your own drama- all around change, but you are in it and the drama is as real.Buy it and WATCH THE FILM WITH COMMENTARY - the first commentator is wonderful - takes you into the mindset like a museum tour guide, and you'll discover that the reason you are shocked and touched and moved, and find this work of art so visceral and real,,,is because it was the masterpiece last western, by a lover himself of the genre, our USA mythical west, where as as it was stated in Judge Roy Bean, "if it wasn't, It should have been..."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently purchased a double DVD package of "Once Upon a Time in the West" and re-watched this film after having revisited the "Dollars" trilogy...and what a comedown. First the positives: a lovely score from Ennio Morricone (especially the "Jill"/Claudia Cardinale theme), gorgeous photography, sets, locations, lighting, and some decent (but not terribly great) acting - Gabriele Ferzetti probably comes off best in his role. You know you're in trouble when the very last bit in the documentary extras is a quotation of Sergio Leone worriedly admitting to co-scripter Bernardo Bertolucci that he had set the pace far too slow when filming the opening sequences, and that the ensuing film would probably be five hours long as a result. It was almost three, and it barely moves along at all. The plot is paper thin and could have easily been filmed in 90 minutes. Perhaps then the much-needed forward momentum and suspense would be in place. As it is, the film has far too protracted silences which do not advance it at all.Henry Fonda's villain Frank is rather drab and one dimensional, especially in comparison to Gian Maria Volonté's romanticized villains Ramon and Indio in the first two "Dollars" films. Fonda is also not even remotely formidable as a physical opponent for Charles Bronson. I'm not certain why Jason Robards' Cheyenne character is even in the film---perhaps as comic relief, but he does not ever really seem to belong in the Old West, despite his grizzled appearance. He and Bronson have none of the chemistry and camaraderie that Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef had in "For a Few Dollars More." Claudia Cardinale is beautiful and beautifully photographed, but even her character is rather one dimensional.Back to the music: for this film Ennio Morricone recorded the score in advance (unlike the "Dollars" films), and some of the soaring themes arrive early in the film and are far too stridently emotional for characters and situations which have not yet won the viewers' hearts. He should have subdued some of his orchestration of the same themes earlier in the film, then revisited them in full intensity after some of the drama had likewise escalated. As such it is a bad marriage of sound and celluloid at the outset.In the end it is director Sergio Leone's fault for not shooting this film so that the story would unfold at a much faster pace. It seems he didn't learn his lesson, though, as his next film "A Fistful of Dynamite" (1972) suffered from the very same problems. I donated the "West" DVD set to my local library just before writing this review; perhaps someone else will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twice Removed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its odd how one comes to a film. I saw this one nearly 40 years ago in an edition that was chopped up. The sound and score was reprocessed and muted. It was terrible. I lumped it in with the Clint Eastwood trilogy. Those movies were fun in the manner of an then new extreme style. But the concept was thin and knowing that one was an exact copy of a Kurosawa samurai movie sort of took the American link out of them. (That specific film was remade again starring Bruce Willis and was superior.)Now after all this time, I come back to it and find it whole, a new thing. Its wonderful. Its as wonderful as advertised. There are all sorts of joys. One is the many references to ordinary, series westerns. Another is the meditative pace; a sort of an anti-action movie rooted in place and place-derived intents. These two things alone would place it as high as IMDb readers have chosen. But there are two other things that matter more to me. The first is obvious: the sound design. Few filmmakers seem to want to leverage sound much. Malick is one, but the idea there is to make an independent layer over the images. Here, the sound saturates the images. In my experience, it is unique in its effectiveness. And that's one of the other shocks: I don't think I would have been able to appreciate it as much as a young man. I've been watching films more lucidly for only a few years now and though all the other components here are ordinary but perhaps extended, this strikes me as wholly new.The other thing probably requires one to have gone through a couple stupid American wars. The second one makes all the difference, because the first was still based on the notion of doing good even if the means were bankrupt. Now, a world can look at westerns and not automatically make the John Ford connection: that Monument Valley and open spaces mean freedom. Frontier gunplay and violence automatically invoked populist justice. It took this movie to break things. And it took this long for them to break. Westerns are a notation for America, a story about an accidental nation. A collection of simple notes for us to grasp. This movie is about westerns in precisely the same way. I study these constructions and nearly always say that the underlying or original goal is to increase the viewer's engagement. But this case is different: the layers provide a distance. It allows us to see the notation about the notation about what will always be a notation: national identity.Of the sections, the opening is the best. At some point when the web grows to allow clips to be annotated online and ranked separate from the movie, that sequence will rate very high. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excruciating Slow Or Fascinating: Your Choice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a unique western, one in which sometimes the action moves excruciatingly slow, which can either be fascinating or boring. Unfortunately for me, after spending big bucks for the DVD when it first came out, I found it more boring than fascinating. In my previous viewings, I always found it fascinating. Maybe I just had a bad day.The movie is filled with gaps of silence while closeups of the main characters' faces are shown. That's director Sergio Leone's trademark, and I believe he does it more in this film than in any of his others. When you get closeups of chiseled faces like Henry Fonda's or Charles Bronson's, it quite interesting but most of the movie feels like slow motion. At 165 minutes, this movie takes a lot of patience. By the way, the closeups of Claudia Cardinale's face were with a soft lens, so the wrinkles didn't show. That's so typical of older films with the vain female stars. Cardinale looks cheap, anyway, with all that 1960s-type eye makeup.At any rate, the action scenes are a decent and not bloody and the characters are quite real, meaning believable. I liked Fonda in here best even though I am not particularly a fan of his but his against-type villain role of "Frank" was excellent. I read where he said this was his favorite role. I'm glad to hear that. The best character in the film, though, was "Cheyenne," played by Jason Robards.The opening credits - spaced out over 11 minutes (which was rare in "classic movie" days) - are considered by many as the most famous ever, in any genre. The music in this film is different, too. It's not as memorable as the score from "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly," however, done by the same composer, but it has its moments. Early in the film we see some shots of Monument Valley which are the prettiest I've ever seen. I wish there had been more of that.Overall, this is a western in which patience is rewarded, I suppose. It certainly looks beautiful on DVD and the sound has been enhanced as well. Note: when this came out on disc, the rating of the film changed from PG to PG-13.</fullReview>

That is the essence of this Film. Leone is a Lover and a Hugger. He is constantly hugging this Movie Loving every minute of it. He Loves the Genre, He Loves the Camera, He loves the Actors Faces, He loves the Landscape, he loves the Mythology, He just Loves and Loves. All that is apparent on the screen. Most likely that is why it is so lengthy. He Loved it all. What emerges is an Authentic Fantasy. There is on display a gorgeousity of grandeur that is quite a sight. Behold its panorama and its larger than Life Characters with their own quirky Personas and accompanying Musical Riffs. This is so playful and fun. It is all done for the Lovers of the World.

From the middle things start to become clear. Till then the way characters are established is going to be memorable forever. The opening sequence which has the 'wait' is one of the best sequences in the film. With his tight close ups and slow reactions of the character, I never felt if the movie was going slow. Add to that, the intricate music by morricone and we get a hell of a cinema. The story again involves three main characters.

		<fullReview>A lot of very interesting things. But in the beginning, the movie starts as a normal Western with the bad guys looking like the bad guys and everyone else moves into the picture as possibly the same. A beautiful prostitute has come clear across America to marry a man name of McBain. Who we soon find out is her husband after all, and has married Jill in New Orleans. While out hunting grouse with his son, McBain is shot and killed by Frank(James?). The bloodthirsty outlaws decide to decimate the place, and soon the whole McBain family is dead. Jill, however, is about to arrive in the town not far from McBain's outpost, and is not killed. She finally arrives. But not before going to the watering hole where she is not shocked by the accommodations, but merely amused. Amused, that is, until Cheyenne shows up. Cheyenne meets the man simply known as Harmonica, a Mexican half-breed who plays an integral part in the story. Harmonica(Charles Bronson), has already blown away four of Frank's gang at the railway station. The half-breed is disappointed. He does not see Frank there, but does a job on Frank's employees. After the funeral, Jill looks everywhere in McBain's house for money, and finds none. She does not realize what the wealth is. Cheyenne shows up at McBain's place(which now belongs to her). He shows the New Orleans entertainer how to make coffee. Frank the outlaw had a singular interest in Brett McBain's land. He rides the train owned my Mr. Morton, making himself a partner. Being a paraplegic with TB, Mr. Morton has little to say in the matter. By now, Frank knows of Harmonica's presence yet even after meeting Harmonica Frank has not put 2 and 2 together yet. Harmonica even gives the names of Frank's victims. Jill McBain throws herself at Frank for really no good reason, except possibly to save her own life from the treacherous outlaw. At the time that most of her belongings go on auction, Cheyenne shows up with Harmonica and Cheyenne is the bounty, so to speak, for Jill McBain's possessions and priceless property. Definitely a film to catch your attention. The train breathing as Morton plays his hand in a bewildering game of poker is reminiscent of the breathing of Dave Bowman as he struggles to regain control of the Discovery from HAL 9000.</fullReview>

Frank framed a man named Cheyenne and his band of outlaws and everyone believes that they did it. Cheyenne must get his revenge on Frank, protect Jill, and work with a strange man with a harmonica who has his own score to settle.Once Upon a Time in the West is quite possibly the most expertly directed movie of all time. Every single scene is so stylistically shot that it is truly a wonder to behold. Sergio Leone uses a combination of long shots that show off the impressive western landscape with amazing facial close-ups that capture the emotions and expert acting of the wonderful cast. Leone directs with such finesse he could take a scene of someone brushing their teeth and turn it into cinematic gold. The first scene where Leone combines everyday sounds to create music is inspired as well as being an amazing example of slowly building tension to an exciting climax.Possibly just as important if not more is Ennio Morricone's beautiful score, which is the best he's every done. His music can breath such life into a character or scene that you don't even need dialog. Morricone's compositions pack such emotional weight that they can transform a scene. A happy scene could be sad, a sad scene could be frightening and all the emotions in between. If a pictures is worth a thousand words, Morricone's music is worth ten thousand words. The cast is excellent as well. Specifically Henry Fonda in his deeply haunting and extremely out of character turn as the ruthless Frank. A blue-eyed sweet talking villain is a rarity and a treasure. This detail is wielded to perfection by Leone as he will use a close-up on Fonda's face to accentuate his blue eyes. His clothes are dirty, his face is dirty and amidst all that grime shining beautifully are his two blue eyes. Like two oceans in the middle of the desert sand. The script is also amazing and it deals with so many cultural and personal battles; corruption, greed, the dying of the "man," and the mechanizing of the West, and so many more. Some will complain about its length and pace, but like many great movies it gets better with multiple viewings. What can seem unnecessary and overlong oftentimes is just detailed and becomes more and more beautiful the more you see it. Once Upon a Time in the West is one of the greatest films ever made and it solidifies Morricone and Leone as some of the all time greats.</fullReview>

The story has four characters coming together on a plot of land where a now dead owner was going to build a town around a rail station. From there, the violence ramps up toward a slow, wonderful conclusion.It has pretty much all the classic staples of a western. Despite not being as action-packed as most movies these days, the long portions of quiet and beautiful scenery give us a sense of the west and leave us wanting more. It's rare that a director can make such a quiet, dream-like film that leaves the viewer wanting to be part of that world.Beautiful, serene, and overall excellent, Once Upon a Time in the West is a grand film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this one, even though I never really watched a lot of western. My hopes were not only met, they were far exceeded! I couldn't believe how amazing a 45year old film could be today, the tension it builds without anyone saying a word is incredible. The cinematography is beautiful and the actors are great. It has a great pace where u never for one second get bored, for a long film like this, thats another sign of a masterpiece. I will never sell my blu-ray and probably watch it several times again. This movie deserves the praise its getting.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Top 10 Westerns of all Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't say much about this film because I don't want to use any spoilers in this review. This is a movie that everyone should have the pleasure of experiencing for themselves with no review spoilers. All I will say is you will fall in love with the music score, this is Charles Bronson's best, one of Henry Fonda's best, and Claudia Cardinale, you could just watch her all day, she's so beautiful. Oh and I can't forget Jason Robards who was amazing, really great stuff from all Four of these actors. Not much dialogue in this film, the way a great western should be(although there are many great westerns with a good amount of dialogue in them). This is a very visual film, it's a film that has everything- it's a film that symbolizes the very foundation of why we love to watch movies. This film will draw you in in a way that you've never been drawn into a film before. Probably one of the most underrated films of all time, everyone should see this movie and experience it's magic for themselves. You cannot go wrong with this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Agony and the Ecstasy of the Old West ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Once Upon a Time in the West" is a movie of a few words ? but each one carries a symbolic resonance that transcends the limits of the story ? and emotionally enriches it, leaving the seen and unseen, the spoken and unspoken, cohabiting in a perfect harmony.As usual in Sergio Leone's films, music plays a vital role as the movie lives through the perfect balance between what the scenes show and what the music conveys, as the line between the real and the abstract flirts with imperceptibility. The iconic tune played by Harmonica (Charles Bronson), one of the most defining of the Western genre, ominous and menacing, announces an imminent revenge while the woman's theme is more operatic and nostalgic. The beautiful Jill (Claudia Cardinale) came to Sweetwater as Mrs. McBain only to find her husband and his family as corpses, ordered to be killed by Morton, a ruthless crippled railroad baron, her theme embodies the sadness of a woman carrying the weight of an intolerable past as a gorgeous whore from New Orleans and her impossible purification. Harmonica and Jill are both prisoners of a condition they try to escape from, for a future desperately uncertain.That's the recurring theme of the "Once Upon a Time ?" series opened by Leone's Western masterpiece, they are less 'telling stories' than inviting us to contemplate the destiny of characters torn between haunting memories and a dreamy future, and that's what Leone's last films are : haunting and dreamy. While the 'Dollars' trilogy's hero played by Clint Eastwood had no name, therefore no family, and no connection whatsoever with the past, in "Once Upon a Time in the West", the two leads are incapable to be architects of their own fates if their soul are not in peace. There are no good or bad people but you can determine who the antagonists are by the way they had already sold their soul before the story begun. And speaking of antagonists, it's impossible to talk about "Once Upon a Time in the West" without mentioning the performance of Henry Fonda as Frank, one of the most despicable and sadistic movie villains.Fonda's performance is even more impressive because he's always been relegated to the roles of good-hearted and inspiring characters, and if there ever was something missing to prove how immensely versatile he is, it was a villainous performance. "Once Upon a Time in the West" is a role of a lifetime that allowed him to finally implode his talent. And the first effect Frank had on me was when I stopped watching the film, as a kid, as soon as he decimated the Irish red-haired McBain family. Maturity growing on me, I overcame that trauma and saw finally the shock for what it was, a demystification of the Old West, showing that what cost the lives of millions of Natives could also be applied to American pioneers, as their lives had no meaning for the major companies, like in other revisionist westerns such as "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" or "McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller", the antagonism is commanded by big corporations in the name of 'progress'."Once Upon a Time in the West" is the poignant chronicle of a time that has passed, a time between tradition and progress, it's the demise of the Old West and the majestic flag it raised. The pioneer family is symbolically eliminated by the corporatist world. It's all about making profit and only a ruthless and heartless bastard like Frank could have accepted to kill a family for greed, what no other outlaw from John Ford's movies would have done, except a Native. The child was killed as a continuation of the McBain threat and Jill's sentence wouldn't have been suspended if she didn't have some assets of her own. Claudia Cardinale is the emotional core of the film, with this mix of false strong-mindedness and wisdom to know how to use charm as a survival instinct in a dark and savage world with no place for 'little people'. The light of hope that kills off this cynical mood is incarnated by the providential help of Harmonica and Cheyenne.Cheyenne plays a significant role as the counterpart of Fonda's Frank, an outlaw with principles and heart, the good Old West, his theme sounds like a playful saloon' piano tune and in a way, he seems to exist only to provide a connection with the past, for Jill so we can know more about her, he's her link to the past. And it's tragically ironic that he is shot by the crippled Morton, not even in a spot that would have made his misery short. His agony, magnificently expressed by Jason Robards, symbolizes the agony of the Old West myth, and elevates "Once Upon a Time in the West" as the masterpiece of Western revisionism.On a side note, I finished reading Ebert's review and I couldn't believe the man who put "2001 : A Space Odyssey" among his greatest films and said that a great movie was never too slow, complained about the slowness. The slowness is not just a trademark in Leone's film but an absolute necessity to taste the instant's poetry. It's like a joke that is repeated so many times, it goes from being funny to annoying until it becomes funny again, the breath-taking beauty of the cinematography invites for a meticulous attention to details, you've got enough time to see the 'unspoken' in the eyes of characters; to contemplate the magnificence and the ugliness, to let yourself haunted by the lyricism of the moment, what can't be done with faster pacing.Leone is a director who trusts the intelligence and the patience of the viewer, and doesn't adapt his style to the attention span of the audience but invites the audience to appreciate these long quiet moments before the storm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, but overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie as a youngster when it first came out and was enthralled by it. Subsequently, I re watched it over the years a number of times and it has always been one of my favorites. However, recently I decided to begin a hobby of becoming an amateur critic of the Western genre. I have begun a multi-year project to review and rank all "A" Westerns ever released. I understand why some fans may consider this one of the best Westerns of all time. It is a high psychedelic opera that can be mesmerizing. I am sad to say, however, that "OUTITW" if fairing very poorly in my rankings. As much as I used to like it, when I take a harder look at "OUTITW" and compare it against other top Westerns, it comes up woefully short in a number to critical categories I use to rank the great Westerns. I'll start with a list of positives: - Of course, this movie is mostly about style and Leone gives this movie the full treatment. For me this is both a positive and a negative. A positive because style is what's great about a Leone Western. A negative, because in this case he overdoes it. Details in my negative list below - The casting of Henry Fonda is a stroke of genius. Frank might be the most effective heavy in the history of Westerns. His blue eyes are perfect for the Leone close-ups - The opening segment "High Noon" tribute is classic Leone - Claudia Cardinale is one of the sexiest females to ever appear in a Western. She is also well characterized and her role is integral to plot developments i.e. she's not a gratuitous sex object. - It's not often remarked on, but Morton, the railroad baron, is very well characterized. Nice touch to have him be a cripple, but the important thing is that he is not one-dimensionally evil. He is humanized not just by his infirmity, but also by the painting of the ocean on the wall of his train car. - The soundtrack is very effective, as usual with Leone. - It's a good looking film and Cardinale's carriage ride through Monument Valley is one of the most visually beautiful segments in the history of cinema, let along Westerns. Now for the negatives: - Leone's strength is his style. In "For a Few Dollars More" and "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly" he managed to integrate his style into a compelling storyline, replete with clever plot twists, snappy dialog and excellent comic relief. "OUTITW" has none of these things. To make matters worse, he slows the pace down to a crawl and adds an hour of running time. - This might have worked if he had created another compelling character except Frank. The fact is that we don't care about anybody in this movie. The only sympathetic character is Harmonica, but we don't have any reason to feel for him until the movie's final scene. - There is virtually no comic relief, outside of Harmonica's "two horses too many" line at the beginning and Cheyenne's antics on top of the train. Compare to "TGTBTU" where Eli Wallach created one of the most fascinating comic villains in the history of cinema. Not only that, but you actually CARED about Tuco more than you do anybody in "OUTITW". What an achievement! - Leone even messed up the landscape. After Cardinale's stunning buggy ride through Monument Valley, we are immediately aware that the movie is really being filmed in Spain or somewhere, certainly not in Monument Valley. The film then gets stuck in the ugly town they built and stays there. - Jason Robard's character is beyond dull. The movie would have been much better if they had just deleted this character, who really serves no purpose. And Cardinale can't act her way out of a paper bag. First billing over Fonda too. Go figure that. - The fundamental plot is too thin to support a three hour film. - Finally, Leone seems to think that all Indians had been fully exterminated from the region in the 1880's Arizona. I didn't see one. In fact, Leone deserves some kind of career Razzie award for making five Westerns without a single Indian. I don't mean no Indian characters, I mean not even the presence of a single Indian. Some "student" of Westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the All-Time Essentials - A Masterpiece that Overwhelms In All Regards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are Westerns that every Western fan should see. There are Westerns that every film fan should see. And then there are the chosen few that everybody MUST see. Sergio Leone's quintessential Italian Westerns doubtlessly belong to that latter category, and "C'era Una Volta Il West" aka. "Once Upon a Time In the West" (1968) in particular is a masterpiece that no one even remotely interested in the art of motion pictures could possibly consider missing. Along with Leone's earlier masterpiece "Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo" aka. "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (1966), this is arguably one of the two most brilliant and overwhelming Westerns ever made.There are countless reasons why this masterpiece must be seen by anyone interested in cinema, but I shall stick to the most obvious ones: Co-scripted by Bernardo Bertolucci and the later Horror-master Dario Argento (who is a personal god of mine), "Once Upon a time in the West" is absolutely overwhelming in all regards, be it story-wise, stylistically or visually. Maybe even more than Leone's other Westerns, all visually stunning and brutal masterpieces, "Once Upon A Time in the West" shows the old West from in its most brutal and most beautiful side. Leone's fourth Western in often compared to opera, and these comparisons are well founded. Visually overwhelming from start to finish, "Once Upon a Time in the West" comes along with what is positively the most brilliant of Ennio Morricone's magnificent film scores; a score that overwhelms. Listening to Morricone's music alone is capable of building up suspense, even if it's listened to out of context. Maybe more than anything else, it is this score by the positively greatest film composer who ever lived, that carries the film and makes it the unforgettable experience it is."Once Upon a Time in the West" is a film that uniquely takes time in order to build up tension. The opening sequence alone is a unique piece of art the likes of which are very seldom in cinema. I do not wish to go too deeply into detail about the story, as this fantastic experience should be experienced rather than read by anyone who hasn't seen it (if there still is somebody out there who hasn't). As much as it is a film about the Old West, "Once Upon a Time in the West" is also a film about the end of the Old West, the triumph of capitalism over the 'pioneer spirit'. The film begins with the brutal massacre of a family over a piece of land, which becomes the object of desire for a murderous villain (Henry Fonda), a bandit leader (Jason Robards) a vengeful gunman with a Harmonica (Charles Bronson) and a ravishing beauty (Claudia Cardinale).The film casts Hollywood's best, Henry Fonda, Jason Robards and Charles Bronson are all at top of their game, this positively being the greatest film either man has starred in. Robards is fantastic as the rough-and-ready desperado Cheyenne, Fonda is gloriously devilish as the villainous Frank, and Bronson, one of my personal favorite actors, is unforgettable as the vengeful Harmonica. All three characters rank among the most memorable ones in cinema, all three actors deliver outstanding performances. As fantastic as these three brilliant actors are, there is one person who steals the show: In over a century of cinema, there have been countless beautiful, sexy, ravishing actresses in seductive, charming, fascinating roles. It is a rare actress and role, however, whose beauty is so overwhelming that it makes the viewer fall in love with her at the very second of her appearance. This is the case with Claudia Cardinale in "Once Upon a time in the West". Doubtlessly one of the most ravishing women who ever blessed the screen, Cardinale plays Jill, who is angel, femme fatale and hooker with a heart of gold all in one, and who brings out the most lovable, most intriguing and most erotic side of either of these traditional female roles. Cardinale isn't simply beautiful in this film; she is a goddess, who will immediately turn every male viewer into a lovesick teenage boy. Without displaying explicit nudity, Clauida Cardinale's Jill is one of the most erotic roles ever in any film. It is impossible to watch this film and not fall in love with her.The supporting cast includes many fantastic actors such as Woody Strode, Lionel Stander, Jack Elam ad Frank Wolff. All cast members fit perfectly in their roles.The locations and cinematography are overwhelming, unlike Leone's Dollar Trilogy which had been shot in the Spanish Almeria desert (as many other Spaghetti Westerns), "Once Upon a Time in the West" was mainly shot in Arizona.As mentioned above, "Once Upon a Time in the West" is a film that overwhelms in all aspects, be it Leone's unique talent to build up tension, the phenomenal photography and rough beauty of the landscapes, the incredibly compelling story, the brilliantly drawn characters or the incredible score by Ennio Morricone ? there simply isn't the tiniest aspect about "Once Upon a Time in the West" that is not absolutely brilliant.The Sergio Leone Spaghetti Westerns have been personal all-time favorites of mine ever since childhood, and it is impossible to say which one is the best. To me, it's either "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" or this one, these two films being my choices for the greatest Westerns ever made. They are doubtlessly also two of the greatest films ever made, regardless of genre. I could go on for a long time doing nothing but praising this masterpiece, but it would all come down to the same point: "Once Upon a Time in the West" is one of the greatest, most essential films ever made, and nobody who hasn't seen it is yet a true film fan. Is there a rating higher than 10 out of 10?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Something to do with death"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's funny how so many of the greatest westerns, particularly those by directors who are best known for the westerns, are ones which deal with the death of the old west. There's John Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance; Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch; Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven to name but three. However, for me the best of all these is Leone's masterpiece Once Upon a Time in the West. It is also my favourite of all Leone's pictures.Leone had always been a director who packed his films with atmosphere, style and rhythm, but here he organises every single element to create one overwhelming mood. Everything in the film is geared towards reminding us of death, of a time coming to an end. The pace is slow and measured ? Leone really takes his time in telling the story. The buildings are rickety and creaking, many of the minor characters and extras are old and look worn out, and the wind howls across the open spaces.Symbolism is everywhere in this film. Jill and the railway both represent the death of the west. The coming of the railway of course literally heralded the end of an era, but Leone also had a rather strange theory that this time was also the beginning of a matriarchy in America ? so women also represent change. Jill and the railway are often synonymous. Jill arrives on the train. The train is black and so is Jill's dress. In contrast, most of the characters are dressed in browns and yellows, matching the landscape of the open plains. The railway magnate is called Morton ? "mort" as in death. Another very subtle touch is that most of the movement is towards or away from the camera. Jill and the train are the only things regularly seen moving from side to side across the frame, as if they are the only ones really going anywhere.The flipside to this atmosphere of death is that it is tinged with the hope of rebirth and progress. This is represented by the recurrent water motif, as water symbolises life. The train needs water to run, and the Sweetwater ranch will provide a watering stop. Jill likes to bath frequently, and later she brings water to the railway workers. Jill is a survivor, and she and Sweetwater represent hope for the future.While Harmonica, Frank and Jill have been analysed to death elsewhere, the character of Cheyenne I feel is often overlooked. Although he rarely drives the plot along and could have been edited out of the story without changing much, he is really central to the tone of the film. He more than any other single character represents the old west. He is tough and rugged on the exterior, but gradually his façade is stripped away to reveal a tired, middle-aged man who just wants to settle down. He is the most real, the most human character, and the one given the most depth. Jason Robard's performance has also come in for a lot of flak, but I think he's perfect for the role ? he does that forlorn look very well.Ennio Morricone's music here continues to evolve alongside Leone's style. The score of Once Upon a Time in the West is not as rousing or listenable as the music from the Dollars Trilogy, but it perfectly mirrors that sad and weary tone. The Leone-Morricone trademark of giving each character their own musical theme is even more firmly stated here. It's particularly clever how the theme for the final confrontation mixes Harmonica's and Frank's themes. Leone and Morricone also worked together to make use of natural sound to create atmosphere, something which up to this point had only really been explored by Alfred Hitchcock (most memorably in The Birds, but I'm also thinking of the use of sound in his 1930's pictures). In the opening scene, the creaking of the windmill, the chattering of the telegraph machine and a number of other noises take the place of a musical backing.If there is anything wrong at all with Once Upon a Time in the West, it's that it takes either repeated viewings are extreme concentration to take in every minor plot point and understand every character motivation. The dialogue is sparse, and often more for effect than to give information. There are many short cuts in the narrative and very little is made obvious, so most of the time you have to join the dots yourself to work out exactly what is going on in each scene. There are two pieces I find people get confused about most often, so I'll give my explanations here. Firstly, why Harmonica tears Jill's clothes before going out to the well. This is to make it look as if the two of them have just had a quick session in the barn, thus Frank's men don't expect Harmonica to be armed and ready to fight and so let their guard down. Secondly, a lot of people (including Alex Cox in the DVD commentary) think there is a continuity error when Frank abducts Jill at Sweetwater and is then seen talking to Morton at his hideout in the cliffs. However the scene where Jill and Frank are in bed together is also at the cliffs ? the walls are made of stone. The implication here is that Frank took Jill from Sweetwater back to his hideout, even though there is no linking scene to show it happening.So, it can be a little confusing, but I'd rather have taut narrative than lots of unnecessary material bogging the story down. Besides, with a film that is this entertaining and this beautiful, there's no burden whatsoever in having to watch it over and over?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite frankly the greatest movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone may have wanted to go ahead with the great Once Upon a Time in America after he'd finished his Dollars trilogy (which included the FANTASTIC The Good, the Bad and the Ugly), but the studios wouldn't let him go on without doing another western. The result is the magnum opus of Leone's career (though many others may debate if that title should go to Once Upon a Time in America, or TGTBATU), and it is not to be missed for any reason. The movie is worth seeing alone for the performance of Henry Fonda as the merciless villain Frank. Pile on top of that the great Jason Robards, a marvellous Claudia Cardinale, and a solid Charles Bronson, and this just can't be missed.Today so many people seem skeptical of older westerns, but that skepticism is unfounded and could keep them from so many gems, especially this one. I would recommend that this not be the FIRST Western, or first Sergio Leone film that one views. Leone's style and pacing take a film or two to get used to, but to know the style is to love it. It is very dramatic, and while the unexperienced may read that as "Slow" they would be making a GRAVE error to do such a thing.From the camera work, to the acting, to the BEAUTIFUL score from Ennio Morricone, this is a legendary film that will leave you with a new standard as the best. There really isn't much more I can say without outright begging people to see this movie, so do just that; SEE IT. You'll thank me afterwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may have commented on the movie, but I was compelled to write after watching the wonderfully- prepared feature DVD. The video quality is absolutely excellent, IMO, with hardly any foreign artifacts (specks). Every now and then there was some digitizing in some dark scenes, but overall, the picture quality was outstanding, considering the age of the film. I wasn't so impressed with the enhanced stereo (5.1 mix) that was used. Sounds from things like the train in the opening sequence didn't follow the subject consistently, but the mono track is also included and it was enhanced to make the audio range more spatial. I urge those OUTW fans to access the optional commentary track that gives viewers a sharp insight into the making of this classic. Things that are discussed include the fact that Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) is actually the hub for the principal characters who weave their paths towards the climax. Also, watch for the use of water, which is vitally important to the story. It comes up so often and in so very many ways. Strange, since the very first frame shows such a parched and desolate land. The discussions also yield more about how director Sergio Leone was deeply influenced by many other filmmakers in his film that pays homage in so many obvious and even subtle ways (like using the song "Danny Boy" -- regarded as a "goof" in imdb -- sung by Maureen McBain [Marilu Carteny], which pays homage to a film that has a similar scene). It's ironic how so many filmmakers now pay homage to OUTW. And one other interesting note in the commentary was how the decision was made to use amplified ambient sounds in the opening scene instead of the music of Ennio Morricone. Those who have patience and are well- rested should thoroughly enjoy OUTW. Those who just want to see stuff blown up and have the patience of Indiana Jones with a gun may grow restless with this movie, which really takes its time to develop the story. Even Harmonica (Charles Bronson) urges Frank (Henry Fonda) not to rush things. Once Upon a Time in the West allows you to take a close look into the faces of all the characters in ways that no other filmmaker has ever succeeded in accomplishing so well. So get plenty of rest, cancel all your plans, pop the DVD in, crank up the volume.... and watch those false notes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest westerns of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This weekend I got the chance to watch this movie (again) on tv after not having seen it for so many years. And in my opinion it is still a fantastic movie. Although if you've got the chance, you should watch it on the big screen, not on tv.Best of all is the cinematography. How shall I explain it? The movie starts with three men waiting for a train at a train station in the middle of nowhere. Apart from the station master who wants to sell these men tickets, not a single word is spoken. You don't know anything about these men, you can only guess that the person they are waiting for must be on the next train. The scene is thirteen minutes (!) long, but it never gets boring. The whole film is made like that: many scenes are extremely long, and there is not much talking throughout the whole film, but it never gets boring. Despite its slow pacing the film manages to draw you in completely and despite its 165 minutes the film is not one minute too long.The characters are portrayed as real people, not 100% good, not 100% bad. The actors are really great. During the movie I was thinking: 'who else could play that role?' and I came up with no answers. Best of all was Jason Robards as Cheyenne and Henry Fonda as the villain (Frank). Charles Bronson as Harmonica is also excellent. But I also liked Claudia Cardinale's character (Jill). She plays a strong woman, quite untypical for a western and for the time in which this film was made (1968).This film focuses more on the dark side of the west, and the dark side of human nature as well. Contrary to "The Good The Bad And The Ugly" this film is not funny. As a matter of fact it is deadly earnest.Ennio Morricone's score is just great. It fits perfectly into the scenes and the main characters all have their own theme.All in all a brilliant film, a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple revenge story turned into a work of art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brett McBain, an Irish farmer widower, lives with his children in a poor, desert of the American West. He has prepared a welcome party for his new wife, "Jill" (Claudia Cardinale), who comes from New Orleans. When "Jill" arrives, she finds that a party of bandits murdered MacBain and his children.Among films as "The Searchers", "Rio Bravo", "The Wild Bunch", "Unforgiven" we put "C'era una volta il West". All are excellent, superb and unique.The meager Sergio Leone's film career is an exemplary example of qualitative change. Leone film after film exceeded the expectations created by their own fans by carrying out increasingly larger. Upon completion of the "Dollar Trilogy", Leone decided to show the final extinction of the "spaghetti-western".With "C'era una volta il West" the great Leone decided to stage a slow and agonizing death dance and had the help of a childhood friend, the famous composer Ennio Morricone."C'era una volta il West" is primarily a recreation for the senses, we face a pure mixture, the better hybrid achieved between the spaghetti-western and western American classic, where Sergio Leone made one of the best jobs his career, showing that besides being a real movie buff and know the western and few have enough quality to also make something new.The film has some sharp dialogue, memorable and accurate, nothing is superfluous and nothing lacking. The actors act unusually, with a beautiful Claudia Cardinale, Charles Bronson showing that will always be the best in that character. Jason Robards made a character that excited Peckinpah and was hired for "The Ballad of Cable Hogue". Henry Fonda has forged one of the best villains.Photography of Almeria and Monument Valley are unforgettable and were taken by the same director of photography film and Godard Pasolini, Tonino Delli Colli. Morricone's music with songs like "Like a judgament", one of the best soundtracks of all time, so good that Kubrick thought only hire Morricone but ultimately failed.Sergio Leone that is devoted to this film, the performance you get from this simple story of revenge to make it a work of art is incomparable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey, it's slow on purpose. Is that a good thing? When it's this gorgeous, yes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once Upon a Time in the West (1968)On the heels of "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly," is this equally sprawling and archetypal Western, this time with less obvious dubbing, and Henry Fonda as a kind of tie in to Hollywood's hero paradigm. It's indescribably beautiful, one of the most gorgeous Westerns ever photographed, indeed a model for good visual directing and cinematography in any genre. That alone makes the almost three hours a pure pleasure.But it's not a fast movie in any other way. It can't be. It depends on lingering over delicious details, small ones, shot up close in startling detail and ever deadpan looks and steely eyes. Nothing is believable and it's not meant to be. It's not even a fable, quite, but more a celebration of being inside an incredible film, as strange as that sounds. Not that the scenes are not believable--even the very last shots of the makeshift town and the railroad being built is about as realistic as it gets. Great stuff.Plot? You might, at times, wonder where the plot went. There are lots of bad guys, and you're not totally sure there's a protagonist, unless the one woman in the movie is the center of our concerns, even if she is clearly a bystander to it all. When it gets clear, in the last twenty minutes, it's again archetypal (and has echoes of the over the tops showdown in "Good Bad and Ugly"). A small bit of slow motion (not needed normally in a movie where everything is slow already) makes clear this is the key moment in the film, the thing that made the rest of it, with all its confusing and violent layers, sensible.For my money, I'd love all this incredible visceral stuff, the sounds and sights, filled in with some kind of deeply felt conflict, not a purely dramatic one. I watch and am shocked, or swept away, or impressed, or dazzled, but I'm actually never moved, not from the heart. And there are plenty of aspects here that should really move us--including feeling for the woman's plight, rather than simply recognizing that it is, after all, quite a plight.Still, another landmark Sergio Leone movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once Upon a Time in The West: Love Poem to the American Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once Upon a Time in The West is my all time favorite film as well as my favorite movie score. Bernardo Bertolucci, the co-writer of Once Upon a Time in The West, later directs The Last Emperor, which is my second all time favorite film as well as my second favorite movie score. Beware this is not your usual western. It is epic poetry. It is opera. It is a perfectly crafted art film that expresses Sergio Leone's true love for the great American Westerns. Leone doesn't necessarily romanticize the American West, he romanticizes American Western films. He makes references to High Noon, 3:10 to Yuma, The Comancheros, Shane, The Searchers, My Darling Clementine and many other great American Westerns very much the way Quentin Tarrantino has made films that pay homage to the gangster film genre. BTW Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds pays tribute to this film with an opening sequence entitled Once Upon a Time in Nazi-Occupied France.Although most of the film was shot in Spain &amp; Italy like most spaghetti westerns, Leone traveled to John Ford's Monument Valley to capture the authentic Western United States panorama. Like Nicholas Ray's Johnny Guitar, it has a poetic quality that uses strong symbolism; but instead of symbolic words and lyrical phrases in the dialog, Leone relies on the alliteration of sights and sounds to formulate poetic stanzas out of every scene. The length of the film is a result of Leone's choice to direct in a sometimes painstakingly slow pace that builds up incredible tension before key action scenes. He allows us time to imbibe the majestic landscapes, and appreciate the details of the authentic sets and costume design documenting this pivotal period in American history. Instead of cluttering the beauty of his carefully photographed frames with dialog, close shots of these actor's iconic faces express all that needs to be said.Ennio Morricone, also my favorite movie composer, scored five distinct musical themes that embody each of the main characters: widowed new bride Jill (Claudia Cardinale), mysterious harmonica-playing gunman (Charles Bronson), bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards), hired gun Frank (Henry Fonda) and railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti). Instead of a musical prelude, the movie opens with a symphony of natural sounds using a screeching windmill, a buzzing fly, dropping water and a ticking telegraph. Meticulous sound editors maintain continuity throughout this mostly visual narrative, composing a perfect harmony between each of the main character's musical motifs along side the multitude of natural sounds mostly inspired by the two major symbols, the railroad and the water. An impressive lengthy tracking shot introduces the "anti-heroine" Jill as well as the beginnings of a bustling railroad town. Don't miss the first few minutes of this movie. Without music nor dialog, Leone creates one of the most suspenseful thrilling first few minutes of a movie whilst still rolling the opening credits. For all 168 minutes I was captivated by each and every frame! Once Upon a Time in the West is the finest example of Sergio Leone's creativity and perfectionism as a director, but most of all it is his greatest testament of love for the American Western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly great western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A railroad magnate named Morton, Gabriele Ferzetti, hires a cruel gunman named Frank, Henry Fonda, to "remove obstacles from the track." One of the obstacles is Brett McBain, who owns some water rich land the railroad must pass through. Frank massacres McBain and his family, framing a local bandit named Cheyenne, Jason Robards, in the process. Unbeknownst to Frank, McBain married Jill, Claudia Cardinale, on a recent trip to New Orleans. Jill arrives to find her new family dead and herself in possession of the land Frank will certainly kill again to obtain. Jill's survival depends on Cheyenne, who wants to find out who framed him, and a mysterious stranger called Harmonica, Charles Bronson, who has his own business to conduct with Frank."Once Upon A Time In The West" is perhaps the most beautiful western ever filmed. Employing his signature style, director Sergio Leone uses the wide screen format with the skill of a master painter, alternating breath-taking vistas with stunning close-ups against the magnificent score by Ennio Morricone. Leone lets the story unfold slowly. Characters surrender their motivations only grudgingly, all the while slowly building to a powerful conclusion. The pace of the film, which I credit as one of its strengths, may also be its main drawback today. Many members of the post-MTV generation accustomed to quick editing may not have the patience to let themselves be swept up by this film. That is a pity."Once Upon A Time In The West" stands as Leone's homage to the great, and not so great, western films that came before him. "Johnny Guitar" certainly springs to mind and the opening sequence makes an undeniable nod toward "High Noon." However, unlike Quentin Tarantino's recent homage to his roots, "Kill Bill, Vol. 1," this film not only stands on its own two feet, it expands the genre. These characters are more than a group of archetypes wandering about under the western sun. Jill isn't your traditional victimized widow. A New Orleans prostitute taking a chance on a new life on the frontier, she's an independent woman who knows men. If sleeping with Frank is the only way to save her life, she will, knowing that after a hot bath she'll be the same as she was before. Frank, in a brilliant performance against type by Henry Fonda, is also a man in transition. He envies the power flowing from Morton's money. He would like to become more like Morton, but his propensity toward baser evil deprives him of the discipline he needs to become a businessman. Cheyenne seeks revenge for being framed and pretends to interested in the wealth the McBain land will bring, but he is mainly motivated by growing feelings for Jill. He's the most sentimental character in the film. He's a bandit with a heart of gold, which is more than can be said for Harmonica. Harmonica, the man with no name, develops a liking for both Jill and Cheyenne, but one gets the feeling he would sacrifice either or both of them if there was no other way to get Frank. He is not the classic, selfless western hero of old.When I originally saw this film, I was disappointed by Bronson. I didn't think he made the most of a role obviously tailor-made for Clint Eastwood. I was mistaken. Bronson brought nuance to the role I doubt Eastwood would have at that stage of his career. In his three films with Leone, Eastwood's "Man with No Name" character tended toward smug amorality motivated only by self-interest. Harmonica has a little more depth and introspection than Eastwood's characters. He plays him with a certain sadness in his eyes; a doomed self-awareness. Harmonica realizes when he kills Frank the remainder of his life will be devoid of meaning or purpose. He doesn't speak much, but he tellingly attempts to wax philosophically with Frank about the nature of men of like themselves and the changing West. In a sense, he knows Frank is the only person who could understand him, since he had to become a gunman like Frank in order to achieve his well- deserved revenge. The characters Eastwood played for Leone were less troubled about their place in the universe than Bronson's Harmonica. This might be Bronson's best performance."Once Upon A Time In The West" deserves an esteemed place among the canon of great westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite western, bar none</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was drawn in from the opening sequence. Three hard men (led by Jack Elam) stake out the train station, waiting. We watch them for EIGHT MINUTES, learning their personalities, watching how they work. 8 minutes with almost no dialog, no sound other than the creaking of the turning windmill in the background. Then within a minute of the hero's arrival, they are dead. Eight minutes dedicated to developing characters we will never see again. No, this is not a movie for the average 1990's viewer; 3 minute attention span between explosions, but for anyone willing to watch and see the craft involved on all levels this is one of the most brilliant movies ever made.The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is undoubtably the best remembered of Sergio Leone's "spaghetti westerns" but this is by far his best work. Never a more evil villain than Fonda. Eastwood's Man With No Name was never as inscrutable as Bronson's Harmonica. The viewer knows from almost the beginning of the movie that Fonda and Bronson are destined to meet, and that one of them will die. We spend the entire movie figuring out, Why? As trite as it sounds, it's true; they don't make them like this any more and the world is poorer for it, thank God we have these to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie Ever Made-You'll find it right here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MOVIE 10.0/10.0 [This review is of the DVD wide screen version viewed on a 42" Plasma with Dolby 5.1 surround sound.]This is the best Western ever made....perhaps the greatest movie ever made. I fully realize the gravity of such a proclamation, because there is another movie out there titled "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" that is also a masterpiece. This will be a long review and I don't apologize because it is indeed an honor to watch and to review the "perfect movie". The sad fact that this brilliant achievement won no awards and even stranger, was actually disliked by some reviewers is a testimonial to the boundless stupidity of some humans who waste space on this planet.Sergio Leone accomplished so many things in this film that it almost impossible to contemplate. Oh my goat, that musical score by Morricone when blended with the perfect casting and the breathtaking cinematography produces a Western Opera that stands alone in brilliance and watchability.This movie is about the West's love/hate relationship with the railroad, the ruthless greed of men...and revenge. This Western classic engages the viewer with stealth parsimony of words, brilliantly using character close-ups to portray what thousands of words could not say. The showdown and surprise revelation of Harmonica mission of revenge is dramatic genius at the highest level. This movie is a grand lament to the passing of the Old West and the beginning of a new era. Signs of decay are everywhere as the progress is the form of two shiny rails marches steadily forward.MUSICAL SCORE/SIGHTS/SOUNDS infinity/10.00 Wow! Each major character had his or her own unique music and hearing this mix cranked up on a good home theater system cannot fail to exhilarate anyone who listens to this marvelous score. The electric guitar for Frank...that gaiting, ambling banjo with breathtakingly potent pauses for Cheyenne...the strings for Jill and, of course, that haunting harmonica for Harmonica provided a an auditory feast that can never be duplicated or topped. This movie is all about sights and sounds, and the sounds were magnificent. The genius of Leone turned mundane sounds into unforgettable landmarks in this marvelous film. I cannot say enough about the astonishing FACT that this movie only contained FIFTEEN pages of dialogue! Leon and Morricone optimized the use of the musical score, powerful close-ups of the characters and those wonderfully potent sounds. Who could forget that squeaking windmill, the timely whinny of the horses, the cicadas chirping and not chirping, and the heartbeat of the powerful locomotive.... I could go on and on of how these sights and sounds wove a powerful tapestry in this magnificent movie. Sergio Leone puts on a director's clinic of how to turn less into more. Magnificent!BADDASSCICITY--- Unchartable/10.0 Look no further, you'll find it here.Anyone who reads my reviews knows the importance of this designation and I must make a few comments about Jill, played by the Italian beauty Claudia Cardinale. My Goat! they just don't make women like this anymore! Jill is a breath-taking beauty.... and a whore...and she knows it. After being confronted by Cheyenne she DARES him and his men to bend her over a table and. she spits out confident vitriol that leaves the bad Cheyenne almost without words. She is as cool and ruthless as she is beautiful, spitting out one-liners like a Clint Eastwood...."But there again.... I don't look like a poor, defenseless widow"...and proceeds to slam down a hefty shot of straight bar whiskey! She could charm the devil out of his pitchfork as she "negotiates" the super-bad Frank out of killing her with pure, lusty sex.Henry Fonda! Leone pulls off the impossible as he casts Fonda, the American icon as a bad guy, and what a bad boy he is! Fonda's character Frank has no problem putting a cap in anyone, even a nine-year-old boy! Frank is a ruthless killer and the very embodiment of a Western villain with that steely blue gaze. He kicks the crutch out from the crippled Morton and sends him crashing to the ground! CHILLING.All of the gunslingers are badasses or dead, and even some of the very baddest still end up dead, on the wrong end of a bullet. The one who rises above all the rest, only identified as Harmonica, is played brilliantly by Charles Bronson. The opening scene sets the stage for the baddest of the bad who tells the 3 hired guns that they brought 2 horses too many. MEMORABLE!The final showdown between Frank and Harmonica is one of the most dramatic scenes ever filmed in a Western.Think about it.....only FIFTEEN pages of dialogue in the entire movie. The one-liners are absolutely incredible. The opening scene set the stage and has never been topped....OMG, we are not worthy, we are not worthy!!!!...Harmonica: Did you bring a horse for me? Snaky : Well... looks like we're... looks like we're shy one horse.[bad guys laugh] Harmonica :[slowly shaking head] You brought two too many.[bad guys are no longer laughing]Cheyenne: Do you only know how to play....or can you shoot, too?Harmonica: I saw three of these dusters a short time ago, they were waiting for a train. Inside the dusters, there were three men. Inside the men...there were three bulletsHarmonica: : Well, you know music, and you can count - all the way up to two.Jill: If you want to, you can lay me over the table and amuse yourself. And even call in your men! Well. No woman ever died from that. When you're finished, all I'll need will be a tub of boiling water, and I'll be exactly what I was before - with just another filthy memory! Cheyenne: [sighs] You make good coffee, at least?Cheyenne: You know, Jill, you remind me of my mother. She was the biggest whore in Alameda and the finest woman that ever lived.Frank: People scare better when they're dyin'Frank: When you're not on that train, you're like a turtle out of its shellFrank: So you're the one who makes appointments. Harmonica : And you're the one who doesn't keep them.Harmonica: Do you only know how to shoot....or can you cut, too?Frank: How can you trust a man who wears both a belt and suspenders?Jill: You don't look at all like a man who is the noble defender of poor, defenseless widows.... but again...I don't look like a poor, defenseless widow [slams down shot of whiskey]SAPPINESS 0.000001/10.0 NoneIt's not often that I am taken by a female lead in a movie, but the character of Jill simply blew me away. Those eyes! Claudia Cardinale is a classic Italian beauty that played a powerful and sensual role in this movie. I freely admit that I would gladly give one year's corporate salary to have been Henry Fonda's hands when he was running them under that corset! When Frank admitted to killing her husband, her response was to stick her tongue about six inches down his throat! Wow! A whore is the truest sense, but a whore that you marry...a thousand times.******SPOILERS HEREIN******If you haven't already, RUN, don't walk to your nearest outlet and purchase this wonderful DVD. Virtually every scene in this movie is memorable, but I would like to review just THREE of them.Opening Scene- Much has been written and said about this wildly original opening scene. It is simply awesome and sets the tone for a movie that is not like anything you have ever seen before. The run-down station is the very embodiment of the decaying west, the end of an era. Sights and sounds dominate, as they do throughout the movie and who could ever forget that annoying, squeaking windmill or that fly! Three men with three horses have come to meet one man on a train, but only one walks away. One liners and BADASSCICITY are redefined in the opening scene. "You brought two horses too many' will be forever burned in my brain as the BADDEST comment ever uttered by a screen character. HELL YES!The Bar- Lionel Stander's Bar! What a place this was! Mere words cannot describe it, but I'll try. Inside it was a labyrinth, with no perceived beginning or end. There were horses eating hay, saddles stacked up, a blacksmith pounding a horseshoe, huge wicker jugs of hooch, little old ladies in bonnets, huge hunks of red meat being cut with hefty meat cleavers, A Black Crow lawmen with a huge gun washing his feet.... AND MUCH, MUCH MORE.This is the scene where Cheyenne meets Harmonica and they both see Jill for the first time. Like the entire movie, this scene is very short on words, but rockets out of the stratosphere with heavy drama. Sam has stopped to slake his thirst with one of those huge jugs when Jill decides to saunter in and strikes up a conversation with the Barman.... when [oh, the beautiful sounds] action is heard, but not seen outside with Cheyenne disposing of his escort taking him to jail. Still manacled, Cheyenne [accompanied by that strumming banjo] bellies to the bar and says, "jug, drinks and then hears the haunting harmonica. HELL YES! That lantern swaying to and fro with the heavy guitar and harmonica is a stunning use of a musical score to introduce Harmonica, who is immediately sized up by Cheyenne. Very, very few words are spoken, but the message is powerfully presented, the gunslingers communicate mutual respect without words, and after all the heavy action, Jill and the Barman resume their conversation almost in mid-sentence! The one-liners are awesome in this magnificent scene, a feast for those who love these movies!Showdown- This is it, folks. This is the HOLY GRAIL of Western Movie scenes. This is the face-off between Harmonica (Charles Bronson) and Frank (Henry Fonda) and is a scene that is surreal and almost supernatural in its drama. The brilliant musical score, the panoramic shots of the breathtaking landscape and the incredible use of close-ups draws the viewer into scene to end all scenes. Frank has come to find out, once and for all, just why Harmonica is stalking him, and Harmonica tells him that he will tell him "only at the point of dying". Before the shooting begins, with a revealing and chilling flashback, it is shown that a younger Frank and a much younger Harmonica, have met before. The very essence of Frank's depravity is shown as he approaches a bizarre and sinister man-made stone arch, symbolic of the very gateway to death and evil. Frank's henchmen are nonchalantly lying around, their evil work done. Frank emanates evil as he crams a harmonica into the mouth of a sweating, crying boy, valiantly trying to support his older brother on his shoulders...a brother with hands bound and a noose around his neck. The musical score and drama reach a pitch as the boy inevitably falls to the ground and into the dust, insuring the death of his brother. UNFORGETABLE! This scene is replayed in the minds eye of Frank after Harmonica caps him right in the heart.... The Angel of Death.... revenge consummated, and Frank finally realizes with his last dying breath...just who Harmonica is. CHILLING!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The West: Still Wild And In Wonderful Widescreen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plaintive wail of an harmonica echoes across a dusty landscape flattened by a merciless sun. Soon, the savage, ringing chords of an electric guitar answer in explosive dissonance. In front of this aural disruption a weatherbeaten humanity scrambles in and out of buildings and across walkways hacked from trees and thrown together too roughly. A fearsome lust to own the land draws the righteous and the corrupt alike. There is greed aplenty. Murder is no stranger. And vengeance hangs in the air. Sergio Leone's undying love for the Western reached its zenith in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. The film is a sprawling tapestry come to life, teeming with energy, highly stylized in its look and tempo. Like SHANE before it, Leone's unqualified masterpiece has influenced every Western in its wake. The film is complemented greatly by the magnificence of Ennio Morricone's music and Tonino Delli Colli's breathtaking widescreen photography. The performances are seminal works. Though Henry Fonda had played it hard and mean before (see John Ford's FORT APACHE and MY DARLING CLEMENTINE), he knocked the audience for a loop with his grizzled bad guy. Robards gives his world-weary rogue irresistible charm. Bronson is galvanizing as the man on a mission (he's SHANE gone slightly maniacal). And the graceful determinism of Cardinale adds a much needed civility to the surrounding upheaval. This is Leone's greatest film and ONCE is absolutely essential viewing. Other Westerns worth viewing: RED RIVER (1948); HIGH NOON (1952); SHANE (1953); FORT APACHE (1948); MY DARLING CLEMENTINE (1946)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Western ever made??? Not quite, but still is AMAZING!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the great success of the masterpiece "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" which perfectly finished the "Dollars" trilogy. Sergio Leone get bored with nothing to do, and decided to start another trilogy, the "America" trilogy with "Once upon a time in the West". That today is considered the best Western ever made in the history of cinema."Once upon a time in the West" begins when the farmer Brett McBain (Frank Wolff) and his sons are murdered in cold blood by the hands of the ruthless bounty-killer Frank (Henry Fonda) who puts the blame on the criminal Cheyenne (Jason Robards). Frank was hired by the legged-rail baron Morton (Gabrielle Ferzetti) to just scare away McBain and his family of their land, because she would be much valued with the advancement of the railroad. But on the same day Jill (Claudia Cardinale) arrives in town, coming from New Orleans, and when she finds out of the crime she reveals that she married Brett McBain weeks before in New Orleans and therefore the land still had a owner. On the same day, Jill meets a mysterious man who is known for Harmonica (Charles Bronson) because he always carries with himself a harmonica, and offers itself as a protector of Jill. And when the criminal Cheyenne knows that he is being unfairly prosecuted, he decides to join forces with Harmonica to help Jill keep the lands of her deceased husband. But a web of mystery and deceit circulates between the contradictory relationship of the characters.When the film premiered at the time it was poorly received by critics and was a box office failure, only today that the critics and the public praised the film as not only the best Sergio Leone's movie, but also the best Western ever made. Well, not quite (in my opinion), but I understand why people praise him as such. The main complain of the critics to the film at the time, it was that the film was extreme slow. But this slowness is caused by some reasons.The first one is that the film was completely different from all the Western films ever made, even from the "Dollars" trilogy because Leone gives the film a dramatic tone. What Leone tries to show in the story is the end of the Old West, the title shows that perfectly. The original translation from Italian to English was "Once upon a time THE West", that is, the end of the Old West. And that originally came in the time of the advance of the railways, and the grand corruption and death that she brought to the population. Leone shows that giving the film an excellent script (written by him and Sergio Donati), which gives the film a superb narrative with beautiful dialogs between the characters, but like any Leone's film, it never loses his great sense of humor.The other reason is, as always. the magnificent direction of Leone, which once again shows advanced for its time. With its perfect close-ups on characters and enormous scenarios, making everything beautiful and epic. But there it comes the problem that prevents the film to even beat "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly". Leone was known for his quiet moments brilliantly filmed, and "Once upon a time" is full of them (but maybe too much). Without considering the first 10 minutes of the film (which is brilliant, putting us in the heat of the scene), but others seem to boring taking the power of narrative and our investment on them.Another problem with the film is the relevance of the characters. Not that they are not superb and memorable (which they are): Jill is nothing more nor less than the representation of the women in the world of men in the Old West and its extreme strength and intelligence, along with an excellent performance from Cardinale; Cheyenne can be compared with Tuco from "The Good, The Bad and the Ugly", both characters are cruel bandits, but in several times they are shown to be simple human beings with their problems and their kind and innocent side; Frank is another cruel-badass villain that Leone built in his films, Frank is a bounty-killer who in previous films its showed that they are honored to their "job", do whoever they were told and paid for and nothing more. But Frank in the film betrays its own principles, and gets into the corrupt world of the railways; Harmonica is almost the same character that Clint Eastwood was in previous Leone films. Mysterious, don't talk much, and never shows his true motives (only at the most epic and badass moment of the film). All characters are fantastic, but thanks to the silent moments of Leone, their relevance and relationship fails in several moments in the history.I don't agree that this is the best Western film ever made, but I understand why people consider it so. From a fabulous story that shows excellently the end of the era of legends with a flawless script, magnificent direction and unforgettable characters. All this makes "Once upon a time" not only one of the best Western films ever made, but a beautiful masterpiece of cinema and the beginning of another amazing trilogy! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the certainly the best of Leone,at least to me(while the others being "The Good The Bad &amp; The Ugly", "A FistFul of Dollars" and "For a Few Dollars More". Actually i watched the movie after i watched the dollar series and this is also my second movie of Bronson and buoy what an actor he was!! He could not only kill someone with his power but silence Morricone is just like a God here with his presence in terms of music and Bronson the ultimate 'Harmonica'. Look at him in the first glance and one will find the reality in his character as portrayed by Bronson since his presence and throughout. This movie really touches heart with story, awesome direction, of course the heavenly music ( by Morricone), super negative role by Fonda and the silence of Bronson. O God! if we had him (Charles Bronson) now he would have certainly created havoc. Just unforgettable!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It might be a sacrilege to call this a better Spaghetti Western than 'The Good, the bad, and the Ugly' but i loved both the films equally. The mellifluous soundtrack by Ennio Morricone further adds to the greatness of the movie.Jason Robards provides the much needed humor in the film. Frank(Henry Fonda) and gang kill all the MacBains. Frank fakes evidence and makes everyone believe Cheyenne's hand behind the heinous crime. Frank's activities are funded by an affluent owner of the train company, Mr.Morton. The secret idea was to grab the land the MacBains live on, which could fetch them millions of dollars.Their plans are thwarted by the arrival of a certain Mrs.MacBain, who refuses to sell the property to Frank, and a man who goes around playing harmonica. The man is after Frank to avenge his brother's death and with the help of Cheyenne, they bring his plans down one by one. They slowly decimate Frank's manpower, then take hold of the land through auction and then put a bullet in Frank's body. The man however doesn't wait for the bounty and leaves the town after accomplishing what he had come for. Cheyenne dies after being shot by a dying Mr.Morton and Mrs.MacBain decides to stay in the town and watch MacBains' town build and grow.</fullReview>

Leone blends all the actors also beautifully and typically into his style... None of these actors would have acted again in the way they did for a Sergio Leone movie, I'm sure!A beautifully shot movie and those typical Sergio Leone Close Up scenes just build the tension and suspense... I'm waiting to see these typical Leone Close Ups in 'Django Unchained' as promised by Tarantino! Leone's best movie for me!

		<shortDescription>Title raped for Germans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The crucial moment of the film is Henry Fonda saying "make your loving brother happy", which was translated for the Germans to "Spiel mir das Lied vom Tod". This sentence means "play me the song of death", and this was also made the title of the whole film in German language.I still wonder how it is possible for some jerks to rape hundreds of films like this over decades, make a lot of money and get away with it. The same goes with "The deer hunter" which is for Germany translated to something like "The ones who went through hell", or "Deliverance", translated to something like "Everybody's the next one to die". And the most interesting thing is, that obviously nobody from the whole original production-crew seems to object, they seem to be not interested in how their product comes across in Germany.</fullReview>

I consider this as one of the greatest openings for any movie. It goes on for like ten minutes and when the train appear, you wish the scene could have been lasted a little bit longer.Charles Bronson plays the main character, his performance is similar to Clint Eastwood in the Dollars trilogy. But he pulls it off pretty good, and through out the movie you get to know more about his past and why he's playing on the harmonica. You get to know a dark secret at the end, which makes the character fully developed. This right here makes the movie stronger then ''The Good The Bad and The Ugly''. Because in that movie you don't really get to know Clint Eastwood character, which makes him interesting. But you wish sometimes that you just could have get to known the character a little bit better.But what is a western without an incredible soundtrack, well ''The Good The Bad and The Ugly'' is most known for Ennio Marricones fantastic soundtrack. But ''Once Upon A Time in The West'' is in my opinion better, it's so fantastic to listen to, that I can not even describe how amazing it is. You just got to listen.Anyways, there is much more I love with this movie. But I don't wan't to ruin my hands writing every single detail I love. But I highly recommend this movie, even if your not a western fan it is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flashbacks done right - Once Upon a Time in the West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with the other reviewers about the superlatives of this film but I haven't noticed a discussion on the use of the flashback so capably offered here. I am referring to Bronson's Harmonica recalling the incident that brought about his revenge for Fonda's Frank character: I am sure I will be corrected if this is in error but there are four total flashbacks where we get more information each time through a blurry recollection until in the final instance Fonda has the crystal clear flashback and we see Frank much younger committing his unspeakable crime. This fourth and final flashback clarifies to the villain and the film audience the motivation for the payback just as he finally "bites the dust". If you like Bronson here seek out the hard to find Rider on the Rain - not a Western but I think filmed in the same time period by a different director: At this time we can see Bronson is becoming this multi-national everyman hero that exploded his popularity. Truly watchable film entertainment that holds up beautifully upon repeat viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone goes a new route with the same results.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a style very much unlike that of his previous three Westerns, Once Upon a Time in the West takes a long time to tell this epic and powerful tale of three men all connected by their past and all destined to connect in the future. The acting is universally excellent with Fonda playing a very uncharacteristic part, but since he is such a great actor he has no problem filling the shoes of the merciless gunslinger, Frank. Jason Robards is great as the outlaw with a good heart, Cheyenne; and Charles Bronson is very Eastwood-like as a man known only as Harmonica with a mysterious past and a quick draw. The central character, though, is that of the beautiful Claudia Cardinale as Jill, a widow seeking revenge.Sergio Leone used a slower, more romantic style for this Western, but he still was able to produce some great images and a story that will forever be remembered. He doesn't deal too much with character development, rather showing us their actions and letting that speak for themselves. And, of course we cannot forget the score by Ennio Moriconne. Though not as memorable as The Good, Bad and the Ugly, it adds a great deal to the film. Certainly one of the best Westerns ever made, this is film making at a very high degree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once Upon A Time...There Were Westerns!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film as a 20 year old in the late 80's on VHS &amp; ended up thoroughly disappointed. Every scene seemed to stretch to near-infinity and the action was too sporadic for what I normally expected from a western. Now, however, things are different! I saw it again a few days ago after reading so many positive reviews &amp; I must admit to pretty much being bowled over! 'Once Upon A Time In The West' is not your traditional shoot-em-up western. Its an acquired taste and I wouldn't be too far off the mark if I say that it resembles a dish with near-perfect proportions of ingredients, slow cooked over an intense fire. Director Leone doffs his hat to several classic westerns and ends up with a film thats greater than the sum of its parts. The lovely Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) arrives in the old west to join her new husband &amp; family only to find them all brutally shot dead. Clues apparently point to the bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards) though the dastardly deed has in fact been perpetrated by the magnificently evil Frank (Henry Fonda). Also in this lethal mix is a mysterious harmonica-playing stranger (Charles Bronson) with his own covert agenda. From the classic opening scene to the explosive climax, 'Once Upon A Time In The West' sucks the viewer into its vortex of emotions as layers upon layers are gradually peeled away revealing each characters true motivations. Featuring a stellar cast who have probably never been better, and a haunting, evocative score by maestro Ennio Morricone, 'Once Upon A Time In The West' is mandatory viewing for all film aficionado's. My only (small) complaint is the occasional self-indulgence displayed by Leone when he tends to give style precedence over narrative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest western ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The so-called spaghetti Western achieved its apotheosis in Sergio Leone's magnificently mythic (and utterly outlandish) Once upon a Time in the West. After a series of international hits starring Clint Eastwood (from A Fistful of Dollars to The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly), Leone outdid himself with this spectacular, larger-than-life, horse-operatic epic about how the West was won. (And make no mistake: this is the wide, wide West, folks--so the widescreen/letter boxed version is strongly recommended.) The unholy trinity of Italian cinema--Leone, Bernardo Bertolucci, and Dario Argento--concocted the story about a woman (Claudia Cardinale) hanging onto her land in hopes that the transcontinental railroad would reach her before a steely-eyed, black-hearted killer (Fonda) does. (The film's advertising slogan was: "There were three men in her life. One to take her ... one to love her ... and one to kill her.") Meanwhile, Leone shoots his stars' faces as if they were expansive Western landscapes, and their towering bodies as if they were looming rock formations in John Ford's Monument Valley</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the opening sequence of three non-verbal gunmen waiting for someone at a train station, grimly determined through the flies, dust, and leaky roof, to the inevitable quick-draw climax shot in extreme close-up with little or no dialogue, Once Upon a Time in the West astounds and entertains with its inventiveness, referencing of other westerns, and its judicious use of actors' reactions to tell the story.The influence of this film on modern movies is unmistakable. In the sudden demise of pseudo-protagonists in A History of Violence, or the complete vision-and-sound opening 20 minutes of There Will Be Blood, we see the ripples of Leone's first American masterpiece. At the time of writing revisionist westerns like The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford are having their day in the sun. But put a Colt 45 to my head and make me choose between these two great movies, and I'll take Bronson's revenge-driven cool over Pitt's sado-masochistic angst every time.Leone is a master of timing and pace. There isn't a missed beat here, but the sequence that most impresses is Henry Fonda's saloon exit into a street populated with assassins. In one sequence we have rising tension, new questions for the audience about Harmonica's motivations, and evidence that Frank is a formidable antagonist when he cleanly and economically picks off three gunmen.Often acclaimed for its visual storytelling, the dialogue in Once is spectacularly high-calibre. From the first punched beat about the number of horses, through to Fonda's throwing down the gauntlet to a waiting Bronson, the dialogue continually stays true to the characters while moving the story forward and telling us something new. And sometimes it's funny.It could reasonably be argued that this is the best western ever made, and will no doubt be number one on many people's all-time best film list. In short, a timeless classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE most moving western ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have heard throughout the reviews of this movie on the web and on the extras of my $5 DVD from Walmart that Sergio Leone, the illustrious director of this and the Dollars Trilogy, was a die-hard perfectionist. He concentrated his efforts on the perfect picture to paint in the viewer's head every scene he shot, and you know what? It worked.As a result of Leone's close-up face shots (there are plenty), the tireless work put in to ensure the authenticity of every set, and the flawless acting from the entire cast (Bronson is particularly good here), this film brings together an ultimately simple story into a 3-hour masterpiece. I seriously can't think of a thing wrong with this movie, unless it's the fact that it's so good no western will ever compare to it.Ennio Morricone's score brings everything together beautifully as each piece is always appropriate for its scene. The music is one of the integral parts of the movie, and as a result watching it is an experience best had when you have plenty of time with no distractions whatsoever, and not much on your mind. It's almost a disservice not to give it your full attention when watching.Oh, didn't I say it already? See this movie. Now. If you already have? Fine, see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trans-genre, highly influenced and influential, vengeance narrative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally I'm suspicious of Westerns, mostly because I really don't like the Cowboys and Indians sub-genre and I'm not very keen on the expansionist themes inherent in most Westerns, stated or otherwise. Like any genre, however, there are exceptions, and of course Once Upon a Time in the West is one of them. Sergio Leone creates a methodical, tension-rising piece of vengeance narrative set in the hard-grit reality of the West, featuring gorgeous vistas, compellingly brown-faced gunslingers, and a surprisingly unique rocking score by Ennio Morricone.Four people arrive in a small town in one day. The first is a mysterious stranger later dubbed "Harmonica" because of his token entrance cue and prominent instrument playing, a man searching for a one "Frank." The other is Frank himself, psychotic yet conniving muscle-man of a railroad emperor, out to gain his own business prospects and kill a few men, women, and children in the process. The third is handsome Cheyenne, rascal bandit of the old-school type who has his honor but also his history. And the fourth, and most important, is Jill McBain, ex-prostitute from New Orleans come to a wedding destroyed by cause of death of the groom, who has to learn how to protect her own interests in an outlaw world of grit and steel as the three men connive over the various things they want from her.Leone takes his time, building relationships like Kurosawa and allowing the camera to just soak in the imagery like his contemporary and script-writer, Dario Argento. Leone is famous for his "spaghetti westerns", Italian takes on what is quintessentially an American-themed genre, but he shows an awareness, respect, and even joy for the type of imagery and action that the genre creates. Furthermore, he sees the isolation as key--this vengeance narrative could not exist in the vigilante-style of a city, nor in a much more temperate climate, much less could the characters really grasp and engage with each other the same way had they closer connections. In a way, heck, one could consider this film something of a horror film, as the unknown (the motivations of Harmonica) drives anxiety and tension to an ultimate moment of revelation that stabs right for the gut. So fine, compare Leone to Hitchcock, too.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I have a feelin' when he stops whittlin', somethin's gonna happen."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When composer Ennio Morricone first got the script for "Once Upon A Time In The West", he was so impressed with the story that he began writing the music for it immediately. The entire movie was scored before even a single frame was shot, and Sergio Leone liked it so much that he had portions played for the actors while rehearsing to get them to 'flow' with the music. One could go so far as to say that a good part of the picture was filmed to the score! It took me a long time to get around to this film, but it was certainly worth the wait. Any movie that opens with Jack Elam and Woody Strode has got to get your attention, but when their characters didn't survive the opening sequence, I knew this was going to be something special. Actually, having seen Elam in countless movies and TV Western episodes, I can safely say that this is the best performance I've ever seen him in. His sparring with the fly to the omnipresent creak of the windmill was an inspired piece of work, and if you didn't know anything about the story going in, you would think that these players would have a major role in the story to come. And then Bronson appears! And then Henry Fonda appears. Curiously, his character's name was Frank. It didn't take until the end of the movie to make the connection to Frank James, brother of outlaw Jesse, and the character Fonda portrayed in two much earlier movies - 1939's "Jesse James", and the sequel, 1940's "The Return of Frank James". It made me wonder if Sergio Leone's original script named the character Frank, or if it was a result of getting Fonda for the part. It's no secret that Leone had been after Fonda to appear in one of his Westerns for a few years, with Fonda declining because every script he ever read was in Leone's fractured English. Fonda eventually relied on friend Eli Wallach's (Tuco/The Ugly in "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly) advice, who said he would have the time of his life.More than most, this is a Western that in turn, defines and is defined by the music. Even Bronson's character is called Harmonica, and his tunes are played to haunting effect. They mask a much deadlier nature to the quiet stranger - "He not only plays, he can shoot too".It took me a bit into the story to figure out it was Jason Robards under the beard of Cheyenne. I think it was interesting the way his character was written, leaving it ambiguous whether he was a lawman or an outlaw. The bigger surprise though had to do with a female character in the lead role, capably performed by Claudia Cardinale. She manages to arc through a wide range of characterizations throughout the story as situations call for, holding her own well against each of the male principals.This is certainly a film I'll have to watch a few more times for some of the points noted above. In particular, the single scene I could watch over and over, one that is inextricably linked with it's musical score, is Fonda's death scene set to the strain of Morricone's dying harmonica. Not only creative, but as effective as any finale in a Western I can think of.As a final thought, I was considering how Sergio Leone could have used the title "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" for this movie if it hadn't already been taken by another one of his legendary classics. But then again, Robards wasn't that ugly.</fullReview>

From Director Sergio Leone who did The Man with No Name films and Once Upon a Time in America and those were great films but this the best Sergio Leone western ever. Also Henry Fonda and Jason Robarbs were the perfect suit for the characters. Claudia Cardinale was Hot in that film, in all the western films I ever seen, I believe she is the most beautiful western characters out of all. Charles Bronson was 100% great in his role as Harmonica and the best character in the film. Sergio Leone did a very good job of directing the film like his other great western films and I honor Sergio as the best director in Western Films in Hollywood History. Let this film be remembered as one of the greatest western film in History.I give this a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people have written about this movie over the years, therefore this is just another positive comment about probably the closest to perfect movie you will ever see.My collection of Western movies is endless, from Alan Ladd to the master of the cowboy Clint Eastwood. But this movie leads the pack just ahead of the Good the Bad and the Ugly.The story is simple and complicated at the same time.. if that makes sense. It is constructed in such a way that you become deeply entrenched into each characters persona, and the story as it unfolds slowly. Sergio Leone is the master of turning a standard scene into a small story in its self. He describes a character not with words but with actions. The scene with Snaky (Jack Elam)and the fly is classical Leone as are many other scenes with no dialog...brilliant! Dialogue is not plentiful but it is perfect. Its Quality rather than Quantity in this movie!The settings around the movie capitulate the whole story and is probably the closest you would get to reality in the West.If you want to watch a classic film that you will never forget, then Once Upon a Time in the West is it.You really cannot call yourself a fan of the Western if you do not love and appreciate this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another epic western from Sergio Leone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never thought Leone could ever top The Good The Bad The Ugly, one of his greatest works, but with Once Upon A Time In The West he comes really close.Once Upon A Time In The West (I'll just call it The West for this review) tells the tale of Jil McBain(Claudia Cardinale)who comes from New Orleans to be with her husband in the west. Once she gets there she discovers she has been widowed because her husband and his entire family have been wiped out by a ruthless assassin named Frank(Henry Fonda). The land, which was owned by her late husband, was going to be used to build a railroad station which would've made them all rich. However Frank and a railroad baron named Morton (Gabrielle Ferzetti) have there own plans for getting rich the same way and that's why Morton had Frank kill them. Neither one of them knew about Jil though, and soon their vile plans turn on her.However there is one man (Charles Bronson) who plays a harmonica and steps in to keep her safe. With the help of a desperado named Cheyenne (Jason Robards) they work to protect her from the evil clutches of Frank and Morton. Harmonica however has other reasons for wanting Frank dead, and it is left as a guessing game up to the end when we finally discover the real reason why Harmonica was after Frank in the first place.Just like with The Good The Bad The Ugly, Leone uses extreme closeups of peoples faces as well as wide long shots of large opened settings to tell a wonderful story about the west. With TGTBTU he told a story during Civil War times, but with this movie he talks about the time period when railroads were being created to stretch across the country.The acting in this film was phenomenal. I loved the expanded shots of the characters which said more than any words could ever say. Don't get me wrong though. The West had a lot of interesting dialoque which helped embellish the characters flaws and behaviors even more.The movie is long, as was TGTBTU, but like that earlier film, this one never becomes boring either. If I were to compare the two films and make a choice, I would say that both were great movies. However TGTBTU would edge out The West as the better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>thank goodness for IMDb !!! I remember over the years that echoing mournful theme song but since I missed this movie on first release I didn't make the connection, and it never played on television because of rights issues and the unusual length for the time.finally I bought it on DVD and there it was, that theme song that gave me flashbacks big time.then I finally knew what the interview with Jane Fonda was about where she described her recollections seeing her father Henry in the unusual role as archvillian, and another one with jack Elam about how it took all day to do the scene with the handgun and the fly.this is a remarkable western, despite some stretches of credibility.the railroad indeed was the thing that finally opened the west; it was the only way to move millions of tons of goods and tens of thousands of people over the long distances, wagon trains were too dangerous and got off the beaten path too easily and couldn't carry enough provisions. the railroad allowed in a symbiotic relationship, towns to be founded and flourish with mining, cattle herding and farming around them.and thus the premise of the movie, McBain is going to build a town right in front of the advancing railroad.the corruption, violence and greed depicted were certainly problems of the day considering the fortunes to be made. no different than today when a big factory is built and the land selected gains 20 times its normal value and those 'in the know' engage in speculation. or oil or mineral resources are discovered on land held by simpletons who mysteriously are murdered in a 'botched' robbery or some such nonsense. it does happen.the movie is so long I haven't seen it once yet without falling asleep which is not to be taken as a criticism, just that wailful haunting theme song gets to me ..... and it is close to 3 hours long.at least the good guy, in this case, the good girl wins in the end.gawd Claudia Cardinale is beautiful and still making films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These two made one hell of a team, Leone with his marvelous directing/story telling and Morricone with his music. That HARMONCIA MAN theme tells you everything you need to know about Charles Bronson's character without him having to say a word (the same is true of all the characters.) This theme stays with you long after the last note has sounded, and it depicts pain and a desire for justice, and a determination to get it one way or the other. (Man, don't that harmonica sound like a wail of pain!!! It gives me chills every time I hear it.) The ending of this movie is perfect justice. Talk about make the punishment fit the crime! This gives a whole new meaning to that phrase.My only gripe about this movie is what they did with Jill's character. At first, you're made to feel sorry for her because she comes up and finds her family murdered and she is in danger of losing her home, possibly her life. But when she makes love to Frank (Henry Fonda) later on in the movie, (oh, hell, let's be honest. She didn't make love to him, she f**ked him.)I lost my respect and sympathy for her. Instead of being a widow mourning for her dead husband, she seemed more like a common slut who would do anything to save her own neck and to hold on to her late husband's property. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with this story line, but if we're supposed to feel sympathy for Jill, this scene kind of spoils that effect. Cheyenne and Harmonica were more worthy of respect than she was after that scene, although Harmonica has a score to settle big time and I found myself rooting for him throughout the whole movie.My favorite western. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

She is the quintessential westernwoman; the woman every man who would ever intentionally watch a western, didn't know it was possible to dream of. Sometimes I may forget her for a day or two, but I have a picture of her on my refrigerator and she's been with me for 3-4 years now.

The movie has a storyline that is not overly entertaining and one I feel could have been cut significantly shorter. I found myself many times throughout the movie just wanting it to reach some sort of climax and end because it was boring me. Obviously the scenery was epic and there were some amazing shots - which is standard with Leone's work - but this movie just did not do it for me. The movie still managed to gain a 6 star rating from me based simply upon the directing and strong performances from Fonda, Bronson and Cardinale. If the movie was 45 minutes to an hour shorter I'm sure it could still have told the story just as well - probably better because viewers would not face so many dull moments - and rated much higher for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic Western!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Do you know anything about a guy going around playing the harmonica? He's someone you'd remember. Instead of talking, he plays. And when he better play, he talks." What a pleasure it was for me to finally get to watch this masterpiece which I kept on putting off because of its nearly three hour runtime. I was blown away by Sergio Leone's direction in The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly, and that was the only film of his that I'd seen up to this point, but now I honestly can't say which of the two films I prefer. This is perhaps a better film because it is set on a grander and epic scale, but perhaps not as entertaining as the other. Both films have terrific performances with memorable characters and a masterful score composed by Ennio Morricone that accompanies Tonino Delli Colli's beautiful cinematography. Leone's exaggerated close ups show us the dirt and the sweat coming out of these grim people's faces and it's juxtaposed perfectly with these extremely long shots of the vastness of the Western valley. I can't imagine liking this film more than I already do, but it is clear that these films were made to experience them in the big screen and it's a pity I couldn't do so. There are also many memorable quotes in this film and I absolutely loved the screenplay. For the first 90 minutes or so I wasn't sure what direction the movie was heading and that is what I liked about this film since it had me guessing at some of the characters motivations and where the plot was trying to go. The characters have a lot depth and not even the villain is portrayed in a stereotypical way. Along with Unforgiven these are the three best Westerns I've seen so you can bet I will watch more of Leone's spaghetti westerns in the future. The film couldn't open in a more spectacular fashion as the camera follows three gunmen waiting for someone at a station. Once the train arrives, the men don't find who they are waiting for and as they are walking away they hear someone playing a harmonica. It is the mysterious man they've been expecting (Charles Bronson) who asks them where Frank is. They've been sent to kill him, but Harmonica is too quick for their guns and finishes them off claiming they "have brought two horses too many." Then we are introduced to a recently married family man who is living on his deserted property with his three children and expecting his new wife to arrive that very day, but a group of bandits led by blue eyed Frank (Henry Fonda) kills them all one by one for reasons that aren't explained yet. The bride, Jill (Claudia Cardinale), arrives to find them all murdered and the officers find evidence that lead them to believe that the outlaw Cheyenne (Jason Robards) is responsible. The lives of these three men all intersect with Jill's and as the story develops the plot and mystery unfolds. Sergio Leone had me engaged with the film from the very opening sequence and he sets the slow paced tone rather quickly. He takes his time to let the action unfold but thanks to the beautiful cinematography and the gripping score I was never bored for a minute. I was continually trying to guess what was going on and what the motivation of each character truly was. I was surprised that Leone decided to have Ford's character shoot a young kid in a very early scene in the movie, and I can only imagine what a shocker that must have been for audiences during that time who were used to seeing Ford play the hero. Bronson is mysterious but it is rather obvious from the beginning what his intentions are. He still delivers a gripping performance as this mysterious character and when his backstory is finally revealed it all pays off. It was Robards' character who had me guessing at times what his real intentions were. At first I believed he was going to be one of the main villains, but he delivers most of the funny scenes and was perhaps one of the best characters in the film. The breathtaking Claudia Cardinale may have not been given a strong female role, but she wasn't simply a damsel in distress and she seemed to know what she was doing. Once Upon a Time in the West is not a straightforward revenge story and it blends several tones throughout the film having you sympathize with each character at different points of the story. Leone maintained the thrilling atmosphere for its entire runtime and the final showdown is rewarding. This is an epic masterpiece and a new addition to my favorite movies of all time list that I'm glad I finally had the opportunity to experience.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, no other movie has captured the Wild West like Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In The West. When a mysterious stranger with a harmonica protects a beautiful but naive widow from a ruthless train baron and his hired gun, they all soon discover that much more than prized land is at stake.This is more than a movie, it's an experience in my mind, a piece of history, as the west is portrayed as a haunting brutal land that discriminates against absolutely no-one. From the eerie silent opening to the unimaginable and unforgettable ending, Leone takes you down a path that hasn't been explored in a western before or since. 10 outta 10 guaranteed!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shakespearean Poetry in the Wild West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In true poetic form Sergio Leone combines all the basic characteristics of classical theater into the dusty, sandy desert of the Wild West. We have tragedy, romance, revenge, comedy and mankind's eternal fight between good and evil. The good guys, despite their suffering always win and the bad guys always get punished or gunned down in bloody gun battle! While sweat runs down each opponent's brow and eyes are twitching; coarse fingers reach for loaded pistols in the sweltering desert sun. Leone has chosen the perfect bad guy in Henry Fonda as he plays the uncouth villain who has lost his soul and staggers through life leaving pain wherever he leaves. Charles Bronson on the other hand the good guy, with a heart of stone, never flinching always standing up against the evil which he has been chasing since his childhood. Protecting all those in his path including the beautiful Claudia Cardinale Bronson plays a superb role, right until the final climatic challenge between him and Fonda. The background music keeps you on the edge of your seat feeling each emotion with each actor; the acting is superb from both villain and hero and the emotions of each and every scene is portrait by Leone to perfection, the scenery and the cinematography are captivating from the drop of sweat which falls into the desert sand to horses chasing into the sunset. This film is the birth place of all modern Westerns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. I love the top rated reviews for this movie. Almost poetic they are. If you have not yet seen 'Once Upon a Time...' I envy you. It's probably my number 1 favorite Western of all times. So that you can weigh my opinion, I add 'Lonesome Dove', 'Tombstone', 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance', and 'My Darling Clementine' to round out a top 5 list of Westerns to have with you if trapped on a desert island and you must watch them over and over. If they gave me 5 more it would likely be the remake of 'True Grit', 'Open Range', 'Stagecoach', 'The Magnificent 7', or any of the other Wyatt Earp movies except 'Wyatt Earp's Revenge'. I suppose 'Unforgiven' should be on the list, but I have never been able to see what others see in that movie. Have patience with me... I'm also a sci-fi aficionado, yet it took many viewings of Bladerunner before I really got locked in.What you are about to see is the ultimate 'revenge movie' in a western setting. If you have ever seen Sharon Stone's revenge flick 'The Quick and the Dead', fuggedaboutit. Spaghetti Western director Sergio Leone holds court on how to properly serve this genre in 'Once Upon a Time...'.Here are some things to know about the movie up front without spoiling it for you: 1) It's a bit slow. This is NOT Short Attention Span Theater. The pace of the movie is deliberately slow. It's more like eating a simmered roast than a minute steak. Have a beer or a bowl or whatever to let your self synch down to the pace of the film.2) Every character in 'Once Upon a Time...' has their own music. Famous composer Ennio Marricone scores this epic film and endows every character with the exact right music to set the appropriate mood. Much of this film is about the score, so tune in and enjoy the ride.3) If you get confused as to what the hell is going on the movie don't worry. It's not atypical on the first time through. To help with that don't assume all the apparent bad guys are in fact all bad, and don't worry if there appear to be NO good guys for quite some time. It all works out most deliciously.4) There is an early scene where the Italian beauty Claudia Cardinale walks into the railroad station. A crane shot follows her into the station and then seamlessly tracks up above the station to reveal the town she has arrived in. It is a breathtaking single shot with Claudia's character music blaring out. An unforgettable moment! 5) The DVD has one of the best commentary tracks I've ever heard.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-crafted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has the greatest opening of any western. The tense silence which is the hallmark of Sergio Leone's movies, has been most perfectly executed in this movie's opening.The acting is top-notch, and the sweeping landscapes are yet again majestically captured as in all of Sergio Leone's classic westerns. The expressions on the character's faces and the intense silences between them add to the mysterious air of the movie. The haunting harmonica score is very appropriate with the theme of the movie: mysterious at first, sounding haunting later on, and finally, oozing heartening emotions. Ennio Morricone is quite possibly the greatest of all the film score composers.The storyline has quite a few twists and turns, and the characters are well crafted.The camera angles are simply breathtaking. One minor point that impressed me, was the way Cheyenne's men dressed: their flowing dusters are inspiring, and nearly the best western costume I have ever seen.This movie is an instant classic. It is different from Sergio Leone's Dollar Trilogy (which includes The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) in quite a few ways, but it has a charm of its own. I would absolutely recommend it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Landmark Spaghetti Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once Upon a Time in the West is an Italian epic spaghetti western film directed by Sergio Leone for Paramount Pictures. It stars Henry Fonda cast against type as the villain, Charles Bronson as his nemesis, Jason Robards as a bandit, and Claudia Cardinale as a newly widowed homesteader with a past as a prostitute. The screenplay was written by Leone and Sergio Donati, from a story devised by Leone, Bernardo Bertolucci, and Dario Argento. The widescreen cinematography was by Tonino Delli Colli, and Ennio Morricone provided the film score.In this epic Western, shot partly in Monument Valley, a revenge story becomes an epic contemplation of the Western past. To get his hands on prime railroad land in Sweetwater, crippled railroad baron Morton hires killers, led by blue-eyed sadist Frank, who wipe out property owner Brett McBain and his family. McBain's newly arrived bride, Jill, however, inherits it instead. Both outlaw Cheyenne and lethally mysterious Harmonica take it upon themselves to look after Jill and thwart Frank's plans to seize her land. As alliances and betrayals mutate, it soon becomes clear that Harmonica wants to get Frank for another reason -- it has "something to do with death." As in his "Dollars" trilogy, Leone transforms the standard Western plot through the visual impact of widescreen landscapes and the figures therein. At its full length, Once Upon a Time in the West is Leone's operatic masterwork, worthy of its legend-making title.If only the first 10 minutes of this movie still existed, this most hyperbolic of oat operas would still be acknowledged as one of the genre's greatest exhumations.Overall,it is a a landmark Leone spaghetti western masterpiece featuring a classic Morricone score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...they made amazing films like this one. This is my favorite western, one of the best ever made. The pacing and filming are pure brilliance and really build the tension as you work toward the inevitable final standoff.The way each character is introduced makes them feel real and full of personality without the need for explanatory dialogue and I love how the music suits the movie, I can still hear Harmonica's haunting tune in my head. Bronson is excellent as the silent and mysterious good guy and Fonda adds a whole new meaning to the word evil.The story is tight and all the threads weave together in the end to form an outstanding western of epic proportions that I can't fully describe in words.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful score and great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the most famous of Leone's western with unforgettable music score. The story of lone hit-man Harmonica (Charles Bronson) going for his revenge is a classic. Leone in this move hired Bronson for his hero with no name instead of his usual Eastwood. Instead of Eastwood here are another actor heavyweights as Fonda, Cardinalle and Robarts. This story is very good; it follows more plot line for them to cross at the end. Also until the final shootout it is not clear why does Harmonica seeks revenge. Acting is overall very good, weakest links is Bronson who was the worst of main actors, but as he is not required to act much he is good. Fonda is great as villain and is clearly enjoying playing main antagonist. Robarts is very convincing as good natured bandit. Cardinale is very beautiful and also very good as prostitute trying to get a new life. Score is amazing as in all three preceding Leones westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Westerns of All Time &amp; Certainly the Most Artistic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Sergio Leone never really made anything better or more entertaining than The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly, in my opinion, he did come incredibly close to repeating that cinematic feat with this spaghetti western epic. A stunning work of blazing originality &amp; featuring precision craftsmanship in nearly all departments of filmmaking, Once Upon a Time in the West is western in its purest form that fuses breathtaking art into the legacy of Wild West unlike any other example before or after it.The story revolves around a small chunk of land which is the region's only water source. The family that owns the land is slaughtered by Frank &amp; his gang, after which the ownership transfers to Jill, the widow of the murdered family. At night, she is confronted by Cheyenne, a notorious bandit who is suspected of committing the crime &amp; vows to go after the real killer. Also new in town is a mysterious harmonica-playing gunman who has a personal vendetta to settle with Frank.Sergio Leone earned his reputation as one of cinema's gifted visionaries for his Dollars Trilogy but this film introduces a very mature side of this director &amp; his keen eye for stunning detail, visual narration &amp; cinematic art is noticeable from the opening moments where we see three men waiting at a railway station for someone or something due in the next train. It's a long sequence with no dialogues or action that any other director would've skipped but not Leone. He makes us wait for the inevitable, turning each frame into a visual feast, capturing the boredom of characters reflecting our own impatience &amp; yet effortlessly manages to create an aura of anxiety that ends with sudden violence, thus making it one of cinema's most captivating moments.Cinematography goes beyond capturing the desert landscapes or events on film as it ended up narrating a story of its own. Making use of slow zooms, controlled movements &amp; perfect close-ups, it brilliantly captures the emotions of its complex characters. The pacing is deliberately slow when compared to Leone's previous works but this slowness did amplify the intense moments &amp; steadily immerses us into its raw territory too. And, Ennio Morricone impresses once again by composing an even more haunting soundtrack for this film compared to his previous compositions &amp; it's easily one of his finest works, if not the finest.Coming to the acting department, the movie features an ensemble cast of Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, Jason Robards &amp; Claudia Cardinale, who all chipped in with strong &amp; genuine performances. Henry Fonda goes against his usual roles &amp; plays the antagonist Frank, the ruthless, murderous psychopath, with zero empathy and delivers an absolutely cold-blooded performance that ranks amongst his best. Jason Robards does well as Cheyenne, the falsely-accused bandit while Charles Bronson impresses as 'Harmonica', whose unfinished business with Frank is revealed magnificently in the final showdown. And last we have Claudia Cardinale making a fine contribution in the company of men.On an overall scale, Once Upon a Time in the West is one epic that shouldn't be missed by any cinema lover, especially the fans of westerns, Sergio Leone or Henry Fonda. Yes, the film is very slow but then, it's very smart as well. It marks the birth of a new style, new approach &amp; striking maturity in Leone's work &amp; creativity and is the most perfect film of his celebrated career. Cementing Leone's name in the annals of cinema, Once Upon a Time in the West is an extremely respected, honoured &amp; significant motion picture masterpiece whose legacy is as classic as Sergio Leone's direction, Ennio Morricone's scores &amp; their legendary, unparalleled combination. In short, Sergio Leone's magnum opus. Extremely recommended.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com</fullReview>

From the outstanding atmosphere, to the memorable performances (With great, unforgettable characters, played by Charles Bronson, Claudia Cardinale and Henry Fonda, who made the best performances of their careers) The photography is simply gorgeous and gives this an epic feeling, not to mention the flawless music by Ennio Morricone, which takes the story into a whole new level."Once Upon a Time in the West" deserves to be praised as one of the best western ever made, but also as one of the best films of the history as well. This is masterpiece. I would give this eleven stars if I could.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dark western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and A Fistful of Dollars and this film appeared much darker to me. And that's what's good about it. Previous films (especialy The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) were more comical sometimes but this film was made in more darker theme. I was impressed by Charles Bronson's performance, I used to see him in movies like Death Wish but this role was probably the best his performance, now I realized what a charismatic actor he is. I liked his character very much. Every time when you hear him playing that creepy melody with his harmonica, you know that it's a bad news for someone. I also was impressed by Claudia Cardinale's acting, at first I thought that she get that role only for good-looking but later turn out that she's a good actress too, it's funny, that I newer heard of her before, I should check out her other movies. Jason Robards glinted in some scenes too, especially in first dialog between his character and Claudia Cardinale's character. And it would be really unfair to make no reference on Henry Fonda who was playing a bad guy, but he did it so well, that sometimes I wasn't sure which side am I on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would have been even more classic without the few opening lines and just have pure sound effects only. But that is sooon forgotten with the sweaky metal sound and the water dripping. This is the most memorable opening in any movie for me. And talking about looks can kill, Jack Elam and the bald guy alone have the goods. The fly sequence is just as tense as it is annoying. You want jack to just shoot the thing!the stunner for me is after the opening gun sling, Bronson goes down! and the sequence of cuts leads you to believe Bronson was the little kid. What a trick that is.The score in this film does most of the talking and dramatic development. Henry Fonda's cool villain stare is refreshing. Not sure about Jason's role but the plot is already complicated enough - gets a lighter sub theme song. Bronson gets the spin-chilling loner score. And Claudia's operatic strong woman sub theme makes the entire thing super melodramatic - that is until the acting calms everything down.with scenes like that who cares about the ending!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone was one of cinema's most instinctive visual masters, Leone used the full spectrum of CinemaScope with controlled abandon. But this is his powerful masterpiece. He will always be remembered for the awe-inspiring crane-tracking shot, To the brilliance of Ennio Morricone's music, he follows Claudia Cardinale as she alights from a train, then swoops over the station house as she enters, only to pick her up again on the far side as she stares at one of the mythical west's most convincing border towns. I truly believe that particular scene is one of the greatest moments in all of cinema.Claudia Cardinale's beauty, the breathtaking panoramas, and hard bold close ups are difficult to forget. Henry Fonda gives his best performance here playing against character (He usually plays good guys and not bad guys). Charles Bronson was equally fantastic as the vengeful Harmonica. This movie is pure art from start to finish, its beautiful to look at. And Sergio Leone when at his best form truly was...cinema</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Your friends have a high mortality rate, Frank."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After viewing Sergio Leone's "Dollars" Trilogy, I got interested in other films he directed. I then went out to search for more, but all I could find was "Once Upon a Time in America". Not that I don't want to see that, I would have just rather see "Once Upon a Time in the West" first. I eventually found it at a library and rented it. It was well worth the search.Although not as good as "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly" in my opinion, "Once Upon a Time in the West" offers new adventures and plot. Along with a nice music score.Claudia Cardindale gave a good show as Jill McBain, the attractive widow who just lost her new family. Although she was good, I thought her character was just a little stale at times.Henry Fonda was great as Frank, the menacing, cold-blooded murderer. Fonda seems to be more accustomed to playing the hero, so this was certainly a surprise to see.Jason Robards gave the 2nd best performance of the film as Cheyenne, Frank's former gang member who is convicted of murder early on and leaves Frank's gang.By far, the best performance was Charles Bronson as "Harmonica", the mysterious man whose brother was killed by Frank years before. He seeks revenge now, and goes around playing a harmonica and getting on people's nerves. He had a lot of great lines and was a very cool character.The music score for this movie was one of the best I've seen. The background score mixed with Harmonica's own music made it even better and really set the mood for a lot of scenes.Fans of Leone's "Dollars" trilogy should see this movie.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead: Sergio Leone, in my opinion, was the greatest director far surpassing Kubrick. This is his finest film; yes, I know THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is held up as his best, I disagree. First, the blending of Morricone's music with Leone's visual storytelling is incomparable. Listen to Death in Musical Form Harmonica's bone chilling discordant tune containing all his essence: pain, wish for death, revenge, emptiness, tell me this isn't mastery of the art of filmmaking? My favorite scene: when Cheyenne first encounters Harmonica in the desert bar, he swings the lamp looks on him with that creepy music, sees the bullet holes in his coat; Cheyenne is no slouch at killing and even he pauses before death in human form; a creature who seeks the peace of death or revenge whichever comes first and fears nothing any more. For everyone who has never watched Sergio Leone watch how he uses the soul camera right up next to the iris of the characters' eyes. Leone will tell you volumes about people without a single spoken word of dialogue. Like the opening of THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY, the bounty hunters have cornered Eli Wallach The Ugly you see the fear in their eyes as they silently gather to earn money the hard way. Once Upon blends Morricone's music with Leone's visual mastery with Frank murdering a little boy after slaughtering his whole family; we hear the harmonica as the little boy now is Harmonica if he had lived he would have become him. The camera zooms on Frank we see the evil smile as he joyously kills the little boy off camera. It is quintessential Sergio Leone. Leone was a devout socialist; we see that again here. Morton has a fictional disease TB of the bones he is rotting away. Morton is such an arrogant coward who tries to convert Frank into thinking that hiding behind his cowardly desk and paying people to be killed, like Jill, is the equal of doing the deed as a gunfighter. As the film progresses, Frank learns to detest Morton and see him as the greedy, ruthless, amoral worm he is. We last see him as Frank leaves him crawling in the mud like the worm he really always was. Compare to DUCK YOU SUCKER, where at the opening, Steiger is put into the coach with all the rich people, Leone zooms the camera on their mouths as they stuff themselves, food juices running down their mouths as they ridicule and mock the poor. This is Leone's view of capitalism; rich, arrogant snobs it is found in all his works. Frank and Harmonica develop a grudging respect for each other; Frank admires Harmonica's straight open hatred not the cowardly duplicitous dealings of cowardly Morton. The duel between Frank and Harmonica I consider to be the single best scene in a motion picture as the horrible past of Harmonica is revealed we go inside of his soul; we experience what he did not we do not feel his pain; WE ARE HIS PAIN. That is the work of a great master. I can tell you I have seen this film 50 or 60 times; it is a true work of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dream or Nightmare?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's epic pastafest from 1968 is the closest the stalwart director ever got to making a western. Yeah sure the dollars movies were westerns, but they satirised American horse operas in Leone's unique tongue-in-cheek style. Duck You Sucker is not really a western. It's a buddy actioner which criticised war, patriotism and social hierarchy. Finally we have Once Upon A Time In America. Something of a labour of love for Leone, this depression set crime epic would be an object of obsession for the final part of his life. With West, dear old Sergio was merely tipping his hat to his inspiration, the American western. A love letter to Hollywood directors like John Ford and Howard Hawks, West is comprised of subtle references to several American westerns. However, there is only one variation. With these references, Leone has taken the conventions of the Hollywood western and reversed them, giving birth to mind blowing authenticity. Still, Leone's immortal style remains and the symbolism of the dollars trilogy is present.Allow me to explain further. At the film's outset, we have 3 villains waiting for a fourth at a train station. While waiting, their appearance frightens the conductor. Now, obviously there are several variations, but think High Noon(1952). At the beginning of Fred Zinnemann's classic, 3 villains wait at a train station for a fourth. These nice fellows also make the conductor wary of them. Now there are 2 differences. In High Noon, the train doesn't arrive for at least an hour, whereas in West it arrives within 10-15 minutes. Secondly, High Noon has our 3 villains waiting for their leader, bad guy Frank Miller, but West has the 3 baddies waiting for the film's hero, Harmonica. As with Leone's other westerns, symbolism is abundant. When you strip away the complex plot, West tells the story of the expanding railroad. The construction of the railroad represents life and how it is eternally progressing. However, the progression of life always has and always will be wrought with different evils. These evils take the form of the corrupt railroad tycoon Morton and his hired gun Frank. Still, in spite of these evils, life continues to progress unaffected and when the evils are rid of, a new evil always rears it's ugly head. When Morricone's trancelike score is combined with slow, uninterrupted shots of stillness, West feels like a beautiful dream, or is it a nightmare?. You decide.West has an ingredient that the dollars trilogy and DYS lacked, a strong female lead. Claudia Cardinale was excellent, like a breath of fresh air. Henry Fonda was deliciously menacing as Frank, probably the most robust role he's ever played. Charles Bronson made for a staunch anti hero as Harmonica and Jason Robards nearly steals the show as the tough outlaw, Cheyenne. Fore reasons I can't quite explain, Gabriele Ferzetti owned the movie as the crippled railroad baron Morton. Personally, I believe West to have the greatest musical score ever written for a western, Morricone's finest hour!. Composed in stunning, majestic style, "Jill's Theme" alludes to a resplendent utopia away from the violent filth of the frontier. "The Man With A Harmonica" is the ultimate soundtrack for a showdown. The piercing shrieks of a harmonica juxtaposed with the fuzz of an electric guitar and the soaring tempo of an orchestra is eerily atmospheric, evoking exquisitely the ritual of the final duel. "Cheyenne's Theme" is catchy and you will be whistling it long after the credits have rolled. As you would expect from a Leone film, West has the blessing of consummate cinematography. The penetrating zooms and close-ups of Harmonica and Frank were proficient and the infinite shots of silence dazzling. While it was still commendably tight, the suspense was a little too tenacious. The slow build ups were nearly as taut as they were in the dollars trilogy, but the intense explosions of violence came too soon and too fast. The tension just wasn't as sharp as it should have been. It also wasn't as copious as it was in the dollars movies, therefore some parts of the film were slightly desiccated. In a brief showdown in the town's street, there are a couple of positively spectacular stunts!. I'm surprised stuntman Fabio Testi wasn't paralysed for the rest of his life. A queasy flashback intercut into the climatic duel between Harmonica and Frank provided the confrontation with fierce bite.What else can I say?. If you love any kind of western you must see this movie. Just falling short of the glory of the dollars trilogy and Duck You Sucker due to some acute flaws, West is a cast iron classic nonetheless. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something to do with death...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's greatest film and a strong contender for the best movie western ever made. Claudia Cardinale arrives at the desert home of her new husband only to find him &amp; his children massacred. What ensues is a hideous game of cat and mouse between Henry Fonda (as the blackest black Bart imaginable) and the nameless &amp; nearly silent Charles Bronson. Things are kept ambiguous as the viewer tries to figure out who is looking to save Cardinale's land and who is looking to steal it. To say Fonda is cast against type is an understatement. He's a conscienceless devil incarnate. Bronson, while ostensibly the "good guy" is no saint either. Jason Robards, in a role of pure irony, provides the moral compass for a cast of lurid characters. Leone proves to be a real artist with this film. The score, the editing, the cinematography and the pitch-perfect, wholly outrageous cast come together to produce a brilliant piece. Ennio Morricone's music score is rightly considered his finest and the stunning photography is by Tonino Delli Colli. Leone worked on the script with, among others, Bernardo Bertolucci &amp; Dario Argento. The enormous supporting cast is excellent and includes Lionel Stander (frequently cut for some prints), Jack Elam, Woody Strode, Frank Woolf (in the pivotal role of McBain), Paolo Stoppa, Keenan Wynn, Fabio Testi, Don Galloway and the great Gabriele Ferzetti as an infirm yet ruthless railroad baron. Versions of this film reportedly run as long as 170 minutes though the US version available on DVD runs 165 and is considered complete.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic brilliance from Sergio Leone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Once Upon a Time in the West" is a truly epic scale Western, one of the best ever made; no other film from this genre can quite touch this one in this viewer's humble opinion. Virtuoso director Leone gives it an impressive sense of grandeur while also always remembering to concentrate on human emotions, as it takes its characters and audience on this dramatic (but never melodramatic) journey. It's subtly performed by all, with absolutely gorgeous widescreen photography. Leone dares to take his time telling this tale (scripted by himself and Sergio Donati, based on a story by Dario Argento, Bernardo Bertolucci, and Leone), which might drive less than patient people up the wall, but the film offers plenty of rewards for those that stick with it. You really come to either care for or loathe these characters, waiting to find out how things will be resolved and what will become of everyone. Enhancing all of it is one of Ennio Morricone's loveliest ever scores; it's likely to bring a lump to your throat several times.Four reliable performers play individuals whose lives come together: Claudia Cardinale is Jill McBain, a former whore who's married well and is on her way to join her husband and his family. Charles Bronson is the unnamed man with the harmonica, who's a man on a mission. Not until near the end does his motivation finally become clear. Jason Robards is Cheyenne, a notorious half-breed outlaw who gets falsely accused of the slaughter of Jill's family-to-be, which was actually perpetrated by the vile, ambitious Frank. In a genius bit of casting, Henry Fonda, who had played so many upright and morally strong men before, plays this role, and does it with commendable restraint, refraining from ever becoming a moustache-twirling Oilcan Harry. Forming part of the plot is the attempt to build a town that will take advantage of a railroad being built.Leone gets wonderful performances out of his entire cast. Some of them are just making "special appearances", which might make one wish that they had more to do, but they're welcome no matter what: Woody Strode, Jack Elam, Keenan Wynn, Frank Wolff, Lionel Stander. Gabriele Ferzetti has the delicious role of physically disabled but devious railroad baron Mr. Morton, but it's Mr. Fonda who proves to be the most fun to watch.Leone prepares you for what's to come with his effectively protracted, stylized opening credits sequence. It plays out slowly, but the tension is unbelievable. From then on he covers a lot of ground. The film has a long running time at two hours and 46 minutes, but never feels as long as that. There are some delightfully clever moments and plenty of time for the characters to make a lasting impression.One doesn't come away from "Once Upon a Time in the West" unaffected. It's very much essential viewing.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone is no stranger to creating long-running-time feature films, but it must be noted that there is rarely a dull moment in the best of his work. Standing alongside classics including 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly' and 'Once Upon a time in America', is 'Once Upon a time in the West'. The ultimate western that could easily be a contender for the greatest film within its Genre. It's Soundtrack is unforgettable, it plays out like an electric-guitar-driven-symphony, and can create excitement and tension from a scene of two men simply preparing for a shoot-out. And believe me, the Shoot-outs go for longer than you realise, but that's the beauty of Leone's creation! The characters are timeless, the scenes are flawlessly framed, the dialogue is naturally cool and the shoot-outs would leave even Clint Eastwood's 'Blondie' shaking' in his boots. It is the iconic match to Leone's 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly'.The film always comes back to Bronson. The man with the Harmonica, who funnily enough, is named 'Harmonica'. Leone isn't usually one for divulging the important credentials of his lead characters, and just as he did with Eastwood's nameless figures in the dollars trilogy, he assigns Bronson's mysterious figure with the title 'Harmonica'. Lead Actress Claudia Cardinale perfectly pairs the show with Bronson, as Mrs. McBain. An unusual lead for a Leone film, but nevertheless a perfect one. More than just a bit of eye Candy, Cardinale showcases a terrific range of emotions as McBain, a woman who has moved to Utah, only to discover that her husband and family are all dead. Upon meeting Cheyenne (played by Jason Robards) she accepts his offer to protect her and go after the man who killed her loved ones. The pairing of Cheyenne and Harmonica leads to an unbeatable combination, and fantastic by-play between Bronson and Robards (who gives one of his finest performances).The villain, like in every great Western, is so incredibly evil, that he somehow becomes extremely likable. In his bold portrayal of Frank, Henry Fonda manages to rid us of any memory of 'Good-Guys' that he has played, and positions us to view him as the ultimate villain. And its hard not to, with a villain entrance that's powerful enough to match Orson Welles in 'The Third Man'. After gunning down a family, and entering the screen to Ennio Morricone's iconic score, Fonda's presence grabs your attention and never lets go. It's also all in Morricone's score, an exceptional sound with which the film could not live with out. Just listen to 'Il Grande Massacro' and try not to smile.Leone's direction, as well as his screenplay, is once again, a fantastic feat, and Tonino Delli Colli's cinematography is astounding and aids in the creation of many memorable scenes. Not just Fonda's entrance, but also, the film's introduction. Minimal dialogue for nearly ten minutes, only the gasping tension created by three gunmen who we are sure never to see again. A fly buzzing soon to be trapped by the barrel of a gun, a windmill slowly squeaking in circles, dripping water; Morricone and Leone manage to create tension from simple sounds before the train arrives. And as it does, the first shoot-out begins shortly after.The way that the scenes are created are impeccable, they are brilliant. The production design is astounding as is nearly every aspect of this film. The main complaints that are associated with 'Once Upon a Time in the West' are that it is "Far to long", or "Slow and boring". If you can already feel as if you are going to say this, then stop. Don't watch it. Don't put yourself through what you think you may hate. But for anyone possessing true movie love, and a desire to see an awesome Western epic, there is no avoiding it. It is a true gem. &lt;10 out of 10&gt; The Western that other Westerns want to be. A Beautiful Epic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>inexplicably celebrated; 60s pulp feigning poigance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was pretty disenchanting to me because it made me start realizing Leone's tricks: he disarms you with nearly half an hour of obsessively quiet ultra-realism that intimately acquaints you with every wrinkle on the face of a bunch of minor characters, then he slips a rather conventional, episodic horse opera under your nose after you've given in to the Art of it all. Henry Fonda's nothing special, Charles Bronson looks constipated as ever, character motivations are neither here nor there, and the plot seems to be driven by the four main characters coincidentally fumbling into each other (and at times seemingly teleporting out of force of will/narrative convenience). It has its "moments", obviously, but the problem is the film begs to be judged as a whole, and anyone whose idea of pure cinema isn't The Dark Knight can see how as a whole it just doesn't measure up to the Dollars trilogy or even a lot of lower tier spaghetti westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest western ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone is one of my favorite directors ever, his style, his pacing and use of music is perfect. I also think he was a great story-teller, not using much dialog, but still creating a wonderful atmosphere and conflicts. And Once Upon A Time In The West shows all that talent. It's my favorite western of all time (I also consider it the best) and my favorite Leone film, and it's one of my top 5 favorite films. Or maybe it's tied with the Dollar's Trilogy and Once Upon A Time in America, but I notice myself coming back to this film the most. While I think this is a superior movie to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly (often regarded as his best), I think that has one thing better. Clint Eastwood, he is a better actor than Charles Bronson. While Bronson gives a pretty good performance, he's essentially playing the Man With No Name, Eastwood does do it better. Rest of the performances are excellent. From Woody Strode's cameo to Henry Fonda's evil antagonist, all are great. Jason Robards is probably the best one, as Cheynne. He's fun, smart and a bit of a badass. But Fonda gives a great performance as well, he plays the villain. Which is bizarre seeing Fonda killing a whole family and being so goddamn evil, but it works. He as cast as him, because of his reputation of being the good guy. Also Claudia Cardinale is very beautiful and is pretty good, though cliché...But we all know the performances don't make a Leone film. What makes it is the direction, cinematography and music. All are absolutely masterful. Let's start with the direction.. Like most of Leone's film, this is a slow moving film. So if you don't like westerns in general, I wouldn't recommend this. You will be probably bored, or maybe you will like the style. And me saying this is a slow movie is not an insult. It's a fact. The slow pace gives it's mood and atmosphere is has. The tension is high and the gun fights are more exciting. BTW, there are not that much gun play going on. If you want gun crazy violence in west, watch Django (1966) or The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. This is more intelligent than those movie though. It focuses on a period in the west, when the railroads came, capitalism came as well. The end of the bandits and beginning a new evil. The films main theme is death, actually Leone said that the pace of the film supposed to be like the last moments before you die. Like most of Italian westerns, this movie is operatic, but Leone preferred to say "ballet of violence". Everything is huge and dramatical, it makes it an very epic movie. This was also about you knowledge of previous westerns. Leone makes a lot of references/homages to old westerns. It even has Leone trademark, typical western characters, almost showing them as mythical creatures. The first 10 minutes are incredible, direction-wise. It's 10 minutes of no dialog, no music, just atmosphere and expecting something. That's one thing people miss about Leone, he knew when to inform the audience and when keep a secret. In the first 10 minutes you don't know what or who are they waiting for and why are they there. And that gunfight is excellent BTW. My favorite moment is the Saltwater massacre. No I'm not a sadist, but how that scene is handled is beyond perfect. There is weird tension in that moments, then when the gun men start killing the family, the music doesn't start, you don't even see who is doing it and where. When the kid runs outside, with that tracking camera shot, the music comes, fast and epic. That moment always gives me goosebumps. It's just so well shot and directed. The cinematography is as excellent as everything else in this. Mixing close-ups and John Ford like wide-shots together, creating a almost surreal, yet beautiful feel. You can see that Leone was influenced by Ford, when Jill goes through the Valley, it's just like a John Ford film.I love the film, one of my favorite. Shame it wasn't liked too much when it was released, it truly is a masterpiece. If you love westerns, you are probably going to love this. 10/10</fullReview>

The writing is poetry almost. The musical score will haunt you long afterward, and the film itself will make any Western romanticist weep inside.This is Henry Fonda's favorite role, Leone's finest work, and the Western genre's most beautiful film. Great musical score. The entire movie transcends the genre into art; a poetic film of great beauty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the opening scene with Western stalwarts Jack Elam and Woody Strode to the final scene with Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale this film is a visual masterpiece that captures Sergio Leone genius in full brutal force. Henry Fonda is the perfect bad guy, Charles Bronson the reluctant hero, Jason Robards the renegade and misunderstood outlaw, and Claudia Cardinale the sexy, but strong heroine. Leone's musical score is so original and so penetrating that it sticks like plaster. He infuses each characters score with their appearance on screen. It shows the west for what it was: a gritty world where power won out, Only three other Westerns compare: The Outlaw Josey Wales; The Good, The Bad and The Ugly; and the Searchers. Put it in the DVD player and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the end of the Old West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Sam Peckinpah's Wild Bunch killed off the Western film, Sergio Leone's widescreen epic delivered a final eulogy in grand operatic fashion. This is the Wild West as only a European could see it: bigger than life, bolder than life, and much more savage than life. The plot, as suggested by the title, is a fairy tale amalgam of every Western movie myth (i.e. cliché) since Edwin S. Porter's 'Great Train Robbery', with beautiful widow Claudia Cardinale defending her homestead against an aggressive railroad tycoon. Included in the subsequent carnage is the usual cast of Spaghetti Westerners: the enigmatic, nameless anti-hero (Chuck Bronson, replacing Clint Eastwood); the scruffy desperado sidekick (Jason Robards Jr., providing welcome comic relief); and an entire secondary cast of swarthy Italian gunmen, most of whom are killed off before the closing credits. Leone toned down the often surreal amorality of his Man-With-No-Name trilogy, but in a stroke of brilliance cast Henry Fonda against his image as the sadistic mercenary hired by the railroad to "clear obstacles" (including a young boy, blown apart at point blank range) from the path of the train.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film's credits sprawl through the first 12 minutes. In the old West a gunfighter, with ambitions to become a wealthy businessman, prepares to drive a woman off her land, which is sought after by the railroad company.Once Upon A Time In The West is an immensely long and convoluted epic Western, director Sergio Leone's first within the Hollywood studio system, in which he revisits the motives, most of them less than noble, that led to the opening up and exploitation of the West. In this context, casting Henry Fonda, a revered American icon, as a grasping violent opportunist was a counter-intuitive master stroke. It's a beautiful-looking film that takes its sweet time in getting where it wants to go, but riveting all the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest achievements in film ever, let alone westerns.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have written few reviews on this site and have been prompted to do so now due to the silly comments people put on great films like this one. Comments like "bad acting" and "bad direction". Honestly these people don't know what they're talking about. This film is a film about death. Death isn't always a clean one shot in the head or billion dollar special effects extravaganza. Sometimes it is small, sometimes not always instant. The film is slowly dying as are the main characters and it is beautiful to behold. It does move slowly. It need do nothing else, that is its style and it would work no other way. The film works on many levels philosophical and political. I think the people who didn't like this film suffer from extreme cases of desensitisation and lack of empathy. The direction is flawless, i find myself every time i watch it, in awe of the beauty of the landscapes the discomfort of the extreme close-up. All the acting is excellent. For all those people who complained about the acting in this film I say this. Acting is living truthfully under imaginary circumstances. That is how one should judge acting. All actors portrayed perfectly the emotional journey all were one. Bronson, saying little thought-out the film, but in his eyes we see his pain and his cold calculated plan of assassination. This film could not be overrated. The only argument with this film is which is better: this, or the good, the bad, and the ugly. Personally I think this is the better. Both are incredible, hands down. But for me, the title sequence and Henry Fonda's performance tip the scales in once upon a time's favour. Watch this film and be blown away. Oh one last thing, a reviewer said that the western is an American style of movie. Well, I'm not a big fan of the john Wayne stuff personally. But fair enough, he and john ford have made their mark, but the dollars trilogy and this have made at least an equal contribution to the western AND to film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe Leone's second best behind GB&amp;U- sophisticated weaving of techniques from past westerns into an near-mythic treatment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's the master of the spaghetti western- hard to refute that- and with Once Upon a Time in the West he goes for taking the skills he formed in the 'Dollars' trilogy (inspired by the likes of John Ford) into a stylistically complex work. The story as well (by Leone, horror director Dario Argento, and Bernardo Bertolucci) slips the lines together without a flaw. The four main characters- the suave, quiet Harmonica (Charles Bronson), the determined and sexy Jill (Claudia Cardinale), veteran outlaw Cheyenne (Jason Robards), and the worn, chilling hired-killer Frank (Henry Fonda)- each get enough screen time by themselves or with each other to get the story going along, with the interweaving perfectly in sync. And Leone's in luck- his actors all turn in top shelve work, with Bronson proving himself to be cool on par with Eastwood, Cardinale highly formidable as the first female lead in a Leone film, and Fonda creating one of his most memorable works. Fonda's Frank draws you like no other actor could have in the first scene he appears. A viewer can hardly believe he would set the story into motion like he does (looking into those blue eyes in the trademark close-ups), that is until the gun gets pulled.With all the performance in check, Leone creates a technical masterpiece. In a sense, Leone here created a film in the sense that Quentin Tarantino created Kill Bill- the later made a film about the conventions in grindhouse/martial-arts films, and Leone made a film about the conventions in the John Ford westerns (the commentary on the DVD goes into detail on this). But, like Tarantino, Leone isn't just creating a compare/contrast show with guns and landscapes. You don't have to have seen all those archaic westerns to get what Leone's doing here, since it's original in craftsmanship and how some turns are taken. The craftsmanship, by the way, is anchored by the likes of cinematographer Tonillo Delli Colli, with similar and not so similar angles and pans and shots to GB&amp;U - it's almost arguable that he should've deserved his lifetime achievement award simply for his three collaborations with Leone. Also, Nino Baragli and Carlo Simi deserve massive credit here. Along with a great vision comes other great people to work with, like Ennio Morricone, who has another score that's so evocative and in tune with Leone's mind-set it was created before filming even began. This is the kind of work that could turn on a non-western fan onto the genre- though I would recommend GB&amp;U as the introduction to this man's view of the 19th century in America. One thing for certain- you'll have to see it twice before you can truly pass judgment. A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:First, the people who hate this movie also hate Kubrick's 2001. This is a completely different way of telling a story and introducing characters it is not verbal it is visual. Leone uses as little dialogue as he can get away with a kind of a film version of Ernest Hemingway. Yet, like 2001, if you watch closely, he is speaking to you. Take the opening in the train station; the bounty killers waiting for Harmonica. Notice, the physical world attacking the men, the fly with Jack Elam, the water with Woode Strode. This is a hostile place; Elam traps the fly, Stroode drinks the water then ignores the drip on his hat. Leone and Morricone blend visual with music to create a one of a kind masterpiece, as they often do. Harmonica's bone chilling refrain is a auditory representation of who he is: pain, wish for death, lust for revenge, loss and grief. We hear it played after Frank points his gun at the little boy, who if he lived, would have become another Harmonica. Walking death, a burned out hate and pain filled monster who seeks the peace of death or revenge whichever comes first and fears nothing on this earth anymore.For those of those who have never seen Leone, watch my favorite scene when Cheyenne first encounters harmonica at the desert bar. Cheyenne, no slouch at killing himself, stops as he swings the lantern at harmonica; the creepy tune, the bullet holes in the coat, the cold angry hate filled face. Notice, how even Cheyenne shows a small touch of fear and decides to back off. Harmonica tries deliberately to provoke him mocking him,"can count and all the way up to two." After Cheyenne tries, in front of his men, to recover,"watch those false notes,"harmonica deliberately slurs his notes trying to anger him. Cheyenne barely holds onto his temper. Harmonica seeks death as much as revenge; he wishes to be killed to extirpate the memory of his brother.The visuals with the music have never been equaled and never will I believe. It dwarfs the overrated THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY, with the exception of the graveyard scene with the Ugly running over the graves, greed consuming him; what a great picture of the utter insanity of human greed. The final duel between Frank and Harmonica using the Leone soul camera is, I hold, the best scene ever committed to film. The creepy tune takes us inside his pain; we do not feel his pain, we are his pain. What a piece of work? I have watched this film 50 or 60 times and I still find new little treasures with every viewing. With the score, such overwhelming pathos, Jill desires harmonica Cheyenne gently tries to disabuse her; a man like that can never be domesticated. Something to do with death, he says. We know he is done; he stands at the door, his world is disappearing the kind of man he is does not fit it is Morton's world now. What an ineffable sadness pours from the images and the music. A world we never can see where warriors fought open battles not cowering behind their cowardly desks like Morton the worm in the mud. The nobility of the film, its depiction of a way of life long gone makes Gone With The Wind look like the overrated piece of crap it is. This is a masterpiece; My favorite film, my friends, we shall never see its equal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The classic Western it sets out to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything about this film indicates that Leone set out to make a masterpiece. Having set the bar so high for himself it is even more remarkable that he has succeeded. The slow pacing, Monument Valley setting, typical Morricone score and all star cast are testament to how memorable he wants this film to be. You can picture him poring over each detail of every scene, even before shooting any footage.The story is a familiar Western tale of a railway baron trying to get his hands on the land he needs by hook or by crook. Unfortunately for him his chief henchman has not bargained on a figure from his past returning to wreak long awaited revenge.As the plot advances Leone treats us to a series of set pieces, with plenty of lingering looks, unspoken hatred and usually a dramatic and violent conclusion.The coup de grace is the casting of Henry Fonda, so often the good guy in his movies, as the black-hearted henchman who clearly loves his job. Claudia Cardinale, Charles Bronson and Jason Robards are all excellent.There isn't much point in going into much more detail in a mere review. The only way to appreciate this film is to set aside about three hours, draw the curtains and let Leone transport you to his vision of the coming of the railways to the West.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone knew how to shoot and cut... he was an expert at both</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right from the very opening moments to the last, this is perfectly crafted. You immediately realize that you are in skillful hands. This builds up tension masterfully, including in the first minute(!). The use of sound(and silence, lest we forget) is incredible, with spot-on use of the exaggerated audio produced by real objects. Morricone brings to this an astonishing score, with distinct themes(with electric guitar as well as softer instruments) and sweeping pieces, all impeccably well-composed. The editing and cinematography, with effective reveals, beautiful sets and nature, heavy use of close-ups and a sincere focus on atmosphere and mood(whilst also delivering amazing gunfights) help make this downright operatic. No, this isn't in a hurry like more recent movies, and there is not an action sequence every ten minutes... however, if you find a single frame of this "boring" or anything of the sort, then I would think that your attention span is simply insufficient, and I urge you to attempt to improve it and give this another chance. Other than being contrarian, I can't imagine why one wouldn't find this timeless and relevant; it's about the future(not in the science fiction way), development, love, and personal dreams... the things life itself are made of, what we all cherish most. All of this, without any instances of sentimentality, preachiness or, at 160 minutes, any wasted time. It fits so much plot(note that viewers are expected to piece some of it together) into that time without coming off as rushed and avoiding overwhelming the audience. The pacing is beyond reproach, with a gradual speed that lets all of the events unfold. Every scene is done exactly right, and they fit together with impressive precision. The sense of humor is great. Costumes are beyond reproach. Everyone in this is a perfect casting choice, right down to the least seen extra; their faces add an immeasurable amount to this, especially in the cases of the goons and the three male leads(R.I.P., truly sorry to lose you). Robards is so ridiculously charming that I could remember him from Enemy of the State(yes, for as briefly as he appears in that), Fonda plays against expectations with an absolutely chilling result, and Bronson, I believe, started doing his thing, what he's so famous for, in this very picture. Do I even need to point out that this is among the (spaghetti) Westerns(it references the classics of the genre, by the way) that constructed our idea(then and current) of what macho is? Compare it. The short lines, "cool-ness", their behaviour(I will put no details here). Cardinale is *stunning*, and, as goes for the others(not merely the leads), an excellent actor. She is an early strong female character(that all of them are marvelously developed begs mentioning), too. Dialog is well-written. There is plenty of violence that gets brutal and contains blood here and there, occasional sensuality and a little moderate language in this, and it is disturbing at times. The Special Collector's Edition DVD comes with a rather interesting and informational commentary track(by directors, including the "Johns" Carpenter and Milius, an author of a book on Sergio and a film historian), four featurettes, two stills galleries and a trailer. I recommend this to any fan of the medium. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen and enjoyed this movie twice.Each time I watched it I took it for granted that Cardinale has sex with Fonda because she's trying to save her own life. She's using the skills she learned as a prostitute to seduce him into sparing her. But I've heard this scene referred to (even on the DVD commentary) as a love scene? And when I recently referred to it as the scene when Fonda rapes Cardinale, my companion looked baffled. Rape may be the wrong word (tho' if Fonda knows she isn't having sex with him by choice, what else is it?) but how anyone could call this sick situation a love scene is beyond me.

		<shortDescription>A beautiful western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once Upon A Time In The West is no ordinary western. Despite the non-descriptive title, this is a film that redefined the genre. With his dollars trilogy, director Sergio Leone proved that he was the master of the spaghetti western; with Once Upon A Time? he transferred the conventions of that genre ? the operatic sense of drama, the nihilism, extreme close-ups, epic widescreen photography, Ennio Morricone music and moral ambiguity ? into Monument Valley, the setting of the traditional American western. The result is pretty unforgettable. Leone tells a simple story via images. Looks, as opposed to dialogue, are used to convey meaning wherever possible. When characters do speak, their lines are significant. Every bit of dialogue is considered, no one talks unnecessarily. This combined with the phenomenal cinematography and unforgettable music results in a sort of operatic minimalism. The western has never been depicted so artistically.There is a real feeling of time and space. The opening credit sequence where the three gunmen wait at the train station typifies this. Instead of launching straight into the initial confrontation, Leone waits. Insignificant details become epic. The fly and the dripping water for instance, are given real significance, and are integral to the pace of the scene. Nothing of narrative significance happens, not a word is said but the pacing and magnification of the smallest details add human depth to what would otherwise be cardboard characters.There are four stand-out performances from Charles Bronson, Henry Fonda, Claudia Cardinale and Jason Robards. Bronson plays Harmonica the mysterious stranger, Fonda brilliantly cast against type is the cold-eyed killer, Cardinale is the stunningly beautiful woman in the centre of the narrative and Robards is the grizzled outlaw. Together, they are terrific. And Leone moves them around the widescreen frame quite beautifully. Morricone's score once again is quite outstanding. The haunting harmonica theme is a particular standout; only Morricone could make a harmonica sound so sweeping, evocative and mystical.Once Upon A Time In The West is truly epic film-making of the very best kind. It's a western of intense emotions and brilliant acting; of peerless photography and ground-breaking music. It illustrates perfectly how to use cinematic space and how to pace events within it. It refashioned the western and brought the highest cinematic artistry to Monument Valley. It goes without saying that it is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"My weapons might look simple to you, Mr. Morton, but they can still shoot holes big enough for our little problems."Leone gets a budget that's proportional to his expertise, and now we want to complain about length. Shoot, the more the merrier, in my case. It could be speculated that Al Mulock would have postponed his unfortunate suicide for a chance to survive the first showdown. But at 164 minutes, this is hardly overkill."Get the costume! We need the costume!"Dario Argento, one of my personal favorites, takes writing credit alongside the usual suspects; Bernardo Bertolucci and Sergio Leone. Call it the good, bad, and ugly of Italian screenwriters. Ennio Morriccone returns for the soundtrack, and once again composes a masterpiece. The cinematographer was the man who masterminded the spinning graveyard scene that enthralled us at the end of "The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly", so expect this one to up the ante. The actors, though, is where the credibility of Leone's previous work is really evident. Henry Fonda plays a villain named Frank, need I say more? Well, yes I need, because that tasty, zesty widow is quite easily one of my top picks for hottest women to lead a role in a film, Claudia Cardinale. So hot, in fact, that I have to admit I didn't know whether to cheer or cry for her during the softcore sex scene. I mean, for real, John Landis of all people has credits in the film. As a stunt double.Well enough credit-talk, let's get to the plot. If money is indeed the root of all evil, it must have been intentional that for once, after the "Fistful Of Dollars" series, that the green bill doesn't enter much into the scene of the film. These guys are just plain bad. Most of the fighting goes on over an empty, unwanted plot of land. Prospects can be almost as important as respect, the story seems to tell us. No, really. We see money only a handful of times in the duration of the film. It's probably used most effectively here, when it's refused. But as the body count rises, and rises, and rises, it reminds us that where there is a serious power struggle, emotions fly just as often as bullets. Revenge, it must be, yet we don't ever truly know why.So, if we accept that Frank is indeed one of the toughest sons of a gun in film making history, which he is, then it only leads to reason that lone gunners won't stand a chance. Enter Jason Robarbs, and the resulting factor of breaking typecast will bring a smile to your face. It sure better. Because the heroic Harmonica, played by Charles Bronson, couldn't play a harmonica to save his life. But who is going to deny a protagonist who doesn't stop smiling while being tied to a train and smacked around by an angry, angry man with a gun.In another turn of events, Leone finally writes a piece where the ending will leave you reeling back when you see who the final profiteer is. Well I suppose that's the way these types of triangles work.If you don't like westerns in general, don't expect that this will change your mind that much. It probably will, anyway, because the epic proportions of the storyline are undeniable. But as usual in Sergio Leone's films, you might have no idea why there are so many people getting shot until about midway through the film. Remember, this is an intelligent western from an intelligent man. It's his prerogative to create something sort of like a good Italian spaghetti bowl; lots of long strands, that when twisted around each other just right, make for a delicious bite."He not only plays. He can shoot too.""Once Upon A Time In The West" (1968) 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic western ? with all the pros and cons that come with that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the railroad spreads western, bringing with it progress and development, the west is a changing place. The rule of gunmen is ending with the new men of power being land owners and developers. A young woman arrives in one such small town to find her new husband and family murdered by gunman Frank under the lead of a railroad developer. Meanwhile a mysterious man arrives in the town looking for Frank for some reasons. Both he and convict Manuel Gutierrez join forces to try and hold onto what remains of `their' west and deal with Frank.From the opening ten minutes you should be able to judge whether or not this film will frustrate you or not. The opening scene is one of the best of cinema but, on paper, very little actually happens. This is what you need to carry into the film ? as it is so very long there is plenty of silence and pauses. If you feel that these are unnecessary then the running time of this film will feel even longer to you. On the other hand if you, as I do, feel that the silences in this film are just as important and telling as the dialogue or action, then this film should move quite quickly.The plot is a mix of revenge western while also looking at the death of the West associated with the American movies ? the strong gunman, the frontier town etc, they exist here but are being pushed out with every frame of the film. What Leone manages to do which confounds me is he fills the film with so much silence but yet little of it brings boredom, instead the film has it's steady pace and never lets it dip into flagging but just keeps enough happening to keep things moving. I must admit that some of the deeper meaning was lost on me but still felt that the central threads of the three or four main characters were more than enough to hold my interest on their own. Of course, bits did work better than other bits but that is to be expected ? I know I got more from the cat and mouse between Harmonica and Frank than I did from the relationship between Gutierrez and Jill. However these minor problems are lost in the sheer scale of the film itself.The acting is great and some of it could be considered the actors at their best. Certainly I can't think of another role where Charles Bronson was required to do so well. Here he has to have a stone face but still give over character ? he manages it and pulls off an iconic type of cool that I'd usually associate with big stars. Fonda plays very naturally as a bad guy. When I first saw this film I was quite young and hadn't seen a lot of his more famous roles, now that I have it is very strange to see him as a bad guy, but the counter casting of him does work anyway. Cardinale is a strong role but I must confess that her character was lost to me a little ? this was one of the threads I was weakest on and I'll watch the film again with more focus. Support cast are all pretty good and have a few famous western faces in there.One of the strongest parts of the film is the score. From the first time you hear that scarring harmonica you know to associate it with bitterness, likewise other parts of the score are very strong and used well. Part of it did remind me of Steptoe &amp; Son but it still worked in it's context! The plot all goes sort of where you expect it to but we are left with the wider picture of the West of Frank coming to an end and the West of Morton moving unstoppably to replace it ? the film never suggests that one is better than the other, in fact it highlights that there may be no difference at all. Meanwhile the frontier men are pushed on into a shrinking horizon.Overall this is an epic, which means it is sweeping in scope, resulting in the occasional stretch showing. The running time is sparsely filled with dialogue which may frustrate some, however Leone has made the silence as loud as the dialogue and the actors provide him with performances that deliver so much without words at times that the time is easily eaten up. Not the most accessible western he made (simply because others are more entertaining) but still an epic and well worth three hours of anyone's time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When viewing this movie you wonder if this is a story or a compilation of imaginary emotional moments. There is "Sweetwater" a place important for the railway to get water. But the railway supervisor (Morton) tries to intervene with it. Why?? He sends Frank to intimidate but he kills. Why has Morton connection with Frank??? No explanation. Frank tries to place the blame of his action on Cheyenne. Who is Cheyenne? It is a bandit but what has he to seek in that "middle of nowhere place"??? It is hardly to believe that it offers any profit.So, I am afraid that I have to conclude that is it is a compilation, "photo's in a frame" expressing "the void".Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting/directing, boring at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just say that I really loved this movie. The actors cast for each role are absolutely stellar and really pull you into the wild west. The cinematography is also outstanding. Closeups of faces coupled with dramatic lighting and atmosphere make every scene a treat. The action sequences are intense and the story is very well written. That being said I do not believe it ranks more than an eight. As a disclaimer, I am not a western aficionado so this might be par for the course. I found many sequences of the film boring. The opening scene is 10 minutes long and nothing is really happening, just a creaky old windmill. I understand that sequences like this build atmosphere, but this movie could have been 15-30 minutes shorter. Also some entire sequences were not shown which would have reduced a lot of confusion later in the storyline. A few really small things stood out to me also. Like Cheyenne cuts his face shaving and then minutes later there is no cut. Sometimes the audio is out of sync ( I was watching the 2011 remastered version ) when people are talking.Overall the positives really outweighed the negatives. When you watch a film from the 60's you sort of expect these kind of things. The superior acting, directing, and storyline make this an outstanding film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reverse Quotations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was in college when this movie came out. I had already seen the previous Westerns by Sergio Leone, and was especially awed by "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" (1966), so I looked forward to "Once Upon a Time in the West" with great anticipation. I was disappointed. On the one hand, I could see that it had a lot of good stuff in it, but there was something lacking. As I found out later, what was lacking was all the footage that had been cut out of the movie for its release in America. It was not until the movie came to television, and I saw much of the additional material (with some stuff edited out for the usual reasons), that I realized what a great movie it was. Even then it was not until somewhat later that I saw the restoration, which included even more material. Unfortunately, those who restored this movie messed up on the music at the end, which is hard to understand, because it would have been simple to do it right. I guess we Americans just were not destined to see this movie in its perfect form, and certainly not in a movie theater (at least not where I live).On the whole, the critics did not seem to like the movie when it first came out either. Some of them may have also reacted negatively to the chopped up presentation, but others were offended by other things, such as the slow pace or the amoral characters. Some of the critics objected to the way it copied stuff from other Westerns. What they (and I) did not realize at the time was that these were quotations, not necessarily in the sense of quoting what had been said in other Westerns, but in the extended sense of creating images and plot points similar to those in previous Westerns. Presumably, Leone had intended that people would watch his movie and smile appreciatively at these quotations, and I suppose some people did precisely that. What he probably did not realize was that these quotations were more likely to be appreciated in reverse, as was the case with me. I had seen many of the Westerns that were quoted, but only once, and thus did not catch the references. "Once Upon a Time in the West," however, I watched every chance I got, and I quit counting after I had seen it twenty-five times.Little by little, I watched the classic Westerns again, or for the first time in many cases, and I would experience déj? vu. For example, one night I was watching "The Plainsman" (1936), somewhat listlessly, when suddenly, toward the end of the movie I felt a ripple of exhilaration go through me. At first, I did not know why, but I quickly realized that when Gary Cooper dressed up in black and entered the bar, he looked just like Frank entering the bar to buy the land back from Harmonica.From then on I never knew when I would catch another quotation and get another feeling of déj? vu, as I did when I watched "High Noon" (1952), "Johnny Guitar" (1954), "The Searchers" (1956), "Shane" (1953), "3:10 to Yuma" (1957), "Warlock" (1959), and many others. Those are fairly obvious, but others can easily escape notice, as in the case of the little piece of material missing from the brim of Harmonica's hat, just like the hat Charles Bronson wore in "The Magnificent Seven" (1960).Of course, one's ability to appreciate these reverse quotations presupposes having seen "Once Upon a Time in the West" many, many times. No problem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once Upon a Time in the West is an epic western focusing on the fate of four different persons, with roots in the past and extension of railways in the background. Life is hard, with lots of violence and injustice, and all means are good for increasing wealth... Apart from directing, camera-work and music, the cast is great as well, particularly all protagonists: Claudia Cardinale as Jill McBain, Henry Fonda as Frank (looks like younger Jack Nicholson - or vice versa), Jason Robards as Cheyenne, Charles Bronson as Harmonica. Their expressiveness is great, boosted by long camera shots; today's fast alternation of events (= often shallowness) does not need such acting anymore - pity... And many filmmakers today would create a max 1,5 hour movie from such a script.For many contemporary viewers, some scenes are too long and out of context, but as there are tensions behind and it is a color movie, then they do not become annoying. I saw the movie on DVD, in a cinema, of course, to sit 2 hours 45 minutes continuously can be a challenge...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like looking into another world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon a time there was a European who perfected the typical and old American western genre. It was the Italian Sergio Leone who succeeded to reach this seemingly impossible perfectionism. With Once Upon a Time in the West he brought both his own career and the complete genre to the highest level. Of course that's just my opinion and there are a lot of people who would disagree with that statement, but for me this extraordinarily great movie seems currently unbeatable. Now, the last 45 years much has been said and written about this movie, but that doesn't prevent me to add my humble opinion to the increasing number of shared opinions about it. The fact that I truly love this movie was just something I didn't want to stay unmentioned.Yesterday, one of the songs of Ennio Morricone's wonderful soundtrack got stuck in my head. The characteristic sound of Cheyenne had kept me busy the whole day and because it had already been a year since I saw the movie for the last time I decided to see it once again.Almost every time there's been talked about this movie in the past there's been talked about the distinctive, sluggish, but powerful beginning. We're lucky that the three men were not half an hour early for the train, because it shouldn't have last much longer before boredom would've struck. However, right now, with only ten minutes to wait before the train comes in, the beginning is brilliant. You then approximately know what's about to come 'cause in the rest of the movie Leone also takes ample time to show what he wants to show and with the pace in which the movie continues there isn't much important you can be missing.Every character which can be found in the movie is a unique and original one, without any form of overacting or a highly overdone presence of one of them. Whether it's about the remarkable Harmonica, which attracts the most attention with the striking tune he plays, or about Cheyenne, which can be recognized by his own theme as well, all of them ensure that it's enjoyable from the beginning till the end because of their abstruse, unknown history. Furthermore, Leone succeeds to let his characters behave very human, just like he did in his previous movies. They all have both their good and their bad sides and none of those sides is hidden, let alone that one of the characters is idealized.Yet the movie feels a little unrealistic in the sense that it seems to take place in a different universe. Especially the slowness in which everything happens makes you feel like you're looking into another world. In particular, the time that is taken to say something feels unreal, while on the other hand it gives a magical feeling as well. It's Ennio Morricone who perfects the ensuing mysterious atmosphere.But a movie would be nothing without actors. Actors which are all delivering a great performance in this movie. Jason Robards perhaps got the best role. He seems to be made for the role of Cheyenne and it's wonderful to see how he slowly changes during the movie. I think Charles Bronson plays the best role in his career and just like Henry Fonda he's acting great in the interesting, mysterious conflict in which they're involved. In my view, Claudia Cardinale can do no wrong and she therefore brings along the necessary femininity in a perfect way. Finally, Jack Elam, Woody Strode and Gabriele Ferzetti deserve a special mention which they owe to their great performances, although not all of their roles had very much influence on the movie's story.After the very good beginning and the great continuation the ending is at least as admirable as the foregoing. A shootout wasn't a big innovation and there already was a foretaste of the use of flashbacks in Leone's earlier For a Few Dollars More, but the way he combines these two elements and the quality of the combination makes sure that the end is more brilliant than that of the average movie. After the first few blurry, mysterious flashbacks the flashback at the end ensures clarification. Then everything falls into place and some of the characters seem to face a happy life ever after.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Beautiful West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing I love about Sergio Leone's style as a director is his execution of telling a story in that while there are moments that have a purpose in progressing in the story, we can appreciate the moments where not much is happening, allowing more room for reflecting, whether it is beauty of the atmosphere in the world these characters live in or how the music is given a chance to evoke the emotions and be its own character. To sum up with more clarity, Sergio Leone made me learn to appreciate films that chooses to take its time, where all the little subtleties are the ones that add the most richness to a film's quality. It made me realize that there doesn't have to be things happening every minute in a movie to truly enjoy it.If I were to describe this stylistic aspect of Leone's directing, I would say he is able to inject a feeling of richness in his stories that makes his films feel very warm in tone, all the while being stories with a lot of grit and sharp edges. With 'Once Upon a Time in the West,' this was the first time this specific quality became evident to me in movies. From all the vast landscapes filmed for specific scenes, we feel more like we are delving into a world of beauty that is rarely visited, than watching a mere movie. How Sergio Leone is able to make his films feel larger than life is an astounding achievement and inspiration for those with an artistic vision.And every acting performance is delivered with a sense of sophistication and grace in adding to this rich story. And with every performance, we are presented with characters that are memorable and pivotal to the world they exist in. The world that exists in the film is filled with dirt and grit, and how these characters behave are evident of the world they live in.And this world that we see is the death of the west and the ushering in of a new era. These characters all play a pivotal point in that, but what plays out in the end is a revelation that brings out the full picture of what lurks underneath the motives that fuels each event that occurs, to bring everything full circle. And the way the movie ends on this note is moving.'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a dark western filled with a lot of melancholy, but still possessing a quality of rich beauty. Underneath all the scenes of violence, there is an emotionally undercurrent that manages to seep through and how Sergio Leone is able to convey those emotions with so much subtlety shows the true mark of a great director. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a classic not only due to its ambition, but also in how grand it feels in every sense of the word.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To make a masterpiece 2 years after another masterpiece tells us that Leone was a masterful director!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching this film, I was concerned whether or not this film would please, despite the undying praise given to this film. This is not just because Leone made a masterpiece 2 years before but also due to the fact that he was set to retire from Spaghetti Westerns before reluctantly making this film. Now that I've seen it, Sergio Leone simply made the right choice in continuing with Spaghetti Western film making! The story revolves around a young woman named Jill McBain who was driven to a town where she finds her family slaughtered by a man named Frank. During this time, a mysterious man playing a harmonica is found as well as another man named Cheyeene who must join forces to save the girl's life from Frank's assassination attempts as a ploy to get the woman's land.Much like 'The Good, the bad and the Ugly', this is an extremely moving and epic tale told in the grandest of fashions to the very best of one's ability. The characters in this film are truly memorable as is the brilliant musical score composed by Ennio Morricone who simply outdoes himself with these films. The performances throughout the film are brilliant and the fantastic cinematography, writing and directing are flawless! Whilst The Good the bad and the Ugly had three of the most memorable characters (Blondie, Angel Eyes and Tucco), so does this film in having Frank, Cheyeene and nicknamed "Harmonica" who closely resemble the characters from Leone's previous masterpiece. These characters are extremely intense, entertaining even hilarious at times and most definitely great examples of fantastic characters in films. Frank, played by Henry Fonda, plays the antagonist in the film who must try o either kill Jill and take the land for his boss or to convince her to give it up. He has an absolutely fantastic scene in the film where we are introduced to him just as he viciously kills a young boy. This scene alone simply strikes a threatening image in our mind as to who this guy is and what he is like. Cheyeene is the extremely likable guy who throughout the film can be both dangerous and helpful certainly for Jill. His character is an iconic Western image right up there with Eastwood's character from the Dollars trilogy. Harmonica is the best character in the film who throughout the film keeps a cool head and plays a harmonica. In one scene, in the dark, Jill hears him playing his harmonica and attempts to gun him down and she only realizes he fails when she hears the music once more! That was another memorable scene in the film Full of fantastic directorial moments and a great script, the performances in this film are rich especially by Henry Fonda who literally becomes another person for this film. As do Jason Robards in a brilliant performance as Cheyeene. Charles Bronson delivers yet another one of the most memorable performances as Harmonica. The rest of the supporting cast all do a great job making the performances in this film are outstanding Ennio Morricone is a large reason as to why Sergio Leone's Westerns work to the extent they have. This musical score is the same in the fact that it is simply such an iconic piece of music that throughout the film perfectly resembles the tone of each scene.Simply to say, Once Upon a Time in the West is an absolute masterpiece of a film that will remain one of Leone's best. I have no complaints with the movie that if I were to pick a bad part, I would only be able to say that it isn't quite as brilliant as 'The Good the bad and the Ugly'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Here's looking at you" might be Humphrey Bogart's trademark slogan, but eyes in a Leone Spaghetti Western reveal much more emotions and even plot than Bogey ever could convey with his. Sergio Leone made extreme close-ups the dominant shots to explain character - and a look into Frank's eyes (played by Henry Fonda), who was deliberately cast against his usual character in "Once Upon a Time in the Wild West", makes it perfectly clear why. There's no need for lengthy dialog if a capable director can do so much more with style alone. And of all around brilliant visuals in Leone's Westerns there is no shortage, no doubt about that. If the widescreen scenery is as grand, deep and epic a director can even deliberately allow the weight of silence to descend on the viewer and let the image speak for itself.Once sound effects are added to compositions like these they become more than nice enhancements or mere fillers, they turn into characters themselves of a total work of art. An art that reaches even higher levels if you take Ennio Morricone's melancholic score into account which rounds off this rare masterpiece. Morricone delves deep into the souls of characters, makes whole landscapes tangible, even develops plot of the powerful story. Add to that a flawless cast (aside from Fonda Jason Robards, Claudia Cardinale, Charles Bronson and others star) and every lover of the moving picture is likely to be seriously moved. Or blown away if you haven't seen anything like this before. There are so many memorable shots in "Once Upon a Time in the Wild West" that one can stop counting them early on and take the whole thing as the ultimate template on how a great film should look like. Films like these are cinematic paradise, made for the history books, and every moment of it should be savored. Definitely one of the greatest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very typical about frontier life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie told me a story about cowboys and west life in 19th century. The story is about a battle between a widow and a bad guy who are powerful and wealthy. The bad guy owned much railway and land meanwhile he wanted to get more land from a widow. Then a brave cowboy came to the small town where the widow lived. He helped the lady to fight with the bad guy and at last they won. This movie is about cowboy and frontier life. The life in the small town is hardly and there are few laws and rules to control people. The most important thing in the west was land and many people will even kill people for land. At the beginning of the movie I can guess what mood the movie will be. The director gave me a beautiful but cruelty scene and the whole movie was in that kind of mood. The cowboy who helped the widow is definitely macho. He was mysterious and had enough power to protect himself as well as people who needed his help like the widow. He was also very callous. At last the beautiful widow fell in love with the cowboy and asked the cowboy to stay with her. However, the callous cowboy said no. Then while the lady asked him when would you come back, he said "someday". His answer was cool and nothing. He was steady in mood and nothing can influence him. This movie is totally about what I learned from chapter four in American ways. In the movie we can see frontier life, self-reliance, rugged individualist, American macho heroes and can-do spirit. Especially the hero is very typical. He demonstrated his strength through physical violence in the movie. He fought against the man who controlled the small town. He was physically tough and rugged by the conditions of frontier life. He appeared and disappeared alone. He could meet all the dangers and is strong enough to extend his protection beyond himself to other.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OUATITW takes place in a weird part of American history. With that said, it's not even a bit ironic that a visionary Italian filmmaker orchestrated it all. Director Sergio Leone had done it before, of course, with the classic "Man With No Name trilogy" featuring western vet Clint Eastwood. But OUATITW is a completely different animal compared to the Eastwood series. While that pulpy, hard-boiled trilogy feels raw and uncontrollable at every turn, OUATITW is much more epic and somber in feeling. The best parts here are Ennio Morricone's terrific score and cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli's rich and haunting capture of the red and dusty Wyoming landscape. The story revolves around five characters who cross paths with each other throughout the film: Harmonica (Charles Bronson) is a wandering vigilante, playing his harmonica more than he talks and on the hunt for Frank (Henry Fonda). Frank's a cruel, heartless monster of a man that kills without any feeling or remorse and just so happens to be in league with railroad tycoon Morton (Gabrielle Ferzetti) in a land-snatching plot involving the inheritance of Jill (Claudia Cardinale), a big-city girl thrust into the wild west, now alone and struggling to simply stay alive. Last but not least, there's the dangerous but lovable bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards), fresh out of captivity and ready to swing things his way, whatever the cost. The expansion of the railroad is the key element of this story. The ghosts of westerns past haunt the proceedings as the money of the railroad barons and thirst of the land developers evaporate the mystery and beauty of the frontier. Morricone cleverly composed a distinct score for each of the five main characters, with Harmonica's being the most intimidating, Frank's the most conflicted, Jill's the most tender, Morton's the saddest and Cheyenne's the most deviously playful. It adds a whole new level to the film and will leave you humming Cheyenne's theme long after the movie is over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts with a never before and not even now seen Scene with a thumbing music which just takes over your whole mind as well as Room.The music is something which makes you keep watching till some gun fires in that shot...the performances are amazing and just cant be forgetted. The film looks so realistic and the music has been copied through generations i guess in lot of movies.This one is a real Cow boy stuff. The film is real classic and there is not a single moment where you can look anywhere else except the screen.i wish i could have seen this movie in a theater but i still feel lucky that i have seen this movie with a home theater system which were really put up for use when i played this movie with classic as well as unforgettable music.Thumbs up to the music , performances and the direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sergio Leone trademarked the spaghetti western with Clint Eastwood his watermark of fame until this film came along in 1968 with Charles Bronson as the man with no name, and surpassed everything that had gone before. Without wanting to disenfranchise Eastwood fans, "Once Upon a Time" is the culmination of the previous trio, the perfect finale to the series.From the moment Bronson steps off the train, bounty hunters Jack Elam and Woody Strode waiting to claim their quarry, the movie sets a tone that is artistically and narratively unique. Morricone's music is even more powerful and the presence of the alluring Cardinale adds a dimension that in my opinion makes the movie less distant than its predecessors.Fonda's piercing blue eyes underscore his callous villainy, but even bold director Leone can't show the unthinkable in that classic scene where Fonda is confronted by the collateral damage caused by his deeds. His unflinching response while only implied is jarring enough. The film is stylish, refined and essential - whether you're sampling best of breed in westerns, or just catching up on the best films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two stories intertwine in a classical movie centered around the construction of the railroad to the Atlantic and the impeding end of the wild west. Much like the movies of Sam Peckinpah "Once Upon a Time in the West" is a romantic swansong to an era gone past, as well as to its idealised pop-cultural meaning. The film centers around four characters with a varying level of immorality. Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale), a former New Orleans prostitute turned housewife, will do anything to preserve her life, even for the sake of her honour and dignity. Cheyenne (Jason Robards)is a fearless outlaw, but with a code of honour and a lot of class. Harmonica (Charles Bronson), a mysterious gunslinger travelling with only a gun in hand and a harmonica hanging on his neck, enters the fray is real style and remains the main protagonist of the story. Opposing them is the villainous Frank (Henry Fonda), a scrupulous gun-for-hire with a knack for torture and psychological warfare, which does not back down from killing women and children in order to forward his own gains.In this bleak vision of the American west dichotomous concepts of good and evil have R.I.P. written all over them. Sergio Leone delves into this world, but adds his own touch of class to the realism. Interested more in the calm before the storm much of the focus is placed not on the action and gunfights themselves (these are normally over within a matter of seconds), but the emotional buildup that precedes it. Long suspenseful shots, which create an unmistakable aura and tension, inhabit the story in droves and also cause it to last over 2,5 hours. Some of these intense scenes are absolutely memorable, while the opening shootout at the station remains one of the best sequences in movie history ever. That said there seems to be an overload of such scenes, which cause the story to drag to a halt. Given this movie lacks the tongue-in-cheek humour of "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly", it can be a sometimes awkwardly tiresome affair. One however that is well worth the toil.Despite being much more somber in nature than the previous trilogy there seems to be much less weight to the story and save for some spectacular storytelling and cinematography I much prefer the mentioned "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly", despite giving them similar notes. The symbolical use of water and trains throughout the movie does seem rather simpleminded at times and doesn't really add depth to the movie. Nonetheless "Once Upon a Time in the West" remains an classic tale about the end of an era. Whats more I get the immense feeling that no one will ever be able to tell a similar story with such unmistakable wit and charm as Sergio Leone did. His westerns seems impossible to replicate in form and whenever I see anyone replicate his long focused shots full of tension and expectation it always seems to be bordering on farcical.Sergio Leone had a short and uneven career. Despite the fact that I feel his "A Fistful of Dollars" and "For a Few Dollars More" are vastly overrated and rather poor movies "Once Upon a Time in the West" stamps out his position as one of the all-time movie greats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A beautifully crafted western - a tribute to the editor's art as well as the director. A sublime score by Ennio Morricone complements each scene - Frank's final ride to Mr Choo Choo being a favourite. As other reviews mention, and in keeping with Christopher Frayling's comments on the expanded DVD which includes his documentary, this western is all about rhythm - what seems seemingly slow to the unappreciative is actually a thoughtful dance with time to produce even-paced scenes that draw you in. A perfect western to sit with on a sunny afternoon with a beer or two, totally alone, and be immersed in its slow waltz from beginning to end. This western is filmed in glorious browns and reds, evoking a dusty and earthy atmosphere, and chiming with the final scenes that the characters are just men and thus destined to earth and ashes when gone. This is not a film to watch with a woman - it is a male, solo experience for those who like to think and ponder whilst watching. Charles Bronson is brilliant - surpassing Eastwood by a mile in how to show emotion whilst saying little; Jason Robards is the sort of comic relief that thankfully is not that comedic; and Henry Fonda is Henry Fonda - dependable and efficient, especially so as a villain. One of the few films that should be allowed to survive Armageddon...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The formation of the modern western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone is most definitely the face of the modern western. Leone revolutionized the genre with his raw, brutal, and visceral films that matured and revitalized the spaghetti western and made it into something so much more grand. Once Upon a Time in the West is arguably his most ambitious film, and the biggest production he has ever tackled. It's almost three hours long and boasts an all star cast and very impressive sets. The film is about an assassin working for a massive railroad conglomerate who is out to get a beautiful widow. A mysterious harmonica playing stranger joins forces with a notorious bandit in order to protect this widow and stop this madman. The story is one of epic proportions that spans many large set pieces and an all around epic scale production. But along with all that, it is also one of Leone's most passionate homages to the spaghetti western genre that inspired him to make the classic films he did.Once Upon a Time in the West is slick, cool, stylish, and at times painfully overdrawn. However, it all plays up to the kind of film this is. Sergio Leone is obviously trying to do something so specific with this film and he may have overshot that, but it doesn't detract from the fact that this is such a wicked film. You can easily strip the film down to hard boiled men staring at each other for extended periods of time, but Leone has a way about him to where he can capture those long stares and make them intense, invigorating, and all too captivating. After the first two hours of this you begin to realize how over the top and extraneous these moments are, but a part of you doesn't care because it's the absurdity of these situations that make the film as a whole so much fun.It is in no way a poorly made film, in fact it is quite the opposite. Leone directs with a suave nuance that pulls you into the intensity of the moment and makes you never want to look away. Leone proves his status as one of the greatest directors in history with this epic saga. He couldn't frame his shots any more perfectly. He couldn't capture the heightened emotion and rigorous sincerity any better. He couldn't bring out any more talent in his already incredibly talented lineup of actors even if he tried. There is an elegant purity to the style of this film that is never overbearing to the story, but always remains an incredibly significant element in making this film as epic and as ingenious as possible.I'm not going to say that this is a particularly easy film to sit through. It's not. It is very long and it drags out every scene possible, squeezing every drop of sincerity and intensity out of the story. I would go as far to call it grueling at some points when you just wish the film would move on. But somehow it all pays off in the end and I still managed to love this film. It is what it is, and Leone captured exactly what he wanted with this epic scale production, and I have a lot of respect for that. Under the right circumstances I might sit through this film again, because it is incredibly good despite anything negative I can say about it. But, love it or hate it, there is no denying that Sergio Leone did things for the western genre no other director did during the latter half of the 20th century. And for that, my admiration of Sergio Leone grows exponentially, and it brings me around to having undying respect and love for Once Upon a Time in the West.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once Upon a Time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IMDb Top 250: 20Sergio Leone's western epic 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is arguably the best western ever made. But it's not for everyone- if the Good the Bad and the Ugly is a firework (and it's not) this is a slow-burning cigar. Leone takes his time to let things play out, and lets the music do the talking instead of voices.As usual, the soundtrack is incredible, arguably perfect. In a film with such little dialogue, the music has far more responsibility. Each major character has a theme, expressed through a tune. Each is great. I believe the best music occurs when Frank rides towards Harmonica at the end. Very emotional.The dialogue, while few and far in between, is excellent. They are delivered well, but more on that later. But the content is fantastic. One example is the "three dusters" bit said by Harmonica. Also, one line in particular has the most mind-blowing foreshadowing that I didn't realise until I had finished the film. I won't spoil it.This is a 3 parts + 1 movie. Two of the actors play badasses, and being a badass doesn't warrant extra-special acting. Then there's Frank, played by the iconic Henry Fonda. I've never seen a Henry Fonda movie: only through the IMDb did I learn of his good-guy reputation. But look at the guy: he just looks like a saint. Like Jimmy Stewart. He cannot be bad. But he is. He's evil. Which makes his acting exceptional. A gripe though is that viewers see two explicit actions of evil, one early and the other a flashback. I think it would've been beneficial to see another example, somewhere towards the middle-end of the film. That being said, he's a highlight.There's some exceptional lighting done here, especially in scenes with Harmonica, like in the dark at the bar.Lastly, the plot. Once Upon a Time is about the end of the West, but the story revolves around Jill's arrival. The plot trots, with occasional action scenes, but the pacing is deliberately stop-start. There are a few big revelations, and the ending is very fitting. However, the viewer has to do some thinking. I intently watched the film, and I still missed things. Once Upon a Time demands a second viewing to fully understand the film.Once Upon a Time is an iconic and memorable Western. So many things are right, and nothing is outstandingly wrong. Personally, I didn't like it as much as the Good, the Bad and the Ugly, but this is an epic not to be missed. 9.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spaghetti Western For Grown-Ups, Excellent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Setting things in motion at a deliberately slow pace, master director Sergio Leone gives his audience a plenty of time to savor the solid visuals and the iconic Ennio Morricone score, as well as muscular performances by black-hearted killer Henry Fonda, Jason Robards as the outlaw with a heart of gold, and Charles Bronson in the role of a new and even more mysterious man with no name.The plot was lifted from about a thousand other westerns before it. However, the timeless themes of progress, often times championed by evil men, crushing little people under it's considerable weight is a narrative that never gets old.The sight of a nearly-nude Claudia Cardinale isn't too hard to look at either.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>without a doubt. Yes, it's slow by today's standards. Purposeful, and sure footed would be more apt. The pacing is deliberate, and for me, adds to the overall effect. Operatic? Yes, as in the "grande gesture". Operatic, as was Stravinsky's "Oedipus Rex", and just as timeless. Morricone's theme for Harmonica is based on Mozart's "Don Giovanni", and this plays out much like that tragedy. Things are set in motion, before the film starts, that can only reach one end - death, for most of the characters. Delli Colli's lensing is so beautiful, like paintings from a master. The final showdown between Frank and Harmonica is only rivaled by Leone's other showdowns for it's ballet like quality: truly breath taking.All in all, probably the finest "western" ever made. 10/10. if i could award it more, i certainly would.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once Upon a Time in the West is my pick for the number one movie ever and especially a western. I have seen all the most popular western movies down through the years and would say there are about 50 that I would watch over and over again. BUT this movie is the best. I will never forget the first time I saw this movie. It was in 1971. A friend mine, Doug and I had been out and about during the day and we ended up back at his house. It was about 3 in the afternoon after a great party the night before at his house. We had just finished cleaning up the whole house from the party and were sitting down with a beer and flipping the channel to see what was on television. We were in the basement recreation room sipping a brew as we watched a western that we had found already in progress. We had missed the first 20 to 30 minutes of some "western" and were watching the railroad station scene with the three men who were sent to meet "Harmonica".We were only five minutes into this scene,with no dialogue and just some strange music, with our beers forgotten and sitting on the edge of our chairs leaning forward in order to miss nothing on the screen. My buddies roommate had walked down the stairs and started talking to us and proceeded to lift weights behind us in the recreation room. We both stood up turned around to face him and at the same time both yelled something to the effect that if he didn't cease and desist making all that noise, ( Just a clink or two of the weights bumping as he was moving them... ) we were going to either beat the crap out of him or kill him! Couldn't he see that we were really into a movie and he was really upsetting our concentration!!!!! :&lt;)Before I continue you must know that I am and have been a western nut since I was 10 or 12. I have read books and watched movies of westerns religiously whenever I could find them. My buddy Doug on the other hand had seen some westerns, and as a reader had probably read a western book or two but was not really too interested. He would rather watch a football game than watch a western for the 14 th time. I could and did talk circles around him about westerns. So he was watching this movie with me just to kick back and relax with a beer after an all night party at his house.Later I told him how surprised I was at his reaction, like mine, to his roommates lifting weights behind us while we were trying to watch some western that we did not even know the name of and that we had only been watching for five minutes.It was at this time as we had just finished yelling at that guy to stop that we both looked at each other, smiled, sat down and moved our chairs closer to the television and continued to watch the scene unfold before us. You could hear a pin drop when the scene was over. We knew that this movie was going to be either the worst western ever because of what just happened, or that we were really going to have a good afternoon and see the best western to come down the pike in the last 20 years.It was a great afternoon and even Doug agreed that we had to see this one again and again in the future. Which we did. Thirty years later, married with three kids who are almost 30 themselves they would agree with me. They all know that dad's favorite movie of all time is "Once Upon a Time in the West"! I made them watch it with me until their eyes fell out! Today I will have to say that "Dances With Wolves" and "Open Range" are a close number two and three. Waiting for more good westerns ................. Jay</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I MUST MOST CLEARLY INSIST YOU DO NOT READ THIS COMMENT UNLESS YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE! I WROTE ABOUT DETAILS YOU HAVE TO WATCH, NOT TO READ ABOUT! I consider Ennio Morricone far the best composer for film scores. Everyone who doubts that should get himself the theme from "El Mercenario" and listen to it with his eyes closed.And Sergio Leone knew like only few others how to create a picture, frame by frame, position by position, action by action, face by face.It is clear that when these two masterminds come together in a almost unique way, the result has to be breathtaking. The fact that Morricone wrote the music before Leone started shooting the film fortifies my opinion that this movie had two directors, working like one.But even the best painter is powerless without paint. Luckily, Henry Fonda, Claudia Cardinale and, above all others, Charles Bronson had the specific look Leone needed to create this epic.It is a simple and yet impressive way, Morricone and Leone cook up the tension in this tale. First, the main characters are presented in a breathtaking way. Cheyenne freezes with his appearance a whole cowboy stop. Frank exposes some of the most devastating cruelties ever to be carried by a villain. Jill, the flower in the wilderness. And then of course Harmonica, starting with killing three western legends and going on by mocking even scary Cheyenne.After the characters are portrayed, the interaction starts. And step by step, more relations are exposed or created. Just the first meeting of Cheyenne, Jill and Harmonica is the most thrilling moment I have experienced with a movie so far. The bouncing shadow of Bronson's hat, covering and revealing his unique face while he plays, silent and calm as a monk, his harmonica always snatches me like the freezing squall of a blizzard.One thing, everyone in the film loses just in the right moment: The mystery. You never know, why Harmonica chases Frank, just until the end. You never know, why Cheyenne becomes a noble guy, just until the end. But be aware: When the curtain falls down, thunder hits you and a storm is blowing when Frank and Harmonica finally have their showdown.This is film-making up to perfection, when the movie is an experience. An adventure. An epic.I haven't felt anything like the emotions I had in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST after or before I watched it. I'd say, this is the best motion picture I have seen so far and I'm pretty sure, nothing is gonna replace it.</fullReview>

Ten years before "Heaven's Gate" explored the "death list" and big business as a willing participant in murder,Leone exposed it and gave it a crippled railroad baron and a murderous hired gun in Frank.One of the most accurate depictions of an old west tavern/watering hole/rest stop shows what it really was like as the west was settled. The soundtrack ranks among the very best,if not the best in film history,and the cinematography is beautiful.Anyone who doesn't appreciate this movie needs to examine truthfully why.Is it because they disagree with the violence?Hate a good original score by a brilliant composer? None of the 4 leads out acts any of the others...so it wouldn't have been a good Clint vehicle,IMO.At the end of Unforgiven,Clint dedicates the film to Don (the Dirty Harry director) and Sergio,who apparently taught him everything he needed to know to be the primo film-maker he has become.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All good stories come full circle, laying the seeds of the denouement in the opening chapter or, in this case, the opening scene. Once again, Sergio Leone invokes a man with no name (Charles Bronson) who dispatches three hired killers in quick succession, after alighting from a train at a windswept desert station; at the denouement, the same man disposes of his nightmare, in the same fashion ? a bullet ? at another windswept desert station. In between, we have a complex, psychological drama encompassing a corrupt railroad tycoon, Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti); a delicious, reformed gold-digger, Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) recently married to Brett McBain (Frank Wolff); a sociopath, Frank (Henry Fonda) who simply delights in killing; and a bank robber/killer, Cheyenne (Jason Robards) who is wrongly accused of mass murder and thus determined to set the record straight.If that isn't enough to get your interest, this story is also a mystery on two levels: why does the man with no name (but, in the story, everybody calls him Harmonica ? because he is often playing one that hangs around his neck) want to meet with Frank? And, where is the gold that Brett McBain told Jill was at his farm, when they married in New Orleans a month ago? If you like Westerns, you'll like this one; if you like Sergio Leone's work with westerns, you'll just love it... I know I did.At 165 minutes though, some will probably complain that it's too long. Don't listen to them at all! Sergio Leone, of all directors, probably used the close-up and extreme close-up more than any other director I can recall, letting the camera explore very millimeter of the actors' faces, searching for the emotion, the feeling, the expression to tell much more than mere words. So, there are long wordless sequences. However, the acting, direction and camera work provide the narrative perfectly. This is a masterfully constructed film by a trio of master story-tellers (Dario Argento, Sergio Leone and Bernardo Bertolucci) and a director (Leone) whose attention to detail is legendary. Couple all that with a musical score from the ever productive and imaginative Ennio Morricone, and you have one of the truly great westerns.Purists who know guns, of course, will laugh at the accuracy of those who manage to kill at over ten yards; six-shooters are notoriously inaccurate. The final battle, at five or six paces between the antagonists, however, is exactly right and must be seen to be appreciated.So, if you've not seen this one yet, then I highly recommend it; if you have seen it, why not have another look?</fullReview>

It contains great lines and movie quotes, my favorite is: Frank: :'So nobody followed you'. Said Frank to Wobbles. The opening scene with the close-up's is one of the best opening scene ever (The best was in the movie the fellowship of the ring). I always thought that the best westerns came from the USA, but that is not true. However I liked High plains drifter and Unforgiven by Clint Eastwood. I gave this movie a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Leone in his eulogy to High Noon at the beginning of this film wanted the three guys to be Eastwood, Wallach and Van Cleef. Eastwood refused so he replaced them with Woody Strode,Jack Elam, etc. In my opinion Leone wanted to show how anti Shane he was, so Henry Fonda kills the little boy. That was a direct blow to Shane. By showing Monument Valley Leone shows how influenced he was by John Ford. If in My Darling Clementine, Clementine stood for the dignity coming to the West, and Chihuahua (Linda Darnell) was a prostitute, her opposite, Leone joins both of them. Claudia Cardinale is the woman that will build the West. She was a prostitute, like Claire Trevor in Stagecoach. So High Noon, Shane, My Darling Clementine, Stagecoach, The Iron Horse are all combined in Leone's second best film. (The first is TBTGTU)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entirely different film from any other Italian six-shooter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I prefer "The Good, the Bad, &amp; the Ugly" as my personal favorite film from Leone, I'll admit that "Once Upon a Time In the West" is his technical masterpiece. Here, he gets all of his aesthetic right. Its amazing to think that this is the same director who made "A Fistful of Dollars" only four years earlier. Its a beautifully operatic motion picture experience where none of the shots feel to be wasted. Its also one of the very few films that works on both a technical level and an emotional level. It is the masterpiece of the Spaghetti Western genre, but an entirely different film from any other Italian six-shooter. Its not the best introduction to the work of Leone, but after you watch the Dollar trilogy, it is highly recommended you seek this out.Some have complained about the slow pacing. While its not as lightning fast as "The Good, the Bad, &amp; the Ugly", it works very well for this film. This isn't a nonstop barrage of action, but a character study and a portrait of the dying days of the wild west. In that respect, it is as effective as "The Wild Bunch". There isn't much background provided for the four main characters, but that makes each one all the more fascinating. The acting is superb, with Fonda a standout as one of the coldest and most sadistic screen villains, a real change of pace for a man known for nice guys and honest roles. Claudia Cardinale is one of the most beautiful women ever in a film, but she is also a great actress. Robarbs proves he is vastly underrated in what is probably the most likable character in the film. And finally, Bronsan turns in easily the best performance of his entire career as the mysterious Harmonica. The direction by Leone is great as usual, and all the shots in the film make you drop your jaw. And finally, the music score by Morrecone is probably the best of his entire career.This is far and away one of the best westerns ever made. It ranks with "The Searchers" as the finest of the genre. Anyone interested is highly advised to see it. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Long Art Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A magnificent, dense, sometimes angry, exhausting film about the end of the West or the western for that matter. Its about the arrival of the railroad and the decline of the old ways. We got Fonda, the killer for hire with business ambitions, we got a noble bandit framed by Frank's(Fonda) men, Harmonica Charles Bronson, the enigmatic gunfighter seeking revenge and Jill, the New Orleans reformed prostitute, heiress to The McBain family farm and thorn in the side of the railway company. The real subject of the movie is other westerns. This is a film that proves the impossibility of the western surviving the screen and brings it all to a lovely and noble end. All the characters in the movie are western archetypes, they all have there own Morricone background music and they speak in lines from previous westerns, and they move in slow, stylized sequences through a conspicuous cinematic landscape. Its a kaleidoscopic view of all American westerns put together, done successfully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello fellow film lovers? since once upon a time I wanted to see "ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST". Though I have already seen 'THE DOLLARS TRILOGY' &amp; 'ONCE UPON A TIME IN America' by the same legendary director SERGIO LEONE I find this "?WEST" much more engaging and attractive. I felt nothing great, MORE THAN what all those people before me, had had felt watching this film... I felt nothing satisfying about the music in this film MORE THAN what all those people before me, felt listening to its music? I felt nothing wonderful about those sensible editing &amp; wide frame visuals MORE THAN what many people before me, had already appreciated watching this film... I felt nothing good about acting MORE THAN what everyone before me, understood watching this film... But I only feel great that since I saw this film only today and it made me feel good for the whole day that I keep thinking about it, which made me forget my girl friend, food and sleep...

		<fullReview>This is the ultimate of its genre: spaghetti westerns. The close-ups so intense that an opthamologist could provide diagnoses. The clear allusion to samurai epics, but carving out its own niche, unlike "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" which is just a remake of "Yojimbo." There are moments that strain one's patience, particularly the operatic music style. And Jason Robards could have enunciated less like a stage actor. And having to watch Gabriele Ferzetti move at a snail's pace due to his crippled condition. But no one has ever used the camera more lovingly than Sergio Leone, even in the midst of supreme tension. Seeing this on a truly big screen when it came out in 1969 was an incredible movie-going experience. The all-time greatest role for Charles Bronson, and one of Henry Fonda's favorites ever, despite being such a "bad" bad guy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantastic casting. None of that low paid new actors kind of thing like the ones used these days. At first when I saw this film I did not think of it much because I was brought up in the typical Hollywood type of westerns of shiny cowboys and Indians but, when I saw this film again it struck me how much it resembled the real colonial old west just before the turn of the 20th century. Sergio Leone was brilliant in this regard and should be up among the top directors of the the last century. The sound track is magnificent, of-course it portrays an extension of the film in terms of creating the correct feeling for the scene but it is in my view that if Argento was not involved with the soundtrack that the film would have had a different atmosphere to the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Western to end all Westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was about 12, my father had it on video. I watched it a few times right away and it immediately became my favorite movie. The first time the amazing atmosphere from the cinematography and music by Morecone which give this dark western story a great home. Every time I watched it after that more of the depth of the characters and story became clear, as it masterfully unfolds bit by bit through every scene. As you switch from character to character their motivation and connection to the plot is revealed more by expressions than action or words and only in the very end it all falls into place.This was made to be the Western to end all Westerns, Leone did not want to make another western but was strongly urged after the success of his earlier budget trilogy and promised a budget much bigger than those combined. In the end he agreed and made every detail in the picture to signal towards the end of Westerns and the wild west. Every "cowboy" character in the picture dies eventually. Leone even wanted to have the stars from his previous 3 movies to be included as the gang who gets shot in the very first scene, but unfortunately this wasn't possible. The whole story is themed around the disappearing of the "Wild west" symbolized by the laying out of train track and the growing influence of big business vs. small gangs.I don't like westerns in general but this is still one of my favorite movies of all time. It won't be for everyone as it is slow-paced and atmospheric and you will probably need to watch it a couple of times to understand everything, but if you watch the beginning and it grips you then you know you are in for a real cinematic treat. For those who like Radiohead it will also be obvious how Thom York was inspired by the music from Morecone and the guitar will sound especially familiar. (listen to the guitar intro of Electioneering from OK Computer for example). This is also the movie that got me heavily into movies so I highly recommend it to all movie enthusiasts. You will never hear a harmonica the same way again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although there are a few notable exceptions, I generally don't like the "Western" genre. But this film, "Once Upon A Time In The West," is one of my favorite films of all genres.It is deep and rich; the film takes its sweet time to develop the interrelationships of the four major characters. Amazingly, the film's dialogue is quite economical and the actors use a variety of non-verbal forms of communication to set tones for the story.One of the major hooks for the audience is to understand Harmonica's (Harmonica is the character portrayed by Charles Bronson) motive to pursue Frank, played deftly by Henry Fonda. We are shown blurred images from his thoughts that become clearer as the film progresses. And when the truth is revealed near the film's most climatic scene, the audience is "blown away." It is just a fantastic scene! I highly recommend all serious film lovers to see Once Upon A Time In The West.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A beautiful lady, Jill arrives in the town Flagstone, Arizona to where she would meet up with her husband, after the two just recently got secretly married. But upon arrival she discovers he and the children had been killed by a hired gun, Frank. Because the McBain family were in the way of railway bighead, Morton's track layout. But they didn't see Jill coming and so their plans face another hurdle. Plus add another couple when the mysterious gunman, Harmonica, and an extremely wanted outlaw, Cheyenne join in to see Jill get want she deserves.After really enjoying the Dollar trilogy, upon every repeat viewing and seeing the heavy influence of Leone's style breaking through. Well, I knew I just had to see his western epic. I finally got around to watching Leone's supposed masterpiece of the western genre, but here comes the sacrilege. It just didn't entirely grip me as a whole. There's no doubting the high quality of the picture and the skill behind the camera that explodes on the screen, but I found it to be a rather empty experience. More so in the ponderous, wind-out feeling, than anything else. What made it a whole lot easier to take on aboard with this opera style story of raw emotional was that of Ennio Morricone's tailor made score. His usual unique and trademark sounds draw upon very strongly in the heartfelt, but also stinging moments of pure sublime touches that simply drains the energy out of you. Leone used that asset beautifully and crafted more emotion then words could display. Each tune had its own character and organic feel by finding its way into each shot and Harmonica's theme was simply breathtaking. Of course the sound effects was the film's most important and striking component.Also stimulating, grand landscapes cover the surface with splendidly, dynamic photography capturing the sombre mood and colourful faces. Leone's cunning direction is so composed and spacious by giving the film grit and a coldness, but with a certain elegance that never can be matched. He stages some cracking scenes and the showdowns are simply unforgettable. My eyes were certainly, glittering after the powerfully precise opening 15 minutes and it would go on to be one expansive stage show with authentic settings worked into the presentation by innovative composition. But his direction and storytelling is inspired from the music cues that control the actions and emotions. The fragmented story has a more serious and level approach to it and a death stench lingering within its context of the dying west (the railroad making headway) that emerges from these characters' journeys into the new frontier. And also a certain cycle of western references creep into the feature. Like his other films it doesn't glorify its actions, but its hard not to be taken by the visionary that's on show, despite the slow moving pace, flawed story (seems rushed and convoluted towards the end with some continuity shifts) and the way it milks out its scenes. But there's certain perfection in this craftsmanship that can tell many stories with out too much effort and it finishes up with a Zen like awe.Now the magnificent performances were very capable and Charles Bronson really surprised me in his sensational role as Harmonica and the doll face Claudia Cardinale is perfect as Jill. Especially since her character is the heart of the film. Ironically, the epitome of total cold-hearted and barbaric ominous fitted Henry Fonda like a glove here, as Frank. Jason Robards is the life of the party with the wise words, as Cheyenne and Gabriele Ferzetti was jarringly, good as power hungry, but psychically ill Morton. Also you have Woody Strode and Jack Elam in cool minor roles.Simply a ravishing, haunting and baroque looking western epic that deserves to be watched. Nothing short of high art, but I don't see it as the masterpiece like some do. But saying that, watching the special features on the disc has made me appreciate it even more to up it from an 8 to 9.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The entire history of the Western - in two-and-a-half hours.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure this has been said before, perhaps I even read it somewhere or listened to it - but it's worth repeating. This film is not "a' Western - it is all Westerns.Almost at the same time this was released, Peckinpah released the Wild Bunch. That film took a whole host of Cowboy movie conventions and turned them inside out, first by its infamous portrayal of violence, but more importantly by treating the "bad-guys" with respect while presenting all the supposed "good-guys" as cruds - with the exception of the Mexican revolutionaries; but then, even this was a violation of an unacknowledged convention - ever since the murder of Villa by the American Army, Hollywood has covered over that criminal trespass by portraying Mexican rebels as little better than bandits - which of course was Washington's official line on the Villa case.At any rate, the point is that Peckinpah's film blew traditional cowboy clichés right out of Hollywood. It hasn't been really possible to make a traditional Western since then.So it's dam' fortunate for all of us that Leone made OUATITW when he did, because one of the goals he appears to have set for himself is to use practically every Cowboy movie he could remember without actually slipping into overt cliché. And, quite amazingly, he pulls it off.The chief means of accomplishing this, as a number of reviewers have noted, is structuring the film as an Italian opera, using the character's actions and responses (both physical and verbal) to take the place of opera's lyrics, performed before the magnificent music by Ennio Morricone, enhanced by editing that's so smooth, it's often not noticeable. For instance, on repeated viewings it becomes clear that certain scenes - the massacre of the family, the final shoot-out - which are so tense on first viewing that they seem to go on forever, actually happen rather quickly; other scenes that at first seem to snip along - such as the scene when Cheyanne and Harmonica first meet - are actually fairly leisurely paced.The ability to manipulate his audience's sense of time is one of Leone's greatest talents. In all four of his major Westerns - this film and the Eastwood films - the final shoot-out (always staged as a set-piece) seems to bring time to a halt; when the smoke clears, we're left wondering what day of the week it is, because even if we have a watch,we don't trust it any more, since it is clearly not in synch with the film. Leone accomplishes this with an editing approach that is musically timed (quite literally, he is editing it to Morricone's score), utilizing long shots as melodic riffs and extreme close-ups for heavy beats.OUATITW is actually the first movie Leone made where he is fully aware of this. Thus he is taking real risks in his choices of which Western conventions to highlight, and which to let drift into the background. Just as example: All three of the Eastwood films have a horse-chase sequence. There is none in OUATITW. Leone wants the horse to begin drifting into the backdrop of history - this is a film about the coming of the 'iron horse' - the railroad. The second to last image of the film is a man riding off on horseback; the final image is the train facing us as the laborers lay down track leading it directly towards us, as the music we know to be the woman's theme swells, reminding us that she is there with the laborers, and that somehow, while the old West (the West on horseback) has breathed its last, the new West, still a land of promise and new beginnings, remains.A magnificent farewell to an era - not just an era of American history, but an era in film history as well.</fullReview>

This is one Western movie (with the exception of Leone's other films) that has both great story, action, characters, scenery, etc...

		<fullReview>A masterpiece of sound and vision. The use of shadow and music in this film to heighten emotion and character is sheer brilliance. The limited dialogue only adds to the tension of this picture. More is said with action and sound then with words. I still get goose-pimples during Chuck Bronson's first scene. The slow shots of peoples faces and their reactions to events is a nice touch. The genius of the writing is shown during the scene in the bar, where gunfighting is compared to music. Do not be mistaken, this movie is more than an ordinary western. This is movie is about the fundamental difference in good versus evil, in hate versus love, or survival versus revenge. There is more than meets the eye and this film shows that a western, or an action film, does not need to be gruesome and gory to be interesting and exciting. And it proves that an exciting film can pluck the heart-strings just as any story of star crossed lovers can. The Writing and directing and the music are all there, not too mention the action. Henry Fonda plays the darkest meanest character in his career and Charles Bronson, as his foil and opposite, is stunning to watch. It is my belief that Charles Bronson is a very underrated actor and Sergio Leone simply did not make enough Films. If you are a fan of the western and of movies that require an active part from their audience, check this one out...you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Western as Rock Opera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never acquired a taste for Sergio Leone's westerns. We're told to enjoy the Man with No Name trilogy, but, as artful as they are, I found them a bit dull. Clint Eastwood might command your attention now, but, frankly, his laconic nature left something to be desired in those films. Then I saw Once Upon a Time in the West, which might be the greatest western ever; if it's not, it's occupying the same plane as The Searchers, Red River, Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia, and the Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. What I think separates this film from The Good the Bad and the Ugly, Fistfull of Dollars, and For a Few Dollars More is, quite simply, its glee. With Once Upon... Leone and Bernardo Bertolucci and Dario Argento are taking a p**s with the American western. Yeah those other three movies flipped the western myth around a little, but they did so seriously. I'm pretty sure Leone's tongue was firmly in his cheek with this one. How else can one explain the opening scene that draws on and on and on creating such tension that it infuriates us when the money shot never really arrives. The gunfight that ends that scene happens so quickly and we see so little that you're left wanting more bloodshed. And that's the wonderful point that this movie makes to its audience--you're bloodthirsty. But will Leone give you what you want? Not a chance. Bodies may pile up but the violence lacks gratuity and, really, blood. There are also several great performances in Once Upon... First, and most important, is the turn by Charles Bronson. He's, basically, the Clint Eastwood character, but about ten-times as charismatic. Then there's a terrific Jason Robards and a terrifying Henry Fonda. I'm always amazed watching that man act and this is among his greatest achievements if only because it goes so completely against type. We knew he could do noble (Grapes of Wrath and the Ox- Bow Incident) and humorous (The Lady Eve), but who knew he could also do evil? He's a slimy villain here and the perfect choice for the role, what with those icy blue eyes and loquaciousness (villains are invariably more frightening when they talk a lot). And, of course, one cannot forget Claudia Cardinale who deserves to be more widely known if not for her acting then for her unrivaled beauty. The plot itself is inconsequential--railroad men murder a family whose home lies in the path of steam engines; nameless gunfighters protect the family's new mother and the property from the railroadmen; some people die and some don't; the end. Once Upon a Time in the West is about interesting characters, great acting, and a lot of attitude. It's a great film.</fullReview>

In the VHS version it is obviously dubbed in as, "I could swear we're going to hear that funny sound again." I have tried running it with a mute button on the films and reading her lips. It looks like she says something like, "Since when do you protect Frank's whore?" Does anyone know what the original line from Jill is, and what the original line from Harmonica is? He doesn't say "Right now." I can't tell what that dubbed in line is either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the first scenes of this film is Jack Elam playing with a fly running on his face.After a while he manages to put the fly inside the barrel of his gun, which he is closing with his finger. There are two long scenes when Jason Robards comes in, looks at Claudia Cardinale and after a while asks for a coffee. The first time she does not know how to do it, the second time she learned. These scenes seem to last ages. The showdown between Fonda and Bronson takes about 15 minutes. Once you accept this slow rhythm you are in for quite a good western. Leone pays homage to High Noon, Shane, Pursued, The Searchers, and specially to John Ford by showing Monument Valley. Here he goes for the super production epic style, many scenes made me think of Gone With The Wind, Lawrence of Arabia etc... I do not think of this film as his masterpiece, I would leave that for The Good The Bad and The Ugly, because to like OUTITW you have to acquire the taste which is not what happens with TGTBTU. Comparing the characters of the two films Charles Bronson would be the good, Henry Fonda the very bad (next to him Lee Van Cleef is an angel) and Jason Robards a bandit that is almost a good guy. Claudia Cardinale is the main character. Try to see it in DVD with progressive scan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dance Of Death, A Movie To Blow Your Mind...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****Contains Spoilers*** Right, where do I start? On the back of the DVD case is written 'From start to finish, a dance of death'. That's exactly where we will begin. The whole movie is similar to one big Mexican standoff. From the tension, to the quick and brutal violence that the director Sergio Leone had introduced so well by this time in the commonly called 'Spaghetti Westerns'.The story is all about three men. As the tag-line reads, 'One man to love her, one man to take her away and one man to kill her'. That's basically a short sum up of the story. Charles Bronson plays Harmonica (Labeled this because he has no name, much like Clint Eastwood in the dollars series) a 'Good Guy' role as he tries to protect Jill. Jill played by Claudia Cardinale is a ex whore who agreed to marry a man called McBain. However her new family are brutally murdered and she is left alone, with the killer wanting to kill her.The opening scene (Similar to the standoff in High Noon) is perfectly done. Charles Bronson takes three guys out in a standoff outside a train station. With one of the greatest lines ever by Bronson. In actual fact the scene was shot last and after it was done, one of the men in the standoff went back to his hotel and jumped off the roof, in full cowboy dress.As we go through we are introduced to the three men, Harmonica (The one to take her away - Played by Charles Bronson), Cheyenne (The one to love her - Played by Jason Robards) and Frank (The one to kill her - played by Henry Fonda).When is all boils down to it, the reason for all of the killings came to the plot of land that McBain had purchased. Now it was worth a great deal. Each man wanted to get there hands on some of the money it would appear. But in this case, looks can be deceptive.Top it all of with some shootouts and some famous Leone close-ups and long shots and here we have possibly one of the greatest movies ever. With an ending that will shock you. Fonda for me seals the show, but really Great acting all round? **********/********** - 10/10 (If you liked The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, you will love this. A great film).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is not only one of the best westerns ever made, but one of the greatest films ever made period. If you make a list of the five best westerns ever made, this is one of them.The late great Charles Bronson was in at least four classic, or near-classic films. These are "The Magnificent Seven", "The Great Escape", "The Dirty Dozen" and of course, this film.In my opinion, the music score by Ennio Morricone is the greatest music ever featured in a film. If I ever have to vote for "Greatest Soundtrack Ever" I am voting for this film.It is ironic that the great Henry Fonda (now rightfully on a U.S. postage stamp) made such a memorable villain. Henry Fonda spent his whole career playing good guys (Abraham Lincoln, Wyatt Earp, Norman Thayer, etc) and yet he made gives one of the greatest villain performances ever seen on film.This is the proof of what a talented actor he was. When you can play the entire range of good and evil both effectively, you are one great actor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Leone at his best, absolute genius. I don't even know how to begin to describe it. In the beginning, it is all just sounds. There's nary a single word of dialogue. Three figures, their identity unknown, walk into the foreground. They wait for a train. One tries to rub off an annoying fly on his face. Another has a problem with water droplets on his head and catches them with his hat. At last the train comes and no one gets off. The three men turn to leave, but at the last moment, the notes on a harmonica start to play. A man appears from behind the train. 'Did you bring a horse for me?' 'Looks like we're shy one horse.' 'You brought two too many.' Seconds later, all three of the killers are down, and the man (being dubbed Harmonica) is shot in the shoulder.Thus, Once Upon a Time in the West begins. The acting is absolutely marvelous. Claudia Cardinale is absolutely perfect as Jill. Her eyes show all the emotion, making her face the story of the shot. Charles Bronson plays the silent and mysterious character. He is a reincarnation of the Man With No Name and is perfect for the part. Silent and distant. Who could ever forget Jason Robards? He plays Cheyenne with an amazing silliness that it just seems natural for him. Of course, they're Henry Fonda as Frank. He plays the coolest villain, so seemingly natural that he seems almost good. He plays it with smoothness to the role, like a prince. Thus, the four roles become the great centerpiece of the story.The plot itself is complex, taking time to build up. There are many minute sub-plots that all tie into the motives of the characters, specifically Harmonica's past, that along with smooth editing, keep you guessing until the end. The focal point in the story concerns the woman called Jill, and her attempts to try and keep living after the massacre of her husband and his entire family. The man behind the massacre, Frank, learns all too well that there is a surviving member of the McBain's, and attempts to go after Jill. Cheyenne is the outlaw wrongfully accused of the murders of the McBain's, but tries as best he can to protect Jill. And of course, Harmonica is the loner, the Man with No Name, out to destroy the evil of Frank.The direction is perfect, as are the cinematography and editing. However, a great triumph here is Morricone's score. Fantastic. Each individual character is assigned his or her own theme that, as the relations grow between characters, interplays and combines to form truly fantastic cues. Just listen to the music at the final showdown, or the part when Jill first arrives at the station. It is truly beautiful. This whole movie is truly beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A western for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no shortage of reviews here proclaiming Once Upon a Time in the West as the greatest western ever. They may very well be right. The beauty of this film is its almost universal appeal. The cinematography and musical score alone would allow this film to stand even without a plot. But there are enough reviews here that read like film class dissertations, let me just hit on a few of my favorite aspects of the movie and offer a general recommendation.As I mentioned before, the visual aspect of this film is so rich that it risks overpowering the film's other aspects. If you've seen other Leone films (then I can't imagine you not having seen this one), then you will recognize many of his characteristic camera angles and close-up shots. The two most striking examples of this for me was the revelation of Fonda's character (Frank) and the close-up zoom on Harmonica's (Bronson) eyes before the final showdown. Sure it sounds like stock Leone camera work, but I think that in this movie he incorporates set and scenery much more fluidly and completely with his camera tricks than compared with the Dollars trilogy. And while writing about the opening scene seems like a spoiler to me, let me just say that if you have any patience at all, you will be rewarded well to sit through it quietly with the sound set at the loudest bearable level.I've mentioned Leone's Dollars trilogy multiple times already. For those who don't know, it consists of his first three (and genre-creating) Spaghetti Westerns: "Fistful of Dollars", "For a Few Dollars More", and "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly". My recommendation is to watch these movies, if you haven't already, before seeing Once Upon a Time in the West. This isn't necessary of course, the movie easily stands on its own. But the Dolars movies seem to build off the previous ones in a way that enhances each sequential viewing. The first three movies will condition you towards Leone's film making and style, which, while totally groundbreaking and rewarding, may be a bit of an overload to the uninitiated trying to sit down and view all 2hrs 45mins of Once Upon a Time. Viewing the other movies first will also allow you to appreciate what this film is not: another Dollars movie. Oh, and speaking of running time, I don't know if it's even possible to find the studio-butchered original American release running, but do yourself a favor and make sure you rent or buy the full-length, letterboxed DVD with 5.1 Dolby Surround.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic, visionary and Charles Bronson a total Bad-Ass!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one of cinemas greatest debates, the question remains: Which is Sergio Leone's best film? The answer would boil down to a choice of three epic masterpieces. Once Upon A Time in either the West or America and of course The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. It is a question I dare not answer because it is so hard to choose between the sheer class of the three. Leone's epic western Once Upon A Time In The West remains one of the greats of all Westerns, the last great one in fact. While many would still prefer Good, Bad and Ugly, this is undoubtedly the more sweeping and epic as this was a big budget affair. Then it also boils down to your preferred choice of bad-ass, Clint or Charles? Well Charles Bronson is a superb bad-ass.OUATITW is such a gorgeously shot piece of work it must be said. Leone uses he camera like no one else. The sheer rhythm and timing of each movement and the flair is remarkable making the film stand up to the visually superb films of the last 20 years from such visionaries as Ridley Scott and John Woo. Leone's style is perhaps the most influential in cinema, aside from Kurosawa. Leone is of course someone who likes to stretch scenes to the limit, get to the heart of the characters at that point and increase tension to near the breaking point. His sense of timing is unrivalled. In The West we have a number of brilliantly constructed scenes that tease the audience before finally releasing the tension, usually in stylised violence. The face-off between Bronson and Fonda is absolutely the epitome of tension of just coolness.As far as the cast goes, Leone always gets a good performance. Even with a guy like Bronson and indeed Eastwood in his earlier career, two guys not noted for their acting prowess, however he gets a subtle, superb performance from Bronson, which is almost entirely told through Bronson's eyes. It's an understated performance of such cool and such toughness that he barely has to raise an eyebrow for us to know exactly what's going on in his head. There are some actors great at acting visually but not too many. Bronson gives a great performance. Leone's gift in choosing actors with a visual intensity is genius. Not only is Bronson good but in a similar way Henry Fonda gives a great performance, again with minimal dialogue. Fonda's sadistic cowboy is one of cinemas great villains, but one filled with depth. Fonda's steely cold stare is chilling. Then there is Jason Robards who perhaps steals the show, narrowly. Claudia Cardinale is also excellent. I do believe that some of the best directors can pull big performances form the actors, with the littlest dialogue. People like Leone, John Woo, Ridley Scott and Scorsese for example have always been great at this.Once again Ennio Morricone gives a marvellous score that is full of grandeur and atmosphere. While the films use of sound is excellent. This is without doubt a film that any movie buff should have in their collection. *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is simply the greatest movie I ever watched. Although it's a typical western, it's unique from all the other films around. The opening scene blows you out of conscience. The movie starts with the scene of some men waiting for the arrival of a train in station. Leone uses the environment's sounds to create an atmosphere of threat.The film is very long, but is at not one single moment boring or predictable. The montage, views and acting are simply superb. Leone likes to play around with sounds, especially in this movie, where each character has its own theme. The movie contains raw violence, but also a twist of romance is present.If you want to experience the ultimate cinematographic experience, this is the one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply the best Western ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was drawn to this movie perhaps simply by the feel of it, the way the movie just pours, ney gushes desert sand, bad whiskey and bad men over the viewer mixed in with the heat and the mules, the trains, the coarse curses and shouts from the railroad workers and most of all the great silences in which Leone is master.Which director do you know who can make 15 opening minutes in which absolutely nothing happens, in to great movie-art? And then out of the blue, when you're lulled in to sleep by the deserts monotone sounds ... bang there is Harmonica. With a blast.Seeing this movie for me as a kid was coming very close to walking and living in that great romantic (and probably in reality very hard) era of the West and the coming of the railroads. Maybe the scenario doesn't seem that overtly complicated or complex (ie. girl needs saving from bad guy, mysterious good guy seems willing, mysterious good guy kills bad guy, end of story), but maybe that is just great storytelling: transcending a rather simple story to a compelling and moving epic.I think the development of the story is somewhat a side show compared to the way it depicts how America got industrialized and how the robber barons/railway magnets of late 19 century America are the real powers and not the 'traditional' gunslingers Frank, Harmonica and Cheyene. It has the message that in the end money is more powerful than any Peacemaker. The way of the Colt and the West gives in to the way of director's chamber and fontainpen.The life's and dealings of common people are happening somewhat in the shadow of the great changes America goes through in the period between the end of the Civil War and the end of the 19th century.Every image of this movie is a work of art, from the ride Jill makes from the station, her meeting with Cheyene and Harmonica, the shocking and chilling moment Frank enters the movie to the end sequence with Frank and Harmonica shooting it out, and it's somewhat bittersweet ending with the leaving of Harmonica and the death of Cheyene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Astonishing. A must-see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My comments are simple....this film is pure genius. Leone's previous westerns to this one are good, especially the masterful Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, but this one really is his true masterwork and pretty much the final word in westerns. Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven was a superb sort of "send off" for the genre, in terms of fairly traditional westerns, OUATITW is simply the towering achievement of what feels like lifetimes of work. An amazing film. One of those "you must see this before you die" type of thing. It also showcases the brilliance of Ennio Morricone, yet again. All the talent involved just really came together for a colossal project..something that really humbles all that came before it and, as many have said, you will never see this again. Tarantino's Kill Bill comes close in terms of being an homage to past cinema (which this film was intended to be, to a certain degree), but the sharp dramatics and stunning originality are just impossible to imitate. Movie magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Often imitated, never equalled...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ask a genuine film expert what they consider to be the greatest Western ever made, and there are generally only a handful of director's names they will mention. Sergio Leone is legend among that short list because the major productions he brought out in his international career, pretty much all of them are in this short list. Sure, there are also directors like John Sturges or Sam Peckinpah, but neither churned out the masterful epics with the same consistency.C'era una volta il West is probably one of the most restrained and subtle pieces of his career, and it is also one of the most sublime. As commentators on the DVD-Video have pointed out, every moment in the film is slow and distended to the nth degree, and yet it is never boring. The actors are all at the top of their game, selling their roles with a stony dedication that one almost never sees in current-generation actors. About the only actor in today's system who even comes close to Henry Fonda's legendary villain or Jason Robards' amazingly ambiguous mercenary would be Johnny Depp, and directors rarely give him an opportunity to prove his salt in front of the camera.What I'd like to see is a director's cut, or at least a cut produced from Sergio's old notes about the piece since the man is no longer with us, as there are a lot of moments in the English-language DVD-Videos that make it clear the studio still had marketing rather than coherence in mind. This in spite of the fact that Leone had already proven himself as one of the most brilliant directors who ever lived on no less than three previous occasions. I challenge any lover of cinema to find a director who has used the 2.35:1 aspect ratio in a more dynamic fashion than Leone. It might happen one day when the bugs are ironed out of the use of HDTV in cinema production, but don't count on it.In place of the usual endless gunfights that typically dominate Westerns, we have a slow-paced, sedate story that really looks as if the makers simply went back in time to the colonial days and photographed a few people. Each moment is exactly what you'd expect to see real cowboys living in the nineteenth century doing, and that is what gets the film its dramatic poise. Every character is so believable that one is almost bracing themselves for the next struggle they face.Most of the plot is fairly straightforward. It lulls the viewer into a false sense of security for the one final dramatic plot twist at the end when we learn why Charles Bronson's character has been so fascinated with that of Henry Fonda. Even if you find the rest of the film less than spectacular, this one dramatic moment will make you sit up and take notice. It's also not hard to see why Ennio Morricone received continued work from the Hollywood system after his association with Sergio Leone. The music in this film is what gives the audience something to focus on while they are waiting for the distended setups to come to fruition. On the second viewing, modern viewers will get more used to the languid pace, of course.In all, I gave C'era una volta il West a ten out of ten. While I don't consider it to be the absolute best film that Sergio Leone has ever made, even his worst is preferable to some of the countless imitations it has spawned. See it at least twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best western ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't detail the film as others have, but state that the proper human emotion for each scene was the primary sought-after element throughout and was gloriously achieved by the brilliant writer, director, and composer. A one of a kind film and a truly great accomplishment, and by an Italian, not an American, director. Probably had to be that way to do it right as American directors want only action and more fake and unrealistic and historically incorrect action, not human reality or sensitivity...... "Hell, boy, this is a Western!"Contrary to American made westerns where the tough macho guys just bull through everything without a sensitive or caring thought ever wimping-up their manhood, this film connected true human emotion to every action and reaction, whether good or bad, weak or strong. This was obviously the director's and writer's main intent....to show that abject meanness and cruelty, but also much goodness and humanity, existed side by side within our heroic struggle to settle the West. And the wonderful and original soundtrack, added at just the right moment each time it was used, served to complete the formation of the correct perception of each human feeling in the characters. This is not your typical John Wayne flick, folks, and thank heaven for that. It is merely the best western I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SERGIO LEONE DOES ORSON WELLES (BY WAY OF David LEAN)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST a stunningly beautiful western saga or overblown, pretentious horse opera? Take your pick; you'd be right either way. What else but self-indulgent can you call an opening scene which runs ELEVEN AND A HALF MINUTES and ends with its principal players dead? John Ford could made a 90 minute movie from this thin script. Howard Hawks might have added a few action flourishes and come in at 105. Instead, Leone has given you ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE minutes, several scenes which run in excess of five minutes and what has to be most beautifully photographed western in motion picture history. Leone milks every ounce of drama from the meager story of the coming of the railroad to the future town of Sweetwater and its effects on the principal players. Leone matches his cinematic skill with his ingenious casting. Henry Fonda has never been better than as the 'evil as a snake' Frank. As Jill, the movie's central character, Claudia Cardinale uses her expressive face to provide the perfect landscape for Leone's frequent close-ups. Jason Robards, Jr. is surprisingly perfect as the 'Bogart-tough-but-lovable' Cheyenne. Gabriele Ferzetti provides the slick, oily but decadent railroad baron just the right touches of class, crass and ruthlessness. At first, Charles Bronson, as 'Harmonica,' seems the only casting misstep. As Fonda's chief adversary, Bronson never seems up to the task, artistically or otherwise. However, upon reflection, this unequal match now seems to be deliberate on Leone's part, to generate the necessary suspense to keep audience attention to the very end of this overlong masterpiece. Not enough can be said to praise Ennio Morricone's evocative, operatic score, or the other technical credits. ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is not simply a triumph of style over substance. In the end style has BECOME substance, etching the characters permanently into our memory. While lacking their dramatic depth, Leone brought to the cinema the same kind of visual splendor as Orson Welles and David Lean.I give ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST a '10'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thee epic western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>spoiler alert. ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is one of the last great westerns. The spaghetti-western style were invented by Sergio Leone, that had already made three movies about Blondie, with Clint in the leading role. With Ennio Morricone's brilliance with soundtrack making, Leone were quickly the God of western. But he got bored, and wanted to make a gangster-drama placed in the 1920ties, named ONCE UPON A TIME IN America, but people didn't have faith in it. So Leone decided after all to make one more western, and it was going to be the last great epic one, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST.A mysterious and fascinating man called Harmonica wanders 'around and teams up with a local gang-force to save a beautiful widow from being assassinated by a gunman working for the railroad-company. This is leaves us for brilliant dramatics...Leone's style of filming is peculiar, everything goes very slowly and it always has a twist of either pure coolness or charm under it. With Morricone's absolutely fantastic tunes threw the whole movie, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST simply had to be something spectacular. The beautiful Mexican-tunes charming you, and the brilliant look of late 60ties movie making. The dialogs are truly superb, and with its genius actors the movie takes us into the last time of true cowboy drama, with everything you can ask for. Rough'n'tough revolvermen, showdowns, dusty desert, sweaty foreheads, tired boots, filthy hair, pure drama and off course a simply amazing woman. Things works it ways slowly and safe, until the pure brilliance of the movie just gathers into the tricky and epic climax. The opening stands as one of cinema history's best scenes; the pressure and excitement of it, before it ends quickly with brutal bullets flying threw the air. ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is one of the very few movies ever that's captured the true essence of western time. The movie stops just to let you enjoy pure cowboy look, before it continues into a new burst of attractive scenes. Fonda is truly fabulous as Harmonica, the mysterious man that simply is way to cool and to relaxed to shoot down with one bullet. Sergio Leone does everything right along with the rest of the movie, he twists easily with the audience and let's us into suspicion, dramatics and charm. If it hasn't been for the beautiful lady's appearance, the movie had been a sort of follow-up to THE GOOD,THE BAD AND THE UGLY, with three rough guys, all knowing how the handle the gun. But the woman, steals every scene. Her natural beauty capturing you, swinging around with us, and being such a perfectly attractive female with beautiful face, beautiful body and beautiful attraction to men. This is on every level a true motion picture, and is without doubt one of cinema's biggest and best classics. Although it never really got to be the last true western, because Eastwood made a brilliant last time western with UNFORGIVEN some years ago, but in the same time, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is the last great western, because it came at the perfectly right time, and, it's Leone, the only thing missing is Clint, although he isn't really missing in this one.STARS: 5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The death of the west maybe-but a noble death indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 'The Good, The Bad And The Ugly', Sergio Leone made what is generally known as the quintessential spaghetti western. All the more remarkable then that his follow up has won even more acclaim from fans of the genre-in fact, fans of great films in general.With the trademark close up/long shot style of shooting, the dollars trilogy can be easily classed as arty. At a dramatic level, however, they are still for the most part (albeit excellent) pulpy shoot-em-outs, a fact all the more obvious when compared to 'Once Upon A Time In The West'. Here, serious art mixes with ultra-cool gunslingers and filters through all parts of the film, to create one of the most stylistic and visually gorgeous films ever made.To review the film itself, the best place to start would be the beginning. The Virgin Film Guide argues that this film's title sequence is the most famous in cinema history. I'm not sure if I agree with that totally-my vote would go to 'Reservoir Dogs', although doubtless there are many others that I am entirely ignorant of-but while maybe not being as famous as made out, it still ranks as one of the best title sequences ever. This is all the more remarkable given that nothing happens: three men wait for a train at a station. That's it. The ten minute scene is dialogue free (apart from a few lines uttered by a doddery old ticket collector at the very beginning) and totally without incident, yet it is taught, nerve-tugging and hypnotic. The tension is carried by the natural menace of Woody Strode, Jack Elam and Al Mulock as they collect water, shoo flies and crack their knuckles, while in the background the sounds of the breeze and a creaking windmill bypass the ears completely and go straight to the brain. Then, suddenly, the train arrives, Charles Bronson gets off, blows his harmonica, and BOOM...The film then cuts to a devastating massacre scene in which a family of innocents (for added poignancy) are wiped out by the bad guy to end all bad guys. The scene is dramatic, shocking (really) and totally perfect, in terms of drama, acting, cinematography and score, thus usefully leading me into several other points that can be applies to the film in general.In dramatic terms, the film is too slow for some in this modern age of films that look more like music videos (I'm talking to you, McG) but what Leone is doing here is cranking up the tension. Take the scene where Cheyenne arrives at the bar and has his handcuffs shot off-the "action" is so low key that it is not sufficient to relieve the tension, and by the end the viewer is about ready to explode. There is only one proper action scene-where Frank is attacked by his own band of treacherous mercenaries-in the entire film. A far cry from the wall-to-wall gunfights of other westerns, but no bad thing. The drama ties in with the music to create an emotional effect to make us sad even when the baddies die, let alone the goodies.Next: the cast. Charles Bronson's role is one that suits him perfectly, a stoic mystery man with little to say. Jason Robards's Cheyenne is charming to watch. Gabriele Ferzetti, although he plays a villain, gives the role such emotion that the viewer is compelled to like him, however pathetic he may be. By general consensus though, the real tour-de-force is Henry Fonda as the ice-cold murderer Frank. Although the whole typecasting issue is probably lost on modern audiences, he still makes a terrific bad guy all the same-so frightening he makes the crickets stop chirping.The film is beautifully shot. The McBain massacre, where the gunmen stride menacingly out of the bushes...and especially the flashback, where we learn the motivations of Harmonica. I won't give it away, but wow. The flashback is probably the best-shot scene of the film, which is really saying something.It's late at night now as I write this, so I'll give the final word to the music. THE music-Ennio Morricone does it again. This is an extremely varied score, ranging from a sweeping, love theme to electric guitar that sounds like it is being plucked with a razor blade. And given that it was all written before shooting started, it is given an added mystique for fans of scores. Beautiful.That's it. I have only scratched the surface-no review could cover everything without hugely exceeding IMDB's word limit-and I have not even touched on the whole "death of the west" theme, or mentioned Claudia Cardinale. But it's all there for you to find out. Ladies and gentlemen: the perfect western.</fullReview>

It may not have been that since he made "A fistful of dynamite" and co-directed "My name is Nobody" later but it is without doubt the one I'll remember best. It's a Leone's requiem to the Western movies and it may well be the best movie ever made.The dialogue is simply amazing, it's said that the script consisted of just ten pages of lines, however it's all so well written that it makes my spine chill. I mean Bronson can't have more than twenty line throughout the movie, and all of them a remarkable.The shooting is superb, I can almost remember every single shot in this movie, the blend of extreme close-ups and wide shots is just perfect and creates a wonderful result.An awesome score written by Morricone makes this movie even better. Every one of the main characters have their own score and every score is great.Fantastic performances by everyone is the final reason why you should stop read this now and go and by the movie instead. Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale are all playing on the top of their abilities.Now some people may have trouble with the slow pace of it but for me it actually adds to the atmosphere, you can almost smell the dust and death in the air when you watch this movie.Just go and buy it.

		<fullReview>After having perused the various user comments about this film, I haven't got a lot to add, but I would like to say my piece about this wonderful film. It was only a month ago that I saw 'Once Upon a Time in the West' for the first time, and I'm in my early 30s! What a lovely thing it is to be amazed by a piece of art work after you think you've already 'seen it all'. This film was breathtaking to behold, from the marvelous and spirited acting to the languid, Ennio Morricone score, from the scenic cinematography to Leone's purposeful and flawless directing; you get it all in this film.I now own 'Once Upon a Time in the West', after having seen it several times as a rental. The purchase of this film in DVD form provides the added bonus of commentary from various directors, actors and Leone scholars. It's some of the best commentary I've heard yet on a DVD. Certainly worth the purchase!Leone's other films are fantastic, of that one can have no doubt, but this one tops them all. I give it my highest recommendation (10/10). If you haven't seen it, see it tomorrow...you haven't got a second to waste!</fullReview>

The sudden strike of the guitar, and the depressing wail flowing from the harmonica -- an especially poignant symphony that left me in awe, and made the viewing experience even more pleasing.Robards is great, and notably humorous, Bronson is laconic, inscrutable, and also good, but Fonda is truly devastating as Frank. Absolutely despicable, a vicious villain wreaking havoc wherever he goes -- one cannot help liking the wicked brute. Leone deserves high praise for creating such a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't think hollywood could ever have a western this good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leave to the Italians... This is Sergio Leone's finest western if not the best ever. What some people might find boring is what makes Once upon a time in the west filled with more tension than most suspense films. The first 12 minutes is a amazing sequence built around a sound scape that gives you the feeling that you are there at the train station in flagstone.The story revolves around several characters and outside of Henry Fonda's Frank(who is a truly nasty villain) I think there is a lot of grey area at . No clear cut good guys.but who am I kidding this is a Sergio Leone film of course everyone is bad. Leone was a true pessimist and I suppose that is one reason I like his westerns. There is no idealism in how he portrays the old west.Here is the bottom line of the review. This movie is not for everyone. I think requires the ability of the viewer to appreciate grim, dark tone, moments of baddass violence and at the same time a patience cinema as art. Yes this movie is a werid but awesome mongrel of many breeds. All of which add up to a great film.The score is amazing. The sound is designed in a way that I don't think can be compared to any other movies. The performances are all pitch perfect. Henry Fonda plays such a perfect asshole to totally wigged me out as I think of him as the sweet old man in `on golden pond.'. Bronson gives a humble yet perfect performance and Jason Robards is also fun to watch.******Spoilers*******The only thing I didn't think was good was the widow. I realize it is part of the story that she was a hooker in New Orleans but the sexuality in the film seemed misplaced. I don't understand her getting with Frank.The part with Harmonica flashing back to his brother's death is powerful and an amazing pay-off for all the build up. Great movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best "Western" ever filmed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always enjoyed this movie from the first time that I saw it back in 1969. You can almost feel the dust fly and the long close-up shots of the actors' faces tell what they are thinking (kind of a throw-back to the silent era). This is possibly the first western to show the wild west of the 19th century as a dirty and dusty place. The musical score is also tops! The opening 10 minutes or so of almost no dialogue and the creaking of the windmill at the train station set the stage for the rest of the movie. It's a great opening scene. Good triumphs over the evil Henry Fonda (one of the few movies in which he plays the bad guy and he did a great job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw Once Upon a Time in the West on TV last night...probably for the 10th time, and it still blows me away. It is one of the greatest movies of all time, and along with The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, High Noon, and Red River, one of the best westerns ever made. Every scene, every word, every musical note is magnificent. For scale and pure cinema it is on par with Lawrence of Arabia, another of my "10s". Henry Fonda made a great bad guy; another example of how effective casting against type can be. I was thinking it would be interesting to see a sequel, where the Charles Bronson character returns to Sweetwater to be with the Claudia Cardinale character... But these days, who would play those parts?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sergio Leone knew how to direct a western, but he didn't just direct a western with Once Upon a Time in the West, he directed a masterpiece of American Cinema. To make Once Upon a Time in America he had to make Time in the West because if he didn't then he wouldn't get the go ahead. Leone could have just a made a quick western that was average then he would have had his wish. He decided to make another trilogy like he did with Dollars and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly but this was a lot different. It didn't follow the antics of The Man with No Name, it followed the history of America as they saw it. What Leone exposed to us in the 60's was the first introduction of the action hero like The Man with No Name and with Time in the West he introduces us to The Man with the Harmonica played by Charles Bronson. He also gave us villains like Lee Van Cleef and the great Henry Fonda who plays Frank, a hit man who is hell bent on making sure nobody comes between the work of a railway track. His first victims are a small American family who have a house in between the tracks and the head of the family refuses to give in to politics so the best way to rid Frank and the bosses is to deal with it themselves and kill the family. Here we meet Jill who is the new wife of Mcbain the father of the family that has been killed and on her arrival she finds nothing but a family massacred including a young boy. Here she decides that what has happened is unlawful and this is where Harmonica comes in. Also on the trail for his own fortune is Cheyenne. The film as a whole is about relationships between pacific characters and that's where the strength of the film lies. I couldn't find a single problem with Once Upon a Time in the West. I wasn't looking for any problems with it though but it's rare to see a film that is perfect like this one and this is the best Western Sergio Leone has ever done. I hate to admit that it's between than the spaghetti Western trilogy but it is and there's nothing wrong with that. When Leone's first trilogy came out the people probably thought he could never surpass what he had already achieved but he did and did it with flying colours. Sergio Leone is proof to the world that there is no such thing as a one hit wonder when it comes to inventing new stories and ways to make the genre you have already created even better than it was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has to rank as one of the greatest Westerns ever made. It's a film that should be seen either in a cinema, if possible, or on a good widescreen DVD, to preserve Leone's striking widescreen compositions.The cast is great, particularly Charles Bronson as the mysterious, gun-fighter Harmonica and Henry Fonda, cast against type as the evil killer, Frank.The score, by Enio Morricone, is superb. Each of the main characters have their own distinctive musical signature.The pace of the movie is quite slow for the most part, erupting into bursts of violence.In common with most later Westerns, this film deals with how the West was changing, most notably here with the arrival of the railways. Like most of Leone's Westerns this film is highly stylised, most notably in the framing of shots and in the repeated use of close-ups.This film is recommended to anyone who likes Westerns or just great movies.</fullReview>

This movie is very impressive and there is much time to think not only about scenes, but about meaning of life and what aim life have. There is a man, who has to revenge, but without it (or that time, it is done) he don't know what to do. He don't know how to live (Harmonica). There is a woman, which is noble lady and bitch together (Jill). She's very real and symbolic as well (I apologize to all women, it is not about women). There is nice and kind outlaw (Cheyenne). He's like father of all outlaws. And there is evil - very charismatic evil, which leads to self-destruction (Frank). Very symbolic, very real. One of the best movies I have ever seen.</fullReview>

Set in the west, two men (Jason Robards and Charles Bronson) try to protect a widow (Claudia Cardinale) from a vicious gunman (Henry Fonda) who's dressed in black.Out of the performances, Fonda and Bronson really stand out here like the landscape, editing, and Ennio Morricone's picture perfect musical score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is perfect in every aspect. The actors all gave once in a lifetime performances, and they couldn't have been cast better. Leone gave us some of the most powerful (conversation-less) images in cinema history. So little conversation, and so much information, emotion and action at the same time, also thanks to the marvelous soundtrack. Enough superlatives, to sum them all up: this is truly one of the best films ever made, and many great directors are in debt to it, and to Leone.As someone posted before me: a true opera western :) Not the most accessible movie *at all*, but for those who do 'get it', and know how hard it is to create all this based on the text in a script... a masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I saw this movie, I just got done watching Leone's "TheGood, the Bad, and the Ugly". That is Leone's most well knownwestern with everyone. After watching this movie, I couldn't decidewhich movie is better. I've come to the conclusion that they areboth great in their own terms. The first movie is more of an actionwestern. This is an opera. The performances by Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson are by far their best in this genre. It's great that Fonda decided to be a badguy in this film. Bronson's mysterious image is a lot like ClintEastwood's Man With No Name. Claudia Cardinale is veryattractive (for back then). She is pretty good as the woman on herown that can't make it without help. Jason Robards is pretty goodas Cheyenne. I enjoyed seeing western greats Jack Elam andWoody Strode in the beginning of the film. What if Eastwood, LeeVan Cleef, and Eli Wallach were in the opening, or were the starsof the film? I was also surprised by the performance of GabrieleFerzetti as Morton. Morton was a great character, one that I'venever seen before in a western. The editing, cinematography, and direction is well done. I alsorelished Ennio Marrecone's score. When Morton's train is lastscene, the piano reminded me of the famous "Ecstasy of Gold"scene in "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly". The music during thefinal showdown was great. I'm surprised nobody appreciated this movie back in 1968. It's ashame that Leone could never here its praise now. See thismovie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'C'era una volta il West' is not an easy film to watch. Its pace is hypnotic and the story unfolds in a way that blurs the viewer rather than provide exposition.Saying that its not easy to watch, doesn't necessarily mean that the movie is not a great one. In fact OUATITW is probably the greatest art western ever made. I still believe that 'Unforgiven' is the greatest western story of all time, but this one is a joy to watch, for all its artistic endeavors.The casting is genius. Especially Henry Fonda. It takes a genius to see that Henry Fonda could play the ultimate bad guy. Bronson's movie career was defined by this movie and Claudia Cardinale is absolutely stunning.If you are a DVD enthusiast, the restoration of the movie will bring tears to your eyes. It's superb, better than 'Laurence of Arabia'. You can even see the pores in the actors' faces. Highly recommended.10/10</fullReview>

Director Sergio Leone takes the viewer into a fantastic, epic western about a mistirious harmonica player (Bronson), a widow (Cardinale), a bandit (Robards) and a evil killer(Fonda). With a lot of references from another classic westerns, "Once Upon" keeps you plugged with a lot of action, humor and a fantastic final scene when is revealed the identity of the harmonica man. Extraordinary performances by Fonda, Robards and even Bronson. If you never saw a film of the genre before and want to know about the westerns, rent this DVD NOW!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitively the best western I've ever seen. It might even be the best film I've ever seen. The reasons why I think so are many. Firstly the casting is great. Claudia Cardinale is perfect as Jill and Henry Fonda is one of the best bad guys I've ever witnessed. The wide camera shots are just amazing, it's like you can see the entire wild west when you look at the horizon, wich is a bit ironic since most of the film was shot in Spain. The closeups at the eyes, Leone's trademark, are also to be found here, better and closer than ever. Ennio Morricone has also contributed to the experience by making what I think is the greatest score ever. Every character has it's own song. Some are beautiful (Jill's song) others are truly chilling (like Frank's song), every song is terrific though.Some people might feel that this film is too slow to be great, but I can't really understand why. The slow tempo is what makes this film what it is, it gives the whole film an arty, wonderful touch to it.This is what I wish to see everytime I watch a movie, Once Upon a Time in the West is not just film. It's art, it's magic, an enjoyment for every sense. This is without doubt as good as movies get.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once Upon a Time in the West (1968/Sergio Leone) **** out of ****The beginning is legendary. Three gunmen arrive at a train station in the middle of nowhere. They wait, and they wait some more. In the background is an annoying sound, and at the same time, a fly buzzes around. Then the train arrives. They get up, but no one gets off. Then, they here the sound of a harmonica. They turn around, and standing there is Charles Bronson. He asks them where there boss is, and they say that he sent them. Bronson asks if they brought a horse for him, and one of them responds (snickering), "Well, it looks like we're shy one horse". Bronson shakes his head and says, "You brought two too many", and then he kills all three of them."Once...." tells two stories. One about the progression of the railroad, and one about revenge. Jill McBain(Claudia Cardinale) has just arrived out west, and when she reaches the house of her new husband and his family, she finds them all dead. Frank (Henry Fonda), a ruthless assassin, has just done the deed, and is working for a more sinister corporation. Cheyenne(Jason Robards) is a traveling desperado who helps Jill in her struggle over the property she has obtained from the recent death of her husband. And a wanderer who not only plays the harmonica, but can shoot too, secretly stalks Frank, in hopes of revenge."Once..." is Leone's Western Masterpiece. It is both poetic and operatic. Leone has proven with this film that he is the master of detail. With his slow pacing, long periods of silence or no dialogue, extreme close-ups, excellent score and cinematography, and close attention to detail, he has made the most artful and unconventional western of all time. The performances are great as well, and it is interesting to see Fonda play such a bad guy, when he usually plays the Jimmy Stewart-type nice guy. My favorite scene (besides the opening), is after the family is slaughtered in the beginning, and Fonda is about to finish off the little boy who is still alive. The close-up on Fonda's face is amazing. With those big blue eyes and that wicked smile, he is easily one of the scariest villains in cinematic history.Leone has done the same thing with the Western genre that he did with the Crime genre when he made "Once Upon a Time in America", he has made it amazing art film that ends up as poetry on screen. The film requires a lot out of you, but when you find out the twist in the end regarding Bronson's character, then you realize that it was all worth it.-30-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the DVD two-disc edition. I'm particularly fascinated and appreciative of the film's musical score and editing of smothering closeups and sweeping vistas. The violence of several scenes may prove unnerving to some, but seem secondary, although quite in keeping with the classic mythological characters that represent the popular stereotypes of western cinema. "Once Upon a Time in the West" is both a tribute to western cinematic traditions and the mythology of the west that began with the dime novel matured with the rise of the adult westerns of the sixties and seventies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-made, classic Western epic from Sergio Leone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's epic 1968 (1969 USA release) western masterpiece `Once Upon A Time in the West' is a visually and emotionally stunning film from start to finish. The location shots filmed in Utah and Arizona are wide and bright to the eye. Leone and his cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli have complete grasp on what they are seeing and how they want it to appear on the big screen. Beyond the stunning visual aspects of this film one should not lose sight of the high-quality acting that is going on all around. As someone who is under of the age of 40 (in 2003) I mainly know Henry Fonda as a grandfather figure in `On Golden Pond.' Fonda's depiction of the gang leader Frank is one of the most harrowing and evil characters you will ever come across. Fonda's steely blue eyes and lack of any moral sense at all are played beautifully. Frank is as scary as Michael Madsen (`Mr. Blonde') in Tarantino's `Reservoir Dogs.'Jason Robards, as usual is great as another `bad guy,' Cheyenne Gutierrez. However for my money, Charles Bronson steals this movie. I usually enjoy Bronson, and have seen most of his classics (`The Dirty Dozen,' `The Mechanic,' `Mr. Majestyk,' `Death Wish') and have never seen him act this well. He is truly a gifted actor when under the capable direction of Leone. Claudia Cardinale (a Tunisian born Italian actress that has had few roles in US films) also does an admirable job as the widow/prostitute Jill McBain.Some directors have a great deal of difficulty retaining complete artistic control of their projects. Leone is perhaps the greatest example of this. Two of his best films (this one and `Once Upon a time in America') were originally released in the United States only after being edited down by about 35 % from their originally intended length. Needless to say, both edited versions are impossible to follow and not worth following. After fifteen years `Once Upon a Time in the West' was re-released in the United States in 1984 to rave reviews and it is now regarded as one of the best westerns of all time. Other directors like Francis Ford Coppola (`Apocalypse Now') and Quentin Tarantino `Kill Bill, Volume I') have had similar fates with their projects. Perhaps someday studio heads will understand when they are working with genius, or at least cut a little slack to directors who have made them plenty of money and have a good track record as was the case with Paramount and Miramax with the aforementioned films. Of course, the more likely scenario is that things will remain the same and artists who make studios millions will be asked `what have you done for us lately?'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jill McBain comes to town and finds her husband and his three children dead.They have been gunned down by three desperadoes.A man who they call Harmonica comes to protect the widow from a villain called Frank. C'era una volta il West, also known as Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) is a spaghetti western from the master Sergio Leone.This epic western tale has the most amazing actors.Henry Fonda's performance as Frank is really something to remember.Claudia Cardinale as Jill is wonderful.Jason Robards plays Cheyenne and he does it brilliantly.Charles Bronson does a very memorable role work as Harmonica. Unfortunately this great actor passed away last August but his movies will live on.You can also see appearances from Woody Strode as Stony and Keenan Wynn as Flagstone sheriff.You just couldn't miss with such a cast and they didn't.The result is an ultimate western drama classic which still works as good as it worked 35 years ago.For many youngsters today this movie may be too slow and I think that's a shame.Too many of them want to see those fast paced action movies with cool car chases.And they don't make movies like this anymore.Many movie makers think too much of the teens when they're making movies.I'm still young myself.I'm 22 and I'm not saying I can't enjoy these modern fast paced action flicks.But I need something else once in a while.I suggest you watch these movies.Leone's virtuosic direction, close shots from the face, superb acting and Ennio Morricone's masterful music make this movie something special.The movie starts great and ends even better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie on DVD after overwhelming recommendations by people on this site and because I have always had a fondness for Sergio Leone. Once Upon a Time in the West is a terrific film. In fact, I would go as far as saying it is one of the greatest of all time. Each frame seems to have a beautiful feel to it. Leone said he lost 5 years of his life on every film he created and it is apparent as to why with the attention paid to every scene. I love Once Upon a Time in America and the Dollar trilogy, but this is, in my opinion, Leone's greatest work. I would recommend that any fan of the genre, especially the Dollar trilogy, to check this film out. I found it to be much more moving. I loved the showdown in For a Few Dollars More, but I think the final gunfight between Harmonica and Frank is the best in any film of this kind. Fonda is a terrific villain, with his bright blue eyes and cold stare. Eastwood is the man and will never be topped when it comes to an unafraid, fast-drawing western hero, but I think Bronson was well cast instead of him in this film.It takes the greatest aspects of the Dollar films and creates one film that almost brings me to tears, not because it emotionally moves me, but because its craftsmanship is so splendid.</fullReview>

Well, to my surprise, this one beat out that trilogy: Fist, For and The Good.I believe that the favorite directorial technique that Leone used, deep focus, extreme facial close-ups and wide vistas is what makes this film visually. Of course, this "opera" of westerns is said to be 40% music; unheard of up until when this movie was made (and even now essentially). The Morricone sound is vital as is the visuals, and together with fine actors like Henry Fonda (as a bad guy), Bronson and even Jack Elam (who steals the beginning of the movie) make this film now one of my favorites. I bought the DVD on a whim and am glad I did.This movie is slow paced and is for "intelligent" viewers who want more than non-stop, mindless action and violence. The close-up studies on actors' faces are so telling of what the West was really like, and when there is violence/death, it is a non-gratuitous type.I definitely recommend this DVD. My favorite special feature was the "Then and Now" stills taken during the filming and similar views of the same sites taken recently. The documentaries are valuable, but a bit repetitive in what is said. Good music, good visuals, good directing - a true classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone's Homage to the American Western!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Once Upon a Time in the West" is arguably Director Sergio Leone's best movie. Having established himself with North American audiences with the Clint Eastwood "Dollars" trilogy (1964-66), he creates here a homage to the American western complete with Monument Valley locations and recognizable American actors in the leading roles. This film has to be seen in widescreen at is full 165 minute running time to be fully appreciated. Leone creates breath taking panoramic shots using John Ford's favorite Monument Valley locations. And there's that beautiful haunting score by Ennio Morricone within which, there are framed. And the opening sequence at the railway station seems to be a tip of the hat to High Noon" (1952), as well. The story begins with the McBain family on a ranch in the middle of nowhere, being slaughtered by a gang of outlaws led by the cold-hearted tobacco spewing Frank (Henry Fonda). The reason for this carnage is not made known until much later. Meanwhile three of Frank's gunmen including Woody Strode and Jack Elam are awaiting the arrival of a stranger, known only as "Harmonica" (Charles Bronson), because of the eerie theme that he plays before speaking. Leone adds a couple of nice touches that break the tension in this sequence. First there is a hilarious encounter between Elam and a persistent fly and Strode standing under a leaky roof letting the drops land on his hat and then drinking the water. Anyway, it seems that McBain (Frank Wolf) had taken a wife while in New Orleans and was awaiting her arrival at the time of his murder. The bride, Jill (Claudia Cardinale) arrives and learns of the tragedy and goes to the ranch. Meanwhile at a trading post, we meet the bandit "Cheyenne" (Jason Robards) who has been blamed for the massacre and is being pursued by the law. While there, he meets Harmonica and it turns out they are on the same side but for different reasons. Jill it seems has a "past" and already knows both Frank and Cheyenne. She figures out the reason for the massacre. Railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzatti) was after the ranch because there is water underneath the land. He sent Frank to murder the McBain's dressed like Cheyenne's gang. And, Harmonica also has a bone to pick with Frank. Amid a few double crosses, a few gunfights and a final showdown everything is sorted out. The casting of Fonda as the chief villain, was stroke of genius. Cast against type as a cold hearted henchman with no feelings, he gives a chilling performance. (Omigod was that Henry Fonda who shot down that kid?). Bronson, who would achieve major stardom as the result of this role, is perfect as the silent hero. Robards turns in his usual good performance as Cheyenne, however his character really adds little to the plot. Cardinale, who was a major star in European and American films at the time, is totally miscast as the heroine. Her accent is inappropriate for this role. Ferzatti turns in an excellent performance as the greedy but crippled and dying Morton. And look for Lionel Stander and Keenan Wynn in brief cameo roles as well. One could easily see Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach in the roles played by Bronson, Fonda and Robards respectively, and reportedly Leone originally wanted them, but it is now hard to imagine anyone else in the parts. One of the best westerns of all time, Leone's masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest western ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...perhaps. I can say, however, that Henry Fonda is a great bad ass bad guy, Jason Robarbs is solid as always, and Charles Bronson is the coolest dude to ever walk the face of the earth. "Once Upon a Time in the West" features some of the greatest visuals ever put on screen and Leone blends them perfectly with Morricone's excellent score. This movie is much better than "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" in my opinion. The difference is that the acting here is almost all top notch with Bronson, Fonda and Robarbs acting circles around Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef (Eli Wallach was good though). If you haven't seen "Once Upon a Time in the West", see it now. Classic film! 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE GREATEST WESTERN EVER MADE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw "Once Upon a Time in the West" I was about 14 and didn't really get it. I thought it was cool for sure, but also slow-moving and almost eccentric. Then I saw it again a couple of years later and I suddenly realized the pacing was part of what made it great and the "eccentricity" was beautiful story-lines, brilliant acting and last but not least: in-your-face first rate, high class, a cut above the rest, cool and classy dialogue.Then I didn't get a chance to see the movie for a couple of years, and all that time it lingered in the back of my mind. The scenes, the composition of the cinematography and the music haunted me, the hair on my arms stood up just thinking about the evocative beauty of the film, and finally when I got the chance to see it for the third time: POW! It finally emerged, dawned on me that this wasn't just Sergio Leone's greatest film ever, it was the best western movie ever made!John Ford, Anthony Mann and Howard Hawks will have to forgive me, but Sergio Leone really plays like a "Best of Western", a "Greatest Hits" collection of everything that makes a good western great. And since this is what Leone originally intended with his movie it is quite amazing to realize that he managed to full-fill this dream to such an impossible degree. His second greatest western, "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is wonderful, and truly one of the coolest additions to the genre, but as you grow up "Once Upon a Time in the West" is the mother of them all, a mature tribute told with a beauty and grace that would have most masterpieces pale in comparison.And since I'm not alone telling people that ONE MISERABLE VIEWING IS NOT ENOUGH, it is apparent that the movie is like fine wine that only gets better with age. See it again. And then see it again. When you've seen it again, you go and see it again. And see it in all it's wide-screen glory, the way it was intended. Then let the movie play in the back of your mind for a couple of years, then see it again and look back on your first reaction with shame. I feel this so strongly that I won't even bother getting into a discussion on the film unless they have seen it at least three times (and I do not mean back-to-back on the same night, don't force yourself, let the movie come to you)!The way this revenge-story develops into a moving showdown between the old and the new west, and how it leads to the most gripping show-down in the history of movies gives me goose bumps just thinking about it. And the music... oh the music... With the movie Leone turns a standard western-plot into an original masterpiece almost singlehandedly through stunning visuals - the wide-screen shots are enough to take your breath away - and the film-maker's talent for resting just long enough with each of his captivating frame before moving on to the next will blow your mind. The way he mixes the art of moving pictures with entertainment is so impressive it will leave you in dumb-struck. Unlike in "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" here EVERY character - not just the ones in the title - have become legends.Anyone who has seen the film can never forget it's brilliant, long opening sequence with the three gunmen waiting for the train to arrive, a wind-mill moving slowly in the background. Jack Elam trying not to pay notice of the fly bugging him, Woody Strode in all his beautiful glory just standing there - collecting water in his hat - looking mean. All the time Ennio Morricone's legendary music luring patiently in the background, and then suddenly... the train is heard approaching... the scene is every bit amusing as it is terrifying.Originally Leone wanted Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef from "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" to play the gunmen in this scene. Leone wanted to show the world that he had matured as a film-maker, and wanted to get rid of the past in a wonderful way that sadly never was to be (Eastwood was away working on another project). That sums it up doesn't it? When even Leone himself felt the other three movies was just a mere warm-up to this one. But sadly "Once Upon a Time in the West" would flop at the box office, and only slowly getting the recognition it so highly deserved, whether it be through filmmakers like Robert Rodriguez and Tarantino acknowledging how much the movie influenced them, or just through normal movie-buffs discovering all it's glory and splendor over time. Remember, even movies like "Vertigo" and "Singin' in the Rain" weren't considered box-office hits in it's days, it took time, and now it's about high time some so-called movie-lovers get their head out of the sand and realize what they have missed, now that it is finally out on DVD in exhilarating, crisp picture quality.I could keep on using words like mesmerizing, breathtaking, spellbinding, enchanting, but when push comes to shove this is one of those few movies where words don't do it justice, just EXPERIENCE it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Along with being in the opening scene of this movie actor Jack Elam was in "high noon" the movie that many feel the idea of the train station scene came from.Also in "high noon" there was someone playing the harmonica at the train station like in ouatitw .This time it was one of the bad guys played by none other than "Lee Van Cleef". Personally this movie is not only my favorite western , it may be my favorite movie of all time.There is one part though I make a habit of fast forwarding.It's the scene of Frank and Jill in the sack,it seems so out of place.Frank has killed her husband/husband to be and family but for some reason she looks to be totally enthralled with him.The joyful look on her face continues even while he talks bad to her.This scene may of been made to attract more box office,otherwise it seems to have nothing to do with this masterpiece.Frank is in character in the scene but jill is somewhat of a mystery.The cutting room floor would of seem the proper place to preserve this scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate western. Bar none.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening sequence of this film alone marks it as something special; three gunmen wait in a train station, with amplified natural sounds somehow adding to the tension. As a scene it just *works* better than anything I've seen in any other western - including Sergio Leone's other stuff.Then there's the brilliant characters, especially Claudia Cardinale's almost madonna-like ex-prostitute, and Charles Bronson as the odd geezer with the Harmonica (to quote "He doesn't just play. He can shoot"). Unlike most westerns, this film actually has a plot, and only really lets you get a handle on it near the end.Finally, there's the soundtrack. This is definitely Ennio Morricone's finest work. Every scene just *fits*, whether serious or comical (and there's a little of both).Oh, and there's a standoff scene (but you'll have to watch it to find out where) that's better than even the end of "a few dollars more".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone's masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of the comments here draw comparisons with Leone's other westerns, namely the misnomered Dollars trilogy (the only common thread was Eastwood as lead). Once Upon A Time is actually a continuation of Leone's exploration of the American frontier. It's also his most hopeful film leaving the audience with the message that the time for gunslinging is over and where nation building must begin - Cardinale delivering water to the railway workers. The beauty of the film is in the conflicted way it tells us this; like Peckinpah's Wild Bunch, Frank and Harmonica know their time is up and there's a huge mutual respect between them in their final duel. I don't think I've ever seen a duel like it: absolutely supercharged with emotion. I do agree that the film could have used a cut here or there but I'm not sure where as there isn't a scene I can think of that doesn't push the story forward. I'd love to have seen Eastwood doing Harmonica but Bronson fills in well. As for Fonda, one of the best pieces of counter-casting I've seen. Pure cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>West at it's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best westerns ever made in my opinion. The slow tempo might be offputting to some, but I myself enjoyed it. Sergio Leone's use of rhytm is unique and works so well with Morricone's soundtrack, that the result is close to perfect.However westerns as a genre are not the most fulfilling of movies for me. Still, my hat off to Sergio Leone. The only name that I can associate with such quality in this genre is, not surprisingly, Clint Eastwood. That is not to say there are no other great westerns, but for some reason my favourites all feature either or the other in some capacity.However much I might admire the work of Eastwood, I'm no less impressed by the lead performances in this movie. An excellent viewing pleasure all around, but maybe for the more patient audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is such a brilliant one. Everything about this movie is excellent. The acting is just amazing with great actors as Henry Fonda in his best role ever as the evil eyed villian Frank, Charles Bronson who plays a fantastic role as good guy Harmonica, Jason Robards who played the part as the gangleader Cheyenne and Claudia Cardinale who played the role of widow Jill McBain (One of the best female roles ever).The story makes the movie a masterpiece. This movie is a special western because you see a dark side of the west, actually this movie comes close to a dramatic thriller and that makes it different than many other westerns. In this one there are no more words spoken than necessary. In place of using long speeches the story of this movie is mainly told by music and impressions of the face of the actors.The music of once upon a time in the west is one of the best music scores a movie ever has. Even the characters have there own music and after you have seen this movie it stays in your head a couple of days.The movie has some great shots like the opening scene, the scene when the McBain family gets killed, the scene on the train, the scene in the town and the final shot between Frank and Harmonica.This movie is a must seen for everyone and I don`t get why it isn`t in the top 10 of IMDB.10/10 for this masterpiece</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once Upon A Time Vs Good, Bad, Ugly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe that The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly still retains the status as the best of Leone's western films.Alas, Once Upon A Time In The West comes in second place. It's good, but GBU is better.The first problem:Henry Fonda doesn't make it as a sinister villain. I cannot understand why he was cast in this role. For example, his bed scene with Cardinale and threatening to murder her is hardly convincing.The not-so silent Charles Bronson can't replace silent Clinton Eastwood. Whenever Bronson eerily plays his harmonica before killing, I think of Clint quietly lighting up a cigar before his shootouts. Comparing the two, I prefer Eastwood's portrayal.Jason Robards saves the day. He provides a realistic, humorous grit that isn't found in the Bronson and Fonda characters.The second problem:There's too much soap in this opera. I find this film too maudlin, sentimental for my tastes.Leone's first three movies were realistic, surrealistic or nihilistic. Either way, there's no trace of sentimentality.Claudia Cardinale feminine role, creating and maintaining a homestead, is not found in the earlier films. There seems to be a socialized or femininized meaning to society, a future to be had, unlike the earlier films.Analysis:Once Upon A Time In The West is a different kind of film from the three predecessors.It borrows elements from the first three films, but has a different meaning in the end. Its not the solely male-eat-male world as before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take a good look at the long shots!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This great movie is sometimes called slow. In my opinion it can not be long enough. Not all movies should be over in 90 minutes, while others are already boring from the first minute. It is clear that this movie is of the first category. Sergio Leone really took time for beautiful shots. Watch the scene in which Claudia Cardinale gets out of the train carefully. The shot starts when she gets out, and continues when she walks over the platform, through the railway station building, and out of it on the other side. All in one shot!!! The MTV-ation of the cinema is not always a good thing. It sometimes makes it more exciting, but the truly long, good shots should never be forgotten. Of course the long shots of Sergio Leone are backed up by the stunning music of the great composer Ennio Moricone. I know of no better director/composer duo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>C'era una volta il West: My redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"C'era una volta il West", also known as "Once Upon a Time in the West" changed my life and became my redemption. I was chocked that a film could be as good as this. It influenced my opinions and thoughts about film in general. "C'era una volta il West" is maybe the most stunning film I have ever seen.This is perhaps Sergio Leone´s most advanced film, filled with references to other famous Westerns such as "The Searchers", "Rio Bravo", "How the West Was Won" and his own dollar-films, but the biggest influence are from "High Noon", "Shane" and "Johnny Guitar".I think that "How the West Was Won" had the biggest impact for the making of this film, this is like a remake of the MGM-film but in an artistic way with a more complex and twisted script, narrated in a much more complex way and with a more stylish direction, all with the Morricone and the Leone touch, with less respect for the history books but more for the Western-genre and with the highest ambition to have personal style which "How the West Was Won" never had. It is also much more like a John Ford-Western than Leone´s other Westerns.Every scene in "C'era una volta il West" has the highest intense, with some of the coolest quotes ever. The two best scenes has Ennio Morricone's great theme "Man With a Harmonica".Should be seen in it's original widescreen format.Rating: 10 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though the good, the bad and the ugly is the best known spaghetti western, this one is I believe the most achieved work. Also, it is aging well, still fantastic to watch (it's missing the 5.1 sound though :).If you decide to watch this movie, get ready in the first scene to see time stop... waiting for the train... and the beginning of the story. If you're still restless after the 1st scene, stop right there and only return to this movie a day when you're mellow and ready to enjoy it. Don't rush that one...It's less of a farce and more a beautiful story with carefully crafted characters than the other westerns. It actually makes me feel somehow melancolic and nostalgic. There is of course some self derision in all characters but they're not as clownesque as in the other Sergio westerns. The characters all have simple dreams making them weak. Those often end-up shattered, making you feel for them, even the bad guys.There's a slew of fantastic actors with fantastic parts (Fonda, Claudia Cardinale, Bronson, Jason Robards) Even actors that get little air time have amazing characters developments, and they all act very well.The music is awesome, even the silences are grandiose.The cinematography is beautiful, and exploit the sets shots and the (usual) unusual face/body shots typical of Sergio's westerns very well.The movie's suspense is very typical; with the famous flashbacks activated by a recurring music. The heroes are desillusioned making them the strongest characters. They also have qualities like being ice cold, cunning or sharp, and very similar to the bad guys. Gunfighters with a code of ethics.Other Sergio Leones: Once upon a time in America with DeNiro, even though I prefer the 1st part of that movie where he doesn't play. Other westerns: My Name Is Nobody is cool though more trivial...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My history with this film *possible spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I once read somewhere that every film fan has that one film, seen by accident, usually on TV at some obscure hour, that just changes the way they view films for all time. Personally, I have two: Michael Lehmann's darkest of dark comedies "Heathers", and what may be the greatest of Sergio Leone's three masterpieces, "Once Upon A Time in the West".One fine Saturday afternoon in 1997, I was eagerly anticipating a family road trip, and being the first ready, switched on the television to kill some time. The station that came up was a classic movie station on cable, and "OUATITW" was the film that was showing, about two minutes into that beautifully staged opening credit sequence. Like so many others before me, I'm sure, I watched spellbound as the action unfolded, and being the student of film I am, made sure to take in the director credit. I watched, hypnotized and perplexed, wondering where all this was heading. I was 17 years old at the time and was used to the current film-making style of not wasting a second, and this apparent time wasting had me intrigued.And then, as the train pulled away and I heard for the first time the chilling harmonica salvo so synonymous with the film, I immediately understood. Revenge. And the simple, reply from Bronson after being told that his three seedy chaperone's didn't bring a horse for him: "You brought two too many", I was thinking the dude was some western superman.And then he got shot! Brilliant. Maybe this hero isn't as invincible as he thinks he is. I ran from the room and grabbed my precious Leonard Maltin Film and Video Guide and looked up the film. I was hooked.I didn't see all the film that day, but next time it was shown I taped myself a copy and have seen it may times since. It remains a film as great for it's parts as for it's whole. Charles Bronson's strong silent routine, Hank Fonda's cold villain, gradually killing his way toward a profound catharsis, Jason Robards' lovable rogue, a part he played to perfection, and the impossibly beautiful Claudia Cardinale, holding the piece together as a great female lead, although her role diminishes as the film rolls on.And then there are the set-pieces. Of course, the opening credit sequence, an extremely tense scene in a bizarre roadhouse, Robards' exciting rescue of Bronson from a train, and the final Bronson/Fonda shootout, so protracted it puts The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly to shame.Before I saw this film, I had absolutely DESPISED westerns. "Old man movies" I called them. After seeing it, I began actively researching them, trying to watch only the best, the most classic, and the most influential. Of all the westerns I have now seen, only Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch, and Leone's own The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly come close to this remarkable masterpiece.</fullReview>

Charles Bronson is always top perfect in a western, and Jason Robards was fantastic as a grungy gang leader. Claudia Cardinal. Need I say more. The story is excellent, and Leone's direction is never at fault. While Morricone is not known for this score, it is quite good and fitting as always. It all just adds up to a perfect film in my eyes. On a side note, nobody builds up tension prior to a shootout like Leone. See The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly for another perfect example.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Western Opera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Once upon a time in the West" is not a Western as you may think. It is a living breathing visual and audio delight. Its scenes are staged as grand opera and ballet. The characters dance together and sing. Their voice is their guns. At one point "Cheyenne" (Jason Roberts), asks Harmonica (Charles Bronson). Can you play? It is obvious that Harmonica is the best player out there and he proves it throughout the movie. Now, this is a Leone film so the Western Hollywood image is once again shattered, if there was anything left after "The Good the bad and the ugly". The elements of that film are here as well. There is "The Good" (Bronson), "The Bad" (Henry Fonda) and "The Ugly" (Roberts). But here there is additions. We have less dialogue and more characters. The bad has a boss (Mortimer). There is a love interest (Claudia Cardinel), who interests all three of our protagonists. Yet this is told smoothly and beautifully, not through words, but though images and music. How? Well first of all Marconi (the composer), wrote the music before the script as written. Scenes were put together to match each music piece and not the other way around. Each character is given a music score. So when he appears, before he appears, you know he is there just because you here his music. It gives each of the three a larger then life aura that is unparalleled in other films of its kind. This is the Leone West. True gritty, dirty. Not much water and true to form a bath becomes an event. The Wild west has space and Leone's camera shows us this space. In between we see all of the poor haggard Chinese who built the railroad. We see them suffer in the background and nobody, including the good and the angelic love interest cares. That was what it was like and Leone makes a point. A brilliant point to the film is the casting of Fonda as the evil dark Frank. We seem him at the start doing evil and I will not spoil this scene for you, except to say that in 1968 audiences sat in the movie theater and gasped "Oh my god it is Henry Fonda!" Yes blue eyes himself. Bronson at the time of this films making was known as a non-attractive Heavy. Here he is the dirty dark eyed unshaven HERO! This works to pull us in to the feel of the film. The music the visuals. Each scene develops slowly. Even the action scenes. But we are enthralled. The character dance to Marcone's tune and with each other. They dance until the conclusion, which gives a feeling of beginning. This was the West as legend and life and how it started. This was the reason we like to see the West in the Cinema.Leone has once again created an art house film for all. Bravo Maestro.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That about sums it up. O.K. I am not unbiased. Once upon... is one of my all time favorites. There is that "coming of age" feel to it and that "way larger than life" feel. Its epic concept would easily lead to a pretentious movie but Sergio Leone just created the western that influenced all westerns after it. I like the classic American western with all "clean shirts" and full of ethics (for example "Last trains from Gunhill") but the more realistic (if we can call it that) and complex approach of the Leone westerns are more my cup of tea.Attention: spoilers ahead:I didn't read all user comments or Forum posts, maybe this is redundant: Check the harmonica in the flashback sequence during the showdown. It changes its shape from shot to shot. But back in 1968 no one was there with a laptop computer to check continuity. So it's excused.End of spoilersWell, Once upon... is one of the all time greats IMHO. Yes, the casting is perfect, so is Morricone's score. But it's that "coming of age" and that "end of an era" feel that makes is so great. My favorite scene is when Hank Fonda is riding on his horse to meet his destiny (=Bronson) and that wonderfully played trumpet solo that says more than a thousand words.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Leone's last and best ever Western. Therefore, it is the best western ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'I wouldn't say when you've seen one Western you've seen the lot; but when you've seen the lot you get the feeling you've seen one.' Katharine Whitehorn Sunday Best (1976) The traditional accusation is that Once upon a Time in the West offers nothing new to the genre but merely replays highlights from his previous classic Western movies. This is, however, a simple evaluation demonstrating a simple prejudice against the director or the genre. It is not a true evaluation of the film itself which is a stunning melodrama filmed in breathtaking manner, garnished with stars (including Claudia Cardinale, Henry Fonda, Jason Robards, Charles Bronson, Keenan Wynn and Western movie favourite Jack Elam) and, to top it all off perfectly, one of the greatest film scores ever written from Ennio Morricone. While it is astonishing in hindsight to note that this masterpiece from one of cinema's most talented directors was not even nominated for the Best Picture Oscar (the dreary and inexplicably popular musical [Oliver!] won), it borders on criminal that Morricone's incredible score was not nominated either (it was won by [The Lion in Winter]). As seems typical of masterpieces, they simply are not appreciated in their own time but masterpiece this is. Given that Leone also directed all three of the 'Dollars' trilogy ([A Fistful of Dollars], [For a Few Dollars More] and [The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]), it is truly remarkable that this movie proved to be even better. There are very few films that can claim to be the greatest Western of all time and this is one of the strongest contenders. I would probably shortlist [For a Few Dollars More], [The Good, the Bad and the Ugly], [High Noon], [The Magnificent Seven] and [The Shootist] in the search for the best Western of all time. Leone also directed the first two of that list and the star of this movie, Charles Bronson, also appeared in [The Magnificent Seven]. However, Once Upon a Time in the West is, in my opinion, even better than all those films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1981, a few weeks after my 16 th birthday I had great luck, 'cause "Once a time in the west" (Spiel mir das Lied vom Tod in Germany - Play the song of death for me) this movie had been played in our local cinema. A waited a lot of years so that I was allowed to see this 16 rated movie. And I saw it 3 times in one week and than every time it was in cinema since then (and in the eighties it was every summer for a few days in our local cinema, and every time it was sold out). There are less movies I saw that often then "in the West". Every time it's a party for the eyes and the soul, even when it's in TV not as good than on cinema. As many people told before, Ennio Morricone made one of the best score ever. It's funny, that he wrote the score before Leone made the first picture of the movie. After Leone told him the story, Morricone wrote the music. And during the working on the movie Leone played the music for his actors. I hope they soon will publish a DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sergio Leone set out to create the ultimate western here, and succeeded. Combining pieces from all of the great westerns that preceded it, he made a one of a kind film. Showing the natural progression from his first three westerns to here, he more or less takes a lot of the same themes and ideas from those and pulled them together. More epic and operatic than `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,' and without the lightheartedness that gave that film it's undeniable uniqueness. Instead, Leone focuses more on the dark side of the west, and the dark side of human nature as well. The four main players, Charles Bronson, Henry Fonda, Jason Robards, and Claudia Cardinale, all give the performances of the lifetime. From a filmmaking standpoint, few movies have ever been so perfect ? the combination of gorgeous cinematography, incredible music, and the sheer style are second to none. A true masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Sergio Leone Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Once Upon a Time in the West" is an epic Western and probably the best film Sergio Leone ever directed. Whereas "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly" and several others of the "Spaghetti Western" genre were mainly played for laughs, this film is deadly earnest in its intent and execution. The casting of Henry Fonda as the villian (Frank) is a brilliant stroke and the rest of the actors, including Charles Bronson and Claudia Cardinale, are also excellent in their roles. The plot centers on the coming of the Railroad and the beginning of the end of the West as many knew it. This transformation effects all the characters but especially Bronson and Fonda, who are deadly enemies for reasons unknown until the end of the movie. The fact that Fonda's character has no idea why he is being hunted by Bronson is central to the story and keeps the viewer on edge throughout. The supporting cast is also excellent, headed by Jason Robards playing a good-natured gunman, and Gabriel Ferzetti as a Railroad Magnate and chief architect of the New Age of Progress. The haunting and brilliant musical score by Ennio Morricone only heightens the suspense and action. This movie is a must-see for all Western buffs and anyone interested in one-of-a-kind film making. "Once Upon a Time in the West" is a classic film in the truest sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is so much about this film that is great, one hardly knows where to begin. Fonda's performance as perhaps the vilest villain to grace the screen went far beyond Oscar caliber, Claudia Cardinale removed forever the stigma of being known as a B Italian actress with the remainder of the cast comprised of no less than the finest character actors of the time.Leone in a grand style put forth a nitty gritty daily existence giving a sense of how the real West must truly have been. Yet throughout maintained a mythical quality so necessary to the telling of these stories. For the opening and settling of the West is the stuff of legend.That it was an instant classic is not the case, as it was not lauded in the United States at first, although Europeans loved it. It was considered too long and probably too wordy for the average American moviegoer. However, there were many, myself included, who knew upon leaving the theater that they had seen a masterpiece.Dario Argnto's script was unexpected and quite simply remarkable. And what could we say about this film if Ennio Marricone's exquisite score was not mentioned - music so haunting it brings you to tears when heard.</fullReview>

The fly in the face of the bandit and the way that it killed are hilarious and strong at the same time. Harmonica (character of Bronson) reveal the duality of personality, usual in Leone's films.

		<fullReview>Here's the history of this great score. Based on an early script by Bernardo Bertolucci, which was later scrapped, though he still gets credit, Morricone composed the whole score before one foot of film was shot. Leone took bare bones recordings to the set so the actors could act to the music. But Leone hated one cue: for Cheyennes's character, in fact, he called it "s**t". During the final recording sessions, Leone discussed the Disney movie LADY AND THE TRAMP with Morricone, saying that Cheyenne was like the Tramp: a scamp, a rogue, but down deep a good guy. Morricone sat at a piano and, after a few minutes thought, started to play the staccato notes we now hear in the movie for Cheyenne's character. Leone was ecstatic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Yes, yes, it will be magical!" - Dib, "Invader Zim" **Spoilers to the plot**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. That's what I have to say. In my review of "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly" (if it gets posted), I've already commented upon Sergio Leone's films and their look and feel. This is my second favorite film ever. (*SPOILERS*) The film takes a very simple plot - settlers vs. the railroad - and twists it in all sorts of directions. Leone (and Ennio Morricone) create an unforgetable atmosphere with the authentic guns, trains, and leather dusters. The creaking wind mill in the opening scene is a brilliant touch. I would believe that this was meant by Leone to be a pastiche of the American westerns. All the stereotypes are there - the good-hearted prostitute, the lone, silent hero, the scraggly, helpful outlaw, the man in black who mows down innocent families. Leone gives nods to dozens of Westerns, including "Rio Bravo", "High Noon" (in the opening scene and the shootout in Flagstone between Frank and his men), "Jubal", "Shane", "The Searchers", "Fort Apache" (Henry Fonda as the bad guy), "The Man Who Shot Liberty Vallance", "How The West Was Won" - and yet, it is shockingly original. Nothing is as it seems. The plot contains a ghost story, superb performances, Morricone's haunting theme, and some of the best shootouts ever filmed. The final scene is haunting and touching at the same time. Fonda isn't really as shocking as you'd expect him to be, but he's good. Charles Bronson rehearses his role as the vigilante in the "Death Wish" films, among others. Jason Robards was never an A-List actor, but his performance as Cheyenne is superb. Claudia Cardinale is beautiful and extremely tanlented, as she shows here in the difficult role of Jill McBain. Cameos by Western veterans Jack Elam, Woody Strode, and Keenan Wynn (along with Lionel Stander) are enjoyable as well. Gabrielle Ferzetti is also notable as Mr. Morton, the railroad tycoon. This was to be Leone's last Western, but the studios pressed him to make the disappointing (by his standards) "A Fistful of Dynamite" before finally commencing work on his magnum opus, "Once Upon A Time In America". Nonetheless, this is a superb film. What more needs to be said? "I saw three of these dusters a short time ago, they were waiting for a train. Inside these three dusters were three men. And inside the men were three bullets." - Harmonica</fullReview>

So readers of this review - I apologise for boring you but I agree with them.I'll limit my comments to two of cinema's most memorable scenes. First, the vertical panning of the camera up and over the station when Cardinale arrives, revealing a thriving developing city in contrast to the apparent deserted rail-side. Second, and related to the first, the final shot with the railroad arriving from the east whilst Bronson rides off to the west, signifying the end of the "old" frontier mentality.Brilliant in every way, unless, of course, you like your Westerns old-style Hollywood (ie no need to think).

		<shortDescription>Many classic scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are more than enough descriptions and adjectives in the other reviews, so I won't add more. I just want to remind viewers to catch the entire movie. Many people seem to start watching the movie when Henry Fonda and his gang gun down the family (including the children). The real beginning features some of the most classic scenes in not only westerns, but all of movie history. The scene starts in a dusty train station. A grizzled ticket agent is counting his money when the door opens. He looks up and sees a pair of dusty boots. The camera pans up past a sawed off rifle to the hardened face of Woody Strode (Sergeant Rutledge, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Spartacus, The Professionals). Soon we also see two more men, including Jack Elam. Looking on is a worried Indian maiden (played by Strode's wife, Luana, a real-life Hawaiian princess). The trio of gunmen go out to the platform to wait for the train. Elam uses his gun to play around with a buzzing fly. Strode waits under a water tower, which drips water onto the brim of his hat. Director Sergio Leone improvised because he didn't expect the tower to leak, so he had Strode take off the hat and drink the water from the brow in a scene now considered an instant classic. The train arrives and the gunmen don't see Bronson, so they start walking away until they hear a harmonica. They turn to see the train pull away and Bronson on the other side of the tracks. He has a harmonica in his left hand and a satchel in his right. Bronson: Did you bring a horse for me? Elam: It seems we're one horse shy. Bronson: Actually, you brought two too many.With that, Strode's evil grin disappears. The satchel drops, guns go up and shots get fired. All four men go down and we just see a windmill in the background. Is it the end of the movie? Is everyone dead? Will we see the film in flashback?That's what really caught my eye when I first saw the movie. Fonda's appearance later helped cement it for me, especially when one of his henchmen calls out his character's name and asks what they should do about the little boy who survives their massacre of his family. Fonda calmly and coolly replies "Well, seeing as how you used my name..." before shooting the kid.A great movie and a great tribute to Hollywood's great western history.</fullReview>

Now; in my top 5 all time favorite westerns. The west was boring to live in; Hey! Let's face it! Time passed slowly, Toils we take for granted nowadays took...well...sometimes took awhile. The framework Leone creates establishes: the mythic super hero/villains with clever dialogue and snappy editing (how many Hollywood directors would have NOT had the guts; to film Jason Robards entrance in a way that showed his arrival instead of hearing the chaos he creates outside the trading post - a very understated funny scene). This movie is crammed with so much wit, I'm restrained to reprint any of the one (or two) liners at the expense of leaving out any of the others. The cast for the most part is brilliant with Robards, Fonda and yes, even Bronson standing out.And this was all before I finally caught the wide screen version which is outstandingg; (Criminal to show the pan &amp; scan version).The dying West as it was? Ambition coupled with ruthlessness! Good guys don't always win...and the good girls don't either. But whoever said that Claudia Cardinal's 'Jill' was good! She was at the right place at the right time and according to Leone, the seeds of civilization are built on her foundation. A more truthful rendition than other glossed over western tales.And the music is terribly funny...loved it!9 out of 10</fullReview>

It's too bad more directors don't follow Sergio's lead here and give their films so much feeling and atmosphere. All done with a fly, dripping water and some creaking wood. To end the fabulous opening, the line "No. You brought two too many!", gives you an suspenseful anticipation of what is to come next.My favourite western movie by far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's left to say about this incredible western? As usual, each character have his or her own musical theme, but--not as usual-- the themes combine in ways that indicate the interactions and symbolism of each character. Harmonica and Frank are emotionally and thematically joined at the hip. Their themes intertwine just as their life lines do. Cheyenne's theme, which can be, at different times, either comical or threatening, reflects his outmoded lifestyle, which we see being replaced by the lifestyle of the town folk. Jill is the whore who becomes the mother (or midwife) of the emerging civilization being born in the desert with the coming of the railroad. Her theme is also the theme of that civilization. Watch the scene where she leaves the railroad station, hires a driver and rides through the railroad town. This is not the archetypal western town of Hollywood with a saloon and a few horses tied up at the hitching post. It is a bustling, living entity, with shops, public transportation, respectable women and men going about their business. And Jill, although she comes from the "big city"--New Orleans--, is quite pleased by it all. By the end of the film, she will be the founder of the next town on the railroad's path. Relax, get to know each of the four major characters, listen to the music, and don't rush through it. This is an epic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Sergio Leone's quirky directing, to Ennio Morricone's vibrant score (you know, that one song the lady sings throughout the film), and somewhere inbetween a glorious script that shows us many characters, connected by circumstance and goodness, written by horror auteur Dario Argento, Once Upon a Time in the West is one of the finest films ever made.It's timelessness is overwhelming, considering it was shot in the sixties, and I saw it for the first time in the new millenium. The story is told with acting, not recitation. Each character is totally fleshed out to the end, every close up showing another outlook on things. Henry Fonda as a bad guy, sure, but we never really grasp how bad. Why Not? Because Fonda is so good in this brilliant role that it takes an entire film to actually not like his character.Jason Robards and Charles Bronson give some of the best performances of their lives, particularly Bronson. His face is so unaffected in one shot, and then utterly emotive the next. Bronson utterly emobodies "Harmonica" as he's known. His motives are unclear. Is he a just outlaw, or a marshall with a vendetta? Just who is he? Fonda's character wants to know as badly as we do.Robards provides the good man from a bad past story line. Sure, Cheyenne is a criminal, but deep down, he means well. He really does. So much to say about this film, where do I end it? I guess all I can say is that it is an extremely absorbing tale which will have you thinking for weeks to come. And for those film buffs out there who have actually taken a film course, this film is the perfect example of the Show don't Tell rule of cinema.</fullReview>

Just like my favourite movie, Stanley Kubrick's "2001-A space Odyssey" you become aware of the real meaning of going to a cinema: Not to hear endless mono-, dia-, or multilogs, but to see pictures; pictures never seen before, which you will remember even if you haven't seen it for years. Thus the few speaking passages are not this important, although you can say them from your heart after hearing them twice. They are meant for memorizing! And so is the entire picture!

		<fullReview>Take an extraordinary story, take about the best setting possible (monument valley), take the best actors of their time. Now imagine a famous director conducting. Add up to that sauce the best music score ever make, a music score that seems to have emerged from the rocks and the bushes of the desert.The mood is a the same time humoristic and tragic. No wonder this movie has been imitated dozens of times. I even participated in a play during high school 20 years ago. We were imitating them.I must have seen this movie ten times. It strikes me every time. Claudia Cardinal play the role of a vulnerable and weak victim but yet so seductive that she can buy some time from the brute who want to erase her. Her charm merit her to find 2 allies, Bronson and Robards. Bronson is there for a vengeance, Robards is the 'good' thief and cannot resist to help this irresistible woman.The setting is so good, you wish to be there and be part of this epic legend. One of the only movie I give 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply the best western ever made. One need not be a Leone fan to enjoy this one. It has it all--action sequences, gunfights, romance, and a mystery to unravel. Robards and Bronson are brilliant, Cardinale never looked so good, and Hank Fonda turns in the performance of a lifetime, and given his career, that's saying something, as perhaps the most memorable oater villain ever.One of my all time favorites. A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone's masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He made a mint out of his "Dollars" trilogy, and made Clint Eastwood a household name with them, but director Sergio Leone made his ultimate masterpiece with ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. Instead of just making a fourth "Dollars" film or turning it into a mere spaghetti oater, Leone created a very long but fitting elegy to the taming of the West. Released just shortly before Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, like the Peckinpah film, was unfortunately chopped by its distributor to allow for more showings in theaters, making it a critical and box office bomb. Since then, however, time has rectified this once-sad set of circumstances.Claudia Cardinale is a widow who comes out west to find out that her entire family has been slaughtered by gunmen hired by a railroad magnate (Gabrielle Ferzetti). Apparently, the spread that her husband had laid out is the starting base for building a new town, and that town is located over the only underground water for fifty miles in either direction, and it's a supply that Ferzetti wants for his railroad. Cardinale, of course, isn't willing to give it to him, at least not for free. Protecting her (but are they really?) are a lone gunman (Charles Bronson) and an outlaw (Jason Robards) wrongly sought by the law for the massacre of Cardinale's family. Looming very close in the picture (and looking to take over for Ferzetti) is that steely gunman, played with chilling perfection by Henry Fonda (!). And Bronson has a score to settle with Fonda, though we are left hanging as to what score that is until they have their final showdown.Shot partially in Spain (where Leone shot his previous spaghetti westerns) and in Monument Valley, the home of many a John Ford western, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is not exactly for those who want their action fast and furious. At nearly 2 hours and 45 minutes, it is very, very long. But Leone manages to cram a lot of things into that frame, and as usual he does so with another fabulous Ennio Morricone score. Tonino Delli Colli's cinematography is enormously impressive, shot in Technoscope to give Leone's trademark extreme close-ups a highly charged feel and to make the wide open spaces seem even wider than they are already.Leone gets very good performances from everyone (including veteran western heavyweights Jack Elam and Woody Strode in the film's 15-minute opening credits sequence, perhaps the longest such sequence anywhere), with Bronson's "Harmonica" character a perfect sub for Eastwood's "Man With No Name", Robards' half-breed bandit done brilliantly, and Cardinale essaying one of the best female roles in a western of any kind up to that point. Even more important, however, is how Leone managed to get Fonda, who almost never played heavies, to give what must stand as one of the most chilling villain performances in screen history. A sarcasm that we never thought was evident in the man evinces itself when he questions a henchman about the man's trustworthiness because he has trouble keeping his clothes on: "How can you trust a man who wears both a belt AND suspenders? The man can't even trust his own pants."Despite its extreme length, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is still a fascinating western epic after all these years. Rectifying the mistake it made when they chopped it up originally by putting Leone's final cut out on VHS and DVD, Paramount has had the good sense to give audiences of today a glimpse into one of the finest westerns ever made. For patient viewers who like a great story, great cast, and great direction, this film is the ticket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent, from the always-underrated, unique Sergio Leone direction, to the acting, to the story, to the always-excellent, passionate, haunting Ennio Morriconne (SP) music.I always liked this movie, first viewing it on television sometime before 1971 as a young lad.We also studied it in film class at Cal State Chico, 1981, myself writing the quiz. According to the highly-respectable instructor, the story goes that the three Clint Eastwood "Spaghetti Westerns" were so popular, that the movie studio gave Sergio Leone a blank check for what was considered a lot of money in those days, and said, essentially, "Go make the movie you want," and he made "Once Upon A Time In The West." I notice that this movie is not yet available on DVD but I have it on Laser Disc, (though it is currently in storage) and I think the full, 165-minute version."Keep your lovin' brother happy."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate Western - Once Upon a Time in the West (1968)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie opens. Three men are waiting at a deserted train stop appropriately located in the desert. They're hot, they're nasty, they're restless and bored. There's minimal action on the screen: one rocks a chair; another hunts a fly. For 15 minutes this continues: the tumbleweed rolls and they wait; the credits roll and you wait. Trying to imagine what will eventually happen, you look into the eyes on their hardened faces, trying to find some sign of a soul. Frustrated, you too become restless with anticipation, their anticipation.Suddenly, in the distance, you hear a train. As it stops, you examine the screen for the reason they're waiting. Are you looking for something good or something bad? You don't know. Then the train starts to move. Silently you yell at the train "Wait, I haven't found it yet!As the train exits stage right and out of view, you see a man on the other side of the tracks. He speaks to the three men:"Did you bring a horse for me?""Err... looks like we're shy of one horse..." comes the reply.Not at all surprised by the response, this kind and gentle man teaches the three some simple addition. "No. You brought two too many!"Sounds like something Mr. Eastwood might say, doesn't it? ("Get three coffins ready.") It should since this film is directed by Sergio Leone, the man who gave us Clint in "A Fistful of Dollars", "For a Few Dollars More", and "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" - the biggest hit film in the trilogy.With such an impressive portfolio, why did "Once Upon a Time in the West" fail to attract the attention it deserved when it hit theaters? Can the studio be blamed for mutilating the masterpiece? (It is a masterpiece, but how good was it before it was hacked?) Did audiences pass like Clint passing up the lead? (What about the drawing power of the stars?) Was America too full of spaghetti already? Who knows? Who cares?Sergio Leone created some of the most memorable westerns ever to hit the screen. He sparred us the whiskey drinkin', Injun killin', white-is-right sanitized version of the Duke's west (sans "The Shootist") and gave us the stubble and squint of Clint. Did he spend all his creativity on the opening scene? Had he taken the genre as far as it could go?No way! Think about his casting decisions, the haunting, soulful notes of the harmonica, the dialogue:* Henry Fonda playing the evil villain: "People scare easier when they're dyin'."* Jason Robards playing the good villian: "You remind me of my mother. She was the biggest whore in Alameda."* Charles Bronson as "The Man": "I saw three of these dusters today. Inside the dusters there were three men. Inside the men there were three bullets."Let's face it, you either like this stuff or you don't. If you like it, you won't find anything better. This movie doesn't need to be discussed, it must be felt. Period.If you feel the need to review something, review the reason it hasn't been released on DVD. There must be an original version hidden somewhere, and I want a copy. Don't you?Remember: Don't trust a man who wears both a belt and suspenders. The man can't even trust his own pants!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent operatic western, possibly the best of all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once Upon a Time in the West is arguably Sergio Leone's best work, and possibly the best western made.A revisionist western, the film examines the stereotypes of its genre through Claudia Cardinale's Jill McBain - who is far more than any other whore we've seen - and the three gunslingers (Fonda's Frank, Robard's Cheyenne and Bronson's Harmonica). Each of these characters has embedded within their portrayal a motivation for their actions. Where most western gunslingers simply are, these men are drawn with so much more detail.It is the mysterious motivation driving Bronson's character, for example, which drives a large part of the story, resulting in perhaps the most satisfying pay-off ever seen in cinema. It is hard to conceive how the showdown - and the rich history motivating it - at the end of this film could ever be eclipsed. In addition to this climax is one of cinema's most brilliantly executed entrances, equalled only by Orson Welles in The Third Man and possibly Max von Sydow's in The Exorcist. When the camera tracks forward and turns onto Fonda's face, we are witnessing cinematic perfection.Also of considerable note is Ennio Morricone's score. Truly dramatic, each of the four leads has his/her own musical motif which underscores their scenes. Jill slightly nostalgic, slightly mournful tune as she enters to be left alone on the station forces us to care for her, despite the fact that she has only been on screen for one minute. Bronson's famous Harmonica motif is (if a little over-used) unforgettable. Outstanding.There is barely a criticism to be made of Once Upon A Time in the West. Perhaps a little over-long depending on what mood you're in watching it, but this truly is unforgettable and unsurpassable cinema.</fullReview>

I can only compare it to my other favorite film Ridley Scott's, The Duellist. Another cinematic masterpiece. I just don't understand why Paramount won't release these two great films on DVD.

		<shortDescription>Even better than the Dollars trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This epic tale of bullish progress and the 'American Dream' is one of the greatest westerns ever made. After the famous 'Dollars' trilogy, Sergio Leone teams with Ennio Morricone once again to craft a masterful story of greed and revenge, coupled with an unforgettable soundtrack, and sprawling, naked landscapes.The actors more than deliver the goods, with Bronson handling the 'Man With No Name' role with seeming ease (his best film to date). Claudia Cardinale impresses as the widowed landowner, bringing a neccessary human element to the film, as does Jason Robards as the sympathetic outlaw trying to redeem himself. It's Henry Fonda, however, who almost carries the film away - his villain totally unscrupulous and stomach-churningly nasty.One of the few films to make me cry - the soundtrack alone will bring a tear to your eye - this is the definitive spaghetti western and a film not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than 'The Good..' Better than any western!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon a time there was a bad guy named Henry Fonda... Anything is possible!From the very beginning of 'Once upon a time...', I realized that Leone was going to show us a lot more than he did in his 'dollar'-trilogy. That very first scene: how long does it last? Ten minutes? Fifteen? And nothing really happened (until Charles Bronson showed up of course)!But that's Sergio Leone: although he has a very slow style, his movies are so entertaining that you adore them. And why? Because he is a director who is an expert in casting, cinematography, editing, sounds and so on. In contribution of that, he just happens to be a good friend of the greatest western composer, Ennio Morricone of course. And this is his masterpiece, beyond doubt.'The movie is about a railroad', I once read in a newspaper. Nonsense! This movie is about 'THE' WEST. I mean, Sergio Leone's WEST. That kind of west consist of a lot of different personalities. We have a villain named Frank (played by Henry Fonda, it seems Leone made him go bad), a beautiful woman named Jill McBain whose husband has been killed, a mysterious guy playing a harmonica, looking for revenge and an outlaw, who is wrongly accused of having murdered Jill's husband.This movie didn't have as much action as I expected. But I don't care. It's made up by the great actors, the brilliant close-ups, Leone's visual greatness and Morricone's music, which is simply unforgettable. This is the best western ever made. Buy the film, and don't forget the soundtrack!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Henry Fonda's best ever role!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's already been said by other reviews on this page as to how a true masterpiece, "..West" really is. So rather than add to the adjectives I will comment on the major factors of the film.Charles Bronson, a very underrated actor I feel; alarmingly underused by silly egotistic directors who feel he has only one character to offer - the vigilante!The "...West" was his shining beacon in his film career. A part that perfectly matched his personnae, as the man with that expressive face &amp; threatening grin; a man of few words but lots of intentions.Clint Eastwood simply wouldn't have been the right choice. The "..West" is a true Italian operetta, while the 3 Dollar films were little more than Italian filling. I especially hate it when people associate "...West" with the Dollar films, even more so when they use "spaghetti western", such a derogatory term for a piece of cinematic art.Jason Robards, almost overlooked in the film by the two main protagonists. Robards, plays Cheyenne, a decent kind of cowboy with a few rough edges and an air of menace when required. He is perhaps the light relief in this film, which is a masterstroke by Leone. The film builds up so much tension there doesn't seem to be anywhere to let off a little steam and give the audience a respite.Claudia Cardinale, as Jill McBain, the widow of the wealthy landowner, Henry Fonda so ruthlessly gunned down, along with the rest of her family. Here she plays her part with so much power &amp; dignity that for me, its her best film. Leone doesn't just regard her as some kind of dumb doll; instead she is perhaps the fulcrum to the whole story and carries that burden of responsibility well, especially when faced with all three male stars.Sergio Leone. Without question, and regardless of what he may have privately felt about this film, "...West" is his most perfect film of all. There is nothing...nothing at fault here, apart from the film company hacking the length of the movie down from around 3 hours down to just under 2 in some prints!!Leone had a good foundation with the Dollar movies, but with the added writing from Dario Argento (yes, that one, of Suspiria fame!) and Bernardo Bertolucci, this film becomes more than just a western!In addition to the script the cinematograpy is simply awesome, especially in widescreen; his clever use of lighting &amp; shadow is so intricate that if you blink you'd miss something. And of course the (in)famous long silences between dialogue only adds, not distracts, from the enthralling ballet!Ennio Morricone a master of the film score; too many to mention, all of them excellent in their own right. But only "..West" gave him so much gravitas that you felt the music was like an invisible character on a par with Fonda or Bronson. In fact I have the main title from the film playing as I write this, and I feel so lifted by the sweeping power &amp; emotion each note unravels!And finally....Henry Fonda!A lot of the die-hard Fonda fans hated this film, or more specifically, Fonda for playing such a cold blooded killer. For years they had seen him appear as the hero, the do-gooder, as Mr Right. But now he chooses to be the Devil, and they didn't like it.But ignoring that, I have to say that this is without doubt Fonda's crowning moment, including On Golden Pond &amp; 12 Angry Men.For a film star of his stature to decide to go against the grain and play a baddie...and God, WHAT A BADDIE!!! showed, great credit on his behalf to go against his adoring fans and play against type for a change.I have to say, and I hope the IMDb guidelines will let me off just once here, but...Fonda's portrayal of Frank has to be seen to be believed. Never have I seen such a sadistic, uncaring, cold hearted son of a bitch in all my movie life. This man is pure evil, without question. Those blue eyes hide a black soul and he really doesn't care about anyone, young or old, male or female.Of course his first entrance in the film, dressed all in black and about to shoot a 9 year old boy, has similar parallels to that of the black dressed Darth Vader from Star Wars. But I'm convinced even he would run a mile if confronted by Fonda!Once Upon A Time in the West, is the best "western" of all time, only Unforgiven, comes close. Even if you're not keen on westerns you really should take a look at this, if only for the music &amp; the pure majesty of the camera's eye!!*****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trouble with many Westerns is they can be a pessimistic excuse for gunplay and bloodshed. Once Upon a Time in the West employs age-old gunfights and squinty eyed heroes out for vengeance, but to masterful effect. As with all Sergio Leone movies, this is best seen on the big screen as the wide screen vistas and stunning artistry ensure that the full impact of the movie pays off dividends when seen in its original format.The plot, in a nutshell, centres on land rights, the development of a railroad, a cold-blooded killer (Henry Fonda), a harmonica playing stranger (Charles Bronson) and a widow who is a lot more than just a gorgeous Old West bimbo (Claudia Cardinale). A must for film fans, not least because of the calibre of its creators. Dario Argento, Bernardo Bertolucci and Leone are a tough act to follow. Little wonder few have topped this in the years since its release.Good soundtrack too by Ennio Morricone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unconventional, but very effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There really aren't enough good things I can say about "C'era una volta il West" (aka Once Upon a Time in the West). The film seeks to be effective with unconventional techniques rather than using conventional techniques well.In many typical movies, you could remove the background music entirely, or switch the music segments around in different scenes and the effect of the movie would not be any different. In fact, the background music in many movies seems like a contrived plan to make sure that all the top 40 hits appearing on the soundtrack CD get included somehow. The music in this film was so critical to the images of its characters and scenes that the effectiveness of the film would be greatly diminished without it.In most movies, the acting is a combination of speech and personality. The irony of this film is that the best acting in it often occurs without a word being said. Long periods of silence occurred frequently, not just to build suspense, but to let the audience experience the emotions and personalities of the characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW! As many have already said, Leone &amp; Morricone at their best. While I can still watch Good,Bad,ugly anytime of the day, this is a film that deserves more attention. Every character sticks out as much as Morricone's majestic and powerful music. The opening segment of this film is still my favorite intro of all time. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Western Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Once Upon A Time In The West" towers above all other westerns and stands as Sergio Leone's ultimate masterpiece, which is weighty considering the canon of his work. Though I'm partial to Rutger Hauer in "Bladerunner" I give complete respect to Henry Fonda as the greatest villian in the movies for his portrayal of Frank. Villianny is easy, but this sort of cold, ruthless, calculating character is a once in a career opportunity. Take particular note of his entrance the first time he appears. Some of you may notice a similarity to this scene in 1977 by George Lucas when we are first introduced to Darth Vader. Whether it was intentional or not, you should be reminded of it. One of the truly brilliant aspects of this film is the interaction between the characters. No one completely trusts anyone. This is particularly strong is the relationship of Cheyanne (Jason Robards) and Harmonica (Charles Bronson). The first time they meet is tense, almost frightening. The greatest contribution this film made to the movies is the score by Ennio Morricone. It is his best, and unquestionably one fo the best scores ever. You will see how music adds to the action, how symbolic it can be. Without spoiling the movie you'll find out the the harmonica music we hear throughout the film is a lot more important than just setting the mood. The heading sums up all I have to say about it: "Once Upon a Time In the West" is the best western ever and one of my top ten favorite films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rate Once Upon a Time in The West among my ten favorite movies of all time. The masterful way Sergio Leone conducts mood, atmosphere and pace is without equal, and his presentation of the main characters is brilliant. Thus Charles Bronson delivers the performance of his life as the man with the harmonica, Jason Robards is a pleasure to watch as the anti-hero Cheyenne and Henry Fonda is brilliantly cast as perhaps the most evil villain in movie history. What can I say? I just love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic! The most satisfying western I've seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I fell in love with this film from the first time I saw it. Once Upon a Time in the West is one of the best character-driven movies with a plot that drives the audience. Henry Fonda is an emissary of evil. Charles Bronson is the mystery man with a code of honor. Jason Robards is an "honest criminal." Jill McBain is a modern woman vying for respect and dominance in a man's world.I adore this film for several reasons.Charles Bronson, Peter Fonda, and Jason Robards are the baddest bad-boys in the west.The soundtrack is both ingenious and haunting.As the title implies, it's a fantasy about good and evil, and the men and women who play their roles in the battle for progress. "The West" is not portrayed as a static backdrop like in your run-of-the-mill John Wayne feature, but as a dynamic entity that engulfs the characters.From the opening scene to the final gunfight, you get the feeling that what is going on here is larger than life.The Charles Bronson flashbacks are astounding.This film is full of styleI can't say more except that if you're looking into westerns as a genre, this movie is quintessential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie, a great role for Henry Fonda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a child, I first heard of Henry Fonda when "On Golden Pound" was released. I didn't know exactly how he looked like, but I knew he was a classic actor. When I saw OUATITW, I was expecting Fonda to be the hero, but I realized only at the end that he was the villain! That was my first encountered with whom his now one of my favorite actors. At the time OUATITW was released, many people disliked it only because Fonda was so brutal (according to his biography "My Life"). That contrasted with most of the roles he had previously. I think that with OUATITW one can appreciate the extent of his talent.The rest of the cast is also very good and the choice of Bronson over Eastwood is all right for this movie. I can't imagine Eastwood in the role of an old victim of Frank.Just about everything is good in that movie: the western countryside and ambiance, the acting, the close-ups, the humor and of course, Morricone's music. UOATITW is Leone's masterpiece and one of my ten favorite movies. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A truly magnificent film. I first saw the movie in 1969, and of course (not that we knew it then) it had been cut by some 30 minutes. The whole scene at the roadhouse was missing, so we didn't even know that Jill had met Harmonica and Cheyenne, a lot of important stuff concerning, Frank, his gang and Morton was not there, and of course the ending was...well let's just say it was different. But even then it was the most astonishing movie experience. Finally in 1979 I saw it wide screen, fully restored. Breathtaking! (It also made a lot more sense!)I agree with every comment on this page. If you get the opportunity to see it on the big screen.go!</fullReview>

Truly the best western, if not the best of any genre that has ever been made. Totally captivating. Always a Charles Bronson fan (I am from the same hometown in Penna!!) Met him back in 1956 when he came to see his Mom. This is his best work. Henry Fonda's best movie too. Music was so wonderful. The scene where Jill views the bodies of her dead husband and kids is a tear jerker. The final scene between Jill and Harmonica....."someday"! deserves a sequel.

		<shortDescription>Claudia Cardinale eyes made me fall in love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film made me fall in love with Claudia Cardinale. I think most western movie fans focus on the hero and the villain in describing a film, but I believe that Claudia Cardinale's "Jill" captures the essence of "Once Upon a Time in the West", and in fact makes it a memorable, although violent, love story. The entire movie plot revolves around the arrival of Jill at the railhead and the subsequent relationship she has with each of the leading men in the movie. Cheyenne's last words to Jill still haunt me today: "You can't imagine how happy it makes a man to see a woman like you - just to look at her..." No doubt Cheyenne was in love with her, and in the end, so was Frank and "Harmonica" (and me). It's no surprise my current girlfriend has beautiful eyes that look like Claudia Cardinale's. "Jill's America", off the soundtrack, is the musical theme attributed to Jill's character and captures the mystery, beauty, and majesty of the west. The next time you watch the film, focus in on Jill and you will discover a whole new dimension to the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unquestionably a masterpiece, the best of all Leone's films, and one of the 10 greatest Westerns of all time. I certainly don't wish to take credit away from the director, but the true star of this epic is Ennio Morricone whose score, as I understand it, was written BEFORE the movie started shooting and used as inspiration. This may be an example of a new film theory: The Composer as Auteur. Morricone's work here was deserving of an Oscar, and the fact that it wasn't even nominated in a year in which Burt Bacharach's atrocious score for the mediocre "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" was honored, speaks volumes about the Academy's ignorance and lack of taste. Or is it jealousy?</fullReview>

Many years later I happened to see the film, recognized the music, and loved it at first sight! I've seen it four times now and each time I'm impressed by seeing the final duel..., in my opinion the best minutes of film ever shot. Maybe seeing isn't the right word.

		<shortDescription>Who needs Eastwood when you've got Fonda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Eastwood did in fact turn down the role as the Man with the Harmonica, it's no loss. Fonda's Frank - "just a man" - is a much more complex character than Eastwood probably could have achieved. (The contrast with railroad baron Morton is good stuff). (I know, Clint was meant for the Harmonica man, but really Fonda was the focus here. Maybe Eastwood couldn't see himslef as villain at this point in his career. Did you notice Fonda's spit - is this where Eastwood got the idea for Jose Wales?). Fonda's portrayal and Leone's direction leave nothing to be desired. Also, Bronson's work here is much underrated - "I saw three of these dusters. With 3 men in them. Inside the men were 3 bullets". Bronson is the rock the movie is planted on. But really this film is a gift from these 2 great Italians. A bittersweet gift, but a gift just the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't kill me over it, because you can also read that I thought it was a great movie. Yet, there is one minor flaw which caught my attention. The moment that Jason Robards (Cheyenne) asks Claudia Cardinale (Jill McBain) if she knows anything about the man with the harmonica -in the previous scene during her first night at the ranch she heard him play in the dark and took a shot at him lighting a cigarette- the script overlooked the fact that some scenes earlier she was also present at the bar where Jason Robards had his first encounter with Charles Bronson -Cheyenne had his chains shot remember?-. So he would have known that Jill knew about the man with the harmonica. Nevertheless...... I agree with the comments which say they wish some of today's film makers would take a look at this pic before poisoning the industry with their garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only Sergio Leone could make a film in which Henry Fonda is the bad guy. His first appearance in the movie is one of the best meldings of camera work and music. The moment when the kid runs out of the house, Ennio Morricone's magnificent music supercharges the scene. As Frank walks toward the kid, the music builds and the camera twists around to reveal who this killer is: good old Henry Fonda! From there he goes on to shoot the kid, and forever shatter his reputation as always being the good guy. Bronson, Robards, Fonda all add to the greatness of the film, but the true stars here are Leone and Morricone. Morricone's music soars and creates a world that stands alone from the fantastic visuals that Leone composes with his camera. The final stan-doff between the Man with the Harmonica and Frank is outstanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who cares that Clint Eastwood isn't in this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been said many times that the role of "Harmonica" was intended for Clint Eastwood. But I think it's enormously unfair to Charles Bronson to endlessly speculate on what Eastwood may or may not had done. Who cares? Eastwood had his chance and turned it down. Bronson seized it and made the most of it. Not only do I think that "West" is Bronson's best movie, I think Bronson does a better job in this film than Eastwood in the "spaghetti trilogy".If you think about it, all three leads in this film are cast against type. Charles Bronson is not the type of actor you'd think of for a lead as a hero (although he did a great job in "The Magnificent Seven" and "The Great Escape.") The average person thinks of Jason Robards as a crotchety grandfather, certainly not a cunning outlaw a la "Tuco" in "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly." And was there ever a more unlikely villain in screen history than Henry Fonda, who build a career on playing sincere, kind protagonists? (By the way, Fonda's role was originally intended for John Wayne, who turned it down.) And yet all of these great actors make you forget their other personnas and suck you into Sergio Leone's world...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considered by many as one of the greatest westerns ever made, and even one of the greatest movies ever made, Once Upon a Time in the West is none of the above, really. Almost 3 hours long, Sergio Leone's "masterpiece" loses focus most of the time and doesn't seem to go in any particular direction.The scenes are way too long and most of them don't even create tension as better Leone films so greatly do. The haunting score by Morricone is good and Henry Fonda as the baddest cat in the west is also very intriguing. The movie is propelled by the motivation of Harmonica, which we always want to discover. That being said, the shootout between Fonda and Bronson is awesome, with flashbacks revealing the nature of Harmonica's motivations. But after that, the movie should have ended quickly, for it deserved a climactic ending, at least. But it doesn't, and it's just another 15 minutes (at least) of talking, talking and more talking!The Good the Bad and the Ugly is Leone's masterpiece. This, is mediocre filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone's Masterpice of Visual Narrative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler's Ahead:First Leone and Morricone worked their magic together one really cannot imagine Leone without the great composer Ennio Morricone. Bronson's Harmonica is the synthesis of the two great master's what is the result? Death walking on two feet the discordant synthesis of pain loss anger hate rage that comes out of the creepy discordant tune that causes even the hardened Cheyenne and his gang to think twice before engaging the figure that plays this bone chilling refrain from his old harmonica. When Cheyenne first encounters him he shines the light on the haggard face the old coat with many bullet holes in it; he decides quickly it is best to pull back from a man who seeks either revenge or the peace of death whichever comes first and is afraid of nothing anymore. Harmonica even tries to provoke Cheyenne but never does even brave Robards no slouch himself at killing dare to confront the man who openly recklessly seeks Frank or death. For those who have never watched Leone before watch how he uses visuals instead of dialogue. His trademark is the closeup right next to the iris the soul camera some have called it. In the final showdown between harmonica and frank the closeup builds with the rising crescendo of the music. This is mirrored in THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY same identical crescendo albeit with different music from Morricone but the style is identical. Leone is without rival in his use of visuals Kubrick is great but in my humble opinion nobody can sustain a scene devoid of dialogue using only visuals and music like Sergio Leone could. This is always his trademark and what sets him apart from his imitators. Leone always focuses on the eyes of his characters. Leone's socialism is also always present capitalists are always the villains of his pictures. Notice the slimeball Morton who flatters his own cowardice by trying to convince Frank that money is a better weapon than a gun. Frank eventually loses his fascination with Morton and is overcome with disgust for his backstabbing cowardice. He admits this to Harmonica before the final duel,"just a man." Harmonica replies,"an ancient race." Harmonica while still on his irrevocable path has a moment of respect that Frank has left the worm crawling in the mud next to his train and returned to the dignity and honor of open warfare without the cowardly dealings of Morton. The BONE TB of morton is a metaphor for Leone's view of capitalists; Morton is rotting away like a corpse his soul is rotten. The same thing happens at the beginning of DUCK YOU SUCKER, Steiger in the coach with the rich elite mocking the poor as animals and idiots. Leone has closeups of them eating to show you how disgusting he finds them. Stuffing their faces food juices running down their faces. Leone's ending is so beautiful. Jill desires harmonica wants to domesticate him but Cheyenne predicts perfectly what he will do if he survives. Cheyenne says it has something to do with death; a man like that just can never be changed into a family man. Soon after Cheyenne dies Leone shows the railroad coming in one world dies and another is born but one gets such a feeling of loss. An ancient way of life is gone forever replaced by one without heroes and villains who fight openly without duplicity or mendacity to hide their cowardice. Quite simply my favorite western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique poetic Italo-Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is surprising that Sergio Leone's brilliant masterpiece "Once upon a time in the West" did not turn out as successful in the United States as it was hoped for. The European audience, however, was enthralled and charmed by this unique artistic work. In German, Leone's Italo-Western has a much more appropriate title which would translate as "Play me the tune of death". Indeed, the storyline is quite capturing: A lonesome harmonica player (Charles Bronson) ends up in a final showdown with his arch-enemy Frank, who shot down a woman's (Claudia Cardinale) family to make profit in the Mid-West. The spectator is thrilled right from the first moment - not only by the powerful dialogs and gunfights, but by the poetic scenery and imagery. One has to admit that the movie would only have turned out half as good without Ennio Morricone's beautiful music which imparts a somehow romantic and epic touch. Along with that, Claudia Cardinale plays the amazing part of an unbreakable, totally intrepid widow. Leone's directing style consists of ellipses which he applied perfectly to enhance suspense and to allow silent dialog and emotion through eye contact. It is a style that is very characteristic of that era and evokes feelings of nostalgia for all fans of neo-realist Italian cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Contester for the best Spaghetti Western?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has some of the best atmosphere. The sets are wonderful, with so much detail. There are panning shots of rooms that clearly show the whole room as an actual location and absolutely filled with stuff. The towns look real and lively. The camera pans are used to a great effect. This film goes far to build up its tension and atmosphere. It would not be too much to say that it is its most distinguishing feature.Moreover, the cinematography is smart, like there is a scene of a person drinking from a bottle, thereby raising his hands and showing that they are in handcuffs. That is smart writing right there.Ennio Morricone is responsible for the music, as with most Sergio Leone's Westerns. He brings a good variety of noticeable tunes. There are emotional strings mixed with a choir or a female solo, and of course the main star is the iconic dramatic harmonica theme of the main protagonist that gets mixed with a menacing guitar. Music in this movie is definitely not part of the background.One of the most interesting actors is Jason Robards (I had to check twice it wasn't "Roberts") as a gang leader. His high acting ability is mixed with a warm charisma. The main villain played by Henry Fonda is well acted but is a little plain. The protagonist is covered with the spaghetti part of the spaghetti western. His signature harmonica thing is cool but then he plays that same tune in situations that do not call for it. And of course he talks with the rim of his face covering his eyes. And of course he is mysterious and shoots perfectly.The main lady role is played by an Italian Claudia Cardinale's. You can read a lot off of her subtle facial expression changes. Unfortunately, this lady is rather clearly dubbed at times.There are also a few other characters who do not appear on screen for long but are nonetheless memorable.The dialogue is good. There is not much of it, but it is good and to the point.This Sergio Leone's film was a memorable one, with many interesting characters, unique musical score and good tension.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something to do with mythology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderful cinematographic masterpiece, this is truly one of the greatest film of all time. This work of fiction has a profound hold over those who watch it, why? Because it touches the depth of the collective soul and we cling to it like to a dream you can't forget; in a greater extent "Once Upon a Time in the West" doesn't just suit the psyche of one person, the way a dream does, but its symbols and profound images, its sense of wonder, beauty, its path of terror and violence, resonates within people's hearts and minds - and because this movie keeps getting watched and watched again - it'll descend in our deep unconscious adding meaning to our lives, and arise in a collective dream-like mythology.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The visual beauty of this movie, the superb acting, the universal themes, and the accompanying score underpin its greatness, but what makes it a truly great movie is the pacing. 'Slow' is how many reviewers describe the pace, but 'slow' implies that the pace could have been improved by a speeding up of the scenes. However, the pace is perfect. Rather than 'slow', I like to describe the scenes as being 'extended' (as opposed to exaggerated, extreme, or protracted, which, like 'slow', are words that imply imperfection). In Once Upon A Time In The West the action is extended over time intervals that allow the viewer to think and reflect and ponder on what is being observed. It's as if Leone has slowed down time, and what we reflect and ponder about is more than just the scene, which reflect an America that we never knew. But we know the themes of greed, lust, revenge, anger, despair, savage cruelty, regret, and loss, and those of us who have reached maturity and have decades of experience under our belt, also have memories of experiences that reflect those fundamental themes. And THAT is what tugs at our heartstrings (at least mine). The scenes are metaphors that stand in for own lives.You have to grow into this realization. Twenty years ago, when I first saw this movie, it was just a good movie, and If I had written a review about it then, I'd probably be comparing it to The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, just like many other reviewers do. Hell, I might even have suggested that it was a little slow in some areas. But the experiences have caught up with me, and I understand now what Leone had tried (and succeeded) in doing. I have not found another movie that affects me as much as this one. As much as a movie can be interactive, can involve the viewer, can make them reflect on the past and ponder the future, can bring up emotions that arise from those reflections, Once Upon A Time In The West takes the crown. This movie is in a class by itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sergio Leone is unique in his field, and particularly in the western genre. He was in his fourth year of spaghetti western, let's say in full swing, in this film. You know it is Sergio Leone by several elements that do not tell a lie. The music always has the same texture, the same taste, the same sonorities, with the eternal harmonica. Then the landscape, the sunshine, the light, the vegetation and of course practically no fauna, and in this one, not even a snake. Hardly a few horses, a couple of partridges, or whatever, and a pair of chickens. Nothing to brag about. Sergio Leone is concentrating anyway on the human animal and there the menagerie is by far diverse and grotesque enough. Then the economy of the dialogue is also typical because Sergio Leone never uses one word too many when he can do without any word at all. The silences are long and so meaningful that you must be blind not to hear the resounding sense of that emptiness. Then the few words that are actually pronounced become so powerful in their scarcity and rarity that you definitely have to be deaf not to see the subtlety of that sound track. Those are the most significant traits of Sergio Leone's style. And this film is the acme of that style. The plot itself innovates in the subject, that is to say in who the thieves are. In this case some railroad contractor who wants to get rid of some settler who has bought a big chunk of land on the very way where the railroad has to go and who has a contract that allows the railroad to go through for nothing if the station is built before the train can come. You can then imagine the intricacies of the action between several gangs and tribes and bands of good and bad men, bad and good beings, and all the nuances, hues and shades in between. The best detail of course comes at the end when the main bad guy realizes who the one who has just destroyed him is. Don't expect me to tell you. You have to watch the film till the very last five minutes to finally understand. Enjoy it. And if you get the collector's edition you will also enjoy the complementary features on railroads and their advance in and through the west.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone's majestic Western epic now restored and preserved thanks to the Film Foundation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prior to the screening of this new, restored version of "Once Upon a Time in the West", which drastically improves on the picture quality of the version released on DVD and any 35mm prints previously available (as demonstrated through a side-by-side comparison before the film began), one of the people involved in this wonderful restoration process said that if we had not seen "Once Upon a Time in the West" upon its original release, we had not really seen the film. After viewing the restored print with a wonderfully appreciative and respectful audience at the 2008 Calgary International Film Festival, I have to agree. The picture is crisp and clear, the colors restored to their original glory with not a hint of the wear and tear induced by years of hardly ideal storage conditions, and there's just the special experience of viewing a Leone film on the big screen which brings his brilliant sense of composition to the forefront, which maximizes the effect of his excellent use of close-ups and long shots, which bares naked the sheer attention to detail in just about every frame. It's an experience that any film buff worth his or her salt should have. Like all (most, perhaps, if not every last one) of the Film Foundation restorations, it was a photo-chemical restoration process, and not a digital one, other than certain moments where damage to the original print made digital restoration a must. Although it is often referred to as a 'spaghetti' Western, probably as a result of the director's other films, "Once Upon a Time in the West" was filmed in the USA with a mostly American cast and American studio backing, not to mention a lavish budget which definitely shows on screen, especially when compared to Leone's previous, low-budget Western films. The Italian touch comes in through the stylistic elements of the film, which are unmistakably Leone's, and the crew appear to all be European as well. There's an unmistakably European air to the proceedings, and one can't help but notice the ridiculous number of well-known Italians involved in the story and script alone- Dario Argento, Bernardo Bertolucci, Sergio Donati, and Sergio Leone. Given how unconventional, brutal, and subversive Leone's Westerns are often said to be (often in the form of accusations, and often in the form of extravagant praise from revisionists), they are remarkably human and tender, and "Once Upon a Time in the West" is perhaps Leone's warmest film, and contains, other than my favorites Tuco and Blondie, his best characters- Charles Bronson's Harmonica, Jason Robards' Cheyenne, Claudia Cardinale's Jill McBain, and one of the all-time great screen villains, Frank, played to perfection by Henry Fonda in one of the most memorable examples of casting against type in the history of the cinema. The story is memorable as well, with Cardinale's brilliant performance making Jill a genuinely sympathetic character, and the certainly memorable, mysterious, and interesting characters who aim to protect her from Frank after she arrives at her new home to find her husband and would-be family murdered for the valuable land on which the family's farm is built on. The narrative is elliptical (probably deliberately), but still very involving and interesting, and the film doesn't feel like a 165-minute long film (go figure- apparently it's excruciatingly slow according to its increasingly vocal minority of critics, I barely felt the time pass), as Leone handles the pacing of the film brilliantly, allowing the scope of the visuals, story, and characters to fully play out without feeling either stretched-out or rushed. Worthy of mention, of course, is the Ennio Morricone score, which doesn't quite match "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly", in my own humble opinion (but then neither does the film itself, in spite of the authentic locations and significantly higher budget), but is still absolutely phenomenal and memorable, in particular the main theme and the instantly recognizable harmonica piece used. If the film does have a significant flaw it is the disappointing foley work, which would be an issue on basically every Leone film except for "Once Upon a Time in America".Exceptionally well-directed (that's a given, of course), wonderfully-written, with countless memorable bits of dialogue and well-developed characters, and blessed with an outstanding ensemble cast and a human warmth that few Westerns are blessed with (the final scene with Cheyenne and Harmonica is especially affecting), "Once Upon a Time in the West" is an enthralling, majestic, operatic Western from the great Sergio Leone, and the biggest compliment I can pay it is to say that it simply does not feel bloated whatsoever. Thanks to the Film Foundation it is now forever preserved in this brilliantly, painstakingly restored form which leaves the film looking better than ever. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone falls in love with his style a little too much toward the end but this is still a cracking film, albeit it has gained a status I'm not entirely sure it deserves.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leone's now iconic film stands out for two very distinct things for me, personally. That is, number one: the brilliant, brilliant soundtrack that adds feeling; raw emotion and atmosphere as well as number two: editing and shot composition which differs between long, wide angled long shots to the gritty close up of the face for certain reactions and objects for certain atmosphere. Many things have been said about how brilliant the film is and in terms of the genre, this genre film is usually considered one of if not the pinnacle itself of the Western. But whereas the typical American western might include John Wayne or some other such hard bodied American taking on a role of 'honest as they come guy' who gets caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time, Once Upon a Time in the West is a slower and less-obvious film that somewhat ignores these conventions. Therefore it is a shame that I liked it rather than loved it once it had ended.The European influence grabs a hold of you right from the off in Once Upon a Time in the West. Afterwards I read a brief summary on the film stating it may well have the best opening to any film ever and that could well be the case. Leone's style here is to ignore the process of 'action, causes action, causes re-action, action, causes action...etc.' and show the guys who are a part of Frank's (Fonda) gang wait for a train to arrive rather than have the train arrive; have the gang arrive and then play out actions ? Leone pays attention to sound (windmill and the fly) and has tantalising long shots of the train track in the distance that announces to us that the train is not going to arrive anytime soon. Cut back to ground level and the guys are killing time before the train arrives ? we don't know why they're there and given it's a Western, they could be minutes away from death so the character's casualness and the build up through composition work really well.Once Upon a Time in the West carries a certain elegance despite its dirty, gritty and slimy nature. Characters look rough, wear dirty clothes and spit more than they need to and the dusty desert locations in Spain and The States work so well that to see the film is to almost feel hot and bothered. From the opening, the film develops with the arrival of Harmonica (Bronson), a man with no name indeed bar the one he's given by a fellow character for spending so much time playing said instrument. As a character, Harmonica epitomises the strange, the mysterious - a man that does not, you feel, belong in the film but a man who has his reasons and a back-story but the European influence is there again in the sense Leone chooses not to show it until well into the film. As a character, Harmonica brings diegetic music to the film in the form of his harmonica, an object he will never forget the manner of which he came across it. When it is played, it echoes and sounds louder than usual giving the man a presence that is almost uncanny ? the music teeters on the brink of being within the film and not being within the film and certainly maintains a brooding and unnatural atmosphere.But Leone does not limit his style to composition choice, locations and harmonica sounds. He broadens his arsenal so much so that at times, the objects are doing the speaking for the characters. Another character is introduced, she is Jill McBain (Cardinale) and she arrives, like Harmonica, into this town by train. The genius here is that a simple introduction of a character by train has been stretched out through having a prior tragic event happen in a preceding scene that will affect McBain ? how will she react? Then there is the brilliant cutting between her pocket watch and the station clock, creating a 'jump' in time between waiting there. Such a technique is rarely seen today and further acts as an example of Leone's ignoring of the 'action, causes action, etc.' method.But even that is not the first time it happens since later on, a card game will happen in a train caboose which doubles up as the only urban inspired 'space' in the film amongst all the dusty and dirty rural settings. The game is accompanied by odd sounding train noises which could be read into as the noises going on inside the player's minds as the pot grows and the tension rises. Once Upon a Time in the West is a film that can bring pleasure to its viewer but it's really brining its director the most pleasure. At 165-odd minutes, Leone is clearly in love with his unfolding of a film rather than his telling of a story and his style does overtake a lot of what I would've liked to have seen, that is to say more of an interesting narrative and less of the style once it had been established he could do it. But it will remain a film studied and looked at for years to come. Like I said with the original Japanese Godzilla film, you get the impression if they'd known it was going to be looked at and studied so much in the future, they might've made sure it would have held up a little more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Western Film I Have Ever Seen. R.I.P. Sergio Leone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who needs Clint Eastwood when you have Charles Bronson! Henry Fonda's role as Frank the psychopathic killer is amazing, I've never seen Fonda do a role of a madman, Jason Robards appearance was great (his music when he enters the bar is great). Claudia Cardinale is just gorgeous, her role is very important in order for the rest of the plot to keep up in the film. I guess I shouldn't be surprised by the genius of director Sergio Leone, that guy was amazing. I believe this western should be right up there with The Good The Bad and The Ugly, to tell you the truth, this film kept my attention althroughout its two hour and forty five minute mayhem. Charles Bronson (with no mustache!) as Harmonica was brilliant, every time you heard a Harmonica, there he was..... Jason Robards dialogue was great, he added a nice little flair of comic relief to the script. Henry Fondas character was very believable and not too nice I might add. Great Cinematography and a wonderful musical score, I almost cried at some points because of the beauty of it all in this film. Bravo, job couldn't have been done any better. R.I.P. Sergio Leone, best western film director EVER.</fullReview>

A classic....the music is "haunting" and so "fitting" and plays a major role in making the scenes, the drama and the action flow together to create a story of shock, suspense, drama, beauty, sadness and joy. And what a memorable ending; just as it should be in a classic western. A movie with a cast that seemed so right and played so correctly by Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda. This is a movie that not only tells a story but draws you in naturally, making you believe that this is the west the way it was. When a movie beckon's you to see it again and again, then you know you have experienced art and entertainment. Once Upon a Time in the West....gives us that special time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rank No. 20 in IMDb list! There has been certain charm in viewing western movies. The landscape the people, their dress, horses, caps, style, guns etc. Who can forget The Good, the Bad and the Ugly? And who can forget its director Sergio Leone? Though I read that this masterpiece of his flopped in the US box office, it still remains one of the most well directed, well shot, and best western movie ever.The story is about a ruthless assassin Frank (Henry Fonda), who kills a whole family to build a rail road. His mission is finally stopped and the widow Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) is rescued by a stranger Harmonica (Charles Bronson) with the help of another notorious dacoit Cheyenne (Jason Robards).The plot is simple, but the narration is brilliant. The characterization, the silence, the style, the choreography of sound, and back-ground score is marvelous. There is a built up of suspense through-out the movie. Always seen Henry Ford as a hero, packed against a team of dacoit and stranger ? brings certain tension of purposefulness of the motives of the characters. In the end, Henry Ford emerges as a villain and Charles Bronson as a savior.The camera angle, the sets and costumes are fantastic. The dialogues are minimal. The love scene between Henry Fonda and Claudia is a bit too much and serves the only purpose of formulaic insertion in the narrative.The small details, the slowness of pace, the lazy movement of people, the sun, the heat the dust all add up the canvas being painted BIG. Not a movie to see on small screen. It is strictly for big screen viewing with stereo-phonic sound effect.Hats off to Sergio Leone for bringing so much style to the genre of western movies!

A story not always pretty or explained in simplistic terms of good-versus-evil... but in the end an ennobling journey nevertheless.The gist of the tale has been covered already in numerous reviews, so let me just add one observation.Like all great art, it requires an attention span that obviously isn't present in many of the "reviewers" allowed to post here.It belongs on any credible list of Top 50 movies... one could even argue Top 20.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sergio Leone is a film God; this is the most beautiful film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I say in this review cannot do this film justice. This film is a work of art, the most beautiful thing ever put on celluloid. I don't know how Sergio Leone does it but he manages to create something so huge with nothing but a camera, the greatest composer and a handful of brilliant actors. For the first ten minutes of this epic western there is no dialogue, none at all. We see nothing but these three men waiting for a train, that is all we know. This is the trademark style of epic spaghetti western director Sergio Leone, his use of the camera has never once been bettered.Ennio Morricone's score is perfect. He manages to capture the mood of a particular scene or character so well with his music. Morricone and Leone were the best cinematic duo in the history of cinema.Claudia Cardinale, Henry Fonda, Jason Robards and Charles Bronson give four outstanding performances. They all have very different roles and they are all stunningly good. Claudia Cardinale gives a beautiful and moving performance as recently widowed Jill who is under protection by Harmonica (Charles Bronson) and Cheyenne (Jason Robards). They are protecting her against Frank (Henry Fonda) a ruthless man who is hired by a railroad baron to knock off settlers who get in the way. The three leading men, Bronson, Fonda and Robards are brilliant in this.I cannot recommend this enough. Go see it now if you have not and just let yourself be immersed in Leone's beautiful western world.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Western , if not Film, of all Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1968, in the wake of completing the Dollars Trilogy, Sergio Leone wanted to wash his hands of the Western and begin work on the gangster film that would one day become Once Upon A Time In America. Fortunately (for us viewers), in 1968 nobody wanted Leone to do anything but Westerns. So he agreed to do one more. But this would not be just another western, no. This would be the film to summarise all his feelings about the Western - the death of the Western from the man who gave it new life. It would be Once Upon A Time In The West.West is an incredible triumph. A picture of such rare perfection that the viewer can only watch in awe as the master of the Western composes a dance of death. Ennio Morricone's scores and ingenious use of natural sound (Leone said that sound was 40% of a film) add an operatic feel to the goings on. One feels that they are watching a legend, and they are, as only the greatest storyteller of the genre knows how. Every performance, particularly Claudia Cardinale's, is pitch perfect. Every shot is like a painting. Every moment is as mythic as it is magnificent. Leone also paid tribute to Westerns he loved. Watch out for homages to Johnny Guitar, Shane and the Searchers. This is what makes Leone, perhaps, the first postmodern director.West is Leone's underrated masterpiece. If it is not the greatest film of all time then it is certainly the greatest Western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once Upon A Time........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that today there are two kinds of films being made. Those that have huge budgets, big names, release dates that are planned to exploit box office, awards and expected weekend earnings. Then there are those that are made for a "certain audience". These films wear their pretensions on there sleeves and in doing so attempt to be branded as something "daring" or "special" simply because they don't have "studio" support. I don't mean to imply that some of these films (large or small budgets) don't have merit and are not good or even great films, as there are many that most certainly are. 30 years ago, Paramount wanted to capitalize on the "Dollars" being generated by the Leone/Eastwood/Morricone trilogy. With a blank check and Henry Fonda, Sergio Leone succeeded in making a western that would fail to ignite at America's box office, garner mostly negative reviews and end up being hacked up by its parent, Paramount. What Leone and Parmount could not have known at the time was that Leone's 3 hour homage to cinema would take its place in the company of films like Welles's "Touch of Evil", Laughton's "Night of the Hunter", Capra's "It's a wonderful Life" and Scott's "BladeRunner", etc. These films and others were rejected, disowned, chopped and forgotten. They would join that small group of masterpieces from all mediums of artistic expression with the magic to transcend time and find faithful and loving audiences decade after decade. Today, Leones beautiful and sad meditation on the end of an America that never was, takes its place in the pantheon of greatest films ever made. See the accolades on the "IMDB" top 250 films, reviews from critics coast to coast on "Rotten Tomatoes", film makers from Tarantino to Scorsese and most of all, those of us who have seen and been touched by this great film through the years since its creation. Today we have a beautiful representation of a great directors gift to the myth that was America. Now more than ever we need films like Once Upon A Time In The West to remind us that the nobility of the myth that gave birth to our America is worth cherishing if only through the lens and music of these pioneers of postmodern cinema. It seems that Paramount has at last done right by Leone and in a sense so has Hollywood in finally paying its respects to Ennio Morricone, Leone's cinematic soul mate and the greatest living composer we have. Wherever Sergio Leone's spirit roams for a day or an eternity, "he must be a happy man".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following "Fistful" with the vastly more impressive "For A Few Dollar's More" and "The Good the Bad and the Ugly" Leone thought he had left the Western behind and was planning on making the Gangster epic "Once Upon A Time In America". But to get the funding for "America" the studio's asked for another Western. Leone made "Once Upon a Time in the West" and with that ended his 'spaghetti-cooking' career on the highest note possible. OUATITW is in my humble opinion one of the most impressive pieces of film-making ever! A meticulously crafted epic of how that west died. The story is simple. It's a brief glimpse of four obviously eventful lives, a more or less scrupulous railroad baron Mr Morton, his coldblooded henchman Frank, Cheyenne the outlaw and a mysterious gunman called 'Harmonica', as they all become intertwined with the beautiful Jill and the approaching railroad.Opening with one of the most famous sequences in cinema history as three killers wait at a dust blown railway station for a train to arrive, Leone's masterwork shows the viewer from the start that they are about to witness a very different type of film. This opening, with almost no dialogue, no music and exaggerated natural sounds (dripping water, a fly, a rusty windmill wheel), shows us the normality of these characters lives. Whereas the anonymous 'hired hands' in other Westerns are simply shapes to be shot at, here Leone gives them a brief shot of personality as they wait for their victim. It's symptomatic for this film, that when you try and tell the story, you automatically end up describing a scene. If Leone choreographed a fly or not, doesn't change the fact that every little detail in this scene well thought through, and used optimally. This sequence heralds the arrival of "Harmonica", and it's not the only outstanding introduction of a character. Frank is given a striking introduction as the camera moves around from the back of his head to a close up of his set, tanned face and steely blue eyes following his massacre of a whole family. Cheyenne arrives via a wonderful audio only gunfight outside of a lonesome, dust blown tavern that ends with him coming through the swinging doors, the light hitting his eyes as he glances up. Jill has a magnificently designed and filmed sequence that follows her from the train into the Station Masters Office where the camera stays outside and watches her through the window (as if it were a bystander following her with his eyes) and as she leaves through the front door it moves up the side of the building and over the roof to show the bustling, growing town beyond. All scored to one of Ennio Morricone's most powerful, moving and simply beautiful pieces of music.Leone uses the more typical Italian Western Spanish locations for most of the film, but for the first time he also uses the legendary 'Monument Valley' with it's awesome landscape of beautifully sculptured red sand stone mountains and rises. It's a landscape that came to represent the American Western due to its appearance in so many of John Ford's classic movies. Leone had dreamed of using this 'home of the Western' and in the brief scenes it appears (mostly Jill's coach ride to her Husband's homestead), due to the lush, wide screen Cinematography that Leone is such a master at using, it adds an authentic atmosphere that is obviously rare in the normal, entirely shot in Spain 'Spaghetti' Westerns. Leone is also a master of composition. Carefully, painstakingly filling the screen with perfectly arranged objects, places and people. The one-on-one finale between 'Harmonica' and Frank is a text book example of choreography, editing, lighting and character placement. As the two enemies move around each other Leone and Delli Colli carefully keep both in frame on the opposite sides of their vast canvas, editing in those trademark close-ups that actors love so much. Add the powerful music and you have one of the most gripping and emotive sequences ever committed to film and it's a sequence that can still raise a chill. Truly wonderful cinema.The beauty of this film is of course not everything. The characters are colourful and complex, and the acting is impeccable. This was Bronson's first real lead, and it was opposite a stellar cast, but he belongs there. Even though we only get a glimpse of their lives, there is no doubt all of the characters have experienced their fair share of adventures before we meet them. The genius part of this is the story is not "going to end". We only see the end. Jill is the only one that has a story to tell after the movie ends. She is the new age coming, and all the men becomes infatuated by her, and she changes something in them. Morton is not the industrialist he wants to be. He is a dreamer. A crippled dreamer who is, despite his money, dependent on a man like Frank, who is himself a part of a dying era.The final scene sums up very well what this movie was about. An end of an era. Not just Sergio Leone's western making period, but also the end of one world, as Frank and Cheyenne dies, but also the beginning of a new era as the train (the money, the civilization) rolls in on the newly laid tracks with more workers to keep the train going.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure cinematic brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A strange a beautiful moment in Italian cinema bringing together Argento, Leone, and Bertolucci to conceive of a western that was not just about tense quick draw competitions but about the nature of capitalism, the nature of genre, and the strange fate of American individualism. A fantastic piece of film making. To me this is a stronger film than any of Leone's earlier works, and it is the logical extension of the kinds of things he was doing in his first three westerns. "Fistful of Dollars" established the mode, "For a Few Dollars More" expanded it, "Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" perfected it, and in so doing, changed it to examine, and re-stage, moments of warfare. And then the final film, which explodes the genre, wisely casting Henry Fond against type as a steely eyed child killing murderer. This is probably as good as Westerns will ever get.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone approaching perfection........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a fan of westerns, or great film-making in general, you must see this film. The film is very long, but you won't even notice. There is not one boring/mediocre shot in this movie! Leone is at the top of his craft, and everything is a visual feast. The characters are deep an unpredictable (the plot will keep you guessing). Bronson, Fonda, and Robards put on a clinic for the rest of the acting world. The film is about the railroads, and the towns and people that lived in their development. It is also about vendetta's long past. Once Upon In the Time is nothing new, as far as westerns go. It's a typical genre stuff. Vengeance, railroads and big business vs. the little guy. Yet this film is more entertaining and well made than 99% of westerns. Bronson is the mysterious stranger, Fonda is one despicable villain, and Robards is HILARIOUS. This is arguably Leone's best film (even though it is Eastwoodless) and i can't recommend it enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People who view movies as foremost an art say "Once Upon A Time In The West" is the best western Sergio Leone ever made. I say "The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly," but that's because I prefer films as entertainment. Films like this one judge you as much as you judge them.A family living on a desert ranch called Sweetwater is gunned down by a gang led by Frank (Henry Fonda), one cold hombre. He brushes off his boss's complaint he was just supposed to scare them by saying: "People scare better when they're dead." Frank in turn is hunted by a stranger known only by the instrument he plays, Harmonica (Charles Bronson). Every time Frank asks Harmonica what his name is, Harmonica gives him the name of someone Frank murdered in his dark and bloody past. Matters come to a head when the new wife of the head of the murdered family, Jill (Claudia Cardinale), stakes her claim to Sweetwater and incurs Frank's wrath.What you have here is an exercise in pure cinema, with incredible compositions, soaring music, an existential subtext that holds up to later reflection, and references to just about every western ever made. What you don't have is very much of a story, at least an intelligible one. Characters get in and out of jams without much explanation, people die suddenly from unexplained causes, there's a final showdown that could have happened at just about any other point of the story with a lot less collateral damage, the hero tears the heroine's dress for no better reason that to make us wonder about him.I don't even like this film as much as I do "For A Few Dollars More," maybe Leone's most satisfying film in its simpler way. But what you are getting here is magical, an expansion of the vocabulary of film. The astonishing opening scene, where three bad guys await Harmonica at a train depot, is alone a quantum leap from anything then in cinema: ambient noise, long shots of people staring at nothing, Jack Elam's battle with a fly.It's a different kind of spaghetti western, that's for sure. There may be less than 30 gunshots in the whole picture, and Leone is using a nearly whole new cast, with a female, Cardinale, as nominal lead. Bronson is a different kind of hero than Clint Eastwood was in Leone's earlier films: humorless, sinister, and laconic to the point of catatonia. The dialogue is still pretty quotable, but there's much less of it this time. An entire faceoff between Jason Robards' tough outlaw Cherokee and a dandy with an itchy trigger finger goes on for about five minutes and has but one word: "Bravo."It's really a western as epic, and an interesting response to anyone who might have thought Leone couldn't have done up anything grander than "Good, Bad, &amp; Ugly." The use of themes and ideas from other Westerns, particularly those of John Ford, give this film a sense of taking stock of cinema's first genre. And Leone is getting it all in, even from the very beginning: That opening shot of Frank's pistol going off into the camera quotes directly from 1904's "The Great Train Robbery," the granddaddy of westerns.I love watching this film unfold in its gradual way, and can't help feeling a sense of exultation over how everything gels, but it's impossible to ignore the flaws. The film drags. There's little humor. Robards' character is never integrated into the rest of the film. Leone's disinterest in plot becomes more apparent, and disabling, as the film goes on.What is Harmonica's purpose here? Is he an angel from God? The Grim Reaper? He seems to serve some mystical function, as Leone's emissary bringing down the curtain on Fonda's Frank, the ultimate bad guy, and the West that spawned him."Once Upon A Time" feels like a dead stop that way, both for Leone (who would make only two more films, neither much appreciated in their day, in the next 20 years) and for the western. They were still churning out good westerns in 1969, like "True Grit", "The Wild Bunch," and "Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid," and even bad ones like "Mackenna's Gold." Just a few years later, they were hardly making any, a drought that continues to this day."Someday," Harmonica says when asked if he'd ever return to Sweetwater. It looks more and more like someday meant never.</fullReview>

It will be a cinematic experience. The word excellent doesn't come close... There are just too many memorable scenes and one-liners to pick just one, but the scene where Jill (Claudia) is riding in the buggy with the landscape surrounding her is like a Rembrandt put into action..

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie during the end of my childhood and I have been shocked. Till that moment Karl May and "famous" East-German Yugoslavian co-production movies were the western films for us with amazing "Indians" like Gojko Mitic. Sometimes pour story, pour implementation, bad movie. Good for socialist export. Some very bad macaroni-westerns have also reached our country by that time, so I had mixed feelings when I have bought form a ticket tout my 200% price ticket for a Sergo Leone ? so another macaroni western ? movie. And the miracle started in the screen. "C'era una volta il West" was totally different from my previous experience. Good story, good characters, famous "capitalist" actors and e real actress (Fod, Bronsosn, Robard and the amazing FEMALE star, C.C.).Even the opening screen was more interesting, than whole films before. The noise in the background, the drinking from the hat, the fly in the gun, etc?This film gave the surprise for me with the first real close-ups, the "premiere-plan" for us.Next day I bought my first harmonica.For thousands of Hungarians changed the mind about westerns, films and fictions. This film made me movie fun!I have seen the movie several times and it never bored me. Even in the 15th occasion I can find some new, some interesting fillips. Well done, Sergio!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my personal favorite of all director Sergio Leone's movies. Watching it, it's almost amazing how perfectly everything comes together. The four main characters each have their own theme music, all of which are haunting tunes that stay in your mind after the movie. All of the performances are excellent- Claudia Cardinale as a world-weary former prostitute, Jason Robards as a romantic "half-breed" bandit, Charles Bronson as a quiet, vengeful vigilante, and Henry Fonda as a sadistic hit man. Each of them are more then they seem, and whether they ultimately prove to be good or bad, they affect everything around them. A sort of grand opera fairy tale, Once Upon a Time in the West may not just be Leone's best movie, but the best Western ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best westerns ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's C'era Una Volta il West belongs to those rare kind of cinematic experiences which one may experience only once in a lifetime. Everything works brilliantly in the film and there's no single fault to be found. It's massive, long, epic western milestone.Acting in the film is fantastic and what makes it eternal is the charisma surrounding the main characters. Charles Bronson has maybe the role of his lifetime as Harmonica, extremely witty and dangerous character seeking revenge. Claudia Cardinale is in her prime and has maybe the most unforgettable woman role in history of western. As the main villain in movie appears Henry Fonda, whose character seems to be the meanest and the most malicious western villain ever controversial to the fact that Fonda had earlier in his career become famous from his roles as a character fulfilling the rules of justice.When above mentioned acting capacity is combined with Leone's virtuosic skills in film-making and astonishing cinematography the result can't really get anymore unique and superb. Every scene in the film is well captured and the overwhelming epic music of Leone's long-term collaborator Ennio Morricone fits perfectly itself on those scenes.C'era Una Volta il West reveals Leone's view of American West in monumental and cinematically fascinating way emphasizing the themes of greed, revenge and maybe the slightly evolving matriarchity as the main elements of the whole film. Overall,the film is immortal and every true film fan should appreciate its mysterious absolutely unachievable, unique Leonean aura, which makes it blossom in its greatness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If he had had Sergio Leone's access to a convincing desert, swarthy extras &amp; a couple of affordable Yanks, Akira Kurosawa might have made "Yojimbo" &amp; "Seven Samurai" into Westerns himself, denying Leone &amp; others the chance to interpret him. But with a big budget and a new vision (a trilogy that would culminate in "Once Upon A Time in America"), Leone makes a film of his very own that stands even with the best of Kurosawa's or anyone else's. New Orleans "lady" Jill(Cardinale, never more beautiful) inherits a patch of worthless, empty desert in the path of an approaching railroad &amp; suddenly finds that she's of great interest to tubercular railroad baron Morton (Ferzetti), his icy hired gun Frank (Fonda), aging bandit Cheyenne (Robards) and a shadowy, harmonica-tooting drifter (Bronson). Long as a summer's day &amp; detailed as the Cistine Chapel, the film never wavers from its sad, beautiful theme: the fall of the free, rugged, wild Old West to the inexorable onslaught of machines, finance, and Order. Despite long stretches of magnificently photographed silence &amp; the presence of the taciturn Bronson, this Western is surprisingly talkative. It wallows a little, as when Cheyenne tells Jill about his mother (give us a break), or when Frank &amp; the drifter discuss the inhumanity of capitalism (wanna read "The Communist Manifesto" 'round the campfire tonight, fellas?). Most of the dialog, though, is as colorfully illustrative as the brilliant Techniscope photography, which depicts Monument Valley better than even John Ford's best (Ford never put Claudia Cardinale in the middle of it, did he?). Lionel Stander, who gave so many fine performances in countless low-budget flicks, finally gets a movie worthy of his unique talent. The always excellent Robards sets the tone of the film as the world-weary badman who see his Old West world rapidly shrinking. Peckinpah's outlaws face the same doom in the contemporary, less lush &amp; more thrilling "Wild Bunch." Ferzetti's Morton, though dying in body, represents unstoppable, industrialized civilization &amp; the invisible but matchless might of money ("Almost like holdin' a gun," Frank tells us, "only much more powerful"). In his only bad-guy role (unless you count "On Golden Pond"), Fonda creates what might be the most chilling Western blackguard ever. It's a wonder that the greatest Western villains were played by atypical stars, including roly-poly Burl Ives in "The Big Country" &amp; all-American John Wayne in "Red River." Fonda's Frank outdoes them both. The film's end after its magnificent, gripping climax drags on too long &amp; descends into sappiness. But the long, nearly wordless opening scene (veteran characters Elam &amp; Strode) is one of the best starts to any movie, using only photography, sound &amp; minimal physical action to set a tone of both comic laziness &amp; slowly building anticipation. Morricone's score is as impressive as any of his others, more haunting than usual &amp; dated with a very '60s electric guitar. Even with Leone's sardonic humor (Cheyenne's comment on the rate of inflation since Judas betrayed Christ is classic), this film shares the thoughtful tone of Ford or Mann Westerns, as well as that of "Once Upon a Time in America," rather than the trademark ghostly wryness of Leone's other Westerns, including the subsequent "Duck, You Sucker." But it's also one of those all-day, luscious escapes that Italian filmmakers (and sort-of Italians, like "Godfather" Coppola) seem to do better than anyone. Among Westerns or any movies, "Once Upon a Time in the West" is a once-in-a-lifetime classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a masterpiece which excels in many areas. Its crowning glory is the way it handles elemental human themes like love, hate and the desire for justice. It also follows an intelligent script which doesn't patronise the audience, but leaves them to work out key points.The four main protagonists Fonda, Bronson, Robards and Cardinale each deliver outstanding performances and of course all the supporting actors are superb as well. But for me, the show stealer is Harmonica (Bronson) whose performance of a man driven by an other-worldly sense of injustice is absolutely mesmerising (the music score helps with this).In all, the performances, directing and music come together for a fantastic two plus hours, which, despite the unhurried pace of the film, keep you riveted to the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, but for one detail</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent plot, the story line moves quite well for a longer movie. It seems anything beyond 2 hours now just drag out far too long. (Anything by Peter Jackson comes to mind) And the acting is superb, especially Hank's acting. There are very few who would have played his part better, especially at the time this movie was made. And quite frankly none of them immediately come to mind. And as the storyline progresses Fonda's portrayal of the desperation in his character is flawless. Almost as if he were the personification of the devil himself, and he knows his time is short. Another note on Fonda, his other main movie that year I believe was "Yours, Mine and Ours" with Lucille Ball. He played two very distinct characters in these movies. It just goes to show the quality of his acting ability.As for the other characters they revealed depth. Save for Bronson's character. Which is how he should be. Because of his experiences he is left changed. As if he is no longer human, nobody can appeal to him any longer. Except for justice and cynicism. He becomes almost as if he were a law of nature rather than a person. Morricone's music score was again ingenious. But this is one item that absolutely drives me insane. In the latest release on DVD it seems that they actually increased the music score volume to the point where it detracts from the movie. And it seems there are a few songs that are overplayed. I believe this detracts from the overall experience. I found I would constantly be adjusting the volume up and down depending upon whether or not we are listening to dialog or music. It seems like if they had first introduced the music loud, then let it fade into the background as the movie progresses it would have been perfect. I know I would buy a new copy if someone would smack the sound editor around and re-release this DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think over time, people will learn that "C'era una volta il West", is one of the best films of maybe all time. It has one: great actors. Two: great screenplay. And three: one of the best directors, in my mind. Sergio Leone.When you see the film "C'era una volta il West". You'll notice that the intro of the film is excellent work that needs to be practiced more often. The fact that there is no music in the beginning of the film for at least twelve minutes, is sign of sure brilliance. Sergio didn't go out and try to be like all the other films out there and have a epic intro with crazy gun fights, he decided to have an intro with no music only sound effects of a windmill and footsteps walking around. In my opinion, I think it's one of the best intro's I've ever seen.Yes, it is 15 minutes shy of three hours. But, if you love cinematography then you'll love how Leone fills the entire film with epic shot after shot.I would highly recommend "Once Upon A Time In The West" to anyone who loves westerns or even a great screenplay with great cinematography.</fullReview>

Sure there are goofs but name an all-time classic that didn't have one and I am sure hundreds will be telling you where to spot them.It's long but I wouldn't have wanted it any other way, as they say pictures can say a thousand words and there were many scenes where you fully understood what was going on.It's a thinkers Movie and like my wife some people can't be bothered to watch and the scenes or the actions of each actor. Charles Bronson is at his best with his smiling face and while some believe he cant act I can see a thousand things he is saying with his Eyes, volcano face and his actions in all his movies.The scene in the bar when Robard's meets Bronson for the first time after just escaping from custody was sheer brilliance as you knew Jason could pick who is a "Real" man and who is a gutless back stabber and it also showed if your brave but not stupid no-one will make a fool out of you and you gain others respect. Yes that's what a lot of people miss, the words that are not said. The idea of a melody for each character was fantastic, while I have seen that in some movies I don't believe I have seen an movie before 1968 and in fact I still haven't seen a music score to come close. At the start you see this scene where all the surrounds was playing music and I felt as if i was in this lonely station for real waiting to shoot Bronson.Tarantino quoted Leone as his all-time hero and I would agree he is one of the best directors and it's a shame he made so few while others made so many.</fullReview>

Well, elsewhere at a famous bookstore site, a review by I. B. Cooper "Beery" states that Leone fully intended AFoD to be ""part 2 of a 'Once Upon a Time' trilogy: 1.('Once Upon a Time in the West' [1880s, Charles Bronson]; 2.'Once Upon a Time, the Revolution' [1900's, James Coburn]; and 3.'Once Upon a Time in America' [1920's, Robert De Niro]).2. is set in Mexico, and in my opinion despite its left wing politics, 'A Fistful of Dynamite' a.k.a. 'Duck, You Sucker' a.k.a. 'Once Upon a Time, the Revolution' fully deserves in place inside the other OUAT bookend movies. And together they form a second magnificent Western trilogy without peer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Story, direction and acting are just top notch in this movie that some might not consider traditional, at all.Indeed, the story, particularly dark and brutal, taking place at the end of the 'far west' era, is not an apogee of a few cowboys but the victory of industrialism over a bunch of lunatics riding horses in empty American deserts. A real change from any other in this category.Yes, the direction is good, a bit cartoon-ish at times. I personally think the first scene, a bit exaggerated given the length it takes, is absolutely fantastic to put the viewer in the right mood for the movie.Acting is strong, with all main characters performing with the correct tempo. That is not true of secondary characters, but in a sense, this gives a bit of humour to this very gloomy picture (under a burning sun!)I forgot to mention: the music is exceptional.</fullReview>

The two most touching parts of the movie for me is close to the end of the movie, when Harmonica (Bronson) is staring out the door after he's killed Frank (Fonda), and Claudia Cardinale asks him if he'll be back one day -Bronson turns, stares with intensity at Cardinale for a second or two, and says "someday" you know he's never coming back.. it's the look on Bronson's face.. another touching moment is when Jason Robards pats Claudia Cardinale on the butt suggesting some of the railroad workers who have not seen a pretty woman in a long while might do the same, and that she should tolerate it -I got the sense of the basic decency of Robard's character, a killer &amp; robber, but lovable in his own way.

		<shortDescription>My favorite Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually don't tend to like really long movies, especially when they are made in a sort of artistic way. But this western is an exception to the rule. It's a true masterpiece of movie making. The beginning, for example, is really special. Usually, I would think it was too odd, but in fact I really liked it. Ennio Morricone's music fits this movie so perfectly. It creates a western-atmosphere that couldn't have been better. In fact, the great atmosphere is what this movie is all about. Yes, the acting and the story both are really great, but it was the special atmosphere that kept me enjoying this movie for almost three hours.</fullReview>

The fly irritating one of the gunman, the drops of water on the hat quenching the other gunman, the click-click-click irritating the 3rd gunman. music is perfect! (each character comes with their own music score). The actors are perfect! I don't want to sound like a broken record... The movie is perfect! Claudine Cardina was beautiful,wonderful,etc. Henry Fonda, Jason Robards, and Charles Bronson (now these are MEN) made a very memorable impression on me in this cinematic work of ART. So did the haunting "spagetti western" music. Basically, to sum it all up...I loved this movie!! 10 out of 10, hands behind my back! @--&gt;--</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best sound track.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was done uniquely by playing the music themes during the filming rather than dubbing later. I don't know of another movie that used this technique. The sound track is a classic, one of the best ever. Each character plays an important role in exemplifying human character and traits especially in the time of the old west, therefore, the title, "Once Upon a Time In The West" is so appropriate. The movie carries one back to that time through their actions and the theme of the ever expanding railroad that took place during that time. There is heartbreak at times followed by success or fulfillment for some of the roles. There is good brought out in the ones who are portrayed as bad, such as Cheyenne. Also, in the end there is death for some, and like in real life everything is not a fairy tale ending. It is a true microcosm of that time in the west, and of the human nature of men and women. The sound track is one of the best ever. This movie can watched over and over again, and every times it can make one realize one's own mortality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great western epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit I loved this film, in my humble opinion it equals the good,the bad and the ugly for the title of "best western ever".Leone is a master of suspense, in spite of the fact that he follows the linear narrative rule that "the "hero" alway wins" he can still create palpable tension in the showdown scenes. As the villain Frank, Henry Fonda gives Lee Van Cleef a run for his money as the most ominous Leone villain.Charles Bronson's Harmonica could take the man with no name anyday, while Claudia Cardinale plays one of cinemas great female characters in Jill McBain. The real star in my opinion is Jason Robards "Cheyenne" a character with a real sense of longing for the love of Jill McBain. (It's a wonder Robards wasn't in more high profile roles) All in All "The west" rivals once upon a time in America as my favourite Leone film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do we romanticize the Old West?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon a time, the old west was shown as a place that made America great. The good guys wore white hats and rode white horses, were clean-shaven with short haircuts and were solid, honorable, god-fearing Christians who were 100% pure as soap. The bad guys wore black, were dirty, had five-o'clock shadows 24/7, and were nothing but hardened criminals. Mexicans were bandits, Native Americans were merciless, slaughtering mobs who killed white men for no reason, Asian-Americans were cooks or railroad workers, Sheepherder's daughters were destined to become victims of greedy landlords with top-hats and pointy mustaches who tied them to the railroad tracks, painted ladies were something we could never figure out the purpose of, and blacks didn't exist. That was what we were mislead to believe about the west until the 1960's, when Sergio Leone showed us that things were never as black-and-white as those old dime-store novels our usual westerns made them out to be with "A Fistful of Dollars"(1964). But soon we were rejecting the John Wayne/John Ford westerns and the Roy Rogers-Gene Autry-type westerns(which were not the same by a long shot), and gained a desire for this image of the west. Leone obviously didn't feel he did the job he desired, until "Once Upon a Time in The West"(1968). Henry Fonda, the man my generation knew as the spokesperson for the GAF ViewMaster, and older generations knew as Tom Joad, is the unlikely villain who'd shoot some little kid, along with the rest of his family if it meant forcing them off land that a railroad tycoon wants. And it's a scene that's genuinely sad. Looking at this we can never believe that we were so stupid as to glamorize the old west the way Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, and our local kiddie show hosts taught us to.Then we remember why we like it -- the revenge. This was the REAL "code of the west," not the myth that we were taught to believe as kids. We can't wait for somebody like Charles Bronson to make the villains pay, even if he IS just doing it for himself. And we realized that the heroes weren't as good as we thought, but they were still good. Nor were the damsels-in-distress as pure and helpless as we thought, or the villains as bad or disconnected from the powers that be as we thought. And it's the fact that being a "quick draw" wasn't just a way to show off, but an important survival skill. Sylvester Stallone said it best in DEMOLITION MAN(1993): "The wild west wasn't even the wild west." If this movie doesn't lay those old myths to rest, very few westerns made before the 1970's will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Must have been busy during the year 1968 to have missed such a great Western film with Great Actors of the Silver Screen! The picture captured my interest from the very start to the finish. The photography of the pioneer days with a railroad being built in great detail, old railroad cars and outstanding scenery made this a Classic Film. Henry Fonda,(Frank),"Home to Stay",'78 TV, played a very very hateful character who caused a great deal of pain to many people in this film. Claudia Cardinale,(Jill McBain),"Sniper",'87,was a very strong willed woman who would do ANYTHING to save her life or her ambitions and had some very warm and sexy scenes. Jason Robards,(Manuel 'Cheyenne' Gulierrez),"Square Dance",'87, played a very interesting character who had a great deal of depth to his way of thinking! Charles Bronson,(Harmonica),"Love &amp; Bullets",'79, made his eyes pierce right into your body and soul and had a great PAYBACK to finalize with a certain PERSON! Great film, ENJOY!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Got to say that this film is something of a masterpiece.....Just listen to the use of sound, check the camera angles and the intense plot. This movie took a few times to watch though to the end but when I saw the twist I have to say I was impressed. I think LEONE to be a highly underrated filmmaker when one considers that The unforgiven (a good film) won an Oscar (although so did Rocky so I guess this cheapens the award).This really is a tour de force in the genre and is highly recommended. I acknowledge the "boring" tag that some viewers have applied to this film. But the lul in the middle only heightens the finale.Modern sterile film makers should take note of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say? A masterpiece by the master director with considerable help from the master composer and a superb cast.The only slight complaint I have about this magnificent film is that I wish Henry Fonda had not played the bad guy. Why, oh why, wasn't Frank played by Lee Van Cleef?But casting of the other lead roles played by Robards, classic stage actor, and Bronson, the ultimate screen heavy, was perfect. As for Cardinale, well, could Loren or Taylor have done it better, perhaps? I'll give Claudia nine out of ten for this one. She was good and above all she was gorgeous.But ultimately the film belongs to Bronson with Robards hard on his heels.The enigmatic character of Harmonica, who slides in and out of shots like a ghost (which perhaps he was), entrances the audience. Never more so than when he makes the hero's one allowed mistake and is taken prisoner on the train. Here he becomes our guide while Robards shoots up Frank's henchmen in stylistic and semi-amusing fashion.The showdown is actually not as good as the one in The Good the Bad and the Ugly, but that is only one scene. Even so the sheer horror of Harmonica's reason for revenge is unsurpassed.If Frank had been the defendant in Twelve Angry Men, I don't think Mr Fonda would have voted "not guilty".Eleven out of ten for this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Leone's greatest Western stars Henry Fonda, Jason Robards, Charles Bronson and Keenan Wynn in an epic tale of the Old West, with Bronson on the vengeance trail and Fonda bent on taking over a ranch owned by Claudia Cardinale, with only Bronson to thwart his plans. The film is admittedly long, and even longer when viewed on TV, when broken up by commercials. But it is like a great Renaissance painting, with long, telling and often silent takes on various characters' faces, especially their eyes. No one says much here, and no one needs to. The expressiveness of it all is absolutely amazing. The story and screenplay were written by Bertolucci and Argento! It doesn't get much better than that. The cinematography and the music are outstanding, and only Claudia Cardinale's outdated makeup and hairdo give away the era in which is it was shot. Otherwise, you might think it was shot this very year. A must-see for both Western and art film fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what can I say?Surely one of the finest westerns ever to grace the silver screen, from the fantastic "longest-ever opening sequence," embellished with an orchestra of diegetic sounds to the epic tale that ensues. Littered with wonderful symbolism and aided by possibly the greatest score ever written by the genius that is Ennio Morricone. Henry Fonda portrays a formidable bad-guy with other great turns all round by the cast. The brilliance for me is in each main character's story and the wider picture of America's birth through the importance about the rail network - there are just so many levels to it. Not to mention (without wishing to give anything away) the finale and the way violence itself is portrayed. The enigma of Harmonica and the underlying linear suspense that takes us to the end also should be merited. What a film - an amazing way to round-off Sergio Leone's previous masterful endeavours in the genre. Should be higher in the top 250 really.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Once Upon a Time in the West" was almost never made. After the "Dollar" trilogy director Sergio Leone wanted to move on to other things, but the studios urged him to make one more of his excellent spahgetti westerns. This film is the result of that.The plot circles on the four main characters: Jill (Claudia Cardinale), a beautiful woman who's new family was just shot down; Frank (Henry Fonda), the evil gunslinger who shot them; Cheyenne (Jason Robards), the bandit accused of the slaughter and Harmonica (Charles Bronson), a mysterious gunslinger tracking Frank for unknown reasons. The four characters start off by themselves, but as the story progresses they meet each other - under circumstances bad and good - and confront each other, all in Leone's excellent Spahgetti Western style.Though I did like "For a Few Dollars More" and "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" just a little more than this, "Once Upon a Time in the West" has an equal amount of style and substance. Jill is, in nature, a tramp, and we get to see her develop throughout the film. Harmonica doesn't have much developement, but he still leaves us with a lasting impression (and it is Bronson's best performance). Fonda does evil very well, he is scary and intimidating here. Robards delivers the film's best performance, as his characters takes an unexpected, dramatic turn near the end. Jason Robards was a terrific actor, may he rest in peace.And then there is the style too, of course. The opening credits last ten minutes into the movie, ten quiet minutes of three guys quietly waiting at a train station, with sounds like a fly and a drip of water the only noise (brilliant beginning). This is not Morricone's best score, but it's not bad either, and it captures the moments just like his scores in the other Spahgetti Westerns.One of the greatest Westerns of all time, and a lot of fun, 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bang...bang...bang the old west is gone! Leone's last western movie is also the first gangster one. There starts a new trilogy, the one about modern America. No more heroes with no name on horses; but landlords, capitalists and gangsters, in the train (the first link between East and West coast). America is now one and done! The epitaph on the Old West is the definitive western movie. No need to say anything more about it: it is now well dead and buried. And beautifully. The initially underrated Spaghetti Western genre ended up teaching the American directors how to make proper clever and not rhetoric westerns (boring John Wayne ones). Close ups, character psychology, music score, timing, epic, story plot, everything here is achieved at perfection. The only American director who could be compared to Seregio Leone for his innovations is Peckinpah, for his attempts to make the old western genre alive again with some originality in The Wild Bunch or Pat Garreth &amp; Billy the Kid, nevertheless Leone is still, by large, my favourite. This is probably not as entertaining as The Good the Bad and the Ugly, but the aim and the results are broader: this is a true masterpiece, it is the portrait of an entire era which is ending and the start of a new one. it is Sergio Leone at his best (= cinema at its best!). A Masterpiece. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a film for people with short attention spans, so those of you who have grown up on MTV, don't bother with this one. You won't like it.Once Upon a Time in the West is one of the greatest westerns because instead of showing us unrealistic hero-type characters (um, Clint Eastwood, anyone?) it gives us regular people living their lives in realistic situations.This film proves Roger Ebert's saying "no good film is too long" -- yes, it unfolds at a snails pace, but, like Leone's wonderful shot of Monument Valley, you have to pull back and look at the big picture. If you're expecting a Jerry Bruckheimer "film", this movie will drive you nuts. But if you like good long movies, you can't do better than this. After 165 minutes, I could go back to the beginning and watch it all over again. How many movies can you say that about?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern work of art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After many years, I recently saw this movie again on the fantastic DVD they've released. There are very few westerns, maybe very few movies of any kind that can match the artistry of this picture. From the opening sequence to the climactic ending it has a gliding, almost still-life pace that might throw a contemporary viewer off. In stark contrast to the action-junkie flicks so common today, the contemplative approach to the sweeping vistas and powerful but short-lived violence elevates this ultimate spaghetti western to an opera. As they say in one of the commentaries, the actors sing with their eyes.All the acting is good if not great; the cast seems to be perfect for the mostly laconic personalities they portray. Even the bit parts flesh out the fairly simple plot. The magnificent setting and scenery play up the timelessness of the human struggle.I knew that this movie has tributes to previous westerns, but until you watch the movie with commentary I don't think anyone except true movie western fanatics would know just how many westerns have had a little of their imagery and plot entwined with Once Upon a Time in the West. If you like this movie, get the DVD and you'll be amazed how well it still works today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Would you like some western?Well, let's take some wild west small town sceneries, a bad guy with his gang, a greedy businessman looking only for his own goals, a defenceless beauty, an unnamed invincible hero with mysterious past and a tough but good-hearted rogue buddy. Mix it with a revenge motive, add a dramatic stand-off in the end and that should do it.I almost heard you saying "What a crap!". There were times when I thought the same about westerns full of cliches and a thin plot. But it has all changed when I saw Once Upon a Time In the Wild West. Sergio Leone appereantly decided to put all western cliches into one movie in such a way that it makes sense. And it makes more than that. This movie leaves one hell of an impression!Leone doesn't narrate. He exerts a slow pace motion picture and lets you think about all the implications and explanations of what is being showed. From every single motive and scene he makes a special encounter for the viewer. Instead of words he lets the actor's faces and the musical score to tell the story. He gives additional dimensions to the characters - suddenly you feel sorry for the businessman, respect to the bad guy and understanding for the beauty. You catch yourself looking two minutes into a man's face without being bored or annoyed. And you don't want this movie to end.It's not just a boring art film for weirdos. In fact, I know a lot of guys who like only action packed block-busters and still were amazed by this movie. It's the essence of it - somehow all the things needed for a good film crossed in one point. Everything fitts in its place. The music by Morricone has already become legendary and the few harmonica tones have become an expression so often cited in other movies. Henry Fonda looks like he should have only played bad guys from the beginning of his career, Bronson is simple and accurate as the revenge itself and Claudia Cardinale shows how a struggle-to-survive look like with a sense of virtuosity.Leone shows respect to the viewer - he doesn't think the viewer is dumb. He lets the story to unravel in an intricate, almost a detective-story like way. He will let you wonder what drives the characters to their actions and he explains some events only after a considerable time in a stylish Leone(TM)way. I firstly saw this movie as a child and I didn't understand everything that happened there but still I was thrilled and charmed. I always get annoyed by the exaggerated pause when the moderator says "And the academy award goes to..." But here Leone lets you enjoy the thrill. The final stand-off scene lasts 8 minutes - it merely consists of two man watching each other, impressive music and a final shot. And it tastes like enjoying a glass of good wine for a wonderfully extended moment instead of dipping it in all at once. Like, in fact, all the rest of this movie.Go see it - no matter if you have seen it before or not.</fullReview>

Maybe not for YOU, but it's just to let you think about how films can actually get to little girls and shape how they see stars. These men were..well..the paramount to what men should be. I see that there was a woman in this...that's nice. I also know the plot revolves around her..but I had her killed off in my mind the moment she came on the screen. Bring on the guys! They each had "that something", and it really wasn't all about looks. Henry Fonda wasn't that good looking but he was handsome, rugged. Charles Bronson, well what is there to say about the strong silent type with those blue eyes and dust beaten almost leathery skin? Woody Strode, just sculptured yummy!!! And Jack Elam...ya just gotta love that ole scruffy teddy bear. The first 15 or so minutes of this film is what I watch over and over again and never tire of it.

		<shortDescription>Leone's best film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The western to end all. A film about American mythology, to which end Henry Fonda is central as a sadistic hitman. This role pretty much undoes his whole career of do-gooding (with the exception of "Fort Apache", which, it has been noted before, shows signs of influence on "Once Upon a Time..."), but more so it also undoes a "mythological" complex in American film. The film's shallowness is in its inability to produce any artistic or philosophic alternative to the myth. Its attempt to do this is Claudia Cardinale as "earth mother"/water bearer. Her character, the protagonist, is interesting and there are many parallels to Joan Crawford in "Johnny Guitar" (redeemed prostitute, the "dream" of a rail station, etc.). The images are blazing with truth, and the characters are fantastic. We even get to see Woody Strode and Jack Elam in a memorable opening scene involving a fly (possibly a touch characteristic of contributing author Dario Argento?). Bronson is very good in the role of the "man with no name" or "man with the harmonica" or whatever you want to call him. The music is some of Morricone's best.This is a western film that is about westerns, about the West, about America, about Europe, about art and death. It impresses me that Fonda's character is not truly evil: he's actually a petty, unsuccessful hitman, out to grab a piece of the West, and doomed to fail. This makes him no less frightening, for he is a dangerous man. But it does strike a blow at the whole image of the "villain" in the West which, if this film had been seen by more people, might have undone the whole genre (much as his previous "Fistful of Dollars" undid the hero in the genre).</fullReview>

The way the music stops occasionally over Robards character Cheyenne is sheer mastery.

		<fullReview>In the West men take their time. There's nothing hurrying them, as every day is the same as the other, and what cannot be done today, can be done tomorrow. So nothing presses you to answer quickly, or even talk. You can think a lot before speaking, and the other will wait for you. There are two things that do pass quickly: bullets and trains. The first one was the symbol of power (the power of disrupting the monotonous life of the West), until the latter came. As it's beautifully said by Frank: sitting behind Morton's desk feels almost like holding a gun, but more powerful. Morton's Locomotive brought, above all, History and Progress to the West. Time started to run, and bullets cannot stop time.I think that what amuses us from the Wild West is exactly that: the struggle to stop time, to conquest the unconquerable: eternity. The fight between that pre-Modern time where the most powerful ruled (like the adjective Wild said: it was the Law of the Jungle), and the unstoppable Locomotive of History; that feeling of emptiness of knowing that what was once the Reign of tough guys like Charles Bronson, today there's nothing but Highways and Casinos.Once upon a time in the West is the perfect archetype of Spaghetti Westerns, and it has all the tropes a Western should have: the tough, thoughtful good guy, the secondary good guy, ugly, that says everything the protagonist doesn't, the bad guy who's almost as good shooting as the good guy, the coward businessman who wants to build the railroad to the Pacific at any cost, the hot woman that makes the plot move forward (not quite the damsel in distress, but another as patriarchal trope: the hot woman who doesn't mind f*cking her way out of life, that seems strong and independent but that in the end is always submitted to men, just in another way). It has a final pistol gunfight where the quickest to shot wins, it has amazing trademark music that marks the appearance of the good guy across the movie.But it's slow. It's damn slow. Perhaps it just wanted to inspire the feelings I describe at the beginning about time in the West, perhaps it just owes itself to a time when going to the cinema was quite an event, and you could keep people marveled in front of a big screen for three hours. Today, however, it's not so good that after the first 30 minutes nothing has happened and only a few lines have been delivered. Today, and unlike many other old movies, this film is not entertaining, and it stands only as a museum piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spellbinding movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spellbinding from the opening; a slow simmering build wrought by nothing more than Ennio Morricone's legendary score and some haunting shots from Leone, right the way to the close; a supremely satisfying conclusion, inevitable yet riveting none the less. Performances from a selection of actors all giving career defining performances, not least Charles Bronson, never better. It's also one of Jason Robards most three-dimensional portrayals, and of course there's Henry Fonda playing stridently against type in a chilling display of steel. An all time favourite, not least because I discovered it on TV one night with absolutely no prior knowledge. So do yourself a favour, pour a whisky and settle in for a slow building masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The harmonica player</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon a time in the west has taken its time to achieve classic status in comparison to Sergio Leone's other western. The reasons, no Clint Eastwood and Henry Fonda playing a bad guy which was a turn off for American audiences at the time.Charles Bronson plays Harmonica, the hero of the story but like Eastwood's cowboy with no name this is a hero with rough edges. He has ghosts to exorcise.Leone takes his time to tell his epic story, with visuals and music playing an important part as the story. There is plenty of sly humour, plenty of stillness.Bronson who started out playing bad guys and graduated eventually to hero status is inspired casting as Harmonica. Claudia Cardinale is beautiful and alluring as the former good time girl who comes to town and immediately becomes a widow. Jason Robards also gives a powerful performance as an outlaw with a heart and tenderness towards Cardinale's widow.Henry Fonda relishes playing a villain but I can understand the audience of the day being conflicted, just as as modern day audience would be uneasy seeing Robert Redford playing a bad guy in some Marvel film!The film lacks the immediate attention of the Dollars trilogy, but as you watch it you appreciate this movie just as time itself has been kind to it and its reputation has soared.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Western Drama so distilled and refined, One of the best I have ever seen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the pioneers of cinema, Sergio Leone's directorial venture' The Good The Bad The Ugly 'urged me to gain high amount of cinematic fanaticism by watching one of his most critically lauded ' Once Upon A Time in The West'. The film gets successfully enlisted among one of the most terrific performances ever by the ensemble cast.The movie opens up with a deadly gun duel between a harmonica playing bloke (Charles Bronson) and three men dressed in a cowboy outfit. Bronson plays the enigmatic nameless person (called 'Harmonica' in the film because of his ability to play harmonica in an eerie fashion even when things appear to look serious ) being the only good guy in the film. He helms the task of protecting Brett McBain's widow Jill McBain against Frank and his fellow gangsters after the villains mercilessly massacre McBain and his children. Joining Harmonica in his mission to kill Frank is Cheyenne , the bearded bandit who is falsely framed by Frank in murder of Brett McBain. Thus, Harmonica along with the ruffian Cheyenne set out to bring down the most dreaded assassin Frank. However retribution remains their sole purpose.The film is slow-paced and the viewer is clueless about the real reason behind McBain's murder even after the half time of the movie has passed. There are bloodless fights, revenge, intimate scenes, land rights, shootouts, trains and you are only required to eat what Leone gives you, simply without questioning the plot. Things perfectly fall in place in the latter half of the movie as you get to know that Leone exhibits complete veracity while directing the Western drama. The action scenes are carefully designed and they can surely put the modern day jumbled action to utter shame. The film was bankrolled with plenty of money as it had elaborate sets, brilliant casting and fantastically executed duels.One of the most amazing western dramas I have ever seen, Once Upon A Time In The West is as distilled, refined and clear as it appears to be.9 on 10 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is for sure the best movie ever done. It is a perfect Western. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is certainly overrated if we compare that movie with the masterpiece that is Once Upon a Time in the West. The choice of the actors was perfect, Claudia Cardinale, Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, Jason Robards. The soundtrack is awesome, soundtrack conducted by the Great Ennio Morricone. And It was directed by the Great Sergio Leone. Even with a story that we cant't say that is great, it can keep us focused for almost 3 hours, and i can watch the movie over and over again. Excellent movie, just like all the others from Sergio Leone, but for sure that it's the best movie from this director and one of the best of all times...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Western Of All Time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone is one of the greatest directors of all time that does need to be repeated, because it has been known now for decades. When it comes down too which of his films is the best. I would normally say "The Good The Bad And The Ugly" is his best film. But his best western is no doubt "Once Upon A Time In The West". The film opens with a man with no name, but he's often called in this film "Harmonica". Charles Bronson one of the toughest true men to ever grace Hollywood pictures plays harmonica. He actually doesn't speak as often as you would think, but I personally think that's his style. Always quiet, with that serious look on his face. Opposite Charles Bronson is Jason Robarts as Cheyenne. I love his personality. He just has a fun time messing with people especially Harmonica never taking him seriously, but as the film continues on, his relationship with Harmonica improves, and he even saves his life, "In one of the best train scenes ever captured on film". But my personal favorite is Henry Fonda as Frank the main villain of the film. Frank is ruthless; he doesn't care about anyone except himself. He also hates Harmonica, he has the opportunity to kill him many times through out the film but he doesn't, Frank always keeps you guessing. And in turn Harmonica even saves his life. The final scene is one of the most epic scenes ever. Harmonica and Frank stand off against one another. I don't have a lot of time to mention much more of the cast but I will say they are all perfect. The soundtrack is also fantastic, but you can be the judge of that for yourself. Just to sum it up, with an amazing cast, beautiful soundtrack, and a great director, this is my pick for the greatest western of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>237 comments to date on this film alone. Many 10 out of 10's. Why? If you have never seen this film, or have been put off by its extraordinary length, don't be, watch it and understand why it provokes such a reaction. The bottom line? If you like westerns, then watch this, afterwards try and convince me that it isn't the best of all time, bar none.Don't get me wrong, I am from an age where we saw nothing BUT westerns, we played westerns, TV was full of western series, so I have seen them all. Yes, there are many other fabulous 10 out of 10 westerns, but, even acknowledged classics like High Noon, The Wild Bunch, even Sergios other two (!) do not quite reach the level that Once Upon a Time in the West has.Knee jerk reaction perhaps, but any time someone asks me my thoughts on what the greatest film of all time (let alone westerns), I blurt out Once Upon a Time....Fonda, Robards, Cardinale, Strode, Elam, and above all, Bronson, who would have belived that such a mix of stars would result in the absolute perfection you see in this film.And the music, a tune for each character, what a superbly simple and effective idea.Wonderful, it blew me away when it came out (I sat through it twice on the trot - you could do that then!) I have never lost my enthusiasm for it. I blessed the day it arived on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly great western from an all-star cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has many surprises. Some plot twists and even a bit of odd humor such as Jack Elam near the beginning fussing over a pesky fly crawling on him. Only a guy with his face could inject humor into that situation! I felt the acting by the all star cast was excellent. Their names were the main reason I chose it from Netflix on DVD. There were a few times when the plot seemed to slow to a crawl and I was tempted to hit the fast forward but I'm glad I didn't. It takes one awhile to get into the "mood" of this movie. Everything was done for an effect.The extreme facial close-ups were likely intended to etch the actors feelings into our conscious. However, after just so many of them I began to feel as though I was being spied on. Really, I like Bronson, Fonda, and Robards, but do not want them "in my face". Ms. Cardinale would be okay! You will get to know every crease, mole, and pore on their faces. Sorry but that is too much for me. The rest of the movie was great. The vast scenery of Arizona and Utah along with the realism of the trains, the buildings and the depiction of a virgin railroad being built were fantastic! I love those old steam engines huffing and puffing along. The large log home where the family lived was incredibly majestic.Sorry if I offend, but the ending didn't measure up to the rest of the movie. There was a semi finale, a showdown, and then the actual ending. The person who I thought would stay didn't, and some of the people you thought would live happily ever after didn't. Maybe I missed something but I never figured out how the ranch ended up in the hands of the person who really deserved it. When you watch it you will understand what I mean. I can't say too much more without revealing the end. (I hate when that happens.)I rate this 9 out of 10. (I almost never give a 10, it takes a "Lawrence of Arabia" or a "Gone with the Wind" to get 10 from me)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never been a big fan of Westerns and I guess I never will... but this isn't just a movie in which some white men chase the bad guys and shoot some Indians in the meantime. No, this is so much better. Once Upon a Time in the West is such an unbelievably great movie, that it made me forget all my reserves about Westerns for once. It hasn't lost any of it's greatness, even after more than 35 years. It's like a beautiful painting or a fine wine: It only gets better by aging but it takes some time to fully appreciate it. Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone always knew how to make a movie speak for itself. They don't need a 20-minute dialog to say what they have to say. No, they do it with the images and the music. The expressiveness of it all is absolutely amazing.This movie should be seen by everyone. Don't think you will not like it because you don't like Westerns. You'll be blown away by this one. There is only one appropriate score for this one and that is 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Staggeringly good western with a neat brew of actors.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The word leisurely is too fast-paced a word to describe this lengthy, exceptionally well-crafted film, so that will likely put off the fast-forward, channel-surfing crowd right away. However, for lovers of art and cinema and the hybrid of the two that occasionally occurs, this is a feast. Famed Italian director Sergio Leone crafted a mammoth, yet intimate western that ranks among the greatest examples of the genre. Cardinale stars as a woman with a checkered past, coming west to live with her new Irish husband and his children from a previous marriage. Right before she arrives, they are slaughtered by Fonda, a cold henchman whose been hired to clear (at almost any cost) the way for railroad tracks. Bronson is a harmonica-playing drifter who steps in to help Cardinale, but has his own agenda. Robards is a criminal, out to punish Fonda for masquerading as him during the killings. Ferzetti is a wealthy crippled man who will stop at nothing to realize his dream of viewing the Pacific Ocean from the window of his private train car. The unlikely quartet of buxom beauty Cardinale, legendary everyman Fonda, Mount Rushmore-esque Bronson and Method actor Robards blends surprisingly well and results in a fascinating melange of acting talent. Cardinale (despite the 1960's trappings of huge hair and heavy eye makeup) gives a thoughtful, committed performance and her ample assets are loved heartily by the camera. Fonda (in a completely uncharacteristic role) lets his cool blue eyes do a lot of the work for him but supplements greatly with his arresting gait, sharp timing and understated sarcasm. Bronson is perfect for his tough, mysterious role. he and Fonda make an intriguing pair of adversaries. Robards brings wit, depth and interest to his part as well. Ferzetti is strangely sympathetic as the driven man who has opened Pandora's Box and then can't contain it anymore. His relatively benign dream sets off a parade of violence beyond his imagination. The whole film is given top notch treatment in the camerawork, production design, lighting, sound, editing and especially in the music. Revered composer Ennio Morricone wrote the music based on the script (!) and Leone actually directed the film, in spots, to coincide with it, rather than the reverse. This has a noticeable and mind-boggling effect on the viewer. There are several magnificent set pieces in the film including (but not limited to): the excruciatingly slow, yet intriguing, opening sequence, the murder of the Irish family, the gunfight in town as Fonda is targeted and the final showdown between Bronson and Fonda. The film's few faults (obviously Italian actors as American characters, occasional dubbing issues, hair and makeup) scarcely matter in a film this grand. There is creativity and introspection in virtually every frame. Even the resolution of Bronson's mysterious character is more than one might expect (it isn't the usual, "You killed my father!" routine.) The film is not going to appeal to the slam-bang, non-stop action crowd, but for those who love the grandeur and artistry of cinema (or even just a good ol' fashioned western revenge tale), this one is hard to top.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent cinematography, an intriguing story, and memorable characterizations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I have a confession to make. This is the first Sergei Leone film I have ever seen (unless you count catching part of his 1984 gangster flick on TV one time). The film takes its time getting to know the people, and it takes just about that long to figure out just what is going on. But once everything is said and done, this is one heck of an epic western. Henry Fonda stars in a rare turn as Frank, a villain so charming one could almost forget he's a cold-hearted killer. He works for a railroad baron doing his dirty work, but he's starting to move up in the world, much to the chagrin of his employer, Mr. Morton. Frank is responsible for the massacre of an Irish landholder and his family, shortly before the man's new wife, Claudia Cardinale, arrives from New Orleans. The murder was set up to look like Cheyenne, (a wise-cracking Jason Robards) a notorious outlaw, is responsible. In another story thread, a mysterious stranger who plays a harmonica (Charles Bronson) is after Frank in a revenge plot that is not revealed until the end. Harmonica and Cheyenne end up teaming together, because each of them has there own reason to want Frank or Morton dead, be it an old score or protecting a reputation.Halfway through the movie, The Widow McBain (Cardinale) loses my sympathy. She's a whore from New Orleans, and as is revealed with Frank, one willing to do anything to survive. Bronson plays an average Bronson role, while Jason Robards nearly steals the show as an outlaw who shoots his mouth off more than his gun. Fonda injects his character with a kind of sympathetic psychosis, so that while he understands guns better than he understands money, and uses them to cause great damage, he ends up not much worse than Bronson or Robards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally, I like my films to conclude in ninety minutes. Most films aren't good enough to last longer- except the great ones- and this is one of them. A great, masterful story that is not afraid to take its time. How many stylish westerns have I seen? Well, I can count them on one hand- and this one has style to burn. The acting and the photography were sublime. And the faces! What glorious faces! I so enjoyed this cast. Henry Fonda was just delicious in an atypical role. Claudia Cardinale was at her most beautiful. Jason Robards and Charles Bronson were just wonderful- and I am not a Bronson fan, by any means. I've heard that the opening sequence of this film is "too long" with "nothing going on." Nonsense- it sets up the entire film. And who can forget the sweeping score- one of my favorites. I can watch this film back to back with my other favorite- "The Wild Bunch"- and believe me, that's a lot of sitting! And well worth the time invested.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A note to Dollars fans expecting another action-drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting --- this film is over two and a half hours long and the action sequences are few and far between?yet I never felt that the movie was overlong or dragging at times. Still, it can a be movie that's difficult to enjoy as you might with other movies, including westerns like "A Fistful of Dollars". This may be due to the fact that the film has smaller senses of adventure and humor in it and spends all of its time studying serious, even sad, themes. Over the 165 minutes of screen time, you'll also listen to a lot of calm, thoughtful dialogue between the characters rather than watch the ingenious scheming of Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name from the Dollars trilogy. Eastwood's star power, not present for this Leone film, is missed, but fortunately we have Henry Fonda playing an infrequent villain role. As Frank, the veteran gunman in the employ of an industrialist, Fonda gets to showcase his talent to play a particularly menacing, disturbing killer. Of course, since it's Fonda you're watching, you'll probably maintain a certain affinity for him, but you can't deny his quiet creepiness during his arrival at the McBain plantation or in the "Keep your lovin' brother happy!" scene. Be aware, however, that Frank is also played as a more normal character during certain parts; here, his evil side is conveyed in a low-key manner at most. From all the hype I heard before watching the film, I was almost expecting Frank to be an over-the-top supervillain of some kind. The characterization in the actual film is a bit more realistic and intriguing than a mere killing machine would be.One other notable feature is Jason Robards as a bandit leader who is not entirely criminal at heart. But his conversion from an ominous escapee to a sympathetic conversation partner for Jill McBain is sort of strange. You'll eventually notice how he starts to act and sound just like Humphrey Bogart playing a gentle, likeable hero! Rather incongruous with his early image of a hardened crook that can fight his way out of a prison escort!Fans expecting something like Leone's Eastwood films may find this boring, but if you're in the mood for a long, thoughtful drama rather than something with more action, you'll be pleased by this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone's west comes alive on the screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So you ask, how a movie what starts with 10 minutes of menacing staring and waiting in train station can be labeled as one of the best western movies there is? Where is the big battle against the Indians or fast galloping posse following an outlaw, thats the question. The answer is simple, less is more if you know how to do it right. And that opening scene does that brilliantly, it shows the viewer exactly what to expect. Almost cartoonish characters, rough atmosphere and suspense, you just know there wont be John Wayne type hero coming to save the day.As the movies progress, the plot and questions are being answered in a slow but very rewarding way. The protagonist played by Bronson is interesting and almost mysterious character because at times you have no idea about his intentions but then again just a look in his eyes or note played from his harmonica can tell you a lot. The first time when I saw him play that harmonica instead of talking, I found it a bit ironic but as the movie went on I started to understand it, because the only purpose he is there is to have payback with frank, so he doesn't want business with anyone else.Henry Fonda is great as the antagonist and Jason Robards adds so much to the movie, his character can be liked but also disliked at times, what makes it so enjoyable to watch. Claudia Cardinale's Jill brings credibility and puts the whole story together. And Morricone's music makes the scenes come alive, its a shame that nowadays movie soundtracks doesn't support the movie the same way as they used to.As conclusion, Once Upon a Time in the West is in my opinion Leone's most complete work and a great achievement in movie making. There is only one question left, could this story really have been true or is it only a fairy tale. As the title says: Once Upon a Time...so its up to the viewers to decide that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I have not seen all his films, I have yet to see a Sergio Leone film I hate. The movies I have seen of his are visually gorgeous with superb scores and interesting stories and characters. Once Upon a Time in the West is no exception. It is long and slow, but I think the film was deliberately paced like that.Once Upon a Time in the West does take a lot of risks, including improvising the action around the score's moods. This was a risk that paid off. The story is rich and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking and beautifully written. Leone also proved what a fine director he was by directing so wonderfully on this film.The characters are great and quite complex, and are further advantaged by being wonderfully portrayed. There is the brutish gunfighter, the beautiful widow, the mysterious harmonica player and the sympathetic outlaw. Henry Fonda particularly does brilliantly in the role of Frank. The visuals once again are exquisite and quite grandiose in its scope and beauty, while Ennio Morricone's wonderfully operatic-like score fully justifies why he is considered one of the all-time great film composers.All in all, a big and bold western and one unlike any other. It also took risks, ones which could have gone horribly wrong but due to the evident work and care of all involved, they paid off. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Kurosawa than John Wayne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this picture as a kid. At the time, I could have described it as some of the coolest movie gunfight scenes separated by long stretches of ... nothing! I recently had the chance to see director's cut of Once upon a time in the West, and how different it seemed through the eyes of an adult. I was struck by how this was truly a movie about the most powerful and primal emotions: hate, lust, greed and revenge - mostly revenge. It' s the more like a Greek tragedy. Watching the movie, I felt that whatever the reasons why Leone had chosen a western genre (aesthetic, practical who knows?), the story was so universal it could have taken place anytime or anywhere. We feel we are in a universe much closer to Kurosawa's than John Wayne's. The violence in Once upon a time caused a sensation when the movie was first released. At the time, it was denounced as gratuitous, yet on viewing, one becomes aware of how fundamental it is to the movie. Sergio Leone displayed the themes with a brutality and raw energy which was only emerging in the movie mainstream (think Easy Rider, etc). This is definitely not your run of the mill western.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though it may not be as fun and light hearted as The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, it is certainly much more artistic. Whether that's a good or a bad thing, I'm not sure. The shots and scenes sometimes seem to linger just a bit too long - the Jason Robard character's introductory scene, for example.Certainly the best things about the film are the soundtrack and the inevitable showdown at the end. Leone has few equals when it comes to the use of a soundtrack. Likewise, Ennio Morricone is one of the very few composers accomplished enough to have his own rabid fan following.Claudia Cardinale is simply breathtakingly beautiful. Henry Fonda is delightfully evil. At first I was disappointed that Eastwood wasn't in the lead role as with Leone's first three westerns, but Bronson's coldness fits the Harmonica's single-minded revenge oriented character far better than Eastwood's sly and ever-composed Man With No Name could.Personally, I think The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is a better movie, mostly because of the Tuco character adding some much needed levity to such an exhaustingly long film. Once Upon a Time in the West is certainly worth seeing, though, and is still far and away one of the best westerns ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's follow up to his superlative "Man With No Name" trilogy is highly acclaimed in some circles, a bit too much so to be honest, but is still a well acted story of a woman(beautiful Claudia Cardinale) who comes to the west as a mail-order-bride, only to find that her would-be family was wiped out by a cold-hearted gunfighter(Henry Fonda, cast effectively against type). She nonetheless vows to carry on, and is later helped by a man known as Harmonica(Charles Bronson) who has also vowed to kill the same man that killed her family.Sprawling story details the westward expansion by train that transformed America irrevocably, ending many ways of life. I did like this film, it is stylish and ambitious, with a good score, but it does become tedious at times, not to mention uncomfortable(Fonda's scenes with Cardinale, for instance...) I just didn't like it anywhere near as much as "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly", but film is still memorable, just not a "classic".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have never seen such an array of tan, greasy faces, darkened by make up to a point that's positively Polynesian. It sets off the glistening white teeth we see during the infrequent grins but we don't see many grins. The default facial expression is the meaningful scowl. The most amusing display of meaningful scowls in at the very beginning, when three grimy dudes in long flapping dusters, including Western icons Jack Elam and Woody Strode, gather at the railroad station, waiting to kill the good guy, Charles Bronson. (Fat chance.) The director, Sergio Leone, gives us a long sequence in which Elam has a duel of wits with a fly that insists on landing on his chin or his lip. He manages to capture the dim-witted fly in the barrel of his Colt, caps the muzzle with a finger tip, and listens with delight as the fly buzzes angrily about inside the pistol.Another good scene. A henchman is sitting alongside the open window of a moving train. A cowboy boot descends from above. The henchman gapes at it. The toe of the boot turns towards the henchman's face and explodes. There is a pistol inside and the bullet forms a neat hole in the astonished miscreant's head.These and most other important scenes are wordless, surprising in that Bernardo Bertolucci was one of the writers.There are some impressive shots of Monument Valley. The production design is evocative and the set dressing impeccable. Leone has a distinctive way of framing his shots. Somebody's boots may be in the foreground, while in the distance another figure slowly draws back the flaps of his jacket to uncover his holsters.That's about it. I've tried to like this thing for years because Sergio Leone is admired by some friends whose opinions I respect. No can do. I don't find it funny. I don't find it involving. I really never cared much about who was or was not killed, which is always a bad sign. The movie seemed like a parody of a Western, with all the conventions drawn with absurd precision. And although Bertolucci wrote it, it isn't until AFTER the final face off between good guy Bronson and bad guy Fonda that we find out Bronson's motive for nattering Fonda. The motive, and the event that generates it, pops out of nowhere, flapping its wings like a stage magician's dove. It has nothing to do with the rest of the plot.However, don't let this stop you from watching it. I gather my opinion is a minority one, as is so often the case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was beautifully filmed with impressive scenery and well-designed sets against a beautiful musical score. The story line is pretty standard, but okay. Water rights, railroad coming in, new town, etc. However this film can't quite decide whether it wants to be a horse opera or a soap opera. At over three hours it's something like watching a full season of Days of our Lives meets The Young and the Restless in the Old West. A good half of that three plus hours is spent on close ups of the different characters staring at each other, or into mirrors, or just staring with gritty expressions on their weathered faces.Henry Fonda gets to show us how bad a bad guy he can be, but that's just not the Henry Fonda we knew and loved and it didn't really work for me. But he was really bad. I'll give him that. Overall I found this film very tedious and I had to watch it in short increments or I'd never have got through it at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You're Kidding me right?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rarely leave reviews and I certainly don't like leaving negative ones, but I can't believe that there is anyone who thinks that this is a great move, non-the-less a great one. And yet, this film (if you want to call it that) is on the top 250. You're kidding me right? If you think that a movie is great just because of cinematography and production design then maybe you will like this movie, because both of these are excellent. But if you want to actually be involved in the story, then this is a dreadful film. You don't know who characters are or what they want until you reach a running time when most films are over, and if you can get involved with them or the story, (because you can't have a story with out any characters) then how is this engaging? The pacing is bad. The cartoon characters, pregnant pauses and most goofy music are laughable. I actually normally love Ennio Morricone in some of his later work and is actually one of my favorite composers, so the decisions come down to Leone to use comical music as well as heartfelt music during a rape scene! (Which isn't meant to be ironic, or if it is, it doesn't work) Nothing in this movie makes the remotest bit of sense, and is really just an exercise in creating a reality that never existed. People have gotten colder not warmer than in history because they have been desensitized, and this concept that everyone in the west was in a free-for-all of unbridled violence is just rubbish.Ultimately, I think that some people watch movies and others get involved in the movie. And this movie clearly caters to the former, because there is nothing here to get involved in. Leone has done some decent work in his other fable ONCE UPON A TIME IN America which is a great film in terms of characters, but ultimately disappointing in terms of story. So to me, the problem here is that Leone is a better directer than writer and you can't fake writing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nowhere near the level of the Dollars trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great visuals; great soundtrack; Sergio Leone directing; Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, and most important (for those of us whose tastes run in that direction) Claudia Cardinale. What could go wrong with this movie? judging from the IMDb rating, nothing. But since I liked very much the Dollars trilogy and Once Upon a Time in America, I am writing this review to warn others that they might, possibly, be as disappointed as I was.So, once again, what can go wrong with this movie? for starters, one can figure out, very early on, that it is going to end with a gunfight between the two main characters, and therefore that they are not in any danger at any point in the movie. That is true of many other westerns, but I cannot think of any other western where the entire plot consists of a series of diversions with the sole purpose of delaying the final gunfight -- for nearly three hours. Good westerns, and good action movies in general, build up the tension, which is not the case here: the final gunfight might as well have happened in the first scene, if both of the main characters had shown up at the train station. Apart from that, there were other excellent opportunities which the main characters let go to waste. They should have seized their chances and saved us a lot of time, part of which could have been used in finding images of Ms. Cardinale on the web.On the positive side, the final gunfight is worth fast-forwarding to.As is often the case, my rating is lower than it would have been without high expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, Acting, Direction and Music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Once Upon a Time in the West" has been recently released in a special 2 disc set, and it's about time. The movie gets better every time you watch it. Sergio Leone's directing is incredible, the pacing and suspense are unparalleled. He squeezes every speck out of every scene without dragging them out. His choice of Henry Fonda as the bad guy and his sales pitch to get him are well worth it. At the time, nobody could imagine Fonda as a bad guy. Charles Bronson is perfect as the enigmatic "Harmonica", bringing his craggy face, economical delivery and a sense of decency to the role that's hard to imagine anyone else could bring. Jason Robards portrays Cheyenne with dash and layers of larceny, chivalry, humor and ruthlessness that bring this complicated character to life. Claudia Cardinale is, of course, beautiful, and gives Jill McBain different aspects, former lady of the night, apparent gold-digger, disappointed and too soon widow, clever seeker of the truth of her husband's dream, used and abused woman and finally friendly hostess for Cheyenne and the railroad workers. The supporting cast is terrific. Paolo Stoppa is sarcastic, crusty but also concerned for Jill when they find her new family murdered. Lionel Stander is great as a saloon keeper who engages Jill in conversation, and when it's interrupted, picks up as if only seconds had elapsed rather than several tense minutes. Jack Elam and Woody Strode are cold eyed killers. Keenan Wynn has a nice cameo as the sheriff and auctioneer. The score is majestic, gritty and perfect, the individual themes convey more than dialogue could. The final showdown resolves a mystery surrounding "Harmonica" and Frank. The final scene as Cheyenne dies and Jill brings water to the rail gangs is a neat summation of the West that will never be the same again. Harmonica's observation that man is a vanishing race being replaced by soulless machines and corporations is an apt eulogy for the men living on the edge of the law. Just about a perfect movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a word, melodramatic. Two much exaggerated drama with every scene. Maybe if it had Clint Eastwood instead of journeyman Charles Bronson I could tolerate the glacier-like pace of the movie.I watch movies for entertainment. Perhaps this has some sort of literary value, but its just too slow for me.The Good the Bad and the Ugly is one of my favorite westerns, but just can't get through Once Upon a Time in the West, as there is always something better I can do with my time, such as watch on old John Wayne movie that I've seen 100 times.I think the director gets way too caught up in impressing the viewers with with slick camera work (which there is, by the way), but drags out each scene to the point its difficult to remember sometimes whats actually going on in the plot.I am clearly in the minority here, and I attribute that to the fact that I am perhaps a more shallow movie viewer than most who post here. You guys see things that I don't see. I hated English literature in college, and I typically hate movies that win awards for their literary value. This may be Shakespeare, but I hated Shakespeare.I don't hate this movie, but its not in my top 100.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is clearly among the greatest movies ever made and the very top westerns ever made, its main competitor (in my opinion) being another Sergio Leone masterpiece: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. It's hard to say which I think is greater and I tend to place them pretty much equal as the greatest Westerns ever. This is partly due to the fact that they are in many ways, especially plot, depth,and even basic approach to the genre, quite different.Whereas The Good... has a simple story dealing only with three gunmen looking for gold, Once Upon... has a much more complex plot with a number of deeper themes. It delves into the relationships of people, the end of the Old West and the place of gunfighters, the spread of development and the future, revenge, etc. Unlike some, I don't consider this plot "superior" to The Good; it's just different, richer, and more complex, and certainly has more potential. However, the plot of The Good is compelling and clean in its simplicity. I also thoroughly appreciate how The Good doesn't make any excuses or try to be sentimental, yet in its grittiness there is amazing depth. Therefore, I really think that the two are just very different and while Once Upon is certainly more complex and grand, it is not necessarily better.More fundamentally, these differences seem to result from the fact that Once Upon really seems to be an homage to the "classic" American westerns such as those of John Ford, taking their basic themes, elements, and approaches. Everything, though, is handled very differently, so that characters are much richer, more ambiguous and subtle, the plot and scenes more tense, the events more violent, gritty, and hard-hitting, and the "classic" elements are in general given a new freshness, so that the emotional impact is incredible. Whereas Leone's earlier westerns really reinvented the genre and broke from the "classic" mold, this film went back to the "classic" predecessors and blended the key elements of those films with Leone's new style and approach, making a film that really brings the "classic" western to its apogee. An homage to those earlier films, it expands them and morphs them into something greater so that this is undoubtedly the greatest western based on those "classic" traditions. Of course, a film's plot is only part of the mix, and a film must be put together well: directing, cinematography, editing, costumes and other details. In this regard, Once Upon... is, like The Good, sheer perfection.I have heard people describe Leone's work as "operatic," which is not a description that I came up with on my own, but it sure does describe the films, especially this one.This film is a true masterpiece and a shining example of Leone's brilliance. It is beautiful throughout and the plot is fascinating and developed superbly(as one should expect from Leone). Although I think that a couple scenes are a little longer than they should be, overall the slow pace of the film is one of its beauties, as always with Leone. It builds the tension and emotion incredibly well and allows the viewer to be absorbed in the film. The characters are wonderful. Bronson is at his absolute best here as the taciturn, calm, man of action while Henry Fonda superbly plays what I think to be his greatest role. His face and eyes are perfect for it. Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale are great,too. The constant theme of the railroad and its development in the scenes as the film progresses are also incredible. Its use is not entirely original, but railroads have immense artistic, dramatic, and symbolic potential and the theme is handled flawlessly. As a result, the railroad theme fully realizes its potential in all three aspects. The images of the railroad progressing are themselves thematically powerful and visually stunning.There are so many wonderful Leone elements throughout this film, giving it extreme dramatic power, grittiness, and atmosphere. A key one is the use of music, such as the haunting harmonica music, acting as a soundtrack and theme song for Harmonica while at the same time heralding the arrival of his character as he plays it, and adding a mournful, haunting feel to the scenes, perfectly fitting Bronson's character. It's wonderful to hear the music as if it's just a soundtrack just before noticing the characters react to it, showing that they hear it, too. Another is the images, with the beautiful long shots of the scenery with close ups of characters' faces or items like guns, sometimes together in the same shot, and sometimes with the items in obscure positions in the picture, so that their very closeness and appearance emphasises them and obscures them at the same time. The beginning scene at the station deserves its own special praise. This scene is absolutely incredible and is Leone at his artistic best. Everything about it is utter perfection, with the slow build-up of tension as the viewer for some time wonders what exactly is going on but can feel the tension; the quick, sharp spot of violence (another Leone trademark); the use of the sounds of the windmill, etc.; the things with which the three gunmen occupy their time whilst waiting; the images, especially the view with the close-up of the windmill and long shot of the countryside and tracks as Woody Strode casts a shadow whilst traversing the makeshift platform; every detail of the station and the characters; the references to other westerns; the arrival of the man for whom they are waiting; the image of them turning to face him. That's a long list, but this scene alone is worth the price of the film. It could stand on its own as a short film.In sum, this what everything that a "classic" western should have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An opera of a western vengeance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Once upon a time in the west" symbolizes the quintessence of theatrical ceremonial. Sergio Leone seized the traditional western and, helped by his scriptwriter Dario Argento, the future reference of giallo and baroque slaughter on large screens, enriched it with emphatic approach and humorous disenchantment. In fact, he builds a myth with modest elements - an organ mouth, a blue-eyed glance, long coats - and introduces lyricism and immoderation, to sublimate the manners of this specific spectacle. The daring of realization - inverted or encircling shot - and artistic choice (Henry Fonda becomes a tough guy) express an authentic will to break the common rules, in order to confer sensible density on his characters and an aesthetic energy on his scenery. Paradoxically, this glittering vision of Redemption, which was hesitating between homage and parody, belongs now to the classics. Looking for ruins poetry and contemporary genesis, the director has created an absolute. A story beginning by "Once upon a time" contains always some scraps of eternity...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece spaghetti western with awesome cinematography.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film portrays two conflicts that take place around Flagstone, a fictional town in the American Old West: a land battle related to construction of a railroad, and a mission of vengeance against a cold-blooded killer. A struggle exists for Sweetwater, a piece of land near Flagstone containing the region's only water source. The land was bought by Brett McBain (Frank Wolff), who foresaw that the railroad would have to pass through that area to provide water for the steam locomotives. When crippled railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti) learns of this, he sends his hired gun Frank (Henry Fonda) to intimidate McBain to move off the land, but Frank instead kills McBain and his three children, planting evidence to frame the bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards). It appears the land has no owner; however, a former prostitute (Claudia Cardinale) arrives from New Orleans, revealing she is Jill McBain, Brett's new wife and the owner of the land. Meanwhile, a mysterious harmonica-playing gunman (Charles Bronson), whom Cheyenne later dubs "Harmonica", pursues Frank. In the film's opening scene, Harmonica kills three men sent by Frank to kill him. In a roadhouse on the way to Sweetwater, he informs Cheyenne that the three gunfighters appeared to be posing as Cheyenne's men.Once Upon a Time in the West (Italian: C'era una volta il West) is a 1968 epic Spaghetti Western film directed by Sergio Leone. It stars Henry Fonda, cast against type, as the villain, Charles Bronson as his nemesis, Claudia Cardinale as a newly widowed homesteader, and Jason Robards as a bandit. The screenplay was written by Sergio Donati and Leone, from a story by Dario Argento, Bernardo Bertolucci and Leone. The widescreen cinematography was by Tonino Delli Colli, and the acclaimed film score was by Ennio Morricone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Instant gratification was never on Leone's mind when he made "Once Upon a Time in the West". This is a slow-burn in the strictest sense, and even character development doesn't happen until very late in the game. Up until that point, none of the characters struck me as very memorable - and even after that, not so much. They just sort of blend in. Although Henry Fonda was a genius choice; you don't get stone-cold killer from hearing that voice. It's beyond subversive.That said, this is a masterpiece in shot composition (widescreen, especially). The gunfight staging, the staggering scenery, gorgeous Claudia Cardinale; it's all in the visuals, at least for me. To watch this movie is to feel like you've just gorged on grand cinema; it's really more like an experience than anything else. I can understand the praise from a filmmaking perspective.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some moments of pure brilliance alas not maintained.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie hoping for great things. I had already seen and loved Once upon a time in America and the Dollars trilogy and was hoping for another superb Leone film. To some extent this is what I got. There are some scenes in this movie that are sublime. The opening scene as they wait for the train is close to perfection as the deadly quiet is only interrupted by the small quirks of the environment it leaves you on tenterhooks. The same is true of the later scene at the house when all seems well but occasionally we see McBain's uneasy glances when he hears small noises. The score is by Ennio Morricone so it goes without saying that it is superb.The plot is also interesting and complex, it twists and turns as we attempt to decipher what the big game is that all these men are fighting over and yet the final twist (as to the nature of Harmonica and Frank's relationship) feels contrived and forced and comes too late in the movie for the animosity which has been present throughout to have meaning. If we had understood their relationship earlier on it would have lent more weight to their interactions (particularly where Harmonica saves Frank's life). It would also have had the effect of making the characters less bland. Blondie worked in the fistful trilogy because although he displayed few emotions, he was able to be sarcastic and fun too. Here it seems Leone wanted the next Blondie but Harmonica's character is boring, he sullenly fails to emote throughout the whole film even in scenes that should be of real emotion for the character (when he is facing off against the man who did so much to him at a younger age) he remains in his bored expression. If he doesn't seem to care about anything why should we. The other characters are not much stronger, their motives seeming to change on a dime (as with Cheyenne who is at one moment intimidating and hostile and the next best friends with Harmonica and Claudia.) Claudia's character is the worst though. The writer seems to have made an effort for her to be a strong character, but she becomes a tedious damsel in distress and has a confusing relationship with Harmonica (who is at one minute trying to rape her then the next protecting her from Frank's thugs???) All this adds up to a film that could have been brilliant but squandered this through its characters and it's failure to make its big plot twist at the end count for anything by deploying it in a way that doesn't feel token and forced.</fullReview>

In the beginning, you are not able to understand why each character is motivated to do what they do. Mysteries are revealed throughout the piece, when four main characters are completely developed in a very simple screenplay. Frank is a murder of an entire family, Cheyenne is a gangster with a conscience (chasing Frank by what he had done), Jill is the widow which survived since she was in New Orleans, and Harmonica is a mysterious outsider in town with incredible shooting abilities and guess what! He plays harmonica when he should talk and he talks when he should play, giving a dose of thriller and humor for this incredible character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best picture ever. Good line, good story, good actor, good directing and Ennio Morricone !!! So if you want to see a real good western, you just to see this movie (also the good, the bad and the ugly ;-) ) The first sequence is an anthology ! The shootouts are epic. Before sudden, ear-shattering gunshots ring out, Leone orchestrates masterful moments of long and intense waiting. In the famous 10-minute opening credit sequence, we're left for a long, long time just listening to drips from a leak, a squeaky windmill, a door slamming open and shut, and a fly buzzing. We listen and keep listening, anticipating; anticipating violence or silence or both. And Charles Bronson appear!!!! I loved the end too, with Jason Robards on his horse (i don't spoiled, i can't tell more). And Henry Fonda make the bad guy, a very good idea (in this time Henry Fonda only play the good guy). This is a mythic Western; an ode to the end of its era. Thanks Mr Leone for your genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How could one reviewer get it so wrong? It was not Sergio Leone who requested Henry Fonda to wear brown contact lenses, it was Henry Fonda who , when knowing he was going to play a ruthless villain, grew a full beard and bought brown lenses. Leone saw him and persuaded him to be clean-shaven and have "the beautiful, bright blue eyes of a killer." He wanted to shock the audience by having clean-cut Henry Fonda be a child killer. It is one of the greatest movies of all time!!! Harmonica (Charles Bronson): Did you bring a horse for me? Killer (Jack Elam): No, it looks like we're one horse short.Harmonica (shakes his head): You brought two too many.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once Upon A Time In The West is a superb masterpiece of a western! It takes you through a story like no other, and thrills you with fascinating performances by Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, and Jason Robards. Jill(Claudia Cardinale) gives a great supporting effort and gives her character "Jill" is wonderful and compelling.. Frank(Henry Fonda) is a dark, and striving personality that wants everything that is deserving of his needs of greed and envy..Harmonica(Charles Bronson) Plays one of the most mysterious characters I ever witnessed on film. His story thrives us until it comes to a shocking conclusion of what his purpose really is!...Sergio Leone has made a movie that will stand the test of time with all other great westerns "Good, Bad, and the Ugly" "Fist Full &amp; A Few" "Outlaw Josey Wales" "Unforgiven" "Tombstone" "The Searchers" "Wild Bunch" that takes place beside it! This is a movie everyone needs to see in their lifetime...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story about accomplishment of Universal Justice and human nature itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Once upon a time in the West" is best and greatest western ever made,and only movie that comes close is "Good,bad,ugly" which is another masterpiece,but "Once upon a time in the West" is number one,and the question is will any western ever exceed strength and depth of this film. This is not just the best western ever made,but also one of the greatest films ever. Definitely this is the best film made by Sergio Leone and in this movie Leone has surpassed himself. Culmination of previous movies made by Leone from "A fistful of dollars", through "For a few dollars more" to "Good,bad,ugly", "Once upon a time in the West" is climax of his artistic creativity. He made other also great movies,non-westerns (like "Once upon a time in America") but this one stands on the top of everything he had done.Story in the middle of 19th century probably by the end of 1860s when railroads were built connecting America from east to west,from Atlantic to Pacific. We see Morton (Gabriele Perzetti) railroad tycoon. There is Frank (Henry Fonda) most dangerous local criminal working for Morton and intimidating people to sell land where railroad passes,sometimes killing them if they refuse like he did with Brett McBain and his family. There is Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) a widow of Brett McBain.There is a local outlaw Cheyenne (Jason Robards) and finally silent revenger called Harmonica (played by Charles Bronson) because he carries harmonica and plays,and nobody knows his name. He is there seeking revenge against Frank (and from his flashbacks from his childhood we know why).Telling Frank names of people killed by Frank he is there for revenge not just in his name,but also in names of those people. Harmonica and Cheyenne form alliance killing gang members that Franks sent against Harmonica. All those characters make this incredible story with lots of unpredictable reversals. Telling story from beginning to the end would be pointless-it is much better to watch the movie. Because in this film we see story about revenge in name of universal justice,story about great dreams and visions but dreamers do not live long enough to see their accomplishment. But other people benefit from them. We see real story of wild west and most of all,through this fictional characters story about great chapter in history and human nature itself.And,there comes the final scene of gunfight between Harmonica and Frank. They talk before that,Frank asks him who is he, but Harmonica tells him that he will find out that only in the moment of his death. They stand to each other on close distance and wait. Game of life and death. We see their faces and eyes and Harmonica remembers when he was a kid and forced by Frank to hold his older brother who was hanged on his shoulders. Frank puts harmonica in his mouth having fun with his gang members. Older brother curses Frank and hustles his young brother in dust which meant his instant death. Young brother falls in dust and harmonica falls off from his mouth. We quickly return in to present moment,Harmonica is faster on gun,he fires and hits Frank. Just a simple and perfect scene. Frank is on the ground and Harmonica puts harmonica in his mouth. Frank dies,his head falls in dust and harmonica falls of from his mouth. Harmonica returns to Jill, says goodbye to her,Cheyenne tells her how to behave with railroad workers on her land and he leaves with Frank. Cheyenne is wounded and Harmonica carries him on his horse.They leave. In last scene Jill serves workers on railroad that proceeds further. This film is so full of symbolics. We see most iconic scene in some solitude in wild west where a man is hanged on remnants of something that could be a church wall,and he is hanging on shoulder of his brother. This is universal symbol of every injustice and oppression,not just in wild west,but in whole human history. And when Harmonica kills Frank he delivers justice not only in name of himself and those killed by Frank,but also in name of all mankind. He is Man without name,he is everything people want to be,but they never dare to. Clint Eastwood did it one way, Charles Bronson did it the other way,and they both were excellent in that role. But different, which is good because Bronson gave more sensitivity to that character. We see dreams.Even when Morton is dead his dream lives on. Railroad proceeds further as we see in the end of movie. From one ocean to another railroads connected and built a great nation. Not only that,this is also symbol and message that after all,life goes on,because life is greater than all of us,and we are part of life itself. This is the final message of this great movie. Like in "Good,bad,ugly" and other films made by Leone Ennio Morricone did an excellent job in "Once upon a time in the West" with extraordinary soundtrack. Iconic melody from gunfight between Harmonica and Frank,melody in the end when railroad is being built or last melody in movie. Memorable. Something timeless and unforgettable. This film is something that you can watch lots of times without getting tired of it. With such complexity,strength,depth,symbolics and message "Once upon a time in the West" has a special place in cultural and artistic heritage of mankind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Leone classic, a Morricone masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After completing the Dollars trilogy, one would come to expect Sergio Leone to have reached his peak with "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" just two years earlier, but he doesn't let up an inch with "Once Upon A Time in the West." The Italian-born filmmaker delivers once again the kind of western the genre will be remembered by.Then there's Ennio Morricone, Leone's longtime composer. He is the glue of "West" if not arguably all Leone's films. Assigning musical themes to each of the film's three main outlaws, he gives us something to truly remember the film by, something to cushion his intense close-ups and lengthy takes. What makes his work in "West" so special, however, is that it carries so much more weight. It's a living, breathing part of the script and it gives the conflict energy considering these characters don't say much, at least compared to Clint Eastwood's character in the Dollars trilogy. Although Morricone's "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" theme is his most memorable, that film has more to hang its hat on."West" is Leone's dream spaghetti western, an American western done in his style. Admiring Henry Fonda, he convinced Fonda to play one of his most unique roles as the outlaw Frank, a merciless killer employed by a railroad owner. Then he brings in Charles Bronson as the quiet but hardened Harmonica, who offers his help to the beautiful widow Jill McBain, whose husband and family were killed by Frank because their huge property stood in the way of railroad expansion.It's classic revenge-driven western, where every scene feels on the verge of something big. The use of the Techniscope when filming, which helped make "Ugly" a step above its predecessors, continues to serve Leone well for close-ups and various camera movements. Faces are so important in Leone's work and he has some excellent ones to work with such as the blue-eyed Fonda.Then there's the way this film quietly revolves around the railroad, the wheels of progress, the symbolism of movement -- all of which are inherently American while also making great material for Leone. One of the film's best scenes, for example, is when the third outlaw, Cheyenne (Jason Robards), who Harmonica enlists as help, takes out a bunch of guys on a moving train.But what this film keeps coming back to is the way Morricone's score tells this story, or as I've read, even dictates the story at points. Every time his music is at its fullest, electric guitar riffs and all, the film is just infused with this great power. Even when what's on screen doesn't completely say everything you need to know, this masterful score fills in the gaps. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best introduction of any movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beginning of this film where the gang is waiting at the train station - is probably the most well done introduction to a movie I have seen yet.I'm just discovering Leone's westerns. This is a great example of how a western can be done right. Some of the scenes though were shocking and brutal. The ginger-family getting gunned down was horrific. When it panned up to introduce Henry Fonda as said gunman, was even more horrific. It's a shock to see such an evil character played by somebody who's usually a nice person.Charles Bronson's character is interesting, though a bit overdone. I guess that's called being "stylized". I know this is an Italian production. The flashback scene with him and his brother... holy crap. That was as brutal as it gets. Shocking. There's a few parts of this film where I was surprised to be so shocked.The only complaint that i have is the god-awful clash of music. The stylish single-note guitar tune that played often in the beginning was AMAZING! Very dramatic.Now... the lame 1970's Day's of our Lives 'string' symphonic composition that plays during the widow's scenes (riding through town) could be completely taken out of the film and it'd get another star out of me.So yeah, the music is my only complaint. Some of it rules, some of it is really lame and daytime-soap-opera sounding.And by the way, this movie is BIG. As in the locations seem huge and majestic. Think Lawrence of Arabia big.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale - 81/2, The Pink Panther), a former prostitute, arrives at her husband's house at a place called "Sweetwater" to find him and his three children murdered. While it is unclear exactly who committed the crime, the main suspect is desperado Chyenne (Jason Robards - Magnolia, All the President's Men), leader of a gang of outlaws. However, it is soon revealed that the true killer is the sadistic hit-man Frank (Henry Fonda - 12 Angry Men, On Golden Pond),working for Mr. Morton of the Railroad company, who wants the land Jill's husband owns, and plans to have Frank kill Jill as well. However, she falls into the help of two outlaws, Chyenne - who is in love with Jill - and Harmoncia (Charles Bronson, The Great Escape), who has a mysterious history, and an obsession with Frank.This film is my favourite Westerns in the world. While I don't agree that it is the best (that title belongs to The Searchers, a film that has influenced so much cinema that without it, no Lawrence of Arabia, Taxi Driver, or indeed Once Upon a Time in the West), it is certainly the 2nd best, if just for the shear homage it pays to the genre. Made by Sergio Leone right after the masterful Dollars Trilogy, he instead set out to make a more thoughtful, mature and intelligent Western, and while the result may be less entertaining than The Good, The Bad and the Ugly, the film is his best, and really shows him at the height of his film-making abilities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another fine spaghetti western from Leone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1968 Sergio Leone followed up his classic "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" with another spaghetti western of similarly high caliber. "Once Upon a Time in the West" shares some common elements with its predecessor but that doesn't mean that it's a re-tread. Here, a mysterious stranger and an outlaw join forces to protect a beautiful widow from being manipulated by a ruthless railroad employee.The cast is a good one with Henry Fonda, Jason Robards &amp; Charles Bronson supplying American star power to this Italian film. Claudia Cardinale amply supplies the eye candy as the beautiful woman at the centre of the story. Once again, the dubbing of non-English speaking actors is less than perfect but that's a fairly minor flaw.The script, with input from Italian film legends Leone, Bernardo Bertolucci &amp; Dario Argento, is evocative and well plotted. It's more complex than "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" but does not end up being convoluted.Leone's direction is top-notch, as expected, and the Ennio Morricone score is a good one, though not quite as memorable as his iconic score for "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly". All in all, the film looks and sounds quite attractive.Like its predecessor, this film is one of the finest spaghetti westerns ever made and a fine film by any measure. While I doubt that its appeal warrants the surprisingly high IMDb rating I do think that it is a worthwhile film for western fans and film fans in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sergio Leone. Change The Face Of Westerns &amp; Cinema Forever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's Masterpiece Once Upon A Time In The West Like in most of Sergio Leone's films, sound and music play a major roll, the noise of the harmonica, symbolising the last gasping breathe of the characters. The long lasting silences broken by the click of a barrel and the shot of a gun.Franks gang enter with a bloody slaughter, and a riveting cold stare from Henry Fonda's deep blue eyes striking uncertainty, menace and evil into the hearts of the audience. This brutal scene puts the story into play. Harmonica also has many incredible and unforgettable lines which is the icing on the cake for me, that and his cool calculated actions on his road to revenge.The amazing cinematography of John Fords iconic scenery is spectacular at least. The old and the new clashing as one period of America ends and the next rises up out of the old, is brilliantly executed by Leone within the town and the railroad.From start to finish I was on the edge of my seat, everything about this film merging together to create a very atmospheric and gripping film. in the words of Leone "The Rhythm of the film was intended to create the sensation of the gasps that a person takes just before dying. From start to finish, A dance of death. All of the characters in the film except Claudia are conscious of the fact they will not arrive at the end alive." so simple and precisely sums up the film, a task which i could only dream of doing.If Leone was still alive you could be sure I would be blowing smoke up his ass. I love the mans genius! Watch this film. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another leone Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the last few months i have started to discover the movies of Sergio Leone. I vaguely remember seeing some of his films as a kid but obviously i was to young to appreciate the pure genius of the man. Although in my opinion "One upon a time in the West" is not his best movie , it still provides all the hallmarks that make Leone on of the most admired directors of all time.To get his hands on prime railroad land in Sweetwater, crippled railroad baron Morton hires killers, led by blue-eyed sadist Frank , who wipe out property owner Brett McBain and his family. McBain's newly arrived bride, Jill , however, inherits it instead. Both outlaw Cheyenne and lethally mysterious Harmonica take it upon themselves to look after Jill and thwart Frank's plans to seize her land. As alliances and betrayals mutate, it soon becomes clear that Harmonica wants to get Frank for another reason -- it has "something to do with death.As i have said there certain things that make Sergio Leone movies extremely distinctive and in this movie they are no different. The cinematography is sharp and crisp and it puts most modern films to shame. How he gets such detail in the profile shots of his actors is amazing and is strangely hypnotic. He also manages to get his actors to perform at the top of their game even though a lot of the time they are doing very little other than looking into the camera.Henry Fonda's portrayal of Frank is probably the best i have ever seen from him and is maybe the best performance by an actor in a Leone film that i have seen so far. His piercing blue eyes stare down the camera lens with a haunting glare and it is hard not to feel sucked in. One scene that particularly sticks in my mind is when he is on the bed with Jill. You can see Henry Fonda is not really comfortable with the scene he is doing and that only adds to the creepiness of Frank .( after all he was 33 years older than Claudia Cardinale ).Charles Bronson is good without being spectacular and i actually preferred the preferred the performance of Jason Robards who played Cheyenne.We are also treated to another fantastic soundtrack. A strangely out of tune piano accompiniament and that haunting harmonica is just perfect.The only criticism of Sergio Leone's films i have is that they tend to be a little too long. Once upon a time in the west is no exception and a story that could easily have been told in 100 minutes ends up being 160 minutes but to shorten it would not be Leone's style . Purist would say the longer the better but not me. I'm still of the opinion that " A few Dollars More" is Sergeo Leone's best Spaghetti western but it's surprising how many regard either this film or "The good , the bad and the Ugly as his best work. I'm hoping to watch "One upon a time in America" in a month or two just to see how , or if , his directorial style had changed much over the years.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first fifteen minutes of "C'era una volta il West" (I am not Italian, I just like the original title to films) is the greatest I have ever seen. The three cowboys waiting to kill the half-breed that is coming on the train. The rickety old shack creaking in the wind, one of the bandits trying to blow a fly off his face, with out moving his hand, while sitting down. The black man standing still as syrup drops on his head, and then drinks it. These are things I will always remember. When the half-breed Harmonica (Charles Bronson) arrives he utters those immortal lines: "You brought two horses too many." That quote is one of may favourite quotes ever.An epic, and magnificent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something To Do With Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In western days, Jill comes to remote Arizona outpost of Sweetwater to make a home with her new husband and his family. But they have been brutally murdered by Frank, an evil gunman for the railroad. Jill is helped by two men; the outlaw Cheyenne, whom Frank has framed for the murders, and the mysterious Harmonica, who seems to have an old and lingering score to settle with Frank ?This is a beautiful and melancholy film, perhaps one of the most exquisite and haunting westerns ever made. It's been described as, "an opera where the arias aren't sung, they're stared", and that fits it perfectly. Ennio Morricone's music (which was composed prior to shooting) is so rich and affecting it permeates every image, every nuance. This is a movie where all the emotion and atmosphere is communicated not through clumsy words, but through pictures, music, expressions, movements. Jill, Harmonica, Frank and Cheyenne are myths made flesh in front of our eyes, thanks to four stunning and contrasting performances, each of which is a study in old-fashioned acting skill. I particularly like Fonda here, an amazing choice for a heartless villain, given both his age (he was sixty-three) and his nice guy reputation, and the supporting cast are full of the usual Leone amazing faces, notably in the opening shootout with Elam, Strode and Mulock. Leone's biographer, Christopher Frayling, ranks this as the greatest spaghetti western ever made, though personally I think Leone's two previous movies are better. The reasons for this are hard to qualify. For me, this film is somehow just a bit too melancholy, a bit too rich in its excesses and its self-worth. What makes the Dollars Trilogy so special for me is its uniqueness in both style and wild characterisation. This movie is a little bit more like a conventional American western, with less action and less craziness, and Harmonica is more of a traditional moral hero than The Man With No Name. Also, I always feel that Leone never really managed to write or direct successfully for actresses; Cardinale is excellent here, and Jill is a fascinating archetype, but literally all the women in Leone's films are whores - she just happens to be the most prominent one. There is also a great sadness to this film I think; for all its brilliance, it essentially symbolises the end of Leone's tragically brief career. His follow-up, Gi? La Testa, was a bit of a failure, then he languished for years before making one great final film, Once Upon A Time In America, but it was butchered to pieces and barely distributed. For a such an influential filmmaker this is a sad coda, almost as if he had become Cheyenne and Harmonica, struggling to stay ahead of the civilisation that the railroad represents and that they cannot be subdued by. However, what we have here is an exquisite, beautifully paced, lovingly crafted elegy to the myth of the American West, filled with rich and moving scenes and extraordinarily skillful craftsmanship. Superbly photographed by Tonino Delli Colli (see how many left-profile-enter-camera-right shots of Bronson you can count) at Cinecitta Studios in Rome and Almeria in Spain, with a brief but magical carriage ride through the buttes of Monument Valley in Utah. Written by Sergio Leone, Sergio Donati, Dario Argento and Bernardo Bertolucci. English title - Once Upon A Time In The West.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see that this is number 19 on the top 250, but I do not think that this does it justice and in general I don't think that people give this film enough credit as it deserves. Everything is perfectly combined to make for an amazing film that you cannot take your eyes off, even through some of the slower moments early on. The acting was absolutely superb, the directing magnificent, the plot amazing. The best part of this film for me was the music though. Every second of music played is essential to the film as a whole and to the moment that it is being played at. The harmonica is sublime, every time I hear it a chill just runs through my spine waiting to see what is going to happen. As a youngster of 19 this film is quite a bit ahead of my time, but even someone who is watching it for the first time 30+ years after it was released can instantly see that this is one of the all time great films ever made. I cannot point to one second of the film where I think to myself that it is not essential to the film as a whole. Finding older movies to watch is not the easiest thing in the world, and some of the other great classics just don't fit my taste. For me though this is a new age film that is 30 years old. I cannot believe how anyone who grew up in the era of this can not put it near the top of their all time movie list. Looking through people's "Top 20" or "Top 30" or whatever you do not see OUATITW nearly enough as it should, but it will definitely be in mine.</fullReview>

A lot more of the maybe traces of cars or tractors are seen in the scene when Frank is arriving on the set of the crime with the train standing still and the dead bodies lies around on the ground?

		<fullReview>Why heap more praise on a Flick that ranks among the undisputed master pieces of film art A pride that wishes to out sing the choir who sing the glory of Leone's iconic Western.This truly is a Masterpiece; not only because the beautiful cinematography, haunting moving score by Morricone and the superb acting of all actors involved, but it universally appeals to almost everyone. Even if you show this to a kid, who has very rigid views on cowboys-and-indians (if kids still play that?), although the child will be bored by many parts of the film, some images, puzzle and intrigue it, as they did me when I was 10 years of age.The appeal lies in its iconic and archetypal characters. They all are strong, independent and awe-inspiring; even a prosaic character like Morton has a nobility and an tragedy that makes loathing him impossible. And the Tragedy of the film, the great melancholy expressed by its cinematography and score, is loneliness. Every character is lonely,a solitary person, who by fate and failure created a desire for survival that can only be described as epic. As a man, the three main men in the film all appeal to some deep masculine part in me. Frank, the will to power. Cheyenne, the opportunist and Harmonica the absolute unwavering unification of justice and revenge. And most women, will deeply feel for Jill McBain's character, who's female fortitude even impresses a misogynist as myself.But don't waste yer time reading reviews that say how brilliant this film is! Go and watch it and experience it for yourself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never seen the uncut version of Sergio Leone's famed Once Upon A Time In The West, before stumbling across the DVD at a bargain price. I had seen major portions of it, chopped up by censors, studio heads, and the nitwits who need to run commercials for local television stations. While intriguing I did not think it could hold up to his justly praised Once Upon A Time In America. I was wrong. It does, and in its own way is just as good, or great. Whereas America is amazingly complex, and follows the lives of several gangsters, West is sparse, amazingly straightforward, yet surreal- having been released fifteen years before America, in 1969. Instead of having affinities more in tune with Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather and Apocalypse Now it resonates with the TV series The Prisoner and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. The film is quite surreal, depending far more on what is shown (imagine that- a film where the visuals are the most important element!) than what is said. In two hours and forty five minutes there's a reputed only fifteen pages of dialogue; most of that cryptic and seeming torn from a Beckett play, rather than being at home in a Western, a genre I generally detest for all the American triumphalism and John Waynean braggadocio, celebrating the worst aspects of the Ugly American. Yet, this film is loaded with symbolism, and a very simple plot. A land speculator named McBain is killed, along with his family, as he awaits his new wife's arrival from New Orleans. She is Jill (Claudia Cardinale), a gorgeous ex-prostitute. The murder is ordered by a man named Morton (Gabriele Ferzettii), a robber baron railroad man whose physical handicap leaves him a prisoner on his train (much in the mode of a 19th Century James Bond supervillain), and who employs a killer named Frank (Henry Fonda), who actually does the deed. On his tale is an unnamed man named Harmonica (Charles Bronson), for the instrument he plays, and also a bandit gang leader named Cheyenne (Jason Robards), whom Frank has framed for the crime.The film follows the interactions of the four main characters, as described by others?. As for the film, it is surreal, yet also hyper-realistic in its use of the scenery of Monument Valley, and the great faces of many of its character actors- from Jack Elam and Woody Strode in small, early roles, to Lionel Stander and Keenan Wynn in later roles. There are scenes that ring true, even as they are also pure symbolism, such as Cardinale's close association with water and self-image, Bronson's almost magical sliding in and out of frame, and the way Frank radiates more real menace in a lip curl than Hannibal Lecter can in a whole film. The film damns Romanticism, even as its title celebrates it. It dazzlingly inverts clichés and, most importantly, realizes that film can and should make use of time, and long shots and scenes. MTV has destroyed much of appreciation of the brilliance that long scenes can hold. This is never truer than the film's start, where three gunman waiting at a train station for someone or something that is coming on the next train. No explanation, no conversation; not a word is said, yet they deal with water drips, flies, and knuckle cracking. Fifteen minutes pass before what they are waiting for arrives, yet it's a visual and aural feast for pure cinemaphiles, on par with 2001's opening scenes of prehistoric humans.Throughout the film, glares, scowls, and small facial twinges convey emotion far more effectively than most pallid dialogue. And the grandiose scenes of natural beauty are something even David Lean would admire. The four musical themes attached to the main characters are highly effective. There are also many great lines in the film. Two of the best are when Harmonica is told by one of Frank's henchmen, after asking if a horse was brought for him, that it 'looks like we're shy one horse.' Harmonica replies, 'You brought two too many.' The other is when Frank, after being queried on his methodology, says, 'People scare better when they're dyin'.' Touches like this, and even the title, lend credence to the idea that, like his later Once Upon A Time In America, this film is nothing but someone's dream of the West, not the real thing. Yet, both within and without, people must wake up to modern America. Damn!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch those false notes?Once Upon a Time in the West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Between our three male leads, and even our female star, not a one can be called a hero of any sort. One is a killer, one a criminal, one a whore, and the other a man looking for vengeance, making friends, but really just traveling to the point of avenging a wrong done to him and his family. Do the two men protect the newly widowed Mrs. McBain from the ruthless killer Frank? Or do they just use her and the prospect of her money to get to where they want to be? Just because someone risks his life for another doesn't mean it is a selfless act. Quite the contrary, it usually means they have a lot more invested in the situation than one might think. Concerning these four characters, you never can tell where allegiances lie, or how long they may hold up. All one can be sure of is that the almost three hour ride they take together, from strangers to intimate acquaintances, for better of worse, is a helluva good time.I completely understand any complaint that the film may be too long and perhaps even boring in stretches. There are plenty of times where little to no speech is uttered; all we have to work with are the amazing visuals and sumptuous score. Each character seems to have their own song that follows them along, giving away their presence as time passes. The use of sound in general is so integral that those passages of silence, on behalf of the cast, is a necessity to create mood and tension between them. Who couldn't think that a short diddy on the harmonica can elicit the amount of suspense it does here. Not only does it give away the position and identity of its player, it inflicts fear in those confronting it. An uncomfortable unease at this weathered cowboy exuding such a lyrical melody mingled with the inability to know if the musical talent hides an expertise with the gun or compensates for a lack thereof. The absence of sound also helps at moments to keep the audience off balance. In one of my favorite sequences?not to ruin anything, but the death of the McBain clan?contains two extended instances of nothingness. A father and his children are smiling and readying themselves for the arrival of Jill, their new wife and mother respectively, yet are taken off-guard twice at the lack of noise from nature, and, on our end, score. You know something is amiss and causing the turmoil to the circle of life, you just don't quite know when or where that rift will show its face.Cinematically, one couldn't ask for more. There is a laborious, detail-orientated craft in play, carefully framing each second for full impact. The multiple showings of a large head in the foreground opposite a full figure in the distance, at diagonals to each other, never grows tired. The long focus, keeping it all in view is stunning to behold, as are the sweeping shots from above. A few long takes are interspersed as well, uncovering a dusty, realistic cesspool of deceit and wild west aspirations, the desert and tumbleweeds crawling around while the action moves through. Even the introduction to each character is handled with a skilled touch, framing them in silhouette, in close-up, or from afar, adding just the right amount of intrigue and importance to each. Especially for our three male leads, it couldn't be better. After a long sequence at a deserted train station, men dealing with the heat, dripping water, and uncaring flies searching for a place to land, we see the figure of Charles Bronson's Harmonica, just arrived from the passing train, telling the three men that they brought "two horses too many". For Frank, an amazing role of villainy by Henry Fonda, we see his handiwork from off-camera as the McBains fall one after the other, culminating with a true glimpse into the compassionless void where his heart should be. And even Jason Robards' Cheyenne enters with subtle bombast, walking into a saloon, slowly and with confidence, following the volleys of gunfire and struggle outside the establishment's walls, ending with the camera upon his handcuffed wrists, pouring alcohol down his dry throat.Claudia Cardinale has her moments as well, those times where she appears to be a lady of good-upbringing, truly distraught over the murder of her new family, a clan of farm folk that would allow her to leave the life of prostitution she had in New Orleans. A strong-willed firecracker, her Jill is unashamed to use her body for whatever means necessary; she likes the touch of a man, knowing that a hot bath will wash away all the unpleasantness for her to continue on living afterwards. Never allowing her to be the victim, Cardinale is no waif in need of protection and help, she can most definitely hold her own.There is of course a story holding the brilliant character studies on display together, one of greed and power. The land left to Jill by her dead husband is worth a fortune once the railroad reaches it's station, something Frank and his benefactor Morton, (another great performance by Gabriele Ferzetti), know, causing him to commit the murder. Harmonica and Cheyenne take it upon themselves to save that land for Jill, although their true reasoning results from the desire to stop Frank and all the evil he has caused the world. No one here is innocent, all are after power in some capacity, selfishly and without too much caring about the others except how much they can help achieve it. Truly a tale of humanity being undone by a world without rules, Once Upon a Time in the West is everything you've heard it was and more. I almost don't want to watch another Western because I'm sure all the rest will pale in comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the difference between a movie and a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People before me have said it all and way better than I could ever do. This film is not mere entertainment. It's a powerful piece about individuals trying to find a meaning for their lives. It's about people with enough guts to start over again or fade out with breathtaking dignity. Leone and Morricone, Bertolucci and Argento. It's not a dream team with nothing to deliver. This film is what you would expect from such big names undertaking a massive and epic masterpiece. This thing will pierce your heart and your senses. It's cinematography is intoxicating, and the soundtrack delivers a full punch of emotions to your stomach. For me sometimes it's really hard to take without feeling a teardrop trying to escape my eye. It's sad when film viewers fail to feel the brutal embrace of one of these classic films. Few directors from this age can take such an endeavor and turn it into something this fantastic (Paul Thomas Anderson is one of them).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sprawling Vision of Western Justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has so much---stunning scenery, a great cast, tight writing, economic plot, and haunting music---and it takes its time to unfold its tale of stark vengeance and redemption. This is unmistakably and indelibly a Sergio Leone vision. One could imagine that Clint Eastwood was first offered the role of Harmonica, the avenger, and then it went to Charles Bronson. Perhaps he wasn't, as Bronson was superb as the Everyman hero/possible avenging angel character; he projected a subtle sorrow in his piercing eyes, even his body language, that made him perfect for the role.The plot is multilayered, revolving around a lovely widow (Claudia Cardinale) of a shrewd man named Brett McBain, who is brutally murdered along with his family by the railroad's hired guns while she is enroute to join them at their home in Sweetwater. Her property is what is coveted and it becomes Harmonica's bait to settle an old score with the railroad's chief hired gun, Frank, who is shockingly revealed to be played by wholesome Henry Fonda. His clear blue eyes, so apparently innocent-looking, become frightening in their lack of human emotions. Frank kills without remorse whatever it befalls him to kill as casually as flicking a leaf off his sleeve. Human life is meaningless to him, even more so than to his tubercular cancer-ridden boss Morton. At least he has a motive (greed) to explain his hubris; Frank evidently needs no such excuse and kills because it's what he was born to do.Another character is brought into the tense mix, a bountied outlaw named Cheyenne, appealingly played by Jason Robards. He is also a killer, but one with a sense of humor and a kind streak, as well as a soft spot in his heart for pretty women. He and Harmonica form a strange alliance against Frank and the railroad, which Cheyenne sees as a threat to his way of outlaw life. At the same time, he becomes friendly with the widow Jill, who in turn is oddly drawn to Harmonica. When Cheyenne realizes this, he utters his famous line: "There's something inside a man like that... something about death." It is discovered that McBain bought a substantial amount of property and had planned to build a railroad station. He had everything legally in place to build the station but if it isn't finished by the time the railroad reaches Sweetwater, his heir forfeits the right to build it and even to keep the land. Harmonica uncovers the motive for McBain's murder and finds the means to prevent McBain's dream from failing by making Cheyenne's gang build it.Frank, who is usually so icily carefree about death and those who stalk him, grows more obsessed with finding out who Harmonica is, since every time he asks him, the enigmatic drifter keeps answering by naming off men that Frank has killed. Everything comes apart for Morton and Frank as the killer begins to slowly but relentlessly unravel, with vague flashbacks rising as to who Harmonica might be. They, however, keep his past shrouded sufficiently so that Frank cannot quite close this maddening chapter in his life by just gunning down Harmonica and being done with him.At last, Frank is mortally wounded in the climatic gun duel by Harmonica, who mysteriously is less fazed by what should also be a mortal wound, leading to the speculation that Harmonica is more than he appears to be. Placing his harmonica to Frank's dying lips where his weakening breath wheezes out a few ragged discordant notes, Harmonica watches as recognition dawns and his past is finally realized by Frank. He had sadistically stood a man upon his younger brother's shoulders with a noose around his victim's neck, then shoved a harmonica into the boy's lips. Easing back to watch for the moment when the younger man's legs would finally give out and his brother would hang, Frank is smiling with cold pleasure at his handiwork. It is at that point that the older brother cursed his killer and kicked the boy out from under him, thus alleviating the responsibility placed on Harmonica to keep him alive.But this sequence, though gratifying from a vengeance point, does not answer the question about Harmonica's mysterious knowledge about Frank's victims or his apparent ability to shake off a serious wound with little effect. That combined with Harmonica's penchant to be in the right place at the right time, to stand outside of events while at times controlling them, gives his character a dimension that disconnects him from temporal events. He becomes at those moments like a mysterious angel of death.Every actor was wonderful in his role, from Claudia Cardinale to Jason Robards, but the two principals were outstanding. Fonda, renowned for playing good guys, turned his reputation as an actor completely around with his flawless portrayal of the vicious and heartless killer, Frank. His foil, played to understated perfection by Charles Bronson, was the reluctant vigilante, the man consumed with revenge for his brother's murder, and yet not merely that. Bronson projected from Harmonica a deep and inexplicable sadness that permeated his words, appearance and actions.This was not Leone's choice for a movie. He had abandoned the spaghetti Western concept after the Clint Eastwood films, but was persuaded to take on this project. It did not fare well at the box office, which is no surprise considering its length of almost three hours. A great pity, as it is often overlooked by fans of the spaghetti Western genre for both its lack of commercial success, and for committing the unforgivable sin of not having Eastwood in the lead. It is a great film and works on many levels; in some ways, it is the distillation and the perfection of the SW genre even as it closed it out for good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Western Ever Told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>don't like westerns, not really sure why, like musicals, they represent a genre that was kind of on it's last legs, if not all but extinct, when I growing up. I mention this because I really, really, did not want to watch this, when I eventually gave in and let my roommate put it on.It's probably the best "western" ever made, and definitely the best of the "Sphaghetti Westerns", it's beautiful, intense, and marvelously composed. The music is incredible and infamous, the performances subdued and brooding, (just watched Peter Fonda last night in "Toute Va Bien", which is apples and car batteries to this film). Anyway it's a "classic" that delivers the goods.No analysis necessary (Railroads, cowboys, revenge, etc), but like "Psycho" it's not the story, or the characters,really, it's just mesmerizing movie making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Dearest Beloved Film of them ALL!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never in my life liked Westerns, in fact I almost despised the genre. But when I saw this movie for the first time, it was far different from any Western I have ever been familiar with. Although, I couldn't say that I had seen many Westerns before this one. But in fact, Once Upon a Time in the West is a lot more than just a Western. And in a way, I don't even call it a Western, it's a genre of it's own kind. But by now I've seen and respect more of the Western genre, from films like Sergio Leone's "Dollars Trilogy: A Fistfull of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly", The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The Man Who Sho Liberty Valance and a couple others. But Once Upon a Time in the West still stands out as the most artistic one of them all, and my most personal favorite.I can't even begin to express how much I've come to ADORE this wonderful, beautiful and brilliant piece of film that I've come to know only as cinema ART. The perfect direction, the beautiful visuals, the haunting music, the genuine characters, the originality of the story and the history within it - it's not only a remarkable film, but it's a truly intimate and personal meditating experience. Once upon a time in the west - the more I watch it, the more I feel the power and history behind that phrase/title.Once Upon a Time in the West is a truly epic and iconic piece of cinema that should not ever be overlooked, and must be a little more recognized of it's brilliance by movie audiences and fanatics of all kinds. I'd like to even note that you can find this movie at a very low price for as low as $5.00 - $7.00! An incredibly low price for such an incredible movie, by all means give it a buy and hold it as one of your favorites as well!My Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen all of the Dollars Trilogy and recently this one, I have come to the conclusion that although The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a great movie, it is not even in the league of Once Upon a Time in the West. Here is a brief review:Directing: The filming of this movie is the best I have ever seen, even better than the Godfather. The minor sepia tone and the desert colors make this film just beautiful to watch. 11/10Writing: With only 3 words said in the first 15 minutes, you may think Leone is crazy. But Leone, instead of using words most of the time in this movie, used closeups and music to display emotions. 10/10Music: At times very wild and loud, it fits the movie perfectly and is very well done by Morricone. 10/10Acting: Henry Fonda: although the character he plays sometimes seems misguided, he does a great job. 9/10 Claudia Cardinale: Looks amazing on screen, and fits extremely well with movie. 10/10 Jason Robards: He plays a bandit, who turns out to be a philosopher. You'll see what I mean. Great, just great. 10/10 Charles Bronson: WOW, JUST WOW. Some of the best acting ever on screen, way more complex than Eastwood.( which is okay because Eastwood was not supposed to be to that complex.) Anyhow, Charles was just outstanding, and nothing more can really be said. 100000000000/10In the end, this movie deserves its spot on IMDb; deserves even higher. Great movie that will take your breath away. Overall: 10/10P.S if you think I am just giving this a ten because I liked it, thats not true. I think hard about my ratings. Heck, I gave the Godfather a 9. This movie was better, plain and simple.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really did enjoy viewing Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In The West. I thought it was a classic western that featured Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson. I thought this classic western could be compared to some of those that have followed like The Unforgiven, The Good, The Bad And The Ugly and Hang 'Em High. I really liked how Sergio Leone weaved this tale of the classic bad man versus the good man. The good man has to go through so many trials and tribulations in order to achieve the final goal to bring the bad man down to his knees. I think that Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson gave fantastic performances and I would definitely recommend it to other friends that respect this genre. I think that I am going to seek out other Sergio Leone westerns and compare them to Once Upon A Time In The West.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you want to watch a a western, Leone's style is the way to go</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once Upon a Time in the West is a spaghetti western about three man, who all want one woman. The film tells about the relationships of these four people and the revolution of the railroads. Directed by legendary Sergio Leone in 1968, and starring Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale, it was a big disappointment in theaters, but today the film is a big classic.This film has a certain kind of a rhythm, which was very important to the director. It starts when three crooks come to a railroad station to meet Harmonica (Charles Bronson). Then we go to the McBain's farm, where all the family members are killed by Frank (Henry Fonda) and his crew. After that, Jill (Claudia Cardinale) comes to the railroad station. Cheyenne (Jason Robards) we meet at the bar in the middle of desert.Sergio Leone said that he tried "to create, with the pacing of the film, an impression of a human being's last breaths before his death". He succeeded in it. Four leading characters all have their own goals that they're trying to achieve. After the battles they fight for their goals, some of them end up being dead and some of them have to move on in their lives.I think this is the best of Leone's. Ennio Morricone's music is amazing. Morricone won an Oscar for his life-long work in scoring music to movies. If you want to travel to the Wild West, Leone's stylized and rough version of it is the way to go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most remarkable fact about this film is the conversations among the heroes of story. For example, Harmonica's 5000 $ evaluation in auction for the McBain's land as giving wanted Cheyenne to Sheriff. Cheyenne's comparison Mrs. McBain with his mother is also interesting. Of course, the introduction scene is unforgettable in which Frank's men meet with Harmonica.Frank and Harmonica. One day a man comes to the town where no one knows this man and his name. First, this man overcomes three men who sent by Frank. At the same time, Frank kills Mr. McBain who wait for his new wife from the train. So she comes into the inheritance of McBain. Frank is curious about Harmonica and wants to learn why mysterious man is in the town. Harmonica hides his secret till the end of the film. In this way, he saves Frank from death but Frank learns the reality that is Harmonica is the man whose brother is killed on Harmonica's shoulder by Frank's plan. So the harmonica sound that continues during the whole film is inspired from Harmonica which is inserted the man's mouth by Frank.As I said above, the sounds are so amazing so that it is just a reason to watch it. It makes you say that Bertolucci and Sergio Leone's hand is in it. The time only could be criticized but after seeing the action it would be unjustice.Lastly, Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson show their performance greatly.</fullReview>

Jason Robards gives a great performance and also Claudia Cardinale does a good job. Sergio Leone always does a good job and this film is no exception. Sergio Leone is probably my new favorite filmmaker due to this movie. I first saw The Good The Bad and The Ugly and speechless and just had to see his other movies.

It's as close an example of cinematic opera you will find - the music, the characters, the direction all works together with such harmony and heartening substance. As with all great films it has a point of view and things to say about the role of men and the influence of money &amp; the threat of violence. There are so many moments of pure genius - the opening scene, the introduction of Henry Fonda, the inevitable reason for revenge; all played out with such languid, confident style.I can't recommend this film highly enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This to me is a movie that has no equal, if you think the Shawshank Redemption is the ultimate revenge movie then you need to see this one. The Music and cinematography is simply perfect the directing is different than any other movie i have ever seen!!! Leone spaghetti westerns are special but this movie is so much more and several notches above his other efforts! I have watched many movies over my life and this movie has never been topped! I love this Film!!!! and can watch it over and over again! You may be turned off by the slow start of this movie but be patient while you are waiting for it to develop look at the artistic way Leone brings in his audience long spans with few words said. The way his characters always enter from the right side of the frame the close ups of they're faces so close you can see the pores in the characters faces, and many times the characters say nothing but you know what they are thinking. Notice how after the shoot out in town Frank (Fonda) is Riding back to the Train and his Horses gallop is in perfect rhythm with the music. To truly appreciate the magnitude of this film,just look at the votes it has received only sixty thousand votes on IMDb and it still ranks in the top 20 now compare the Shawshank Redemption Which by the way is also one of my favorites... it has over 400,000 votes( as of june 30th 2009) and is currently ranked number one. Once Upon A Time In the West is 18th which is amazing considering it only has 60,000 votes compared to the Shawshank Redemption which has over 400,000 votes. What this means is that most everyone that watches Once Upon A time in the west give it a number 10 score, and there are another 340,000 people on this site that has not even viewed this film yet do your self a favor and watch this Masterpiece! I consider it the Greatest western of all time nothing comes close!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sergio Leone's greatest masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leone had already proved his talent with the Western genre when he made Clint Eastwood famous in the epic "Man with No Name" trilogy, ending with the classic "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly". And Leone's next great movie, "Once Upon a Time in the West" is whole step above what the great Italian director had ever accomplished before and after. "Once Upon a Time in the West" has the humor, craft, thrills, and compelling storyline as "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly". But the one thing that makes it stand out as a better film is its overall more serious approach to the look of the West, and the violence that was exchanged in its time. It's title, starting with "Once Upon a Time" may give you the impression that the movie is a fairy tale or fantasy kind of movie, but it's far from that.Starring Henry Fonda in the one time I ever saw him cast as a villain. And he's not just a Western gunslinging bad guy in this movie, he's one of the most cold-blooded, deadly killers ever shown on the screen. Opposing him is Charles Bronson in what might be his finest performance and role ever. And Jason Robards, another talented figure in movie history. These three ever-famous names helped contribute to the overall power of the movie, for it is some of their greatest achievements in their careers. All of the supporting actors and actresses were top-notch. The storyline and plot was extremely well-developed and the film does not have a body count that just continues and continues to climb and soar endlessly, which is a more realistic and therefore, powerful approach on Leone's part.Music was composed by the master of soundtrack, Ennio Morricone, who created some of the most memorable music ever in "Once Upon a Time in the West"."Once Upon a Time in the West", running nearly three hours long, is an extremely compelling movie that is full of artistic approaches and styles by Sergio Leone. From its suspenseful beginning to its suiting ending, it reveals itself to be one of the greatest cinematic shows ever. Releasing its magnificent acting, plot, storyline, and purposes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Once Upon A Time In The West" IS the tale of the West. It is the ultimate tribute to every movie of the genre. Sergio Leone's masterpiece captures all the themes that were recurrent in westerns during that time: love, revenge, money, the railroad, the frontier and converges them into an epic, poetic representation of the ideal West, the one we've all heard and read about. The opening scene is a slow gut-crushing build up of tension as three gunman sit and wait at a run-down train station in the desert. We are not given an explanation why, all we do know is that when that train comes something's going to happen. During these minutes of anticipation barely a word is spoken, it is as if time has stopped. Yet Leone like an artist, paints this moment with stunning detail. Every move, every expression a character makes is so carefully choreographed that it makes these three men shine, it makes them memorable even if their participation in the movie extends to this scene only. The camera shots range from extreme close ups to breathtaking shots of the landscape creating an epic and yet personal feel. The traditional introduction with a musical theme is thrown away instead Morricone employs a different kind of music, one that relies entirely on environmental sounds (the drops of water, the fly, the windmill's creaking) to create a proper mood to these minutes of anticipation. The culmination of that music is the sound of the train coming. Signaling the end of the three gunmen's wait. The train stops at the station to refill, they gather and await, anticipating that their target will get off it. No one does. The train refilled starts it's engine once again, preparing to leave the run-down station. The three men decide to do the same but as soon they turn their backs and head to the horses the environmental sounds are disrupted by something unnatural, something not made by machines or wind, but by man. It is the sound of the harmonica, playing a dark, bitter tune. The gunmen turn around trying to figure out where the sound is coming from, they watch the train wagons slowly move away revealing the man with the harmonica. He gazes them and continues playing for awhile. The end of the tune marks the final moments of the scene as the man with the harmonica exchanges a few lines of dialogue with the gunmen. Finding their answer unsatisfying a new type of silence begins, accompanied by a new musical piece by Morricone. Simple in it's composition and straight forward in it's increasingly menacing sound it helps build up the nerve-wrecking tension of these final moments of life. The high point of the entire scene, the moment of violence, lasts a little more than a second as Harmonica fires three shots, one for each gunmen. Killing them, but not before one is able to shoot back, he is hit near the shoulder and falls to the ground. Silence. Only the creaking sound of the windmill is heard. Harmonica regains conscience, he bandages his arm and leaves. End scene.The reason why I described this scene is because it serves as an overview for the entire movie. Not only because it demonstrates the directing technique Leone uses but also because in it's core it holds three of the plot elements that make "Once Upon A Time In The West", the train, the water used for refilling the train and the harmonica. These devices become the central objects that motivate the main characters and as the movie progresses we see how they interweave with each other, we see how they are connected. Sergio Leone has e certain philosophy when it comes to making films. His idea of entertainment doesn't come from the violence he puts in films. While most directors glamorize the on screen death, turning it into the central part of the enjoyment. Leone creates entertainment from the build up of tension, the of anticipation leading towards the violence, not the killing itself. We saw him experimenting with that idea in "The Dollars Trilogy" with every next film becoming more and more closer to the ideal. Here. Here is where he perfected that. Leone takes his time to introduce us to the characters, he makes them interesting, he makes them seem alive. Giving us all the more reason to care when the final confrontation takes place. He has an uncanny ability to make even the most insignificant character memorable in his own. It just makes it easy to see the level of detail, the hard work the entire cast had put into this movie. Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, Claudia Cardinale, Jason Robards all put a performance of a lifetime."Once Upon A Time In The West" is a staggering piece of art that has withstood the test of time and it rightfully deserves it's place as one of the greatest movies ever made. Sergio Leone's tribute is an epic Opera, honoring the myths and legends of the West.An immortal movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic quality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone once said in an interview to Italian television that John Ford westerns were probably the farthest from reality. As cinematic genre very rapidly evolved in the 1960s to reflect better real "human behaviour", this allowed Leone to produce characters that were the embodiment of the West. Neither black, nor white, neither good, nor bad, just a mix of both. This typifies heroes such as "Harmonica" who is really after a personal vendetta, and Cheyenne, who is really after some sort of ill-rewarded redemption. The American west was gray, like its characters, with stories of heroism and moral decadence. No other movie presents this dilemma better as Once Upon a Time.This is an exercise in sobriety and restraint, certainly in the script, where only a few lines are sufficient to convey the full weight of the story. It is also an exercise in excess (for the time). For 1969, the amount of violence (and I don't mean gun-related violence) was outrageous for its quality. It is really difficult for the public of the time to comprehend how someone, let alone a movie director, could compose such death scenes as the hanging.All in all, a movie of relentless and gritty beauty, an aesthetics study of human nature, and perfection embodied in the notion of simplicity.Some examples from the script: Harmonica shoots Frank's accomplices who had turned on him.Mrs. McBain, surprised: "You saved his life!" Harmonica: "I didn't let THEM kill him, and there's the difference." At the end of the movie, Cheyenne to Mrs. McBain, about the railroad workers: Cheyenne: "Why don't you bring these men some water. You have no idea what the sight of a woman like you does to men like these... And if one of them should pat your behind... Just do as if it was nothing." Beautiful way of expressing masculine and feminine strength and frailty in a single phrase.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stylish, pseudo-realistic masterpiece, to be watched again and again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Once upon a time in the west' is a long, sprawling, cliché-ridden, innovative, wonderful cinematographic masterpiece.The story is hackneyed, almost banal, but who cares? Mr Morton is building a railway from the Atlantic to the Pacific. He is physically crumbling and dying from tuberculosis of the bones. He directs the construction from a sumptuous and unbelievably wide private carriage that follows the ever-extending track in the wake of an old-fashioned steam locomotive (whose driver is never seen) complete with the obligatory cow-catcher.To cope with little local difficulties he turns to Frank (Henry Fonda) and his murderous gang. McBain, a pioneering Irishman, widower-ed and with three red-haired children still sporting Irish accents, has bought the only land for miles around with a source of water, essential to the railway.Does Frank negotiate with them for future use of the water? Does Morton even know where the water is? None of this matters. Frank and his gang slaughter the McBain family. Henry Fonda, previously so familiar in upright roles, callously shoots the youngest child, the only survivor of the first assault. The viewer gasps as much at the unexpected perpetrator as at the brutality itself.But this scene is not how the film starts. The opening sequence, according to the viewer's taste, is either gripping, or a ludicrously slow-paced director's indulgence. We have no idea what is happening. Three obvious baddies wait at an isolated station for a train. They bully the elderly station-master. One catches dripping water in his hat and later drinks it. Another cracks his knuckles. The third is pestered by a fly that crawls over his sweaty, stubbly chin. Very few words are spoken.The train arrives. The gruesome threesome awake from their lethargy, fingering their guns. Nobody steps down. The train sets off and the men turn their backs on it.A harmonica sounds. One passenger has alighted on the opposite side. He has arrived to meet Frank, but Frank isn't there. He asks if there is a horse for him. The spokesman of the baddies says that they seem to have brought one horse too few. The harmonica player (Charles Bronson) , fixing the others with a flinty stare, says that it seems they've brought two horses too many. Guns explode. Everybody falls down. 'Harmonica' picks himself up, winged but not badly wounded. The other three are not so lucky.This sequence takes about 14 minutes. It sets the scene and the tone. If you're not mesmerized, switch off, even though nothing is quite as slow from then on. The viewer is deliberately challenged. So many 'western' conventions are present, but all have been distorted. The film belongs to the genre, but it breaks all the rules.From the opening sequence, we switch to the almost unconnected McBain massacre. The only link is Frank. 'Once upon a time in the west' is so carefully and cleverly structured that it should be watched several times, despite its length. The story can be followed reasonably well at a first sitting, but a second is almost obligatory.Nothing is accidental in the early scenes. Musical themes are set. The Ennio Morricone soundtrack is haunting and brilliant. Huge facial close-ups are introduced. The camera is often stationary. Every shot is considered. Dialogue is crisp and laconic.After appearing in a uniquely brutal role, Frank (Fonda) disappears for almost an hour while other elements of the story are developed. Jill (Claudia Cardinale) arrives, a New Orleans whore who has already married the already dead McBain. Frank's murderous but slaughtered threesome were, by their ankle length 'dusters', pretending to be in the pay of Cheyenne (Jason Robards). Mr Morton appears, determined to complete the railway but sickened by Frank's brutality.The developing story revolves around 'Harmonica', Frank, Cheyenne, Jill and Morton. There are some blurry flashbacks, becoming progressively clearer, hinting at the otherwise unexplained connection between 'Harmonica' and Frank. 'Who are you?' asks Frank. Bronson reels off a list of names of men Frank has killed.Although the film is exceptionally long, it never drags. Leone directs with supreme confidence. He lets things slow down and stop, even the music. Leone and Morricone indulge in cheerful conventional, clip-clop sounds at times, but the underlying musical motif is the sound of dying, plaintively expressed by the harmonica.By the end of the film, three of the main characters are dead. There is an extraordinary final showdown between Frank and 'Harmonica', interrupted by a flashback continuation of the earlier blurred scenes, explaining who 'Harmonica' is.Much of 'Once upon a time in the west' is tush. Everything is highly stylized. All the characters are caricatures, as was obvious from the earliest shots.But the film is a masterpiece. It may have restricted all film-making that followed it. Everything about it is brilliant: the acting, the script, the music, the sets, the locations, the cinematography, the story, the structure.Above all, 'Once upon a time in the west' is an exercise in style. A hackneyed genre is re- examined. Reflective viewers will realize later that everything about the film is unbelievable and either a dutiful reinforcement or deliberate refutation of the traditional western.To say this detracts nothing. The film was, is and forever will be a landmark in cinematographic achievement. If you haven't seen it, make sure you do. If you have seen it, watch it again, and again, and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally watched Once Upon A Time In The West almost a year after buying the DVD...yeah I know; how could I...SHAME ON ME!!! What a 'Western' though...after hearing so much about it my expectation was very high and it accomplished to capture me with its slow alluring magnetism. Such is this film from Sergio Leone...a definite classic, one that will be in your memory long after you see it. The visuals and the music go hand in hand and what can I say about the cast; gees Fonda is outstanding. He gambled with going against type and portrays a rather evil character) which undoubtedly pays off and his performance (I would say) is absolutely mesmerizing. I read from the pamphlet included inside the DVD cover that Sergio concentrates a lot on facial expression close-ups....every detail is visible. Looking at the characters faces we see so much, far more than mere words can divulge; they say, "through a man's eyes is the window to his soul". I want to quote what Sergio himself said about the film which is stated on the inside of the DVD cover; - "The rhythm of the film was intended to create the sensation of the last gasps that a person takes just before dying. Once Upon A Time In The West was, FROM START TO FINISH, A DANCE OF DEATH. There have only been a handful of films which can boast the phrase ' poetry on celluloid ' and 'West' is one of them. The storyline isn't new (although a good one nonetheless), certainly for a Western, but there's so much going for it...the entire production is so detailed and the cast outstanding you won't worry about it. There are several main characters throughout, although Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) attracts all of them to her from one incident which occurs in the beginning of the film. The ramifications from this one single act propels the entire plot to the inevitable conclusion of a showdown between good and evil. The music score heightens the atmosphere and also the predominant background sound effects. I noticed in the first instance those attributes played a major part enveloping the surrounding story together...Ennio Morricone sure did his homework on this aspect. Who could ask for more from the creator of such haunting and catchy themes as 'The Good, the Bad And The Ugly', A Fistful of Dollars' and 'For a Few Dollars More'. There's no doubt in my mind 'Once Upon A Time In The West' should be seen at least once, it is a remarkable Western. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must preface my statements by stating that I recently watched this film for the first time. Of course, it was extremely thick--layered with deep character details and plot complexities; like other first-time viewers, I was particularly struck by the beauty and haunting reality of the musical score. This is an exsquisite piece of film-making and should be required viewing for any movie fan. Ahem... now then...This may or may not have been mentioned before, but there seems to be an uncanny similarity between El Diablo (w/Anthony Edwards and Lou Gossett Jr.) and OUATITW. Of course, the former was made far after the latter, but this resulted in probably the greatest example of wholesale carbon-copy atmospheric appropriation in the history of cinema. If anyone has seen El Diablo, perhaps they would attest to the fact that the musical scores and climactic scenes extend beyond heavy influence from OUATITW.Don't get me wrong, I actually like El Diablo (to a certain extent), but the similarities between this film and Once Upon a Time in the West are irregular.

		<fullReview>One of the best things about this film is that you don't have to make any excuses for it. So often older films seem to receive a ratings cushion based on when they were made. Some films are "groundbreaking" or "ahead of their time." While these statements could be used to describe Once Upon a Time in the West, they are not the only reasons to appreciate it. The casting and acting are superb. Claudia Cardinale is gorgeous. The cinematography is incredible. The music is perfect. If Sergio Leone were alive and making this movie in the 21st century I don't think he would have changed a thing (except maybe the voice dubbing). Westerns were so formulaic and non-artistic before the Italians came and started writing and directing. This movie is the ultimate timeless example of the potential of this genre. If I had not known what year this movie had come out I would have no idea if it was 10 years old or 40 years old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One musical reference I can hear is very similar to a section from Ravel's Daphnis and Chloe. There is another reference to a musical theme from one of the dollar trilogy. Can't place which one right now. It's the famous one. Also when "Harmonica" plays the "bad notes", I'm sure it's not from the harmonica. Sounds much more like the strings of the piano played directly - like a "prepared" piano. Might even be a zither. Many use of the major seventh chord which seems to be out of favour for last 30 years. Rarely heard in pop tunes today. Still a beautiful chord. The score sits on it and lets it ring.

All coming as it would be normal to. image 10 out of 10 for western movies, 8.5 out of 10 looking higher One other aspect worth mentioning is the music, sure you can say is a Morricone, but this makes no difference. music 10 out of 10 If you don't like westerns, as i did, just see this one, if you like 'em and you haven't seen this one.... it makes you wonder.PS.

The score is perfectly intertwined with each scene as though they were never separated, and the attention to detail for costumes and set design are brilliant.

On its way, the railroad met characters, various people, and it did not stop. It had a life of its own. Never mind the people, the railroad went westwards (and back). Now, on its way, various dramas were happening. People were dying, people were living. People were killing, people were surviving. The movie catches it all. The railway is unstoppable. And on its way, it met Charles Bronson, and Henry Fonda (their characters, I mean). They were not the main actors in this railroad trip, but they left their mark on it.

		<fullReview>I just finished watching the DVD of this film on a 36" Sony with surround. The idea of seeing this on a full sized movie screen is frightening. It should be renamed "The Western with the really big heads". For some fun you can count the actors pores, they're huge. You can get a feel for this movie by standing 2 inches from a mirror and staring at your own face for five minutes. While doing this try to look evil then look perplexed then righteous. If you do this you'll be acting just like the stars of this flick.The much praised characters are a collection of western stereotypes, good hearted whore, evil eastern robber baron, head henchman and expendable minor henchmen, silent mystery man, and a criminal who turns out to not be so bad. Then add the obligatory slaughtered innocents. How can the plot be, at the same time, both predictable and disjointed? This collection of scenes, some well acted, ought to be in a movie but without linear continuity or at least some back-story, are just that, scenes looking for a movie. These minor complaints aside, the sheer pretension is overwhelming. Save the bad guy so the good guy can wreak personal revenge? More hubris than honor there. A bad movie on many levels, but if you liked that Plan Nine movie you'll love this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the greatest westerns ever made, 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is visually stunning, perfectly cast, and despite a slower, more deliberate pace than Sergio Leone's famous 'Dollars' trilogy, always compelling and never dull. By turns humorous, suspenseful, violent, and profoundly moving, it is a great achievement by Leone to have turned a relatively 'small' story into a film of epic proportions. The score by Ennio Morricone is one of his best, and works wonderfully well with the visuals. I particularly love the scene where Jill McBain arrives at the station and the camera pans up to show the town - a perfect combination of music and image! The acting too is uniformly excellent, especially Henry Fonda as the amoral Frank and the stunningly beautiful Claudia Cardinale as Jill. One of the finest films of the late 1960s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gritty, sharp, and intense are all words that adequately describe Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West. Unfortunately, words like slow, painstaking, and violent term the film just as accurately. I'm not one to shy away from a film simply because it's long. If done correctly, plot can be woven along quite nicely through a long film. (One of my favorite films is From Here to Eternity, which tells a story through a long film quite well.) This film however, felt more of a poorly done documentary than a film at all. (It should be noted that I am a documentary fan, emphasis on poorly done.) The audience has traveled 2 hours into the film full of excess violence and bloodshed before we get any details on the plot. With what is well done in the film, like the lighting, the long shots, the editing, and sound effects, there is so much more that detracts from it. The acting was only sub-par, saved only by a strong screen presence from the veteran Henry Fonda, albeit, in a shift in the roles I'm used to seeing him in. Packed with more violence than a Tarantino flick, the needless bloodshed especially against a little boy 20 mins. in was off- putting to say the least. Maybe it wasn't my type of film, and maybe I'm not well-versed enough in westerns to appreciate this film, but Once Upon a Time in the West is not a story I will be revisiting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good, the Bad and the Slow as Molasses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1968, Sergio Leone's "Once Upon a Time in the West" is an epic story of a mysterious stranger known as Harmonica (Charles Bronson) who joins forces with a desperado named Cheyanne (Jason Robards) to protect a newly widowed ex-prostitute (Claudia Cardinale) from a ruthless assassin, Frank (Henry Fonda), who works for a railroad tycoon (Gabriele Ferzetti).As my title blurb amusingly suggests, this movie is really slow. It's basically an hour and 25 minute movie stuffed with filler to make it twice as long. For example, a man merely getting off his horse and approaching someone to talk is made out to be an epic blow-your-mind event. Absurd. I'm not saying it's not a good movie; it is and it has numerous attributes, like the great cinematography, outstanding cast and hypnotic score. So it's definitely worth watching, but you have to be prepped for an epic, slow movie that's more of a piece of art than a piece of entertainment.Fans of the film defend its slowness on the grounds that it's an allegory of death. They suggest that the movie's always revealing and expanding itself until the last act, where it becomes clear how everything's connected. At this point the film becomes a catharsis as the plot points converge, ending with a duel. Then the picture loudly reveals its theme: The death of the west, the death of gunslingers and the death of the myth. My response: The death of the West and the gunslinger via the encroachment of civilization (here represented by the advent of the railroad) is a constant theme in Westerns, before and since this film. While it's a great theme for any Western, it was nothing novel in 1968. Speaking of 1968, that was the year "2001: A Space Odyssey" came out, which is sort of the Sci-Fi counterpart to this film. Let me put it this way, if you loathe "2001" you'll probably hate this one too.Some say that "Once Upon A Time In the West" is very different from Leone's previous film, the iconic "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" from 1966, but I see a lot of similarities: The epic (overlong) length; the three main characters consisting of good (Bronson), bad (Fonda) and ugly (Robards); a fitting score by Ennio Morricone; and Leone's unmistakably mesmerizing style.Despite my honest criticisms, this is a notable Western and a one-of-a-kind film, highlighted by Bronson's laconic hero, Fonda's villainy, Claudia's curvy beauty and Robards' likable good-desperado. I can see why some hail it as an artistic masterpiece, but I can also see why others think it's repetitive and boring. My appraisal falls in between these two extremes, albeit closer to the former.The version I saw runs 165 minutes and was shot in Arizona; Moab, Utah; Sonora, Mexico; and Andalucía, Spain.GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best revenge movies of all time...western masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Leone,Enio,Argento and Bertolucci work together you get movie like this.One of the best movies ever made,with brilliant acting,powerful music and beautiful shots.For me Jason Robards acting is one of the best acting performance in history of films.If anybody out there didn't see this movie,use your free Sunday,sit back and enjoy in this masterpiece.Western is no longer that popular,but this movie set up high standards,and after Once upon a time,rarely someone dare to make movie in this genre.Watching it over 20 years from time to time, Once upon a time in the west still stands as one of ten best movies in history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Westerns of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Sergio Leone really did a great job on this particular spaghetti western! First off, the cinematography was simply amazing! It just captured the American West in the late 1800's time period perfectly! It was beautifully filmed and it really felt like you were in the old American West! Also the music in this movie was great. It was composed by Ennio Morricone who is known for the music in the man with no name trilogy that starred Clint Eastwood. The acting was also pretty good, especially by Henry Fonda who played a villain for the first time in this film and it had great duel scenes. Charles Brosnan played the character Harmonica ( he earned this nickname by playing the same tune on his Harmonica whenever he is about to duel with someone.) Even though this film is a bit long (175 minutes) it was well worth the time for me. This was a great film and i would recommend this to fans of Spaghetti Westerns, fans of director Sergio Leone and fans of Henry Fonda.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>singing for it and mesmerized by this creep ... hard to explain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why do l love this movie???......well first of all may be this movie defines Sergio Leone's films. Now this film is a real creepy at most of the places but, this could not overweight the grace of this type of film making. Its just amazing that a man could think of and actually work on making such a film. This film is a Spaghetti Western film which has nothing special in its story actually but, but, but, it is an epic of melodrama in its different sense. To me the film was cosy, enchanting and swaying. The people and there lives, their desires and needs, work done to fulfill them and then their consequences all things grafted so differently but cohesively that one cant remain feeling dissatisfied after watching it. There were few dialogues that can make us satisfied...call out the smiling sound of "whooooh yup". Now all the credits goes to the director that he worked on making such a genre and made his artists work for perfection , all in a different sense. Once Upon A Time In The West is different and standing firm for its style. The photography, camera directions, close ups and long shots made me feel as if i am a part of this life there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I completely and utterly adored this film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "Western" genre is not one I'm particularly familiar with, and I didn't quite know what to expect when I watched "Once Upon a Time in the West". I'd heard good things, seen its high position on the ever-reliable IMDb Top 250, so I decided to take a risk and watch this 2.5 hour film. Thankfully, I was not in the slightest disappointed. In fact, I completely and utterly adored it. It's filled with great performances, gripping tension, and completely justifies its long running time.The film tells a story of land-ownership and revenge, with Henry Fonda playing against type as the villain, Frank. Fonda does this with brilliance, and manages to make you forget all of the great hero roles you've seen him play (see "12 Angry Men"). He's dark, mysterious and extremely hateable. The other standout role here is that of Charles Bronson, as Harmonica. Harmonica somehow manages to be an even more mysterious character than Frank, and Bronson manages to keep this running throughout without losing a connection with the audience. The chemistry between the two is electric, and the reveal at the end why vengeance is so important for Harmonica is a stunning twist. The dialogue between them is constantly excellent, but it's also the looks and the silence that really make their hatred of each other real.Being relatively new to the genre, I cannot talk much about references to other Westerns, however there were so many things that instantly made me want to explore further. Leone's direction is fantastic, and he has a great vision running throughout the film. This is set up extremely well in the first 10 minutes, a long dialogue-less scene where three men wait for a train. For all of these 10 minutes, you're on the edge of your seat waiting for something to happen. The action sequences in the film are exciting and don't feel at all superfluous. To bring all of this fantastic film-making together is Ennio Morricone, whose score is tense, exciting and beautiful all at once. The ways that he brings the melody played by Harmonica on his instrument of choice into the rest of the score is masterful. Even though his score for "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" is now seen as clichéd, he moves away into new territory while also staying familiar.For anyone who is completely new to Westerns, "Once Upon a Time in the West" is almost certainly the place to start. It's gripping and thoughtful all at once. And it doesn't feel for one moment like you're watching a 2.5 hour movie, you never want it to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Once a time in the west" (Spiel mir das Lied vom Tod in Germany - Play the song of death for me) this movie had been played in our local cinema. A waited a lot of years so that I was allowed to see this 16 rated movie. And I saw it 3 times in one week and than every time it was in cinema since then (and in the eighties it was every summer for a few days in our local cinema, and every time it was sold out). There are less movies I saw that often then "in the West". Every time it's a party for the eyes and the soul, even when it's in TV not as good than on cinema. As many people told before, Ennio Morricone made one of the best score ever. It's funny, that he wrote the score before Leone made the first picture of the movie. After Leone told him the story, Morricone wrote the music. And during the working on the movie Leone played the music for his actors. Now I bought the BluRay, great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The finest western, if not the finest film ever made. Period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once Upon A Time In The West is a quite simply a masterpiece. No film has ever had the same effect on me. I shan't repeat the many eloquent reviews on here which wax lyrically about Leone's beautiful direction, Morricone's sublime score, and the four perfect lead performances.....there would be no point as i agree wholeheartedly. I will instead just list some of the many small moments in this incredible film, moments which make the experience of viewing Leone's epic even greater than the sum of those aforementioned parts:The expression on Henry Fonda's face as he confronts little Timmy McBain, and the sneer in his voice as he tells Morton "People scare better when they're dying!"....has there ever been a more coldblooded villain in movie history?Claudia Cardinale's brown eyes.Charles Bronson and Jason Robards' putdowns. "You know music- and you can count. All the way up to two!" "Do you know a man with a harmonica? He's someone you'd remember. Instead of talking he plays- and when he'd better play, he talks."THAT opening sequence....THAT shot as Jill arrives at the station, the camera swooping up and over the building to reveal the entire town.And finally, a heartfelt conversation between the film's two most pitiless characters,and bitterest enemies, before their final showdown about how there's no place for their kind anymore in the new civilized America.Leone's previous 3 westerns, particularly his celebrated The Good The Bad &amp; The Ugly, were remarkable movies in their own right. It's a measure of what a triumph Once Upon A Time In The West is that it easily tops them all, along with every other western- yes, even Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Powerful,Unforgettable Epic Masterpiece From Sergio Leone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once Upon A Time In The West is one of the greatest Westerns ever made and a unforgettable,Epic Masterpiece from beginning to end. Filled with powerful direction,great acting,beautiful photography and a brilliant score,Once Upon A Time In The West is not only one of the greatest Westerns of all time,but also one of the greatest films ever made,one of my all-time favorite films and Sergio Leone at his best.Once Upon A Time In The West tells the story of a mysterious stranger named Harmonica(Charles Bronson)who teams up with outlaw Cheyanne(Jason Robards)to protect widow Jill McBain,a former hooker now wife and widow(Claudia Cardinale)from ruthless killer Frank(Henry Fonda)who wants Jill's railroad. Now,Harmonica and Cheyanne must defend and fight for Jill and stop Frank at all costs.Once Upon A Time In The West is a Classic Masterpiece of Cinema that right from the very start has you glued to the screen and give viewers an unforgettable cinematic experience that is a large epic not only in scope but in length. Director Sergio Leone gives viewers a different kind of Western than his excellent and Masterful Dollars/Man With No Name Trilogy especially with The Good,The Bad,And The Ugly. I guess that is one of the reasons Once Upon A Time In The West was overlooked when it came out in 1969 because it was a different film than The Man With No Name Trilogy in other words if the Man With No Name Trilogy were Action packed Westerns with big ambitions than Once Upon A Time In The West is a visual Art film Western. Leone takes the epic scope of TG,TB&amp;TU and expands on it with this film giving us a powerful film that has more visuals than dialog and more drama than Action and also pays tribute to the great Western genre taking the trademarks and familiar things that are in a Western film and turning the trademarks on their head and raises the trademarks to a higher level. One of the great things about OUTITW is that this film is more about visuals and tone than it is about dialog because with this film we are shown and given images that are not just there just to be there but add to the story and makes understand what's going on in with the story and the characters who they are and what their motivations are. The images are haunting and at the same time beautiful and add to the films power and greatness. OUATTW doesn't have a lot of dialog but when the dialog is said it is great and memorable making the characters feel gritty and real. It's interesting that OUATTW and Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyseey came out in the same year and while both films are in different genres(Western and Science Fiction)both films are alike in terms of using visuals and little dialog. Leone and cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli give OUATTW a beautiful visual style making the West look romantic and epic while at the same time making the film gritty and true to how the old West really was. The style is Spagetti Western but is filmed like a Hollywood Western of the 1940s and 50s All though the film is long(at 2 Hrs and 45 Minutes)OUATTW moves at a great pace and there is not a wasted scene in the film because OUATTW is one of those films that is so excellent that you want the film to be longer and keep going. The four main characters Jill,Frank,Harmonica and Cheyanne are great characters who represent the classic Western movie standards and arch types(hooker,killer,mysterious gunfighter-gunslinger,outlaw)but the four of them are presented in a larger than life way and are stylized but at the same time feel very real. With the exception of Frank the other main characters Jill,Harmonica and Cheyanne are given a moral ambiguity and have gray areas where you feel sympathy for the three of them and wonder what will happen with the three of them. Although this is not an Action film there are enough Western gunfights to satisfy Western and Action viewers and when the Action happens it is fast and intense. The final 15-20 minutes builds into one of the best endings in film history because it is filled with tension,suspense,surprises and at the same time sad and optimistic. It's an excellent and unforgettable ending you will not forget.The whole cast is great in their roles. Claudia Cardinale is excellent and beautiful as Jill McBain,with Cardinale holding her own against Bronson,Fonda and Robards. Henry Fonda is brilliant and intense as Frank,one of the greatest villains in film history. Fonda is cold and pure evil and you'll never forget his performance. Charles Bronson is wonderful and mysterious as Harmonica,a quiet gunslinger who plays the Harmonica and has great scenes with Cardinale,Fonda and Robards. Jason Robards is great and humorous as Cheyanne,an outlaw that helps out Harmonica and Jill. Gabriele Ferzetti is amazing as Morton,the railroad baron who is also Frank's boss. Frank Wolf(Brett McBain),Lionel Stander(Barman),Paolo Stoppa(Sam)and Keenen Wynn(Sheriif-Auctioneer)give good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos from Western favorites like Woody Strode(Stony-Member of Frank's gang)and Jack Elam(Snaky-Member of Frank's gang).The direction by Sergio Leone is excellent,masterful and powerful,with Leone always moving the camera,using great angles and intense close-ups bringing a unique visual style to the film. Great direction,Leone.The score by Ennio Morricone is brilliant,beautiful,unforgettable and one of the best scores in film history,with Morricone's score matching the tone and powerful of each scene. A masterful score by Morricone.In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Westerns or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Once Upon A Time In The West,a true Masterpiece of the Western genre and a Masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was alright. To be honest, I was pretty bored for the first half of the movie. Things just weren't made clear enough to make full sense.In the end when it is revealed that Harmonica's brother was killed by Frank was a shocker. I feel this movie would have been much better if it was revealed in the beginning, then we could really have a full tale of revenge instead of revenge just being revealed in the end. In addition, I feel Cheyenne's death at the end was meaningless. Didn't have to happen to finish telling the story.I do feel that the music was good though. Especially the song with the harmonica in it. A memorable tune.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a big fan of westerns. The good guys were plain old good guys and the bad ones were bad just for the sake of being evil. That is precisely what the "spagheti western" genre is against. I feel more involved in a story if either the main character or one of the supporting roles is authentic (Of course, it will be better if both are). That's why I like most of Leone's work.This case is not the exception. The characters were really great. I think that the great actors were an excellent choice. The plot was complicated and smart (Which I look for in a movie). The script was pretty good. The photography was great also, even for a movie this old.Despite its long runtime (I'm not precisely a big fan of long movies), it felt all well focused. The plot unraveled in a really interesting way until we see one of the most tense scenes in westerns (The climax of this film).Overall, this film is definitely a masterpiece. It's one of those movies that let you thinking about them long after the credits rolled. If you liked this title, then you should check out other Leone's films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once upon a time in the west happens to be one of the best western films i have seen.The other being The Good,The Bad and The Ugly.The cinematic depictions in this movie are a blessing.Some scenes in the movie just like the beginning of the soundtrack when Frank(Fonda) first arrives in the movie is just so special.For each character you have a unique soundtrack.For Frank its a dark soundtrack,for Harmonica(Charles Bronson) you hear the Harmonica,for Cheyenne(Jason Robards) its a spooky sort of and for Jill McBain(the beautiful Claudia Cardinale)its a smooth echo kind of.Fantastic guy is this Ennio Marricone.Tremendous pairing between Ennio and Sergio Leonne.The storyline and the rest of the setup is fantastic.You never come to know what Harmonica wanted from Frank till the end.Surely,there were three people in Jill's life.One to kill her,one to love her and one to take her.The underdog in the movie turns out to be Cheyenne who does a fantastic job with Harmonica protecting Jill.The end fight between Frank and Harmonica is grand.Its all about revenge.Though the movie feels to be quite long in the middle portion but makes it up for some fantastic score and a riveting finale.The ending is pretty good.And the dialog,"Its gonna be a beautiful town,sweet water".That just sums up this movie for me.No western can be an epic but surely this is an epic of a western.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Spaghetti Western of All Time!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's "Once Upon A Time in the West," a.k.a. "C'era una volta il West" is one of the all great westerns. Indeed, hands down, it is the greatest Spaghetti western. This tale about railroad expansion in the old West holds its own against the best domestic westerns of John Ford, Anthony Mann, Robert Aldritch, John Sturges, and Budd Boetticher, and Henry Hathaway. The cast is first-rate with iconic western star Henry Fonda playing against type as a cold-blooded killer and gimlet-eyed heavy Charles Bronson wearing the boots of the hero for a change. In between, Jason Robards is splendid as a bearded gunslinger named Cheyenne who has his own gang of killers and Claudia Cardinale as the up-rooted New Orleans prostitute who comes west as a mail-order mail bride for Frank Wolff, usually a villain in Italian westerns. Although it clocks in at a mammoth 165 minutes, "C'era una volta il West" never wastes a minute in telling its vast story, complete with flashbacks. Sergio Leone surpasses anything that he did in any of his Clint Eastwood westerns. The screenplay by Dario "Suspira" Argento, Bernard "Last Tango in Paris" Bertolucci, Sergio "The Big Gundown" Donati, and Sergio Leone contains several epic set-pieces that will never be equaled by anybody. Moreover, it features a sprawling plot. Ennio Morricone's orchestral score, which was finished before the first foot of film was shot, is a legendary in its own right with some unforgettable melodies. The day that Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale of "The Professionals") comes west from New Orleans to join Brett McBain (Frank Wolff of "God Forgives, But I Don't") at his house in the middle of nowhere, she arrives to find tragedy awaiting her. Brett, his two sons, and his only daughter are laid out on the very tables that Jill was to share a picnic welcoming her to their home. As it turns out, Frank (Henry Fonda of "Fort Apache") and his duster-clad henchmen show up ahead of Jill and massacre the McBain family. One of Frank's henchmen accidentally calls Frank by his name just as McBain's youngest son comes running out of the house. "Now that you've called me by name," Frank observes and pulls out his revolver and guns down the kid! Nobody but Sergio Leone would have had the balls to pull this off with one of America's greatest heroes masquerading as the epitome of evil.Charles Bronson plays an enigmatic gunslinger who keeps his six-gun tucked snugly in his waistband near the base of spine. He plays a harmonica like you have never heard a harmonica played. Whenever The Man (Bronson of "Red Sun") utters a word, it sounds like a classic line. In fact, there isn't a bad line of dialogue in the entire movie. The Man meets Cheyenne at the same time that Jill encounters him at a remote stagecoach station in the middle of John Ford's Monument Valley. Jill is on her way to meet the McBain's when the driver pulls up for a drink. Inside, Jill asks about a bath and the proprietor (Lionel Stander of "Beyond the Law") tells her that only three people have used it today. All together, she inquires contemptuously, or one at a time. About that time, Cheyenne (Jason Robards of "Hour of the Gun") makes the grandest entrance of them all. A fusillade of gunplay sounds before he stumbles into the way station, gulps at a jug, and then has a man shoot off his shackles while he holds a gun on him.Sergio Leone pours more style and substance in these 165 minutes than you can stand. There isn't a single thread of the plot that is left dangling (unless you watch a cut version of it on AMC) and everything fits together like a puzzle. "C'era una volta il West" was the first Spaghetti western to be filmed partially on location in the United States. The film is an indictment of big business, meaning the railroads, and railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti of "On Her Majesty's Secret Service") serves as a visual metaphor for the corruption in the railroads with his bone cancer that forces him to walk with crutches or an overhead grid of poles that he can lower to enable him to walk around his railroad coach. Morton dreams of reaching the West coast with his railway. Frank acts as Morton's right-hand man and both men understand each other all too well. Without one the other could not exist.Repeatedly, Leone serves up a flashback that has a younger but just as mean Frank chewing on an apple and sauntering through the desert with a sadistic grin on his face. Frank's idea of a good time is to hang the brother of one man by forcing him to stand on his little brother's shoulders. The older brother hangs only after the younger one has collapsed from the exhaustion of holding brother up."C'era una volta il West" contains some of the coolest shoot-outs ever staged on-screen. The opening shoot-out at an isolated water stop along a railroad in the desert is classic with three gunslingers waiting for the train to arrive. Jack Elam catches a fly in his gun barrel and listens to it buzz. Woody Strode stand under a water tower and lets water collect in the rim on his Stetson. Al Mulock as 'Knuckles' cracks his knuckles in ways you could never imagine. This scene goes on and on and then Bronson arrives and the showdown begins. Anybody who likes Spaghetti westerns must see "C'era una volta il West." The lip synchronization is 100 per cent on the money with no discrepancies. The photography is flawless and costume design is marvelous. Interestingly, the closest that most Hollywood westerns can to the long, dark, duster coats that Leone's gunslinger sport were the rain slickers. "C'era una volta il West" was a smashing success overseas but a resounding flop in the states.</fullReview>

If you love A Fistfull of Dollars, For A Few Dollars More, and The Good The Bad and The Ugly, you will love this. I liked it better than those 3, but I won't argue with anyone if they liked any of those better, they are all good too. You can tell that Leone had a way larger budget for this movie, and it helps to bring the entire atmosphere to life. Charles Bronson's character is superb. Jason Robards character was funny/badass(My favorite character, and Henry Fonda...wow. Fonda was awesome! If you like movies that aren't all flash and dazzle actions like Face/Off or the Bad Boys series (This is no knock on those movies cause I like those too) then you will like this movie. Leone shows how he is one of the best directors in history with this movie. It is definitely worth picking up to own; I found it at a local store for 12 dollars. One of the best buys I ever made. See this movie!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"C'era una volta il West" (called "Once Upon a Time in the West" in English) truly feels like the culmination of Sergio Leone's artistic desires. This convoluted story of two men (Charles Bronson and Jason Robards) joining forces to protect heiress Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) from a thug (Henry Fonda) is a treat in every way. First, there's the opening scene: it really blows your mind when you see that the villain is Henry Fonda. Bronson and Robards play their roles as cool, but giving the impression that there's something beneath that suave exterior. And Claudia Cardinale is...well, you probably know that virtually all European actresses back in the '60s were hot babes, but this one makes the audience feel that there's more to her to than just good looks.All in all, this is a movie for everyone. It's weird to think that Dario Argento - now a horror director - was involved in the making, but it's true. Really cool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once Upon a Time in the West is a movie definitely made for the big widescreen. Parts of it made me feel I was on a Disneyland ride. While the movie isn't going to win any screenplay awards with its minimalist dialog, the imagery and music bring the story all together.The viewer has to let the film draw you in so that you are right there with the characters. This movie has got to have some of the most tightest facial shots on any film I've seen; Especially when the drama is building to a crescendo.Another reviewer called this a postmodernist Western and that description is spot on. I can see where Clint Eastwood learned to do his stares and glares and where his Oscar winning Best Picture, The Unforgiven, sprang from.OUATITW was definitely ahead of its time because it doesn't seem aged at all considering it was made in 1968.This isn't the old yippie-i-o-kyay classic Westerns; It's a new postmodern Western that takes the genre in a new direction.I only wish I saw this movie earlier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best stylistic western I have ever seen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 8/25/2005 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Sergio Leone): The best stylistic western I have ever seen. Sergio Leone uses sound(and sometimes the lack of it), music(by Ennio Morricone), atmosphere and some of the best acting talents of the time to create a masterpiece of a western that grabs you before the beginning credits finish to pretty-much the end with only small lapses in the middle. It's neat to watch each of the unique characters go thru their paces as they wind thru the story coming to each of their conclusions. Charles Bronson is great as "Harmonica", the man who plays before he speaks. He has a story to tell that comes out in the last 15 minutes of the movie in the way of a flashback. Most of Sergio Leone's characters don't speak a lot except for Jason Robards' character who is the most un-Sergio-leone-like but his character even works for the most part. Fonda plays a ruthless killer who's looking to gain the property of the widow played by Claudia Cardinale and along the way gains respect for Harmonica despite their extreme differences. Cardinale is unpredictable as the widow who's just trying to do what's right for herself and holds her own very well. This epic western could only have been better if it never ended. A sequel would have been great just to see how the remaining characters carry on and to see how the new town of "Sweetwater" exists with Cardinale at the helm. Bravo Mr. Leone!! This is the kind of western that I can handle. Deep on character and story with just enough bravado to not lose it's western-branding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best western ever made !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much like many masterpieces, it is demanding. This film has been accused of being a little slow in parts. I have shown this to film students in a film class I have taught and I noticed many of the class members were getting a little fidgety throughout and a little bored. But during the last 30 minutes they were on the edge of their seats, shouting at the screen and clapping when it ended. They were all blown away. Even the young girl who thought she was sure to hate it and complained throughout the film, by the end became its most vocal admirer.This film may be a tad slow but that's only because the brilliant grande finale is build up slowly throughout and the mounting tension is released explosively at the end. The best opening to a film ever and the best closing shot ! What more could you want !!! Brilliant 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the most skillfully made western of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone shows again that he is at least as good as John Ford at making westerns. This movie has a total of three real fight scenes, but the film is shot so splendidly that there is tension the entire time. The fight scenes aren't even that long, but the anticipation of the fight is where the real feelings come from. Also one of the best acted movie I have ever seen. Bronson, Ford, and Robards do some of the best work of their respective careers, Robards's undoubtedly best role of all time. Ford may have done better work in other places, but if so, then not by much, and Bronson was simply magnificent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gives a new meaning to a word "masterpiece"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The spectacular, excellent and downright phenomenal dollars trilogy starring Clint Eastwood and masterful, highly beloved "Once upon a time in the west" simply proofs one obvious fact: all the greatest westerns are made by a man called Sergio Leone. For example every single movie legendary John Ford directed is down there under Leone's ingenious works. Personally "The Good, the bad and the ugly" is my all time favorite but that doesn't mean this one is in any way less perfect. Charles Bronson as the mysterious harmonica made the role that I still consider to be the finest of his career and Henry Fonda is absolutely terrific as the bad guy. Morricone's glorious music with stirring electric guitars, first-rate acting, marvelous dialogue, ultra-stylish photography...everything in "Once upon a time in the west" sends shivers down my spine. This is an ultimate western and the kind of an immemorial movie masterpiece the world of cinema will never, ever forget. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine Copycat Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Django Unchained, it seemed necessary to catch up on a few old westerns to see if there's any connections worth noting. The most distinctive element ended up being how original Django is compared to the composite mimicking that went on in Once Upon. Looking back at the dates of the best westerns and chronology of this film, it's less surprising.Beyond that, the first thing you'll notice about this, at least viewers who see Star Wars long before they get around to classic westerns, is that Princess Leia shares a similar hair style to an Irish teen in this.While money and guns are once again a big focus in this film, revenge becomes the primary theme. Underlying everything is the dirtiness and lack of water, which is one of its better qualities.Technically, it has an enjoyable, whistling-worthy soundtrack along with a lot of authentic looking settings and trains, and even bathing and coffee making. It's enough to make it worth seeing once, but hardly one of the best, even once upon a time in the 1960s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best Spaghetti Western - the best Western of all time!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came to this film quite late in life - I was born in the 60's and only since hitting middle age have a I regressed into older films before my time.I'm so glad I did - the genius of Sergio Leone is there to see and Once Upon a Time in the West tops them all. Mr Leone is a not a director but more a walking art form. Like a Picasso for the silver screen. The way he uses breathtaking landscapes with a complete absence of dialogue is simply awe inspiring. I can't recall how long the film plays before there is a spoken word but it is definitely a long time.Some people argue that Leone's style is overblown, it is too slow and laborious. Such impatience detracts from what is a visual feast served up with top notch acting performances. If there was ever a formula for the perfect Western this is it. The harmonica player with the hidden agenda, the villainous hit-man with a vulnerable edge, the bandit with a surprisingly good heart.Casting Henry Fonda against type as a villain must have raised some critical eyebrows at the time and yet it is a masterstroke. Leone wanted Fonda to wear contact lenses because a villain 'can't have blue eyes' and yet those same blue eyes somehow add to the insanity of Fonda's character. Bronson hardly talks in the film and yet he always seems to be there (or is that just his harmonica). Jason Robards also puts in a vintage turn with the audience never quite sure whether he is good or bad.Best bit for me - the scene where Bronson protects Fonda from assassins, in essence keeping him alive for that final, inevitable and glorious showdown. Ennio Moriconne's quirky but lavish scoring adds the luxury topping to what is one of the finest cakes ever baked.I love the tales of the Old Wild West and have watched lots of Westerns in my time. But whilst there are many excellent movies in this genre, all are compared to this masterpiece and fall short. If it were a boxing match the towel would be thrown in at the end of the first round.This film has no equal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really my thing, but I still found enough to admire.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who has never particularly been a fan of the western genre, I'm sure that I don't fit much into the demographic for Once Upon a Time in the West. Still, I was able to find enough to admire here. Sergio Leone is a director who, if nothing else, knows damn well how to stage a scene. The first hour is basically a combination of extended introductions to our main characters, but each one is incredibly tense and memorable. We meet the mysterious Harmonica (Charles Bronson) gunning down those who were out to kill him, the villainous Frank (Henry Fonda) as he shoots a child, the mischievous Cheyenne (Jason Robards) as he escapes custody and the beautiful Jill (Claudia Cardinale) as she arrives off her train.Each sequence is drawn out but doesn't feel overlong, giving us a first look at the characters that sticks with the viewer until long after the credits roll. That opening hour doesn't delve into the plot much, or the characters themselves, but it's easily my favorite area of the film as it shows a lot of what Leone is best at doing. In these scenes Leone shows his gift for building suspense, utilizing silence when it's appropriate as opposed to trying to ratchet up the tension with directorial tricks. He lets the silence build it all, giving an eerie calm so that when the violence occurs it startles you, shakes you up. In a time so desensitized to graphic violence on film, Leone knows how to make his bullets matter.The four main characters are all memorable and solidly well-acted, potentially with the exception of Harmonica. I found Bronson serviceable in his role, but the role itself wasn't one that I cared for; the whole mysterious stranger playing his harmonica because he's a badass thing was something that I found laughable almost immediately and it was hard for me to take seriously throughout the film. Bronson allowed me to get over it after a while, along with lessened use of his theme that I found incredibly grating in the opening act, but I still had a hard time not laughing at the basic idea of the character. The other three were sources of great enjoyment for me, though. Fonda goes against his persona and plays a vile bad guy, which is a genius bit of casting on Leone's part, and he uses those baby blue eyes to penetrate you so he can rip out your heart. I think it's one of his finest performances, seeing someone so adored for being wholesome take on such a cruel bastard.Claudia Cardinale is stunningly gorgeous here, but she also brings a lot of womanly fire to the boy's club. Working against people like Fonda and Bronson, it could have been easy to fall into the role of the helpless woman, but Cardinale makes Jill McBain maybe the most aggressive character in this show. She's got a ton of passion and refuses to let the men push her around. Cardinale may be my favorite performance in the film, but I'd have to say that my favorite character belongs to Jason Robards' Cheyenne. While the feud between Frank and Harmonica rages on, battling with each other while Jill is caught in the middle, Cheyenne is just a wild outlaw having fun in the midst of it all; and oh what fun Robards makes him. You can tell that Robards had a great time shooting this, and seeing him in this character brings a levity to the film that is a welcome relief.There are definitely a lot of things that I liked about this film, but for everything that I liked there was something that I disliked as well. As great as Leone is at crafting individual sequences, the film became rather tiresome once it tried to actually start doing something with it's characters and narrative. The first hour is exciting and the final half hour or so was a nice conclusion, but everything in the middle dragged on and on. I enjoyed the characters but I didn't particularly care about them, and the script writes them all so thin.Everything is too black-and-white, with a meaningless plot that was clearly created around the individual scenes. It's like they were writing their cool characters and cool sequences but then realized they had to actually make a narrative to have them exist in so they just tossed something together. It doesn't have a drive at all, despite such excellent moments. Once Upon a Time in the West is a film with a lot to admire, but for me it ended up being less than the sum of it's parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I made a film with this girl once. She was only the camera operator but was obsessed with unnecessarily drawing out scenes, zooming in, zooming out, and claiming it was for the sake of "creating tension".I have to wonder if she'd taken this film as her template.I watched OUATITW as a part of a university class, and at the beginning my lecturer informed us that the title sequence is, reputedly, the longest in the history of cinema. I don't know if that's true, but it certainly felt like forever. A forever of nothing happening. And the same might be said for the rest of the film. Two hours of faffing about, then five minutes of vaguely interesting story, and then another twenty minutes faffing about before it finally ends. This does not create "tension". It doesn't create "atmosphere". It creates BOREDOM, and if all the unnecessary scenes were removed, or chopped down at least, it would not only have been a much shorter film, it might have been a slightly more interesting one. I didn't understand anyone's motivation and I really didn't care. I was just mentally screaming "oh, just hurry up and shoot the guy and be done with it!"I didn't like westerns before. I passionately hate them now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For years I had heard critics and some film buffs heaping praise on this film. I finally got the chance to sit down and see the film for myself and to say the least it was dissapointing. The performances are adequate, the plot is routine and there are entire sections where absolutely nothing happens. I know alot of people will argue that Sergio Leone was using the less is more approach to set the tone of the film but for me it just didn't work. Leone was a technically proficient director and some of the camerawork in this film is brilliant, If he had only learned to pick up the pace a bit I believe the film could have worked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding epic western that is truly one of the best of its kind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>C'era Una Volta Il West is a real contender for the title of greatest western of them all. A masterpiece on every level, it is easily the best film ever made by director Sergio Leone ? fine praise indeed for a man whose other works include the likes of The Good, The Bad And The Ugly and Once Upon A Time In America. What makes the film doubly impressive is the way that it moves at its own uniquely languid pace, with the camera pausing on sweaty faces and vast empty landscapes for seemingly indefinite periods of time. These frequent lingering pauses ? almost certain to provoke tedium in any other film ? here take on an absorbing significance and fascination. Although the initial reaction is that much time seems to be wasted during C'era Una Volta Il West, on reflection one realises that every frame is beautifully composed and makes some kind of contribution to the overall atmosphere of this most atmospheric of films. It is a film that continues to leave impressions on the viewer long after the final credits roll.In the Old West, a mysterious "Harmonica"-playing gunslinger (Charles Bronson) arrives at a remote railway station anticipating a meeting with someone named Frank. Instead he is met by three hired killers, who try to gun him down but are actually themselves killed in the exchange. Later a family of homesteaders are murdered in cold blood by a gang of gunmen, led by the afore-mentioned Frank (Henry Fonda). The father of the murdered family was supposed, before his death, to have collected from the nearest train station a prostitute he married during a trip to New Orleans, the beautiful Jill (Claudia Cardinale). When he fails to collect her from the nearby town, Jill ventures to the homestead to find out what has become of him. During her journey from the town to the house, she has a strange encounter with an outlaw on the run, Cheyenne (Jason Robards), as well as the enigmatic Harmonica. Upon discovering her new family dead, she inherits their remote home and later realises that her deceased husband intended to transform the house into a railway station when the ever-expanding train tracks reached their piece of land. Frank is instructed by railway mogul Morton (Gabrielle Ferzetti) to get Jill, now the legitimate owner of land that he wants, out of the picture by whatever means necessary. Meanwhile, Harmonica keeps flitting in and out of Jill's - and Frank's - life, an almost supernatural figure whose motives remain unclear until all is revealed at the film's haunting climax.C'era Una Volta Il West is visually perfect throughout, with every camera angle and widescreen shot worked out literally to the millimetre. Ennio Morricone provides an incredible music score ? my favourite film music of all-time by a country mile ? in which each of the five main characters is cannily given their own leitmotif, repeated every time they're on screen. In the final showdown between Harmonica and Frank, both characters' leitmotifs are cleverly overlapped to generate extraordinary drama and tension. The performances are excellent, most notably Fonda (cast against type as a despicable murderer, and mightily effective in the role), Robards (who is wonderfully charismatic as a charming rogue), and Bronson (whose nonchalance and woodenness as an actor is used to the film's advantage to make him supremely enigmatic). A film of endless pleasures that stands up to renewed viewings time and again, C'era Una Volta Il West is a triumph ? a film that simply MUST be seen by any one who loves movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best opening sequence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A squeaking wind pump, a dripping water tower and the baking sun. The beginning of Once Upon a Time in the West, in which three hired guns wait wordlessly at a train station for their target to arrive, is one of the best openings in cinema history. It is every bit as tense as Sergio Leone's finale in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, which he filmed two years earlier.But good as this Western revenge saga is, it is not as accessible and a good deal slower than the other films in Sergio Leone's series of Westerns (namely A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly). What many reviewers describe as its "operatic" and "epic" nature can also be read as "occasionally mawkish" and "overlong".That said, this story earns its status as a classic for combining the gun-toting fun of westerns with the grand theme of the end of the Wild West, brought about by the arrival of the railroad. The railroad is the villain here as Henry Fonda plays an unscrupulous blue-eyed bad guy paid to force landowners to sell up cheap so the rails can pass through.Charles Bronson is a darker take on Leone's man-with-no-name character, but it is debatable whether that makes him more interesting then Clint Eastwood's version.The main characters each have a theme tune, opera-style, which is an interesting motif, but quite an irritating one when you have heard the harmonica tune for the 30th time.A fine movie, but claims that it changed the western any more than Leone's previous films or that it is better than The Good, the Bad and the Ugly should be taken with a pinch of salt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess this movie is probably thought of as Leone's masterpiece, delivering, as it does, a dose of the old west with immense style and self-assured presence. Much of the cinematic style used by Leone has entered the folklore of the west and is as much a part of that folklore as spitting, guns, dust and swinging saloon doors. I can't imagine a duel any other way than through Leone's eyes and I now expect a Western to always have a 'man with no name' character who says virtually nothing.This movie has it all...the waiting, the heat, the sweat, the dust and then the swift, deadly violence. The story is not bad either, pitting our hero and an outlaw against a murderous railway man who is seeking to get a recently widowed ex-whore out of her inheritance. But what it really has is great shots of the amazing scenery, and real, palpable tension. Leone described the film as having the rhythm of the last gasps of a dying man. It is very much like that, and this builds a very strong sense of foreboding. Everyone will not walk away intact, death is woven into the fabric of the movie. As we move from one convulsion to the next the tension is ratcheted up to extreme levels so that the eventual violence is almost a relief. The end result is an amazing movie that helped to create the legend of the old west, and that is now a part of the legend. It looks amazing, it's a rollicking good tale, and it'll leave you desperate for a beer!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A feast for eyes and ears! Leone's film is a timeless masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THIS is perhaps the greatest film ever made. A passionately penned down portrait revolving on the downfall of the West-era. Brilliantly filmed, with careful attention for the smallest detail and performed by gifted actors and actresses in not so obvious roles. Straight from the slow and clammy opening credits sequence, you notice that this is an epic that will require your full attention and one that'll automatically provoke great feelings of respect and admiration. A cowboy's struggle with a fly is portrayed like it is a devastating battle, guided by unnatural noises on the background that put an extra emphasis on the unbearably tropic climate. This is the merciless West and you need your eyes and ears focused at all times to avoid trouble with someone more powerful than you. I have seen this masterpiece of film-making numberless times now and I still get mesmerized instantly when I behold the atmospheric set-pieces and the ominous characters. A truly magnificent opening to what will become a powerful movie experience and yet nothing of the actual storyline has been revealed yet!"Once upon a time in the West" is a collaboration between titans...For the flawless screenplay, Leone (already a master-writer himself) received assistance from no less than Bernardo Bertolucci and Dario Argento (this latter is a personal God of mine). These icons, who already deserve statues for the work they did separately, combine their talents and deliver a genuine western story that involves organized crime, blackmail, revenge and even human emotions. Separate story lines that only come together neatly in the end, after a series of fascinating sequences filled with suspense and dazzling action. Leone grabs every chance to innovate with both hands and this results in unexpected shock moments (the slaughter of the Irish family) and even completely unimaginable anti-castings (Henry Fonda as a relentless gangster?). The main story lines are very diverse but Leone takes his time to slowly clarify them all. Tough guys are hired secure the construction of a railroad while a notorious gangster escapes from jail, only to find out that someone abused his trademarks to get their dirty work done. A beautiful woman has been widowed without knowing it and she stands alone in an abandoned, dangerous land. And then there's a lonely cowboy patiently waiting to fight a personal battle of which no one knows the details. If you've chosen to watch "Once upon a time in the West", get ready to be overwhelmed by fascination and involvement...expect yourself to sit on the edge of your seat, exploring all the corners of the TV-screen as you want to make sure you're not missing a thing! Leone could count on the perfect cast, with the already mentioned Henry Fonda in an unusual but fitting role and Claudia Cardinale who embodies every male creature's dream. Charles Bronson and Jason Robards complete the great cast, both in the finest roles of their overall brilliant careers.The previously summed up elements already indicate that this is an unmissable cinema event and then I haven't even spoken of the music yet! For many fans the ultimate reason to point out "Once upon a time in the West" as the greatest film ever made and they're right! Ennio Morricone's score is so marvelous, so perfect that it began to lead its own life outside the film. The constantly repeated tunes "Man with the Harmonica" and "Goodbye to Cheyenne" cause a chemical reaction inside your body every time and they provide the story with extra depth and atmosphere. The images on the screen and the music you hear form a wholesome that can never be topped in cinema. This is the best, period! We should only use superlatives when talking about this film: the BEST and the most UNIQUE In case I haven't made myself clear thus far: "Once upon a time in the West" is a motion picture that belongs in every DVD-collection. With my most sincere apologies to Sam Peckinpah, John Ford and Howard Hawks but this is simply put the best western ever!</fullReview>

Seeing 'OUATITW' also reminded me of Shakespeare: did the actors, during the seeming hundreds of interminable pauses between the banalities they uttered think they were doing 'Hamlet' or 'King Lear'? My irritation and the distraction it caused led me to ponder minutiae; I wondered a few times how the characters were feeding their horses and livestock. No fields of alfalfa, no streams or rivers. Just 'stark' arid desert. (Perhaps 19th Century American western fauna could find nutrition in cacti?) On occasion I enjoy seeing forty, fifty, sixty year old American films with all star casts even if the movies stories don't hold up.

		<shortDescription>A Western Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1964, a small time director named Sergio Leone, unknown in America, directed A Fistful of Dollars and would subsequently change the way the world looked at 'westerns' forever. Up until this time, westerns consisted of the perfect hero, who was invincible and always did the right thing; a knight who traded in his shining armor for cowboy boots. It was the duty of this morally outstanding superman to take on the despicable villain, complete with a black hat, save the girl, and ride off into the sunset. Then came Leone, who gave us stories and characters that were not black and white, good and evil, but rather a grey reality. Leone's protagonist, the so-called 'man with no name' (as played by Clint Eastwood), did not always do the right thing. He was not the noble sheriff or marshal, but instead a mysterious stranger looking for a buck. In fact, in the third film The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, there is only a thin line separating the 'good' from the 'bad' and 'ugly'. Leone's revolutionary westerns did not stop there. His cinematography would become his calling card- beautiful panoramic shots of big country combined with extreme close-ups, what has been described as using the faces of the characters as second landscapes. Throughout his career, Sergio Leone would work with one of the greatest composers of the 20th century, Ennio Morricone. Morricone's use of harmonicas, chimes, and amplified guitars (just to name a few) along with natural sounds, such as the creaks of a windmill, would become a trademark of not just Leone, but the entire Italian 'spaghetti' western sub-genre. It is in 1968 that Leone would direct a new project, leaving the "man with no name' series behind. This new project, Once Upon a Time in the West, would combine the traditional western with the groundbreaking work in his previous three films to create an epic masterpiece, true cinematic art.Story Once Upon a Time in the West tells the story of five characters, all intertwined by property just made valuable by the railroad. A mysterious drifter called Harmonica (Bronson) comes to the town of Flagstone, but this time not for the allure of money. Harmonica is after revenge, and a central element of the film is Harmonica's past. In one of the boldest, most brilliant casting moves ever, Henry Fonda plays Frank, an emotionless killer working for the crippled railroad baron Morton (Ferzetti). Frank and Morton plan to take the newly valuable McBain property, and blame it on the notorious criminal Cheyenne (Robards). But the true star is Claudia Cardinale, playing Jill McBain, the beautiful prostitute who marries Brett McBain, owner of the property. The casting works perfectly. Bronson gives a distinct feel to the 'drifter' character. Ferzetti has this aristocratic look to him, perfect for the power player Morton. Robards is both rugged and comedic, the type of guy who can crack a joke one minute and wipeout a gang of lawmen the next. Cardinale is beyond gorgeous. And then we have Henry Fonda, who destroyed his beloved, wholesome image and portrayed one of the top villains in movie history.Cinematography In OUATITW, we see the evolution of Leone. The cinematography is perfect. This truly is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen, ranking right up there with 2001: A Space Odyssey. Wide shots of the beautiful, open country side lends to the epic, opera-like feel. To portray emotion, Leone used close-ups of the actors' faces rather than dialogue. His style takes the old saying 'a picture is worth a 1000 words' and uses it in the most brilliant way. Often times we need only to see the expression on the character's face to understand the situation, not forced dialogue. Once Upon is a masterpiece of pacing. The film progresses slowly, but in a dramatic, epic way. The opening scene is an example of his genius. We are introduced to three gunfighters waiting at the train station, with only noises in the background, such as the creaking of a windmill. The three men are silently waiting for the looming confrontation with whatever or whoever is on the next train. The camera zooms in on the men's faces, and WAM, the train comes in with a deafening screech. One could never guess that a 12-minute opening, with almost no dialogue, could be so powerful and tension building.Sound You cannot discuss a Leone film without discussing the sound. Ennio Morricone composed all of the film's music before a single scene was shot. The actors act to the music, scenes are shot to the music. Unlike the Eastwood trilogy where there would many pieces and themes, there are only a few themes for the central characters and they are used repeatedly. Bronson's harmonica theme is haunting; Fonda's theme featuring amplified guitar is the definition of amazing; Robard's humorous banjo theme is a refreshing break between the intensity; and Cardinale's romantic theme is just as beautiful as she is. Morricone's music definitely surpasses the previous trilogy in its ability to set the mood, and become like an additional character, an additional setting. The use of natural sound is superb, from the flight of birds to the trotting of horses.Overall The camera work is perfect, the music and sound is incredible, the acting is excellent, and the pacing is genius. As you can so obviously tell, this is one those classics that you will never forget in your lifetime. The opening scene, Frank's introduction, the image of a blurry Frank walking behind a desert background, the showdown, all are imbedded into my brain. There are movies, meant to make money and entertain, and then there are films, art. Once Upon A Time in the West is art in its purest form.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I saw this on the IMDb top 250 and made a mental note to watch it, and when I saw it for sale somewhere I grabbed it, thinking, "Hey, top 250, this is a don't-bother-renting-just-buy situation!". Three hours of epicosity later, I'm not impressed.The only reason you could give this a rating higher than a six or seven, in my opinion, would be based on its historical significance. Film students may be exulting in its groundbreakingness so much that they don't notice that it's three hours long. You, however, will.I'm not trying to contradict all the people that say this is the first time X or Y was done, I'm just saying that whatever fancy cool amazingly before-their-time techniques were employed, they weren't done in a way that made the film enjoyable. So, by all means, as part of a class, and with the historical context firmly in your grasp so you can stay awake looking for the right stuff, watch it. Otherwise, I expect you'll want your three hours back. All the fancy-schmancy stuff they talk about like extreme close-ups, etc, just make it drag and drag and drag.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some American Meatballs In A Spaghetti Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never been crazy about foreign made westerns because in my humble opinion it's an original American art form. We don't do Shakespeare or Moliere or Cervantes in American cinema, why do Europeans insist on a pale imitation of a uniquely American contribution to cinema? Not they've done bad westerns all the time, Once Upon A Time In The West is not a bad film. I've just never accorded it the landmark status that some give it.Still Sergio Leone certainly packed this film with enough American names so that it does read like a cast John Ford could have put together. In Ford's last western with Henry Fonda, Fonda played the ramrod martinet Colonel Thursday who led his troops into a massacre because of his pursuit of glory. That was as close to a villain Fonda ever played on the screen before. Leone made Fonda ratchet his game up several notches in villainy, he's truly evil here. Fonda's a man in the pay of the railroad who wants to get a homestead family off a particularly important piece of land. Fonda also goes and frames another outlaw gang headed by Jason Robards, Jr. for the evil deed. But what no one figures on is that the homesteader had gone and married a second wife played by Claudia Cardinale. She's got the land now.She's also got a mysterious guy with a harmonica played by Charles Bronson helping her while he's pursuing his own agenda. Who he is and what the agenda he's following is something you would watch Once Upon A Time In The West to find out.I've never been terribly crazy about the music Leone employs here. Some folks swear by it, but for me I'll take John Ford's use of American melodies any day and twice on Sunday. And although Jason Robards, Jr. has a beautiful death scene, it was copied in part from what Sam Peckinpah did with Joel McCrea in Ride the High Country.Still with a cast that also includes people like Keenan Wynn, Jack Elam, and Woody Strode there are enough Americans who know their way around the Hollywood west to give it a familiar ring. Once Upon A Time In The West is a decent enough western, but hardly rates landmark status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extrmely long and boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it interesting how the critics always rave about these old movies, that have big name actors, no matter how bad the movies really are. This is a perfect example. If this movie was made today (especially if it had smaller name actors) the critics would all pan it. This movie is WAY too long, almost 3 hours. It only has about an hour and a half worth of story. The rest of the time is taken up by a lot standing around saying and doing nothing. Very long and very boring. Jason Robards is fun, Henry Fonda's good being evil, Chuck Bronson's fair, and Claudia Cardinale looks good, and has nice tiddies, but she is a terrible actress, seemingly barely able to speak English.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The man with a Harmonica (Charles Bronson) arrives at a desolate train station. He's met by three gunmen sent by Frank (Henry Fonda) and he promptly kills them. Jill (Claudia Cardinale) is a new young bride from New Orleans. She arrives to live with her husband Brett McBain and his family in an isolated desert homestead he calls Sweatwater. She finds the whole McBain family massacred. Cheyenne (Jason Robards) is the prime suspect but he joins her along with Harmonica to seek revenge on the real killers, Frank and his men who are working for the railroad.This is a western dripping with the Sergio Leone style. The story is simple. It's a lot of attitude. The movie starts with the great Harmonica arrival scene. Woody Strode and Jack Elam are so great that I wish they survived to stay in the movie. A minor problem is that the opening scene is so great that the rest of the movie struggles at times to return to that level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the fourth film taken from Sergio Leone's Dollars series. Once Upon a Time in the West is a fantastic masterpiece. The slow pace of the film only serves to increase the amazement at the beautiful presented scenery. The music score provided Ennio Morricone is just amazing, its so powerful its almost chilling in nature. The character played by Henry Fonda thrills me every time I watch this film and the music that is associated to the character again chilling. The character that Henry Fonda plays is Frank and he is ice cold. Henry's eyes are such a vivid blue as the camera pans around on him. Just mesmerising.The film is set towards the end of the "Old West" era with modern America creeping in. Under no circumstances should you ever miss this film its a must watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Handiwork of a Master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The formula "once upon a time" is traditionally used to begin a fairy- tale or legend, and Sergio Leone's use of it here may be intended to claim legendary or mythical status for his epic story. (He was later to make a gangster epic entitled "Once Upon a Time in America"). Certainly, he makes use of two familiar Western situations, so familiar that they might as well have been drawn from a fairy-tale. One involves a railroad company trying to force honest homesteaders off their land, a trope so well-known that Mel Brooks was to mock it in "Blazing Saddles". The other involves the mysterious lone gunman out for revenge. The film is generally classified as a "Spaghetti Western" because Leone was Italian, but in fact it was partly shot in Spain and partly in America. The action takes place in and around the fictitious town of Flagstone; the name was presumably inspired by Flagstaff, Arizona, and the location is doubtless supposed to be somewhere in the deserts of the American South- West.Brett McBain, an Irish-born homesteader, and his three children are shot dead by a gang of bandits in the pay of a corrupt railroad boss. The railroad want McBain dead because they want to acquire his land cheaply; it lies on top of the only reserves of water in the area and is therefore the only possible route for their new line, as they need water for their locomotives. McBain is well aware of the value of his land and is holding out for a better price. What the villains do not realise is that McBain has recently married Jill, a former New Orleans prostitute who arrives in the West to find herself already a widow.Jill, however, decides to stay and fight the railroad and their hired gunmen. In this she has two unexpected allies. One is Cheyenne, another bandit whom the gunmen have tried to frame for the killings. The other is a mysterious stranger with his own reasons for seeking revenge on Frank, the leader of the gang who killed McBain. We never learn his real name; he is always referred to as "Harmonica" because of his fondness for that instrument.Harmonica might seem like a natural role for Clint Eastwood, and he was indeed offered it, but turned it down, and it went instead to Charles Bronson. I have in the past been critical of Bronson's lack of emotional range, but here his deadpan inscrutability serves him well, adding to his character's air of mystery. This must count as one of his best performances. The casting of Henry Fonda as the cruel, sadistic Frank has been described as "against type", although this was not the only film in which he plays a villain. In another Western from 1968, "Firecreek", he also plays the leader of a gang of outlaws; in both films he shows that he could play a bad guy as convincingly as a good guy. The one cast member I was less keen on was Claudia Cardinale as Jill; she was never the greatest actress in English-language movies, especially in movies where, as here, her dialogue was spoken for her by another actress. (Cardinale did speak her own lines in the Italian version). Another actor whose lines were dubbed was Gabriele Ferzetti as the crippled railroad boss Morton, but he nevertheless makes a memorable villain. Leone was keen to give an epic look and feel to his film, and "Once Upon a Time in the West" is quite deliberately slow-paced, much more so than his earlier "Dollars" trilogy, or at least its first two instalments. I understand that the film exists in three versions; I saw the 145-minute version originally shown in American cinemas, but I understand that there is also a 166-minute version made for the European market and a 175-minute "director's cut". Even the short version, however, features long, slow scenes in which there is little dialogue and little action, with the action sequences themselves brief if violent. This is particularly marked in the famous opening sequence in which in which three of the outlaws wait at a station for the arrival of a train, and around ten minutes goes by in which nothing much happens other than a windmill creaking and a fly buzzing around Jack Elam's face. (This scene was inspired by a similar one in "High Noon", one of a number of deliberate references to famous Westerns).Mention also needs to be made of Ennio Morricone's haunting musical score, at times discordant and plangent, at others melodious and lyrical, making use of unusual instruments including tubular bells and (naturally enough) a harmonica. This music makes an important contribution towards the film's emotional impact.Leone's direction in this film will doubtless divide opinion, with some decrying his slow-motion style as boring and others hailing it as evidence of the handiwork of a master. For myself, I lean towards the latter view; Leone may take his time over telling his story, but in doing so he adds to the film's power and grandeur. Attempting to speed up the action would only have weakened the film's impact rather than improving it. I would not perhaps rank this film as the greatest-ever Western, which is how some have described it, but it is among the best Westerns of the sixties; I would certainly rate it higher than a number of contemporary Westerns, such as "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid", "True Grit" and "The Wild Bunch", which have also been much praised but which for me fall short of greatness. "Once Upon a Time in the West" comes very close to falling within that description. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sergio Leone's first saga of his ONCE UPON A TIME trilogy is a killing Western classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's first saga of his ONCE UPON A TIME trilogy after competing THE DOLLARS trilogy. ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is as good as his classic Spagetti Western predecessors if it is not better. Mustering three Hollywood toughies Bronson, Fonda and Robards, the film evidently echoes the pattern of THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (1966, 8/10), although Bronson is a perfect specimen embodies both the Ugly and the Good, and for the first time Sergio deploys a woman, the Mediterranean beauty Cardinale to be a pivot among these three, contrives an interwoven plot with vengeance, duel, murder, vice as well as the righteous side of the Western ideology: masculinity, integrity, fraternity and chivalry. Three men are introduced with their own respective sequences give their characters a full-blown presentation: the mysterious and tacit Harmonica (Bronson) is a marksman with a stern resolution and trademark music (the 10 minutes-long opening scenes of three gunslingers waiting in the train station is a homage to the opening sequences of HIGH NOON 1952, 8/10); Fonda's Frank is an appalling child killer, remorseless and intimidating, he has no mercy in anyone and can wipe out anything standing in his way; Cheyenne (Robards), the wanted bandits who would be framed for Frank's slaughter, is the most inscrutable one, we cannot easily categorize him at first, his weathered face glimpses with acute wariness, he has escaped from numerous pursue and capture, he could be the last man you ever want to mess with. Cardinale's Jill, a former prostitute from New Orleans, also is granted a strong narrative arc, she is secretly married to Brett McBain (Wolff), nevertheless, on the first day of her arrival for her wedding, her husband's family is being cold-heartedly massacred, she becomes a new widow and inherits a large tract of land, where they intend to build a station when the railway reaches out. Jill inevitably falls the victim of Frank's atrocity, but she is not a common chaste heroine, she necessarily knows how to exploit her advantage to keep alive and find a way out, at the same time, she is not afraid. It is a career-defining role for Cardinale, her strong-willed resilience only add more allure on the erotic exotica of her glamor. Come to the rescue of Ms. McBain is Harmonica and Cheyenne, both harbor an unsaid affection towards her, even more is admiration. They have some unfinished business with Frank and his gang, which also includes the railway tycoon Morton (Ferzetti, who is considerably memorable as he wonderfully conveys the exasperating angst from his bodily defects ), who initially is Frank's boss but slowly loses grip over him as Frank runs amok with his evil deed. The segueing confrontations slacks off a bit in the sense of tension and certain sequences are befuddling for a first-time viewing especially the subplot concerns Cheyenne in the third act is bluntly excised as one could assume a film running around 175 minutes, is there really no room for such an important set piece since obviously Cheyenne is the most interesting role and Robards is so competent and accomplished to convey even the most subtle expression without any affectation, contrast to Bronson's perpetually unfathomable smile hanging on his round but ragged visage, slowly deadens its enigmatic spell and degrades into a deadpan one trick pony. It is Henry Fonda's most iconic role as an out-and-out villain, he is bone-chillingly vicious from his first appearance, but Fonda is also fated to carry on a human level of consciousness when he is forcibly bedding Jill, he is a monster no doubt, and he softens himself in front of the luscious figure which he sympathizes not only out of lust, but also a little glint called kindness. Even during the final showdown, as we all awaits his doom, he is still reminiscent of a man who is perplexed by a riddle or blurred by his memory, until finally Harmonica reveals his identity, his demise is more like a quick relief than a belated punishment for a rotten soul. The film is a bona-fide epic from all aspects, from its immense Flagstone set and the beguiling desert scenery in the 2:35:1 aspect ratio; to the lengthy patience in atmosphere-building and character-establishing; to Morricone's sterling score, which can not be circumvented by any reviewers, the entire sound voyage of the film can take one's breath away, it is visceral, mellifluous and completely at the service of every plot turn, one can even admit, it gallantly steals the thunder from its visual counterpart, and Morricone's virtuosity is still without parallel, so is Sergio Leone's enormous contribution of the undying genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has all the majesty of Italian opera--revenge, death, courage, perseverance, pathos, evil, redemption. There are even leitmotifs in the score,as well; music that is associated with each of the main characters: Jill, Harmonica, Cheyenne, and Frank. The scope and breadth of this film is undeniable. The pace is slow and deliberate, building the tension through close-ups of faces through which the story is communicated without the use of words. But, Leone can pull back into wide-shots of panoramas and vistas of great beauty. Sound is extremely important in creating and conveying the tension as well: the sudden silence of crickets, the monotony of a turning windmill, the crash of waves of an imagined ocean. And, lastly, the film is about America: its violence, its expansion, its robustness, its desire for a better future. ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is about the end of the Old West and the rise of a new.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I used to be biased to western movie. I watched several before this one. I always thought they are good, but not very good. Even Clint Eastwood's "The Good..." is just good, but not great. But this movie totally changed my mind. I could never imagine that a western movie can be so beautiful. This is the best western movie ever. Charles Bronson plays the good guy Harmonica. His performance is superb. I watched his Death Wish many years ago. His performance in that movie already gave me a deep impression. I really like Mrs. McBain played by Claudia Cardinale. She is so lovable. Her facial expression is magnificent. Cheyenne played by Jason Robards is also a cool guy. This movie is like a beautiful poem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sergio Leone was anathema to film audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine yourself living in the 1970s and watching "Once Upon a Time in the West" (1968). Then go live in 2003 to watch a 2-Disc "Special Collector's Edition" released by Paramount, with a running time of 165 minutes. Finally, let's dwell in a world of 2013 and try to watch the legendary film again - obviously the threads of a long story should stitch together, but does it? I may seem stupid but Sergio Leone's work has always stupefied me and thus while he made only 6 full feature movies. Those are the "Man With No Name" saga (3 gunslinger movies with actor Clint Eastwood) and the "Once Upon a Time" saga (3 historical movies about America's past from end of 19th and first half of 20th cc.) He didn't learn to speak English in his lifetime and communicated with his American actors by broken attempts at English, Italian or French. That is the reason, I reckon, why it is sometime impossible to recognize the plot in his working and these are quizzes that the titular took with him in grave.On summary Sergio Leone spent his whole life living and working at Cinecitt? Studios in Rome. That was the European equivalent to Hollywood Studios in America. Amazing as it is, Leone never made shooting in America - the most he did were some exterior scenes in New York for his last movie, everything else was shot in Italy and Spain. People that knew him remember how he always walked around in a long robe like Roman senator. I saw him alive only once in a 6 min. documentary from the bonus disk at hand, this with additional material on "Once Upon a Time in the West" directed by Lancelot Narayan.On to the movie. I don't underestimate anything written or said about this western which undoubtfully sticks at top 10 westerns for all times. The issue here lies elsewhere and I am not asking the simpleton to tell me what's the story about. Now, I spent whole day watching the movie and looking through the documentaries - one thing that is not clear starts in the beginning and that is why a gang of three are waiting for Charles Bronson (Harmonica) in the opening scene. If Frank knew Harmonica, which he doesn't, why should he send men to kill a foreigner. I think here that the opening scene should be sequence to the second scene - where Frank kills McBain and his three children, planting evidence to frame the bandit Cheyenne. The third scene is easy to fabricate - Jill McBain, Brett's illegal wife who married him previously, arrives as owner of the land with intention to sell (but she is a prostitute and why should she move elsewhere except if she doesn't go into business).I continue with the illogical plot as if we are in Agatha Christie's thriller. Appears Morton (a Hercule Poirot type that moves in shackles because he is crippled, played by Italian stooge Gabriele Ferzetti). He is supposed to be a rich railway Baron that hires henchmen to work against each other. He wants to buy land before government regulators arrive at the district and then resell with profit. The sheriff in local dust town works for him and administers an auction for McBain's land that is precious because lies on railway and have water holes. So at the auction proper Harmonica takes the highest bid at 5000$ which he receive as premium for Cheyenne. The latter is taken prisoner by train (which train is unclear, whether Morton's coach or a regular to dust town) but subsequently he escapes with two accomplices and kills Morton and his henchmen. Simultaneously, Frank arranges a duel with Harmonica after the rest of the henchmen are killed in skirmish gunfight. Harmonica draws faster in a final duel and kills Frank (because in flashback shot it becomes evident he is seeking revenge for his hanged brother). Final scene is where Harmonica and Cheyenne say "Good-bye" to Mrs. McBain and while they can't share her love it is evident that she is happy with so many men around. Post finale, Cheyenne dies from wound in the guts made by Mr. Choo Choo (Morton).This is it. I think Sergio Leone was Neanderthal in cinema and his stories should remain unsurpassed art phenomenon for generation to come. Take care!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Masterpiece From the Master of Westerners</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the definition of the western. The loner antihero, the damsel in need of help, and an overarching villain. This film is one of the greatest works of cinema from the 60's, an under appreciated gem in its time, finally given its respect. And respect it deserves. The film starts off with a dazzling sequence, which the protagonist, harmonica, kills three would-be assassins sent to kill him by Frank. The it shifts to the paralleling story of how the west has grown, and the frontier is dying. Our hero is caught on a revenge trip to avenge the death of his family, and the death of his lovers family. Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda give reverse roles and are outstanding in them. It all leads up to one of my favorite confrontations in a movie, between Harmonica and Frank. The cinematography and setting is beautiful. The pacing is good also and compliments a great story written by Sergio Leone. This is 2 hours and 45 minutes worth sitting through. This film is like a traditional western and is not for everyone. But if u can overlook a few cliques, you can experience and epic piece of cinema that is probably Sergio Leone's finest. Beautiful, simply that. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Leone's Best but Certainly an Aesthetically Precious Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Leone was propositioned to work on this movie, it was green lit through the lucrative funds that he would then invest on his dream picture but, however, it appeared that there could be another string of sequels that would watermark his name across another trilogy. "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" illustrated the misers enabling an ethically ambiguous Eastwood to appear in good light; the amazing thing is that with our chasm to this, he is the best character in the movie as far as moral compass is concerned and realising this consciously is weird for me as he is a swindler and ruffian and yet with those qualities, he still manages to weigh on our empathy with him; this is what really gives him that perplexity and enigma that is so grounded in these movies.Incidentally while I watched one of the segments in the movie I kept on thinking invariably about the fact that the outlaw wasn't shooting Claudette's character that it was only a shrewd attempt at keeping her either faltered or of course for his own needs. I was thinking "god, man, stop waving that thing around! You aren't going to use it" - then the scene after that it elapsed into Frank's carriage and we hear those really cool and cynical words - "People scare better in death" - that was just one of the best responses that I ever heard and felt from a movie."Once Upon a Time in the West" stars Henry Fonda as Frank, Claudia Cardinale as the Widow and Charles Bronson in a role that I don't think mimics Eastwoods at all which I found really refreshing. The plot - through the beginning it left you alien in the west as we establish the bad characters. One of the running ideas in these movies are the characters actions - and they are really cavalier from the beginning, lazily lying around and only letting a fly roam around until it's trapped!The nuance with that harmonica that Bronson plays is never even considered from the beginning, so I was forced to assume that what he was doing with it was singing a wavering note just before he goes in for the kill. But this is what strikes me with Leone - he never really denies the significance of any apparatus - he wants it to be grounded in. Like for example, when Claudia tries to look for the thing that looks almost like a train set thing that represents it in toy form. I digress from that though. Unfortunately, it does take some time to be accessible but perhaps that was Leone's myth that this is an atypical western. While it still plays out the revenge idea, it requires music to make it strategically orchestrated.My favourite parts in the movie are Ennio's Score, the principle photography - it marvels me how wonderful that escarpment looks and then how it is a pedestal for fighting and I also find the outlaw to be somewhat like Eli Wallach, not in counterpart but rather in culture.Another thing makes this distinctive is the decision to put a more heroine orientated character in the boots of the forlorn woman; the death of your family either impels you to retribution or it bound you in the safety of your own house; however my expectation for that anti- heroine turn of behaviour was largely downplayed.Still with the mellow words of Bronson mixed with the brazen and incorrigible manner and threat of Frank make it eventually a very engrossing film - even though you know who wins, it's the mental subjectivity of his prey that orchestrates the mood and then brings the cause to creedence with answers... It shows its influence in Kill Bill 2's use of soundtrack and the way it's choreographed in fighting manoeuvres - even the bride - in fact, the whole incarnation, as we know it, is in debt to the ingenuity of Sergio Leone."It's not like that" - Yes, Bronson, we need this scene to navigate into the duality of the fighting prowess and tumult to be part of either the cerebral or visceral channeling - which will it be. Bronson shows with this in mind that Frank is no business man - "I'm Just a Man" - Now Revelatory that he's a freeloader - his business is diminished and Frank proves that he is nothing but empty shallow bags of remorse.This movie is the forerunner to that wonderful "Once Upon a Time in America" and on that note, "Once Upon a Time in the West" is slightly longer then I thought was necessary, but it had so much panorama on the surface and it's a real uncompromising tail, never conforming to the John Wayne archetype (Don't get me wrong, Wayne is an icon, but he was just canon as an actor up to that point).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a little disjointed for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Leone's films - the Dollars trilogy in particular - and love the way he fuses film and music together with his long time co-worker - Morricone. I purchased this 2-disc DVD for the princely sum of 6 Euro, having wanted to see it for a long time. I was a little surprised to see it on the IMDb's top 250 list at number 18. A very high placing indeed. The opening scene at the railway station is great. A little slow for some people but I loved it. The creaking of the windmill, the fly on Elam's face, the inevitable shoot-out are all fantastically done. Nobody but Leone would have got away with that amount of time seemingly wasted on the introduction. If any other filmmaker had tried it - they would be slapped down as a pretentious showboater. The next big set-piece is good also - Henry Fonda's character gunning down an entire family as they prepared a banquet celebration. But - for me - the downward spiral starts from here onwards.The music is good, the characters are okay and Cardinale is certainly easy on the eye. But the plot, storyline and general story-telling is so muddled and disjointed that I was left very unsatisfied. Also, the character of Jason Robards is a strange one and to me, unneeded. What value did he bring to the story? None as far as I can see. Sure, Fonda used his trademark long duster coats as cover for the murders - but other than that - I cannot see what his role is. And as for his relationship with Harmonica, whom he meets in a bar, saves from a train and then ends up dying next to him, it is puzzling in the extreme. Harmonica and Cheyenne seem to have no connection to each other but yet Cheyenne goes out of his way to help him??? Curious???Also - there are some scenes which I could not comprehend. Cardinale's bedroom scene with Frank? What? Also Frank meeting Morton in a desert hideaway? What? And both of these scenes practically follow each other. Makes no sense at all.The final showdown is okay - but lacks a bit of tension for me. However, the extreme close-up of Bronson's eyes adds a point to the film's score on it's own. Very impressive.To me the film suffered from having too many main characters and not enough for any of them to do. You had Cardinale, Fonda, Bronson and Robards all vying for story-time when in reality one (or possibly two) of them needed to be culled. Too muddled and too confusing. And there is a lot of posturing going on too - people staring at each other wordlessly - must have happened 10 times throughout the movie. But the style and the music win it a 7/10 score for me. Good - but certainly should not be in the top 20 films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Had I seen the very beginning of "Once upon a Time in the West," I suppose it would have been less difficult me to try to figure-out the plot of Sergio Leone's and Bertolucci's film. I had heard several good remarks about this movie and was looking forward to seeing it. I just lucked-up by TCM's presentation of it. Although I appreciate the fact that it shows just how brutally girtty "The Old West" was, to me, it could have moved-along a lot faster.BECAUSE I didn't see the very beginning, I had no idea why "Frank" (Henry Fonda) was killing so many people (from Morton's train)....took me a while to figure-out why he murdered the entire family. When I finally saw "Harmonica" (Charles Bronson), I couldn't relate to his attachment to the harmonica. Finally got that, too. I did not recognize Jason Robards ("Cheyenne") because he was so scroungy-looking. And, his entrance into the film (with all the shooting and noise outside of that tacky "saloon"), with him entering in handcuffs, completely threw me.I never could tell one "gang" from the other.....I couldn't understsand just when in the movie - except after "Harmonica" roped-off the station - so many men were working on the railroad, and where they came from. It was a mystery to me why "Harmonica" was working so hard to make a railroad-station for "Jill McBain" (Cardinale), because there had been no romantic nor friendly connection between them. MY impression of Cardinale's arrival was as the mother of the children who were murdered; after all one son said "my mother died 7 years ago".Yes, I thought the movie was wonderful, but wanted it to keep to a line of plot, rather than jumping-around so much. Kudos for all you folk who truly idolized this movie. Maybe I need to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, in at least one man's opinion, the best film ever made. The script, the directing, the acting and the score are perfect together for the entire movie. I didn't know anything about it when I saw it, and you don't need to either(if you haven't already). So if you happen to be reading this, take the word of an honest man: buy or rent this movie as soon as possible. You won't find a better director and writer in Leone, you won't find a better score than one done by Morricone, and you won't find more fitting actors than Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, Claudia Cardinale and Jason Robards. And like I said earlier, they mesh together for the best movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, but hard to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will not begin to comment on the well-documented cinematic achievements within this film, but this movie (like all of Leone's for that matter) is hard for me to watch. The amount of looping of dialogue is a major distraction... and it's not an outgrowth of Italian/English translation. Just count how often the lines "spoken" during a scene were obviously dubbed in a booth later. Were there planes constantly flying overhead during principal filming ruining the audio takes? Maybe I'm picky, but when the video and audio are out of synch, it detracts from my ability to focus on the scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Western of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't originally care much of any Western genre films. It wasn't until I sat down and watched all of Clint Eastwood's masterpiece, UNFORGIVEN, when it first came out, that I began to discover what a excellent genre the Western films were. I saw that at the end of the film that Eastwood dedicated UNFORGIVEN to "Sergio (Leone) and Don (Siegal)." I then watched and began falling in love with Sergio Leone's films, FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, THE GOOD THE BAD &amp; THE UGLY, FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE, etc. But it wasn't until I watched ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, did I realize I found my favorite Western. To me, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is not only my favorite Sergio Leone film, but my favorite Western of all time. It has the most original characters, a very well done story, fantastic direction, and the most beautiful score of all time. For me, WEST is the achievement of Leone's career, it was the only Western film Leone directed that was actually shot in America, at Mounument Valley, the location of several of John Ford westerns. I find all of the characters in WEST to be original and different. Jill (Claudia Cardinale), the prostitute who is settling down for a new life until she finds out her husband, Brett McBain (Frank Wolff) and his children were murdered. Cheyenne (Jason Robards) the outlaw who actually has a good soul inside of him that loves Jill and does whatever he can to help her. Harmonica (Charles Bronson) the man who expresses his vengence and pain by playing the harmonica , but is also very quick with his gun. Then there's Frank (Henry Fonda), my favorite role in Fonda's career as well as my favorite villian of all time. A villian so cold and vicious, a man who uses witty remarks and shows his evil personality by killing anyone who get in his way. But it's not just Frank with the witty remarks, but also Harmonica and Cheyenne give some memorable lines as well. The story, written by Leone, shows the talented director use of creativity. The story was also co-written by Dario Argento, who would later become a legend himself the Italian horror genre, notably with SUSPIRIA. And co-written by Bernardo Bertolucci, who has done directed modern Italian neo-realism films like THE CONFORMIST, 1900, and THE LAST EMPEROR.Then there is Enni Morricone's score. The most beautiful and moving score I have ever heard. Morricone using a different musical insturment to identify each of the major characters. Jill has the string instruments. Harmonica, naturally has the Harmonica. Frank has the electric guitar. And Cheyenne has the banjo. The score of "Man With Harmonica" is very popular and influental that it was recently be redone with a techno dance score and even played on a recent episode of THE SOPRANOS. But it's the actual theme for the movie, that has become a modern classic, that the song is being played at weddings replacing "Here Comes the Bride" or "Cannon In D." If you heard the theme of WEST, you would understand why. Everytime I hear the theme, tears are still coming out of my eyes. The musical score, is without a doubt the best score ever written! Then there is the visuals of the film, the way Leone shot and edits the film. The intense opening scene where three of Frank's men (Jack Elam, Woody Strode, and Al Mulock)are patiently waiting for Harmonica to show up. Elam traps a fly in the barrel of his pistol and listens to it buzz; Strode has drops of water cumulative add on his hat; Mulock cracks his knuckles. Then the showdown between the three of them against Harmonica. The first scene where Fonda's character is seen. The scene when Jill arrives in Flagstone, and rides the horse carrige through the scenery of Monument Valley. The revealing of why Harmonica is given his name, and how he acquired the instrument. I know people will argue with me about the best Western film. UNFORGIVEN, THE WILD BUNCH, THE GOOD THE BAD &amp; THE UGLY, BUTCH CASSIDY &amp; THE SUNDANCE KID, THE SEARCHERS, STAGECOACH (1939), SHANE, FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, HIGH NOON, THE OX-BOW INCIDENT, RIO BRAVO, MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, and even BLAZING SADDLES are all excellent Westerns that many will considered to be their favorites. But none of those westerns has the look, mood, and feeling that ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST has. It's those elements that are inside WEST that gives it it's soul. And this Western has one of the most powerful souls ever put on film. Sergio Leone will be remembered for FISTFUL OF DOLLARS since it was his first successful box office hit, and THE GOOD THE BAD &amp; THE UGLY because it's his most popular. But people should remember Leone's work with ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. The "true" wester epic of his career. If you should catch ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, please see it the way it was ment to be seen, in it's widescreen format, or letterboxed. And please catch the full 165 minute version, not the butchered 145 minute version. Or better yet, if it's playing at a cinema house near by, then catch it there! This is a masterpiece, and I am so pleased to see that as the years go by, WEST is becomming more loved and is the second favorite Western on the Internet Movie Database list. I just hope as the more years go by, that it will be number one. At least it's seen as a classic, and after watching all of it, you can understand why. Please, whenever this film is on Turner Classic Movie, or any pay per-view movie channels, sit down and watch this classic. I hope Paramount Pictures will understand how many people love this film and will finally release it on DVD. Hopefully it will be soon. Don't miss this movie, please see it! ***** (out of five) ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tied with The Magnificent Seven, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, High Plains Drifter, Tombstone and Silverado. Each of which represent the quintessential Western, albeit from a slightly different perspectives.Awesome talent, Claudia works the same magic on C'era una volta il West that Ursula Andress does for Dr. No. The cameo with Woody Strode and Jack Elam is sheer genius.Jason, Charles and Henry couldn't have done a better job. While Sergio Leone mentored Clint in his early Westerns (big screen days), he wisely didn't cast him this time (Clint was doing Hang 'em High at the same time).This movie, like those it's tied with, stands the test of time supremely well. It's a shame that the Western has had its run, given how much enjoyment most of us got out of them, but then I can't imagine too many actors and directors who could pull it off these days anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following his greatest picture of all times, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly Leone directed Once Upon A Time in the West. This film is OUTSTANDING! Not only is it outstanding but it's Leone's second masterpiece and it wouldn't be his last. Leone's direction is outstanding, Ennio Morricone's score is once again a powerful and memorable score which captures the beauty of the film, and the performances were great. Anyway, I'm not going to get into the plot so I won't risk spoiling anything but then again you probably already know the plot from other reviews.Still even with how brilliant this movie is I felt it could have been better. Why? because of the performances. Two of them to be exact. Now while Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda both did a respectably great job let's not kid ourselves. The role of Harmonica was written for Clint Eastwood and no one could have played that role better then Eastwood himself and the Frank character would have been played better by Lee Van Cleef.Now I have to ask myself if Clint Eastwood were in this picture would this be the fourth installment of the Man with no Name saga or would it be a sperate movie on it's own? If this were the fourth picture then it would have given us a more psychological reason why Man with no Name is a bounty hunter to begin with! Regardless this is an incredible movie which is extremely underrated by the Hollywood community and deserved a Best Picture and Director Oscar or at least a nomination! 4(****)out of 4(****) stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once Upon a Time in the West is Sergio Leone's epic western and without a doubt his greatest film. He is probably the best director of westerns that ever lived, and this film proves it. From the hauntingly quiet opening scene to the duel at the end (which is one of the greatest scenes ever filmed) Leone's directing grabs you unlike any other. Charles Bronson is excellent in his role as a lone gunman out to avenge his brother (the role was originally intended for Clint Eastwood), and Henry Fonda plays one of the coldest, most brutal villans in film history. One of the grestest films from one of the greatest filmmakers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone overdoes it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A nasty railroad magnate hires some bad, bad men?led by evil gunslinger Frank (Henry Fonda)?to ensure that nothing gets in the way of business. Mysterious stranger Harmonica (Charles Bronson) and bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards) do their best to stop the baddies in their tracks. Beautiful widow Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) gives the men something else to think about other than shooting each other.There are those who consider Once Upon A Time In The West to be director Sergio Leone's magnum opus: with a magnificent cast, and contributions from some of Italian cinema's greatest names (the script is by Leone, Dario Argento and Bernardo Bertolucci, the cinematography is by Tonino Delli Colli, and the score is, of course, by Ennio Morricone), the film certainly has an excellent pedigree.However, while it does boast solid performances and is often very impressive to look at (the widescreen cinematography is terrific), the film suffers from a severe case of over-indulgence, Leone taking his trademark themes and visual touches to the nth degree, the exaggerated style ultimately getting in the way of the storytelling. The director's signature moves are so excessive and drawn out that Once Upon A Time In The West proves hard to get through without dozing off at least once.Watch if you want to waste several minutes of your life as Jack Elam tries to blow a fly off his face, or to hear Charles Bronson repeatedly playing the same few notes on his harmonica, but give it a miss if you're looking for something even remotely as cool as any of Leone's Eastwood movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>when your nemesis arrives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before adding my comments, I enjoyed reading Michael Coy's ("Something to do with Death", 1/2001) witty discussion of the surprisingly complex (i.e., "labyrinthine") roadhouse. For those of us who have seen this movie ten or more times, thinking about the roadhouse is a source of humor.I also enjoyed reading Jonathon Dabell ("Outstanding epic western that is truly one of the best of its kind"; 9/10/2006) and byroncallas ("Best Western Ever Made", 16 February 2002).Sergio Leon's "Once Upon a Time in the West" (OUTW) is the most satisfying western in cinema. It captures the isolation, lawlessness and brutality of that period and location. With Ennio Morricone's (arguably) peerless film score, with unique musical signatures for the major characters, the themes broaden.For example, the concept of the birth of a frontier train station unifying people and bringing them together suggests a populist economic renewal. At the beginning of the film, the numbers who stood to profit from the new station were few. At the end of OUTW, a large number of railroad workers have arrived who are both building the station's infrastructure and laying tracks. It would be hard to argue against the idea that OUTW depicts a socialist economy triumphing over a fascist and/or capitalist one.Then there is the pairing of 'Morricone's score with Leone's imagery of Claudia Cardinale at the film's end. It seems to bring to mind philosophical questions about womanhood. Jill is an ex-prostitute and she ends up the heiress to a frontier railroad station. Isn't a prostitute in her own way, a 'station'? So what are Leone and Morricone telling us? For me, the complex feminine theme arising from the past and future of Cardinale's Jill is filled with intellectual ardor that has seldom been equaled.The opening sequence of credits paired with the arrival of three dangerous men at the remote train station is exquisite. The opening sequence is very clever visually.The entire cast is superb. The major characters are wonderfully conceived. Cheyenne is a hybrid between fearsome outlaw and comic relief (particularly with his musical signature). His relationship with the other characters brings the quartet closer.The concepts of "revenge" and "what is a nemesis" are perfectly demonstrated in OUTW. Henry Fonda's psychopathic, icy-blue-eyed Frank; and Charles Bronson's unblinking, relentless Harmonica are career-best performances from both players. The tension between the two seems heightened by the hereditary differences of the actors. Fonda's angular, WASP-like features and tall stature versus Bronson's rugged, "nation less" appearance seems to be a more rousing spectacle than had Clint Eastwood played Harmonica.When Leone's film is winding up and Morrione's score is filling the air the moment is euphoric. We all go to movies to be swept away like this.While OUTW is great in many ways, it does have a flaw: The body count, particularly in the first forty-five minutes, makes it difficult for OUTW to be screened in concert halls. The body count means it can't be enjoyed by every age demographic.Let me conclude by wishing eternal damnation to the censor who removed all references to Jill's past life as a prostitute in the TV screening that was my first look at OUTW. I can't believe someone could live with their self after doing that.I'd like to meet up with The Censor somewhere near Monument Valley with a harmonica in my mouth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow - why did it take me so long to see this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once Upon a Time in the West - This was the first time I ever saw this flick. Wow. It is so great to sit down with a movie that you know nothing about and have it turn into a real gem. This movie was beautifully filmed. A real master at work. The story starts with a brutal attack that had me wondering why? I wanted to know right away. However, Sergio was on his own schedule as slowly, but surely, the layers of the story are revealed. The pacing reminded me a bit of Kill Bill. I figured Tarantino was a fan, and it turns out he is. Henry Fonda usually plays the good guy, but I really didn't know if his Frank or Charles Bronson's character was the good guy. Of course, good and bad are especially relative in cases like this! Charles Bronson doesn't have a name and IMDb lists him as Harmonica. He was played as a real mystery. A man with his own agenda, who didn't have problems killing anyone. He also played the harmonica with a wild tone that was pretty sweet. Due to the deliberate pacing of the movie there were a few times where I was on the edge of my seat. Waiting for what I thought should happen to hurry up and happen! Ultimately, the whole thing worked. The reveal of Harmonica's back story was a surprise. It left me wondering, now that his goal in life was finished would he stick with the girl?Speaking of the girl, that whole thing was relative too! The more I learned about her, the more I wondered would living with her really be a happily ever after? Early on, I was a little perplexed by her behavior. Even wondering if she was just acting poorly. I suppose after learning all about her, it is possible that is how her character would behave. That was a great watching experience. According to IMDb, Once Upon a Time in the West is number 23 all time. Certainly better than any of the Oscar nominees that year. No surprise there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Western I Ever Saw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three men (Henry Fonda, Jason Robards and Charles Bronson) with various claims to morality spend their days shooting and circling around one woman of questionable morals and her dead husband's hidden treasure.Could this be Sergio Leone's best film? He has made many notable westerns (or "spaghetti westerns") but I have to say this is the western I have enjoyed the most of pretty much any western I have ever seen. I am not really a fan of the genre, but if more were like this, it would change my whole outlook.The score from Ennio Morricone, featuring the harmonica? Wonderful. Morricone has done a variety of music over the years, but his western themes remain his most notable.Dario Argento, who was only 20, wrote part of the story, which really opened doors for him. Not only did it get him a leg up in the Italian film community, but it probably later got him Jennifer Connelly to star in "Phenomena" after she had just finished wrapping up work with Leone.Some great lines in this film: "How can I trust a man who wears a belt and suspenders? He doesn't trust his own pants." And "You remind me of my mother. She was the biggest whore in Alameda." This whole movie was epic, could have been a mini-series or an ongoing show like "Deadwood" -- characters with no names who die are given more than adequate screen time. Character development is not in short supply here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't call it the best of the best, probably because I'm such a big movie buff that I don't dare name a best film 'till I've seen them all. Now, to answer a qouestion I know many of you are asking in your own thoughts without daring to pronounce the actual words: Is this piece of cinematic art better than The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly? I personally think it's pretty darned close if they're not actually equal. Everything is here, the tension, the soundtrack, the epic story and the contrasting characters, and what separates this brilliant western from good and average ones, as Sergio Leone knows, is the mystical element that tends to make its self known quite often. In my personal opinion, a great western ( and I am a huge fan of the perticular jenre ) is not just about robbing trains, or cowboys versus indians, you have to feel a world is about to die, and watching this movie I have felt just that. Of course, much of the credit must also go to the cast, and I think everyone was at their best in the roles they were given. I will just mention Charles Bronson because he is in fact the main character and also because I began collecting and enjoying his whole work on the silver screen. Overall a 9 out of 10 in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is a movie that you will hear people call "The Spaghetti Western to end all Spaghetti Westerns" or even "The Movie to end all Movies." Much to my surprise, the latter claim isn't even all that ridiculous.Here's how I know it's a great movie that I will never tire of: I didn't like it the first time I saw it. I didn't dislike it either, but I felt confused and underwhelmed. I wasn't expecting what the director had served me, and it took me out of my comfort zone. Where's the dialogue? What's going on with this plot? What's with the anti-climactic ending? But coming to appreciate a movie after initially disliking it is often indicative of a great movie -- one that doesn't rely on plot twists or cheap tricks to entertain.It was a similar feeling to when I watched Pulp Fiction for the first time, which instantly became my favourite movie upon a second viewing. But for me, this movie was even harder to follow the first time. I was so disappointed when the movie ended because I had so many unanswered questions regarding plot, character relationships, etc. I then read a detailed summary that cleared things up and watched the film again a few days later, and it blew me away. When you can watch it without trying to figure out what is going on, it is one of the best film experiences out there. Now, just because I found it hard to follow the first time doesn't mean it's a confusing movie; everything is, in fact, explained and makes sense once you get it (unlike so many movies that try to be too complex for their own good). In some ways, the movie is so good that it distracts from itself; I found myself so caught up in the music and astounding visuals at times that I would not pay attention to the sparse but clever dialogue.I'm glad I bought this without having seen it, because I felt compelled to give it a second chance after the unsatisfying first viewing. All I can do is urge you: watch it, and watch it again. You will be rewarded with something unlike any other movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The American West, as interpreted by the Italian Sergio Leone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cinematic masterpiece. Everything about the film is top-notch. Some people may like the story less than others, but it's really the kind of movie that is first and foremost a work of art. Something to be beheld.Some of the shots are amazing. Tracking shots that bring the whole "world" into view. The camera is used very effectively to tell the story visually.Sergio Leone brings his distinct style to the American western. The movie is gritty and violent and beautifully directed. It's long, drawn out, and operatic, and features a great score by Ennio Morricone.The story involves a mysterious stranger, a wily outlaw, and a merciless killer hired to scare a family off their land. Jason Robards was my favorite, playing the outlaw and providing some of the film's lighter moments.This is far and away my favorite "spaghetti western". Leone pays homage to the classic westerns of American directors like John Ford, even shooting in Utah's famous Monument Valley. And unlike Leone's "Dollars Trilogy" with Clint Eastwood, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST focuses on the fabled Old West of saloons, ranches, and the approaching railroads, rather than the more Mexican-flavored adobe settlements of the Southwest.One of the more impressive films I've seen and definitely one of my favorite westerns.</fullReview>

Jason Robards employs his magical voice and considerable talent to fine effect. Claudia Cardinale is solidly good and good-looking. And I was surprised Charles Bronson could perform this well; I'll never sell him short again. Assisted by the soaring female vocal track, "Once Upon a Time in the West" is tinged with the poignancy of an elegy even as it strikes a note of hope. After all, everything the viewer sees was once upon a time. Love; resilience in the face of colossal injustice; beauty; existential aloneness; determination to build hope despite villainy and deep sorrow - it's all here in "Once Upon a Time in the West."

		<fullReview>When I saw this film for the first time I have got to admit I did not like it at all. Maybe I was too young or maybe I was just not interested because my attention span was limited who knows but a lot of years later I probably grew up a little and the time I sat down and properly watched this film I came to appreciate it for what it is. It is a masterpiece and in order for anybody to fully understand why, I think the watcher needs to pay attention because the subtleties and the detail are not always obvious and there are very small body movements and shifts of position which if missed can render the scene you are watching confusing. Naturally if you start being confused you can tend to lose interest and I think thats where I made my mistakes. Please if you haven't watched it rent, buy or borrow this film and at least judge for yourself. Looking at the top 20 films in the IMDb top 250 list this film has the lowest votes and there could be all sorts of reasons why but to simply watch it is the starting point. If the viewer dislikes it then at least another person has watched this great film and as always opinion is all. For me it is a marvellous captivating visual experience and I hope more people come to see it in the same way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course lots of westerns are far from original. They often imitate each other and the always feature all of the same ingredients and clichés. Also the characters are often alike, as is its overall style. Leone movies are also like this, with as a difference that Leone was the trend-setter and pioneer for the genre and above all things also was at the top of his game.What also really makes this movie distinct itself is its story, that makes this movie a real original as well as great one to watch. It's entertaining, adventurous and all truly original as well, as far as the genre is concerned. It takes some original approaches such as for instance featuring a woman in a central role. Normally women feel very out of place within a western and distract a lot from the movie its story. The love-stories are annoying and never work out as they should. They take away a lot from the movie. In this movie they actually managed they let it all work out well for the movie. I think this is simply due to the fact that Leone featured the female role in the movie quite prominently, while in other cases they were merely supporting characters, with like 5 minutes of screen-time.But aside from the female part in the movie, the actual story itself is also just great and perfectly written. Surprisingly enough the story got created by two of Italy's greatest Dario Argento and Bernardo Bertolucci, who are best known as directors and normally weren't every involved much at all with the western genre. What I foremost liked about the movie was that it perfectly knew how to feature 3 different characters, of which none of them you really knew what to think about them till the end really. None of the is fully good really and none of fully bad. It's not a black and white story and the characters are not one dimensional. It's not really a typical western, which is also positive for the people who aren't really into the genre. It features plenty enough of ingredients and themes to make this movie perfectly watchable for all people, even more so than usually is the case with a Leone western.The movie is a typical Sergio Leone western, that features his distinctive and trademark style. The movie once more proofs that he was a great story-teller, who could tell an epic tale, without having too feature a lot of dialog. It's a bit of late western from Leone and the '60's were coming at and end. This means that the style is a bit different from his earlier acclaimed westerns. This mostly can be seen back in the movie its cinematography that is quite dynamic at times. but still of course the movie features lots of long, empty shots, with nothing but people staring and close-ups. All of the things Leone became so well known for.The movie has quite a surprising cast. Most surprising thing perhaps is that it doesn't feature Clint Eastwood and instead this time has Charles Bronson in it as the mysterious gunslinger. Also no Eli Wallach or Lee Van Cleef in this one but instead there are Jason Robards and Henry Fonda, in the most villainous role, while he had never played a villain before in his career. All of the actors are nevertheless well cast and each of them give fine performances.It's a movie that slowly moves toward its end. At first you don't know who all of the characters are and what their motivations are. Also each of their story lines seem to have nothing to do with each other but as the movie more and more progresses you realize that they actually do and their faith are all bounded to each other. It's build up to its end that mostly certainly does not disappoint, not in the least. It has a great and also a bit of surprising ending that for instance is just as memorable as the end of "Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo".The movie and some of its scenes are also made by it's music by Ennio Morricone. It's one of his most memorable western scores and has a couple of nice different themes in it.A great tale, even for those who aren't really into the genre.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sergio Leone's requiem to the West.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best Westerns ever made, Leone was a master of the genre and this is probably his best film. It lacks the obvious humour of the dollar trilogy but makes up for it with a genuine sense of menace. There is almost a constant sense that violence may erupt at any moment.The opening is a classic, three men turn up at a remote station and with barely a word wait for the train to arrive. On paper the idea of spending the first ten minutes watching three men doing almost nothing sounds boring, but here there is the sense that this is the calm before the storm. When the train arrives it seems that nothing is about to happen but as it departs we hear the sound of a harmonica, the three men turn to see Charles Bronson, after a brief exchange the three men are lying dead. The next scene sees a man and his son return home after shooting some birds for dinner, the man talks to his teenage daughter as they prepare for a party; the man's wife is due to arrive that day. As the man gets water from the well a shot rings out and the girl falls to the ground more shots and the man and his elder son are dead too. The young son comes out of the house and is met by a group of men, led by Henry Fonda. Shockingly he guns down the child.That is two of the four protagonists introduced, the next is Claudia Cardinale, the widow of the man who's family we'd just seen die. Not knowing what has happened she heads to her new home, stopping off on the way at a bar. While she is inside we hear gunfire outside and the Jason Robards enters, his arms in chains. He confronts a man in the bar... the harmonica playing Bronson.What follows is a constant sense of danger interspersed with moments of violence. Why did railroad employee Frank murder an entire family? Why does Bronson play the harmonica and why is he so interested in Frank? Leone's direction is excellent, the film is long and for long periods nothing much is happening but I never felt bored watching because he created such great atmosphere. He is assisted by a fantastic score by Ennio Morricone. Henry Fonda put in a great performance, playing against type, as the murderous Frank and Bronson is ideally cast as the mysterious "Harmonica" putting in the best performance I've seen from him. That isn't to say there is anything wrong with the other actors, they all did a good job.I'd recommend this film to anybody, especially those who are fans of westerns. The only people I wouldn't recommend this to are fans of Henry Fonda who don't wish to see him as a bad guy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harmonica takes a brief pause, stares at the villains, then goes in an intriguingly nasal voice: "No, you brought two too many". To which he takes them down all at once. Just to illustrate that Charles Bronson is really awesome. The character of the quiet mysterious stranger looking for revenge comes by a lot, but never like Bronson could do it. Sergio Leone had to make another western because the studio forced him to, and figured he might as well do the best one ever made. The camera work in this movie is amazing. The actors look like gods on their silver screen, towering over the world, delivering classic lines like it's a contest or something. This movie uses every western cliché in the book and makes something beautiful one of them. The highlights can hardly be counted, but to me the inevitable duel scene takes the cake. The close-up the characters are getting, I love them. And I haven't even talked about the music yet. Morricone is a genius, they're simple obvious musical ideas but only he could come up with them. A brilliant tale of revenge, regret and despair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"When you hear a strange sound, drop to the ground"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone may not have chosen the high-brow subject subject matter of his 1960s European contemporaries, but, boy, his films are pure cinema. Leone may have progressed beyond the charming but erratic editing style of his earliest Westerns ? 'A Fistful of Dollars (1964)' and 'For a Few Dollars More (1965)' ? but his use of the camera is unlike any other filmmaker I've ever seen. The director's wide frame, captured in Techniscope, is like a freshly-painted canvas, its watercolours glistening under the intense Western sun, and style dripping from every shot. Mostly gone is the slightest hint of parody that I observed in his earlier films; Ennio Morricone's score, rather than being joyously overwhelming as in 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly (1966),' instead meditates gracefully on the passions and losses of its major characters. This added grace recognisable throughout the film emerges no doubt from a far greater budget, the film bankrolled by Paramount Pictures and shot largely in the United States {with Leone paying tribute to John Ford through the use of his favoured Monument Valley}.Leone has stated that "the rhythm of the film was intended to create the sensation of the last gasps that a person takes just before dying." That most of his set-pieces end in a bloody shootout suggests the aptness of this analogy. However, like Leone says, the heart of his pictures is not to be found in the moment of death ? however gratifying we may find it ? but in the final gasps for air. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' opens with an astonishing ten-minute prologue in which three armed outlaws (Woody Strode, Jack Elam and Al Mulock) impatiently await the arrival of a train. The minutes pass by almost without dialogue. In the sweltering heat, the men lazily brush away flies; a windmill creaks as it spins idly in the breeze; a telegraph machine chatters inside the railway station. This simple act of waiting, in less talented hands, could easily have been tedious, but Leone rejects the standard perceptions of time by allowing the viewer to immerse themselves in the canvas that he has just painted. These minutes of waiting become a Danse Macabre - the final moments these three men will ever know.As in the director's previous effort, the film's main characters blur the line between "good" and "bad" (and "ugly"), but the clear villain of the piece is, memorably, Henry Fonda as Frank. His against-type performance is wonderful, not because it's a far cry from his usual persona, but because it isn't. Close your eyes, and you'll hear that same righteous drawl that spoke with such rectitude in '12 Angry Men (1957).' But Juror #8 he certainly isn't; Fonda adds a nasty, sadistic sneer, and Leone focuses most closely on the actor's hypnotic blue eyes. It's almost frightening how Fonda's squeaky-clean persona can be corrupted so readily. Claudia Cardinale plays Jill McBain, a stunning widower who refuses to bow down to those who murdered her husband and his family. Morricone's score only has good things to say about Jill, but Leone appears to admire her precisely because she, like her male cohorts, is not a hapless innocent. A former prostitute, this lady from New Orleans has absolutely no qualms about sleeping with the enemy. No pride, only objectives ? that's how you survive in the West.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Once Upon A Time" is to the western as what "2001" is to sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone. What more is there to say? Don't be fooled by the context: Charles Bronson, Henry Ford, the end of the 1960's, a "western"...no, no, my friend -- this movie is liquid style that transcends its own time period. Not even a "western" anymore, but a cool Leonefied experience.The best soundtrack ever (Ennio Morricone's famous thrusting ballad was composed first, and then Leone wrote it into the script). Beautiful to listen to, fascinating to watch. Claudia Cardinale (a delicious Italian beauty) plays the part of lead woman, which is the largest difference between this and the "Trilogy" Leone made prior. Those had no women in them, except in small roles as the hostage and/or mother and/or rape victim and/or food fetcher. Here Miss Cardinale is magnified under the Sergio Leone patented spotlight and transformed into the pouty grieving widow, in all her false eyelashed, holier-than-thou attitude and spicy comeback glory.And then people die. Lust for revenge boils blood. Threats are made. Threats are carried out. Harmonicas play. A beautiful, dusty, long, dangerously deliberate masterpiece plays out that curls your lips into an amused little smile by the time Jill serves the water to the men, and then the great opera finally ends.Leone was a great director. Rumor has it he was in line to direct The Godfather. All of his trademarks are in this one, including some surprisingly deeper poetic touches [the sound of the ocean as the cripple looks at the painting, which foreshadows his fate] and classic irony [the cripple on the train has enough money to afford everything, except his own health]. As usual, the sound effects are exquisite -- everyone's voice seems amplified, and the detail of smaller elements are emphasized, like the buzz of a fly in a gun barrel, or dripping water, or doors opening.Leone wanted Angel Eyes, Tuco and Blondie to make cameos as the 3 wanderers in the opening sequence, but Eastwood backed out so it never happened. Actually it turned out better this way. Some have said that "Once" is too slow. There is an obvious difference between "Once" and the "Trilogy," which was much more commercial. This looks more minimalistic, and is moodier than the Trilogy. Perhaps this difference in starkness and stubborn pretension via Leone is why it never became a huge hit.Italian directors are masters of this genre. If you're starved for more, try to find "A Fistful of Dynamite (Duck, You Sucker)" -- it's another great, yet often overlooked Leone film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite "spaghetti" western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider this to be the greatest of Sergio Leone's westerns, commonly referred to as "spaghetti westerns". I enjoy each of the big three leading up to this: "A Fistful of Dollars", "For a Few Dollars More" and "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly". But this is his best of them. The story, the music, the gritty realism all make for one of the best movies ever made.The snippets of Harmonica's memories brings the audience closer and closer just as Frank is brought closer and closer to the final realization of how the past has finally caught up to the present in order for justice to be served. Everything else is unimportant in the end, as it comes down to the final confrontation. Cheyenne's death confirms my belief in the irrelevancy of everything else.This is a must see not just for lovers of the western genre, but for movie lovers in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite astonishing for about 45 reasons, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is a film that also took me 45 years to bother to see. Whilst I admired the over-all production especially the art direction and the photography, I found the convoluted and quite bewildering story presentation tedious and ultimately irritating. There are many absolutely gloriously spectacular scenes both in Utah and with the train; the created sets/houses/town etc are genuinely visually fascinating and stunning to enjoy and make you reach further into the movie. I liked the main casting, even enjoying Fonda doing Eastwood. You can see how Bronson became a superstar after this. Some soaring magnificent orchestrations and endlessly beautiful scenes... but oh, that slow pace really did get to me. An irritating magnificent western masterpiece. Probably what Cimino was aiming for with HEAVENS GATE but overspent. This superb production came in for about $6m and looks every well spent dollar of it. Bravo! Beautiful.... Boring.</fullReview>

This movie made me find Ennio Morricone online. I was shocked how many movies he scored.As I remember, I read that Henry Fonda was dubious about taking this role, casting him with his first role as villain. My favorite character is the one Jason Robards played.Someone has already said here that this is the best Western ever made, and thinking back to the scope of it, the sheer enormity of how the backgrounds and landscapes were shot, it is indeed an experience to see it, not just a pastime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular! Leone's climatic ending to the Spaghetti Western era.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leone equals and even succeeds his Spaghetti Western trilogy predecessors to bring you Once Upon A Time In The West, one of the best Westerns in film history.Leone tells a story of a secret railway station of great value, which involves three of the most legendary film characters. Charles Bronson is harmonica, the mysterious loner, who smoothly drifts his way through each scene by means of his slick dialogue, his quick and sharp shooting and his harmonica. Jason Jobards is Cheyenne, the comical, yet philosophical, criminal, who has the more humane role. Finally you have Henry Fonda as the dirty and gritty Frank, a role that Fonda was surprisingly well suited. The entrance and interplay of each of these three characters result in one of the most thrilling films you will ever see. As well as thrill, Claudia Cardinale is based within the centre of the trio, who brings a sense of hope that separates her from many of the dark aspects that are involved within the film. Furthermore, Frank Wolff plays the tragic Brett McBain, who has very limited screen time, but uses the time he is given to portray an unforgettable character, whose death sparks off the whole plot.Ennio Morricone also provides an electrifying score, a true masterpiece, which energises every scene and knocks the film into a completely different ball park.Ultimately, Sergio Leone's directing is the reason why this is such a classic. His masterful cinematography and camera-work was the piece of the puzzle that brought all this outstanding work together. Including the shootout at the Railroad, Frank's entrance, Harmonica's brothers death and panning over Sweetwater.This is one of Leone's best films and one of the best films in cinematic history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Opulent medley Western of the railroad revolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If one watches even casually, one can see any number of previous and indeed subsequent Westerns in this romantic masterpiece by Sergio Leone. What makes this a remarkable film for me is that there is none of the wistful mystery that can be attributed to the genre in broad strokes. Once Upon A Time In The West is not another dusty existential epic, where men kill one another for pride or simply purpose. Even at the remarkable close, hundreds of extras flocking around the desert rose that is Claudia Cardinale's Jill one doesn't get the impression of grief of nostalgia. Instead, the drama is an ungrudging struggle of modern prosperity vs righteousness.We are treated to a masterclass in storytelling. Leone has an unreal grip on the temperament and the pace of the film; once he's set it up in the long, tense prologue during the titles, the rest of the film rolls on at that tempo. There's all the time in the world to take in complementary wide shots of the country and ultra-close-ups of the men's tan-hide faces (with consistently excellent lighting, one might add).And they're worth watching. Robards is the earthy American, Bronson the vengeful Mexican and Fonda the uneasy opportunist, fine performances all round. Cardinale looks comfortable as the principal - the men don't find over her but around her - and she's there in that role not as an attractive diversion. The money (I'd imagine there was a lot of it) is all well-spent and Morricone's score is another winner. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time I watch this movie I appreciate it more and more.There are so many scenes of brilliance here,so many memorable moments.Then there is the cast which is fabulous.At first viewing,there may be a sense of disappointment that Clint Eastwood doesn't appear in the role of Harmonica.It must be said though that I don't think the role would have suited him as much as it suits Charles Bronson.He is perfect for this role as a man so obviously with a grudge against Frank whereas the role Eastwood played in the previous spaghetti westerns was of a man with no apparent grudges.I don't think the role of Harmonica would have sat comfortably with him,he was better being a man without any motives.Caludia Cardinale looks stunning as Jill McBain and shows she can act too.Jason Robards exudes charm as Cheyenne and fits the role like a glove.But the real triumph here is Henry Fonda as Frank.Playing completely against type,he gives a fabulous performance as the psychotic but intelligent villain of the piece.Yes,this is a tremendous cast.As stated earlier,there are so many scenes of brilliance.The opening ten minutes or so,Cheyenne sliding the lamp towards Harmonica,the final shoot out.All brilliantly done and scenes that linger in the memory.I like the humour in the movie such as the Barman telling his story to Jill,stopping when Cheyenne and Harmonica have their face off and then carrying on as though nothing had happened.Also,when a gun shot is heard and the scene shifts to Cheyenne who has cut himself shaving,obviously jumping because of the noise.Very clever.I can definitely understand why so many people call this the finest western ever but for me it is slightly behind the fantastic The Good,The Bad And The Ugly.Why?I think that the narrative in OUATITW does get a little confusing at times but I have to say that this movie is very close to being the best western ever.It is a great piece of work.Last but not least I must pay tribute to two legends of the cinema and only need to add simply that Sergio Leone was a brilliant director and Ennio Morricone was one of the greatest film composers of all time.Geniuses the pair of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Sergio Leone's best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trying to find "Once Upon A Time in the West" on DVD much less on VHS is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. After months of searching for it at rental stores and libraries, I finally found it and got a chance to see it. As a person who likes the western genre and the "Dollars Trilogy" I really enjoyed this movie. For starters, Sergio Leone's direction is breathtaking. The shots of the western landscapes are beautiful and so are the intense facial up closes that he uses so often in his other films, particularly during the duels. This builds much tension, even if the outcome may seem predictable. But not only does his directing talents capture such a grand film. Tonino Delli Colli's sweeping cinematography helps plaster the western backgrounds and landscapes. As with the actors, they all add diligence and layers to their characters, making each of them unique and complex. For the first time in a western, the story focuses on a woman, Claudia Cardinale's character. In earlier Sergio Leone films, women are depicted as a stereotype, either as having a heart of gold or as a whore. In a sense, the female lead is both, but she's more than just a three-dimensional figure. She's a character with feelings and emotions, and in which the story revolves around her.Henry Fonda often plays the nice good guy in movies, but he's the exact opposite in this; a ruthless, psychotic killer, who feels no remorse for those he kills. This was an unusual twist for him, but nonetheless, he makes a believable villain. Jason Robards and Charles Bronsan are likewise excellent in their roles as the two gunslinging protagonists. Robards delivers his lines of wisdom and humor fluently and Bronsan makes himself as the man of mystery, like "The Man With No Name" in the "Dollars Trilogy". The difference between the two is that Bronsan's character has a story.Adding more drama to the characters is Ennio Morricone's score. It is very unique, different from the other films he had worked on with Leone. Unlike in "The Good, Bad, and the Ugly" which was made up of a couple of great themes, his score is solely written for each of the different four lead characters. His music develops moods for each of them as it does in reflecting the story's emotional points such as: sorrow, fear, tension, and love. Overall, "Once Upon A Time in the West" is an excellent western that any Sergio Leone fan or buff of the genre should see. However, the one thing that this movie lacks is the action. Sure, there is some shooting, but not enough to carry a film that's almost three hours. At times, the movie gets boring, but the story and character development make it interesting, so I should not complain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to find a better western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was such a fan of Sergio Leone's Western trilogy with Clint Eastwood that when I saw he did a western with a big name Hollywood cast and Hollywood budget, I said, "Aw, that's it for Leone. Cross him off the list. Its all just cash-in time, now." And for almost 40 years, I never saw Once Upon A Time In The West. Oh sure, there were those late night TV airings where I saw the first excruciatingly exquisite scene and dug the music and the mood and then fell asleep. But, a couple of Ennio Morricone CDs always kept the theme music to Once Upon A Time in my immediate memory. I vowed to sit through the whole thing the next time it came on late night TV. Last night was the night I came to realize what a fool I'd been all those years. Wow, what a film. Every scene is a delight to behold, especially now that I have a 46" LCD to enjoy it all the more. The shots of Monument Valley (reminiscent of How The West Was Won-another personal fave) are incredible as are all the trademark Leone close-ups. Everything in the movie is just perfect. Fonda is the ultimate villain (WHO KNEW!), Robards is excellent, as usual, even Claudia Cardinale provides more than the de rigeur eye candy. Bronson....well, Bronson book-ends the Sixties Western if you think about it. He had a fine role in the 1960 classic, The Magnificent 7 and ends the decade with another classic western. Nicely done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it comes to spaghetti western movies three names come to mind Sergio Leone, Ennio Morricone and Clint Eastwood. Although this movie does not have Clint Eastwood, Henry Fondas performance well supplements the lack of the Eastwood. This movie and Buono, il brutto, il cattivo, Il (Good,bad and the ugly) are the top western movies of all time with no argument.The epic story telling grips the viewer from beginning to end with spectacular performances by Charles Brosnon, Henry Fonda, Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale. The movie also presented Ennio Morricone greatest connection of track to scene. A memorable track to scene moment was the scene that launched of right as Charles Brosnon entered the scene for the final duel.The story is basically the dispute over some railroad track that connects several characters in the process of the feud. As long as it maybe the plot definitely doesn't evolve slow, it may seem that way for people who just can't stand to watch movies beyond the norm 120 mins. All the characters are given a heart in this film to some degree and have very distinguishable features.There are very little western movies that lock me to my seat but this was definitely one of them. From epic one liners like Henry Fondas "How am I suppose to trust a man who can't even trust his pants." said to a man who has both suspenders and a belt connected to his pants. To Charles Brosnon saying "Can you play music with that too." sliding the revolver down the bar towards Harmonica.The movie was one of the best western flicks of all time. It was entirely underrated and anyone who remotely likes western flicks would be left in the dust if they hadn't seen this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overlong, paceless, ultimately boring western about a heartless killer (the late Henry Fonda) fighting a man known only as Harmonica (the late Charles Bronson) over a beautiful widow's (Claudia Cardinale) land. Turns out Henry killed Charlie's brother when they were younger and stuck a harmonica in Charlie's mouth to mock him, and now he's come back to shove that harmonica where the sun don't shine. Jason Robards is also caught up in the matter.Despite a brilliant performance from Henry Fonda in an uncharacteristically evil role and a fine performance from Charles Bronson as the Clint Eastwood-like loner out to kill Fonda and the addition of the beautiful eye candy Claudia, this spaghetti western has no energy, no pace, no gusto. Granted "The Good, The Bad, &amp; The Ugly" had none of these qualities either, but at least GB&amp;U had some humor in it. There is one line in here though that does stand out in particular to me:"You... you saved his life!" - Claudia"I didn't let them kill him [Fonda]. That's not the same thing." - Charles Bronson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be fair, I only watched the first hour of this thing. Seriously, they could have edited that down to 10 minutes. I don't need to look at a tumbleweed for 2 minutes or a "bad guy's" face for that long either without dialog to add anything. I felt like yelling at the TV something like "GET ON WITH IT"! I find that a good rule of thumb for movie watching is the "20 minute Rule". If after 20 minutes the movie doesn't do anything for you there's a very good chance it won't after 2 hours. Sort of like going on a blind date, you sorta know after the first 5 minutes if it's a bust or not, then the best thing to do is to be polite until you can gracefully exit. Good luck to anyone else watching it, maybe it gets better after the first hour but I didn't want to risk wasting any more of my life watching paint dry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone's worst, as far as I have seem them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion Sergio Leone is one of the best directors ever. But Once upon a time in the West is his failure. Whenever I watch a Leone movie, I am prepared for a slow pace - and am surprised that it is actually steady. OutW really is too slow. There is no typical Leone tension build up. The final shoot out is a meager copy of the two previous ones with Lee van Cleef involved. Henry Fonda is not a convincing villain like Van Cleef and Volonte (Fonda - and Leone - took revenge though with My name is Nobody). Charles Bronson is not underacting like Clint Eastwood - Bronson is simply not acting. Wallach is missing - I cannot even remember what kind of character Cheyenne is. There is no character development. There are no tricks, black humour, double and triple crosses. In fact there is hardly a story. I am happy to learn, that I am not the only one to prefer the Dollar movies. I also prefer all the movies Leone directed after this on, as far as I have seen them (the most). In fact I have been thinking of rating OutW with a 1. But that is not fair. The opening scene with the three hit men waiting for the train is absolutely brilliant, with Leone's typical eye for the detail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains spoilers!! Most of the westerns I've seen was when I was a kid and my father saw them on tv and I found them all terribly boring, but this one stands as the best western I've seen! What made this good for me, I guess was the plot. When the climax came I thought to myself "Goddamn, this is evil stuff! Great movie! The best old movie I've seen (except for Chaplin's "Limelight" of course, which is the best movie I've ever seen)!!". What dragged it a bit down was that it dragged a bit out after that. I think it could have still maintained the "great" position if it had just ended after the shoot-out or when Harmonica came into the house and said he had to leave. I didn't really need to see his companion, who also had to leave, die. I didn't feel anything for that guy, so that was just a bit irrelevant. It still stands as one of the best older movies I've seen though. "Casablanca" still tops it though, I guess (and of course "Limelight"). I also feel that this is one of those movies where the music and the images came together perfectly! I sat several times with goosebumps when seeing this movie, although I knew Morricone's "The man with the harmonica" when I saw the film (I have the song myself). I usually use a 6 point star system when rating movies and stuff and 4 is for a good movie and that translates to 6,66 on a 10-point scale, but I'll be generous and give it an 8! It could have gotten a 9 if it didn't drag out at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly low-key film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's an unusual way to describe a Western, but the word which came to mind while watching Once Upon a Time in the West was "quiet". In this film, more than any other of his that I've seen, Leone shows the influence of Kurosawa and the Japanese tradition with extended shots and constant use of silence and immobility as devices for setting mood. The opening sequence, for example, stretches to the point of unbearability. Something is about to happen but we don't know what, or when, and the suspense and tension grows with every passing second of near silence. After a brief flurry of action, all is, once again, silent.As _Casino_ is to gangster films, so _Once Upon a Time in the West_ is to Westerns - a sprawling epic on a grand scale executed with great skill. One of the best five Westerns I've seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shows what a genius director can do with mediocre material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The script of ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is hardly brilliant or original. The beautiful Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) comes to a Southwestern town to meet her new husband, only to find that he and his children have been murdered. The killer is Frank (Henry Fonda), a paid assassin of a railroad businessman, who has framed a local outlaw named Cheyenne (Jason Robards) for the crime. Then there is a Mysterious Stranger, identified only by the harmonica he constantly plays, who for some reason is trying to find the killer Frank.Sergio Leone, who had by this time established his reputation as the inventor and uncrowned king of the spaghetti western, takes this essentially hackneyed tale and builds incredible tension with it. He rations information like a miser, leading us along on a bread-crumb trail of clues that leave a good taste in our mouth but always hungry for more. The performances he coaxes from his leading actors are arguably career bests for all of them. Henry Fonda is shockingly cold and hard as Frank, the archetypical Western Killer in Black. There is no other fear quite like the fear of seeing the comforting and familiar warp into the menacing and alien; hence the power of casting Fonda, a man who played heroic leads for his entire career, as a heartless villain. Charles Bronson's secretive face and knowing smile will keep you fascinated; it's hard to believe this is the same man who proceeded to give identical schtick performances in movie after movie throughout the '70s and '80s. Claudia Cardinale's face speaks much more powerfully than her accented voice: her spirit and defiance make for a commendable character. Robards' scrappy outlaw is charming as he slowly warms to Cardinale's character.But the feel of this film, which is half its power, is hard to describe. Ennio Morricone's magnificent score, of course, is part of the magic; each major character has a theme music that is played subtly differently depending on how they are seen, which is why OUATITW is sometimes called "operatic." Leone sets up some wonderful shots: as where Bronson's eyes are alternately lit and darkened by a swinging lantern (arguably symbolizing our uncertainty whether he's a good guy or a bad guy); Bronson's silhouetted figure framed by closeups of the men who have been sent to kill him; Fonda's graceful, sidewise swagger as he prepares to draw down; the catlike speed with which he turns and draws when a man behind him reaches into a desk drawer; the shock and fear on Cardinale's face as she throws the door open to reveal a danger seen by her but not us. Leone's every shot simply oozes style, and makes us forget any flaws in the story.It must be admitted that OUATITW shamelessly romanticizes the gunfighters. That's not necessarily bad, for a mythical story can be as good in its own way as a factual one, but anyone who sees this film should also see UNFORGIVEN to get a more realistic feel for what gunplay in the Old West was really about.Simply put, this is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen, and it is due almost entirely to the director's skills. I rarely use the word "auteur" (which is merely French for "author") for a director, because the word is so often abused by arrogant faux-critics as a disguise for humbug. However, I will admit that OUATITW is truly a case of a director, or auteur if you must, making magic out of the most unpromising of materials.Rating: ***1/2 out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent film. Has great cinematography and a very epic music score. However, it has many flaws which kept it from achieving its full potential and it is simply not remotely as good as "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly", at least according to my subjective preferences.The films flaws are many: its pacing is too slow, which place increased stress over the viewer's patience. The director appears to believe that the most dramatic scenes were those where the characters stared blank on each other for the greatest amount of time: the final confrontation has the two main characters starting at the ugly faces of each other for 20 minutes straight in complete silence.Overall, I found it highly recommended but not the perfect masterpiece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West is one of the most compellingly dramatic Westerns of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched this movie on AMC late night during the '90s, I was impressed at the pace of the scenes by director Sergio Leone, the compelling score by Ennio Morricone, and performances of Jason Robards, Charles Bronson, and especially Henry Fonda. Having just watched it again on DVD with wonderful stereo sound, I'm even more impressed by the whole awesome spectacle of the dramatic and sometimes epic flavor of the thing. Everything just seems perfect with each shot and movements of the performances. And among them is Claudia Cardinale-top billed among the cast and the only other role I'd seen her in other than the "Pink Panther" movies-who provides quite a luminous presence as the only truly compelling female character in the movie. She has great scenes with all three leads. And Fonda, usually an actor who plays such idealistically decent characters, is such a revelation as the take-no-prisoners-villain Frank. His showdown with Bronson is one of the most compellingly tension-filled in movie history. With Leone, nothing feels too slow. It's just right with the way things happen. I think I've said enough, so on that note, Once Upon a Time in the West gets a definite recommendation from me. P.S. On a personal note, I loved hearing all the mentions of New Orleans, a city only a two-hour drive from where I live.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to the same atmosphere as those in Leone's 'Dollars' trilogy, and considering how much praise ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST has gotten, no wonder I was disappointed. The echoing harmonica really got on my nerves after a while, and the whole approach struck me as long, boring and with pointless characters. To me, Charles Bronson lacks the charisma of Clint Eastwood's character in the 'Dollars' trilogy, and Henry Fonda is nowhere near as intimidating as Lee Van Cleef was.ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST's characters are uninteresting and their plights are pointless.... to me. I tried sitting through the movie twice and both times I fell asleep. However, I've watched the Dollars trilogy (FIST FULL OF DOLLARS, FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, and THE GOOD THE BAD &amp; THE UGLY) several times and enjoyed every second of it. Catchier music, more colorful characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I just flicked through a couple of reviews here and nobody seems to find this as misogynistic as I did. Maybe I saw a version that was missing a few scenes - I don't think so however.Basically the scene where Frank and Cardinale are in bed together bothered me a hell of a lot. There's no build up to this scene. We don't see him beat her or force her at gun point. It seems to be she likes this guy. This guy who ruthlessly murdered her husband and his family. What the hell. I was beginning to wonder if she was in on it from the start. She doesn't seem to be bothered by sleeping with this scumbag at all. A strong female lead like her would have stashed guns and set traps to kill this guy. Would have made a hell of a better film (also pleasantly shorter). Also why does Bronson and co leave her unguarded for such a long time? They clearly know she's in danger but leave her to be molested or murdered or both.Sure, maybe she had no choice but to sleep with frank - but why didn't they show these scenes? Also why did she seem so comfortable with it? I guess she didn't want to get murdered but in these circumstances anyone would be justified in calling the director misogynistic. Not exactly inspiring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Good: Sergio Leone creates some memorable scenes and performances. Once Upon a Time in the West opening scene, which is around 13 minutes, builds tension with few words or dialogue. Quiet, fast violence, then quiet again is a memorable opening. There are many memorable scenes with Fonda, and Bronson running around in cowboy hats with other rugged character mixed in with music and a rugged landscape. Sergio Leone made Western's which looked dirty and real. The Bad: Two and half hours is way too long. Many scenes added little or dragged the story down, and should have been cut. A few less artistic scenes would have helped the story. Too many plot twists, and sub stories which confused the viewer. The Ugly: Memorable scenes and performances made the film watchable. Regrettably the films elongated length, bad sub-story scenes and attempts at humor kills Once Upon a Time in the West strong points. The opening and strong acting gives the film a nine, but the extra baggage drops the film to a 3. I give Once Upon a Time in the West a six out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally got around after all these years to checking out the fabled "Once Upon a Time in the West." Mostly I found it mannered and dated. It was clear that Sergio Leone now thought of himself as a sort of Fellini of westerns.I think he must have created this whole project with the sole purpose of providing material for film history courses in universities. Every sight, sound and character has a flashing neon sign reading "Symbolism" complete with pointing arrow in case you're missing it. It is mostly baffling, and I don't have the patience or respect for movies that you supposedly have to work hard at to unravel like I used to have when I was eager to prove to everybody how intellectual I was. In the end, once you get to the bottom line statement of such films, I can usually think of about half a dozen slightly more mainstream "Hollywood" films that say the same thing more effectively, engagingly, and forcefully. There's nothing new under the sun--there isn't anything new to be said about man's virtues, vices, struggles and triumphs. It's all there in Shakespeare, so to speak.In sum, this movie is completely self-conscious about how profound and deep it supposedly is, and that's why I say its mannered. It's a real dinosaur from the late 60s, and truly stuck there.That said, there are some standout scenes in between all the showing off. The famous opening train depot sequence does indeed deserve its reputation. The final revelations between Henry Fonda's character and Clint East...er, I mean Charles Bronson's character were supremely handled, I must say. That was a great scene, beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before you have a stroke, please read WHY I was not entirely impressed by this film (then, you can hate me)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have absolutely loved the Sergio Leone "Spaghetti Westerns" that he made before ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. So, given that I have given very positive reviews for FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE and THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY, my being far from impressed with this film isn't because I dislike the genre or have it out for Mr. Leone! No, I have some legitimate reasons why I think the film is overrated--certainly very few of the IMDb users can honestly think this movie is one of the best 25 movies of all-time (despite its high IMDb score).The biggest problem is the terribly slow pacing. While none of his films of the genre are fast-paced, they are deliberately paced and hold your interest. However, this film could easily have had 45 to 60 minutes chopped out of it without a major negative impact on the movie. The buildup is just way too long and drawn out to allow this to be a great film. Self-indulgent in its pacing, yes, but not great. I don't want to watch Jack Elam blowing a fly off his face again and again and again. I don't want to see closeups of the actors eyes again and again and again. And I certainly do not want to have a scene take three times longer than it would in any other Western! The second biggest problem is that although the film seems like a meticulous labor of love in some places, a few other ones it is just plain sloppy. The absolute worst is the actor who seems to play a younger version of Charles Bronson. Not only does it look almost nothing like him, but the eye color doesn't even match--and considering all the closeups of eyes, this is just sloppy (Bronson's are bright blue-gray and the other has dark brown eyes). Also, in a few other places it looks like scenes were missing as the movie just jumped from one scene to another--and I DID watch the extended version of the movie, not the edited version. And finally, how Jason Robards was able to carry on the entire final portion of the movie--apparently fine--only to keel over dead in the very end just seemed ridiculous and sloppy.Now as far as what I liked (and boy did I want to like this film). I loved having nice-guy Henry Fonda play a cold-blooded creep. This was great. And, although I generally hated the long, slow pace, the opening scene was worth the very long wait. The music, while not Ennio Marricone's very best, was still excellent and haunting. My advice is see these other Leone Westerns and then compare them. Even THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY (a very, very long movie as well) is much faster paced than this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is at least a third too long, taken up in long pauses, and head/facial shots, with orchestral music and singing on the soundtrack, clearly inconsistent with the wild west theme. And I was sorry to only see a brief appearance of Jack Elam (even considering his too long scene with the fly) and Woody Stode. Charles Bronson was Charles Bronson. He may not have much range, but he is great in this movie as a Charles Bronson character. I felt sorry for Henry Fonda. He was either terribly miscast or he just couldn't get into the role. He was supposed to be menacing, but the only menace he showed was mechanical. Claudia Cardinale is not much of an actress and I felt that she wasn't speaking English at least part of the time - her voice seemed to be dubbed. Her role seemed to be to add a bit of female flesh. The scene of Charles Bronson ripping her dress made no sense since he apparently didn't have evil intention, unless the point was to show a little flesh. The same could be said of her going out to provide water to hundreds of workers constructing the railroad tracks who probably hadn't seen a woman in forever; and she was wearing a very revealing top that appeared to be in danger of falling off. Jason Robards who had sort of a peripheral role, was the only good actor in the movie, but then he is always good. For the Charles Bronson fans (and I am one), the final showdown gave us what seemed to be five minutes focused on the narrow slits that are his eyes. This movie was a tribute to Sergio Leone's wretched excess. Definitely not "A Fistfull of Dollars".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Forth Best Western Ever....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>.... Ranking only behind Leone's Dollars Trilogy. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' features a great cast, featuring Henry Fonda as the cold-blooded villain, Charles Bronson as the mysterious 'Harmonica' and Claudia Cardinale as the widowed Jill McBain. The direction is amazing, with Leone really taking the best bits from all westerns such as show downs, greed, and deep character development. Ennio Morricone's beautifull score is one of his best to date, even beating out his more famous 'The Good, the bad and the Ugly' theme. The film is long, but you hardly notice it, as Leone uses time and space brilliantly.All in all, this is the forth best western ever, I just prefer the Dollars trilogy to it. I have one critisism though... Leone originally wanted Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach to be killed off at the begining - (I suppose they would be the three gunmen waiting for Bronson's arrival off the train?). He wanted to pay respect to his earlier films and the three stars, but Eastwood wouldn't agree. To me, this would have been a brilliant opening sequence, but seeing the 'Invincible' Clint Eastwood die.......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost great but for the miscasting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The amazing cinematographic touch of Leone is there, and his flawless capture of the grit and grandeur that MUST have been the west of 150 years ago is worth the price of admission alone. But amidst this visual feast are flaws that prevented a higher score from me. The first is the plot itself, which revolves around a woman, a "former" prostitute, and her three lovers- all of whom are major characters in the film who battle each other in some form or another. Actually, I read this afterward on IMDb. You could have fooled me on that one. Women have no place in a Leone western to begin with, and Claudia simply did not have the acting range to pull it off. She was in a lot of scenes but I never thought of her as the focus of the film. Sophia Loren cast in the role might have brought a magnetic quality to the woman, perhaps, but not Claudia. Which comes to the miscasting. With Leone's star firmly in the ascendant, it is clear that all of Hollywood wanted in on this one, and Sergio obliged, to the detriment of the movie. Jason Robards, as a commenter already noted, is dreadful as Cheyenne. He brings nothing to the movie and his hang-dog acting style is irritating and tiresome. Bronson as the protagonist Harmonica is too short and ethnic looking to be convincing as a tough guy. And the harmonica playing "hook" of the movie is laughable, though it makes some convoluted sense at the end of the movie. Hey, a tough guy has to be ready to draw his gun at ALL times. If you play a harmonica, not only do you use two hands, but you must concentrate on the melody. Just didn't work for me. The main theme was superb, but the secondary theme- where the banjo is being plucked in a jaunty tune- was out of place and WAY overused. Other plot holes are where the heck did McBain get the money to build a big house and purchase lumber and supplies to build an entire town? And if he had money, why would he marry a New Orleans prostitute? So a great movie, for it is a Leone, but with many, many flaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I LOVE Sergio Leone. And I LOVE Charles Bronson. When I finally got around to seeing "Once Upon A Time In The West" I figured I would love it, that it would become an instant favorite, but I was sadly disappointed. This is a movie with all of the right ingredients that tries to do much, and takes way too long to do it.Clearly, Sergio Leone was ready to "graduate" from his spaghetti westerns and tackle more complex stories, with richer characters and deeper emotions. The problem is his greatest strength as a director is his eye, his sense for visuals and panorama, the masterful filling of the frame and his use of editing to convey story and character. He forgets that here and what we're left with is a soggy melodrama stretched to its limits in order to fill Leone's massive canvas. And it becomes pretty clear after three hours that there was not enough story or character to warrant the movie's epic size."The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" was driven by action: amoral characters in a violent world who faced death and betrayal at every turn and used a gun as their primary form of communication. "Once Upon A Time" focuses on a mail-order bride, who spends most of the movie staring silently while men play the harmonica and order coffee. The story unfurls itself so slowly- and so confusingly- that by the time you grasp it's themes of revenge and industrial progress you might simply not care. Charles Bronson- who was born to star in a Leone picture- is wasted here as a man so patient and controlled that his eventual outbursts of violence are anti-climactic. Jason Robards is so sleepy and sluggish that I found it ironic- and sad- that his character's main identifying feature was that he was a lover of coffee. Completely wasted are Jack Elam and Woody Strode who- after being beautifully introduced in the movie's brilliant opening sequence- are dropped from the film entirely. And Henry Fonda, dirty-faced and unshaven, gives the best performance of his career as the black-hearted gunman Frank- until he opens his mouth and his earnest mid-western warble ruins the illusion.Had the movie begun with the railroad storyline and proceeded to follow the adventures of the men who would do anything to acquire and protect the lucrative plot of land we might have had a better film. Like "The Good &amp; The Bad" there would have been heroes and villains, each with their own sense of morality (or lack thereof), and assorted motives for their extreme actions. Since this plot point is concealed until late in the film, the characters and their deeds lack clear motivation. And there's just no excuse for the languid pacing here, in which full minutes tick by without any action or story beats.Now, with all this said, the film is still beautifully shot and photographed, with every frame gracefully composed and full of detail. The opening sequence is spectacular, with the buzzing of the fly and the dripping of the water adding unbelievable tension to the simple act of men waiting for a train, and Harmonica on the roof of the train taking out gunman from above is also fantastic. Claudia Cardinale is gorgeous and magnetic as Jill, and the Ennio Morricone score is at times both menacing and sweet.Still, three hours is too long to tell a story that's much less complicated than the movie would have you believe. I applaud Leone taking on a movie with more complex themes, but that's no excuse for abandoning the simplicity and impact of the gunfight or the power of a man with no name who is defined not by what he thinks or the emotions that he feels but by what he Does, and how he does it. These are the characters that Leone understands, and the types of films he should make. I guess he didn't realize that he didn't have to make this grab towards artistic respectability? he had already proved himself a brilliant and timeless filmmaker.GRADE: C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sergio Leone's Fairy Tale West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Once Upon a Time in the West" is Sergio Leone's leisurely Western saga about a newly-widowed bride (Claudia Cardinale) and three men (Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson and Jason Robards) who circle around her like sharks in an effort to get out of her what they need in order to further their own aims.None of the three is exactly a good guy, though Bronson and Robards come close, but Cardinale, thanks to some facts we learn about her character on the way, isn't exactly our traditional Western heroine either, and she's more than capable of dealing with whatever these guys have to throw at her. Robards and Fonda are both excellent, Fonda making such a good villain it makes you wonder why he wasn't cast as villains more often. Leone's film is operatic in sweep and tone; Ennio Morricone's simply gorgeous score bathes everything in an elegiac aura, a fitting attribute for a film that is, after all (as the title implies), a fairy tale. The film doesn't achieve quite the level of greatness of Leone's masterpiece "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly," but few films do.At the risk of sounding like a chauvinist, I have to believe that Leone's films work better for men than for women. Not to say that women can't like them, but the themes and emotions that Leone conjures on screen have a primal maleness to them, which is why I think he and his films have become so emblematic of "guys' movies."

		<shortDescription>Sergio's slow-moving western has some unforgettable moments...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to give ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST a decidedly mixed review.Before I begin, let me point to the major flaws involved: the dialog is not as sharp as in the Clint Eastwood westerns Sergio directed; the score is not quite as electrifying as those memorable background scores featured in the Eastwood flicks; and there is never enough exposition in the dialog to fill the viewer in with any background information nor is there any insight into the character motivations of CHARLES BRONSON. You have to wait until the last ten minutes of the two hours and forty-six minutes running time to discover why Bronson has been trailing the villainous HENRY FONDA.Aside from these annoying defects, the convoluted storyline does manage to hold the attention from the opening shots before the credits, consisting mostly of close-ups of WOODY STRODE and JACK ELAM as they await the arrival of a transcontinental train. The story is only vaguely made comprehensible by the time CLAUDIA CARNIVALE arrives to greet her new husband and his children--only to find that they have all been slaughtered. From then on, the tension never lets up, although it is drawn out interminably with scenes that never seem to move but have impact because of the clever editing.It's certainly a western saga and obviously cost a pretty penny to produce. The atmosphere seems authentic as to the sets and costumes and there is a distinct lack of a Hollywood touch to the gunplay and violence.But is it a great western? I would have preferred a less enigmatic approach to the storyline--but the strength of the film lies in the solid performances from an excellent cast. I would have liked a little more from Claudia Carnivale than a fixed stare, which she seems to substitute for an intense overall performance. However, JASON ROBARDS, JR. does an impressive job as the outlaw "Cheyenne".The final shootout between Bronson and Fonda is masterfully shot and within the time it takes place we're also given a flashback that shows why Bronson was tracking down Fonda's character. But the film's pace is much too slow and not exactly enlivened by a lack of dialog.And finally, I was disappointed that Morricone's score lacked the excitement of those he did for other "spaghetti westerns".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But I would hardly say that this is one of the best pictures ever made.I liked this film very much, but I'm not a huge fan, as almost all of the other posters on this site seem to be.Leone does a wonderful job of focusing on the characters and using his camera to set a wonderful mood to the film. I think that all three of the male leads are excellent. And despite what some have said, I believe it is one of Fonda's best pieces of work. In my opinion it's the last excellent performance of his career. You can feel how tired and beaten Jason Robards is by looking at his hang-dog expression.I know that Leone had great affection for the American western, and he wanted to acknowledge as many great western films as he could by adding little hints during the movie. I thought this was a great idea and made the film even more interesting to watch.I think my favorite scene is the one in the beginning at the station. The lack of music, and just hearing the normal sounds really helped to build this scene into a classic.But I did not think much of the Claudia Cardinale role of Jill. While she is quite the central figure, we really don't learn too much about her. And I don't believe Cardinale was right for the roll.Overall, a very good film that I would like to see again, and maybe it is a classic western, but still a little unsatisfying.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful film, if you can ignore the sexism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen some great Westerns ('Shane', 'High Noon', 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', 'Unforgiven', 'The Wild Bunch') but this may be the best of them all. There are so many memorable images: killers coming out of the dust towards a small boy, long coats swinging ominously; a crippled man crawling away into the desert; a boy with a harmonica in his mouth, his brother standing on his shoulders, a noose around his neck. All riveted to the mind by Enio Morricone's score. Except for '2001: A Space Odyssey' I have never seen a movie that uses music and silence so effectively. The cinematography, score, editing and directing are all amazing and the acting is also strong - other reviews have given them the praise they deserve, so I will skip to why I only gave this film an 8.It's SO sexist. Not that the central female character is weak; on the contrary she's tough, pragmatic and clever enough to match any of the men in the movie. The problem is that too often she acts like a typical Western woman: she seeks a strong man to protect her, and is always at the beck and call of the film's hard men. The attitude of the men is summed up when Cheyenne tells her to go out amoung the men working on the railway and, if any of them touch her backside, let it go because 'they've deserved it'. A little sexual harrassment is fine after a hard days work. This is probably a reflection of the era, but I saw nothing in the film to say that Leone didn't endorse that attitude. There is one particularly nasty scene where Harmonica seems about to rape the woman, but stops and tells her to get him some water from the well. Why is this so bad? Because our hero is shown as deliberately putting the woman in her place - basically telling her I could have had you and I could have you any time I want: remember that. Be nice and do what I say. I found that hard to stomach in a 'good guy'.The other big flaw in the version I saw was right was, and I'll try not to give away any spoilers, at the end when a central character dies. It doesn't fit the plot or the pacing of the movie, and feels totally like a scene edited out by Leone that got reinserted in the new version.All that aside, a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Decent spaghetti western by Sergio Leone. However, it suffers from the same problems as all of Leone's westerns: overly long, often- ridiculous dialogue and an abundance of hammy acting.Starts off well enough. Good build-up with much intrigue. However, if you think only the intro is going to be slow, to build up the suspense, and are hoping the remainder of the movie will movie will move at a quicker pace, you're in for a rude surprise. The whole movie moves at that pace.Has some good action sequences. Despite the unnecessary, and seemingly random, complexity of the plot, it comes together well at the end.As mentioned, dialogue and acting often leave much to be desired. Henry Fonda is great in his role. Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale are solid in their roles and even Charles Bronson is more-or-less okay (it is touch-and-go though!). However, as usual in Leone movies, it's the supporting cast who are largely atrocious. Some of the worst acting you'll ever see. Prize for worst performance here goes to the villain who gets thrown off the train and shot by Henry Fonda. I hope he went back to his day job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong on visuals, weak on story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The magnificent opening set piece -surely one of the greatest in the history of cinema- promises a masterpiece. Alas this promise is never realised and the film descends into rambling, long-winded and often confusing sequences, usually visually stunning in themselves, but containing huge leaps both in logic and time.There is much that is left unanswered by the end of the film and what explanations there are often are unsatisfactory. It barely seems plausible, to take a small example, that the newly arrived wife would choose to stay alone in a deserted cottage knowing her family has just been murdered there and that the murderers were still on the prowl, both in terms of her safety and the sheer morbidity of it. I get the impression that Sergio Leone cobbled together this rather ropey story around a few set pieces he had in mind and used his considerable cinematic artistry to try to hide the plot holes.There are too numerous head-scratching moments to mention but one of the most notable involves Jason Robards as Cheyenne. He escapes (offscreen) apparently by murdering his prison guard? Its not too clear. This homicidal tendency then disappears and he becomes a kindly figure. Later he allows himself to be handed in by Bronson for $5,000 although we never discover what he is wanted for, presumably a serious crime? Again, off screen, he escapes from captivity. I presume we are not shown this since it would involve the killing of law men? Or maybe the film was already WAY too long? Then he seems to be pursuing the widow. Bronson leaves, then he leaves? Then he and Bronson are riding off together and he just falls down and dies of a wound that has not been mentioned till that point?Worth watching for a few great set pieces. But the narrative's all over the place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw the classic 1968 Western in Blu-Ray today. Like watching a new Quentin Tarantino movie. Director Sergio Leone stepped out beyond his spaghetti western roots to make a giant western saga. The story is told in the lives of four different western archetypes. Claudia Cardinale, Charles Bronson,Jason Robards and a villainous Henry Fonda star. The screenplay was co-written by future Italian film giant Bernardo Bertolucci. The film is audio edited in a way that even the dubbed-in voices of the actors are never a hindrance to the pace of the story. The score is also by another Italian film giant the legendary Ennio Morricone. If you have a spare evening or afternoon(the restored film is 2hrs 45mins) be sure to watch it. Filmed in color in Arizona,Utah and Europe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am an oldies fan. I love 60s,70s,80s films. I like some European westerns, too.But this is AWFUL! Long, slow, boring, just plain bad. I won't repeat what others very accurately said, but I will add my (femenine) opinion on one thing: Claudia Cardinale's makeup is grotesque. Those false eyelashes! So thick they look like brushes. I do like makeup on actresses. I always complain about most "realistic," washed-out faces in today's films. But the MU in this film is so 60s it's ridiculous. Sure, some women wore MU in those days (mainly prostitutes). But it consisted of white powder, black-rimmed eyes (they used charcoal bits), and crimson lips. It might not be a terribly important point, but it's SO obvious.IAC, this film is unbearable. Even Ennio Morricone's soundtrack is not up to his usual high level (The Mission, A Fistful of Dynamite, Chi Mai, etc.) He must have realized what a turkey he had to deal with and just matched the musical score to the quality of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this at a revival house for my first viewing. I'd have to say that this was much better than the typical Italian western, which is 2 hours of people staring at each other and odd sounding gunshots. The cinematography was beautiful, as were the sets and costumes. The acting was pretty good, especially Fonda and Robards. What is missing was either a screenplay that filled 2 1/2 hours of screen time or an editor to cut out about 45 minutes of superfluous material. This is no masterpiece, but it is a film worth watching. Leone will be remembered as someone who made overlong good movies, but no masterpieces. Maybe these films are loved in Europe, but here in America we like some story with the pretty images. Rating: 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>most overrated film on list</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the exception of Toy Story 2 being in the 60's on the imdb user list, this one could be the most overrated film. The story and characters were poorly introduced. Upon watching this film, and I wasn't distracted or intoxicated, and I couldn't follow what was going on. Actually, I was distracted by Claudia Cardinale's beauty and her several close-call rape scenes. Other than that, the story was a joke. I don't know if anyone will agree with me on this, but I think Henry Ford was miscast. All I could think about with him was 12 Angry Men and him being intensely moral. He does have a moral, good-guy vibe coming off of him as a villain... just look at the difference between him and Bronson when you watch the movie. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly was a masterpiece with a great (well laid out) story and never a dull moment. This film must be for Spaghetti Western aficionados, because I'm not seeing the greatness here. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason Robards destroys this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every Sergio Leone movie has impressive stuff in it. The sequence here where Jill arrives at the train station and takes a carriage through town, and then Monument Valley (while a ravishing piece of Morricone scoring plays) is astonishing.But... I've never loved an entire Leone movie. He's too self-indulgent. Here, long stretches of silence are his only idea. When they work, the results are sublime. But here that's only three times out of twelve. There's so many of them they're quickly exposed as a gimmick/crutch, BUT alternately, when he gives lines to his actors the quality instantly plummets. We never become interested in a single character's arc. As soon as Claudia Cardinale talks, you go "oh, that mysterious, vivid creature we've been looking at, is just a common two-dimensional female lead... meh..." Her Doonesbury mascara is a bit much. This movie plays like an unrelated series of scenes Leone wanted to shoot.It still might have been a decent effort... but then Jason Robards shows up, and destroys the movie. In the history of film, has there ever been a less interesting actor than Jason Robards? At his best he's average, at his worst, he's an energy vampire, sucking the life out of projects. Over his entire career no viewer has ever said "I've just got to see that new Jason Robards movie this weekend." If you ever thought actors were interchangeable and all you needed was a competent one who could read his lines, watch Robards here. What was Leone thinking? You cannot hang an entire movie on Jason Robards. His heavy is feeble, not intimidating. He wanders around hoping to look competent; clueless about where to place the emphasis in his lines, or what to do with his arms. And when he tries to flash an intimidating look, he focuses too close to his face and just looks cross-eyed and silly. He molds nothing about his presence or his role. It actually seems like he's thinking 'I'm all wrong for this. I hope no one notices.' He brings nothing to the table. He' s completely out of his depth. Nothing resembling chemistry forms between him and Cardinale. Charles Bronson's harmonica theme is excruciating. It's Morricone's worst motif.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Cowboy Movies (or Maybe the Best) Ever Made ? A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three bad guys stay in a station waiting for the train. Along more than ten minutes, there is a disturbing lack of action, with minor details being presented: a fly, a drop of water. Then, Harmonica (Charles Bronson, maybe in his best performance on the screen) arrives and there is a short but spectacular dialog between the characters. The next scene, the viewer sees a family being massacred by Frank (Henry Fonda, with a stunning performance). Then we have a long shot and panoramic scene in a station, with the arrival of Jill (Claudia Cardinale, with such a remarkable beauty and performance). And last but not the least, there is a scene in a road bar, where we are introduced to the character of Cheyenne (Jason Robard, in a spectacular performance). The introduction of this four main characters is slow, but very well presented. And this will be the tonic of this film: slow, but very well constructed scenes and characters. The story was written by Dario Argento and Bernardo Bertolucci, therefore it does not need any further explanation. All supported by the magnificent, wonderful, stunning, marvelous, fantastic soundtrack of Ennio Morricone. Another masterpiece of Sergio Leone. The DVD just released in Brazil in special edition, with two discs and lots of extras, deserves a special observation. Congratulations to Paramount: Sergio Leone, writers, screenplayers, actors, actresses, crew and the fans really deserve such a respectful edition! My vote is ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Leone is usually stellar, but this movie is a misfire. Perhaps its slow pace played better 30 years ago, but several moments in this movie are soooo sloooow that I couldn't stand it. Every scene, every close-up is an opportunity for the actors to ham it up and further slow down the film. Unlike most who view this film, I found the acting to be rather ordinary for the most part. Bronson was nothing special here; I can only surmise that people's preconceptions of Fonda led them to believe that he did a great acting job here. (Just because he was the heavy.) Most of the characters did not appear to be more than standard cut-outs, or an opportunity for big-name stars to wear Western duds.Given the near-unanimity of opinion on this board, perhaps I need to see this again, but I doubt it. "Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo" is a far superior movie to this; see that one instead. Eli Wallach added some real _life_ to that picture, life that is sorely missing here.</fullReview>

What's so good about it? The Good, The Bad and the Ugly is far superior, as are the 'dollar' movies that preceded it. I guess it is cool that Henry Fonda is an evil piece of work, but other than that this movie really has nothing going for it, except Claudia Cardinale and her legendary beauty. The pacing was way too slow, the scenes were unnecessarily long and dragged often, and the acting left much to be desired. It's as if Leone tried to fuse an art film with his macho western style, and the result was a confused piece of action-art nonsense with no substance to justify the 'art' and too many stagnant and lifeless performances for it to be considered 'action'.</fullReview>

It was only by reading the excellent and first-class Synopsis provided on the IMDb web-site that I finally understood what the film was supposed to be about.Unfortunately for any judgement on this film, only a few days ago I watched John Ford's "The Searchers" once again. Now, there, you have a true western masterpiece! The story is told in a straightforward, concise, and economical manner, without any of the so-called modern tricks of slow meandering camera movements and/or long and supposedly pregnant moments of silence. I found "Once Upon a Time in the West" totally pretentious and often rather silly and "posing". During its first hour virtually nothing of the story was ever spelt out or even got going. As to calling this a "masterpiece" and other such nonsense terms, some people really need to educate themselves about what is good and bad cinema. "The Searchers" - the absolute best!

		<fullReview>Sergio Leone understood mannerism better than any director who ever lived and employed it to extraordinary effect in his spaghetti westerns. In addition, his superb use of sound, detail and the closeup were rarely equaled in the history of the cinema. That said, his Once Upon a Time in The West is by and large a dismal, overblown failure of equally titanic proportions. The acting is self-conscious not mannered, the details other than the opening sequence at the train station (brilliant in absolutely every regard, he should have quit when Charles Bronson says, "You've brought two too many.")are largely uninspired and the music is nothing short of grating. Both of Leone's Once Upon a Time films (in America and in the West) were creative and box office failures as he bit off far more than he could chew.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will admit I didn't really get the sense that there was a plot in this western at all, but it didn't spoil anything, I was going to watch it regardless, from director Sergio Leone (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly). Basically the railways are being placed all over America, even the far west, in particular a small border town full of guns and crime. It opens with an inspired sequence seeing men sitting around doing not much, one guy traps a fly in his gun barrel, they are waiting for the train to arrive. Anyway, Arriving into this town is Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale), who is shocked to find her new husband Brett (Frank Wolff) and family slaughtered, and the prime suspect is coffee loving Cheyenne (Jason Robards). The real killer however is gang leader Frank (Henry Fonda) who is trying to get his own way with the ownership of the railroad, along with the mysterious man known only for playing his Harmonica (Charles Bronson). Also staring Gabriele Ferzetti as Morton, Keenan Wynn as Sheriff, Paolo Stoppa as Sam and Marco Zuanelli as Wobbles. As I said, I didn't really get the plot, I just enjoyed the actors being cool and quite often quiet to effect, the violence and gun play, and some good music by Ennio Morricone. The critics describe it as some kind of operatic thing with the little dialogue, I suppose I'd agree with that, it is about fifteen minutes short of three hours, but it is certainly a different kind of western to see.

		<fullReview>Sergio Leone will one day, maybe fifty years from now, replace Mister Wood on every critic's list as the worst movie director of all time. He'll at least make the top ten. At least Wood could make a story interesting, at least one character you might care about, and didn't have the gigantic Leone budget. Leone fails on every level. The story is very disjointed. It's mostly just comically unrealistic gunplay, with some guys being able to kill minor characters from great distances, but unable to kill major stars that should be easier. That's nothing new, but the circumstances are quite laughable. The story is just killing after killing, to take land away, and it follows sadist Henry Fonda, and his opponents, Charles Bronson and Jason Robards. Jack Elam appears in what amounts to a cameo. The characters aren't much to like. Bronson makes little jokes like an underdog hero of a Japanese movie, but the plot is so bad, and the characters so unlikable, you don't really care. To be fair, they aren't as unlikable as other spaghetti Westerns, but they don't have any appeal, either. You struggle to watch the film. You won't be able to do in one sitting. You'll have to watch a piece at a time, because you will fall to sleep. What makes the movie a bomb is the use of such outstanding cool music that neither matches or contrasts the situation. It falls flat, and it is a waste of good music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I see many folks like this film, to be sure-there are some moments when this movie approaches something more than what it is-simply put-a violent saga of the Old West. Yes, Henry Fonda tackles a role far different from his normal stuff, but in reality-it was a big step down for an actor who showed far greater acting in roles like The Wrong Man, Mister Roberts and On Golden Pond. Jason Robards, one of my personal favorites has the best role of any in the story-at least his lines are interesting. Charles Bronson stands out-mainly because he has so few lines-the less said by Mr. Bronson in a movie-the better! He does makes for a stony, stoic character he portrays. Claudia Cardinale-forget her acting-she is there for beauty in what is really a very ugly film. Some of the music score is interesting, the outdoor shots are nice, but the screen play could have used a lot more work. If you are into the ultra violent western genre-go for this and watch it. This is just one person's opinion-but I have seen most of all the sound westerns-save for the "B" stuff-ever made. Once Upon A Time could have been done much better by a better director/producer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long and VERY boring! did I say it was also boring and very long?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>every scene filled with extended pauses and unnecessary camera angles, if you want boring to death between the paucity of action (ridiculous and totally without suspense) then this is surely the film for you! You say who knows the reason for the protagonists conflict? I say who cares! I had lost interest ......along with the will to live.....long before the end of this grindingly dull movie. Is this the result of a group of profits motivated film executives thinking "wow we have a major director here, lets allow him to do ANYTHING he wants, after all it MUST be good!"? Next time hire a cheaper director but pay for some decent dialogue!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top 50 ! Yeah Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I write this ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is ranked number 50 in the IMDB top 250 movies . I can`t help thinking a lot of people have confused this with ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA The problem I had is that it`s massively overlong and it crawls along at a snails pace , most of this is caused by someone walking into a set , the camera spending several seconds holding a close up on their face , then the character walking along very slowly , they stop , camera holds close up on their face for several seconds again , and then , only then do they open their mouth , camera cuts to close up of other characters faces , then someone opens their mouth to reply . Gawd with a little minor editing this film could have been half the length without loosing a single scene or line of dialogue And doesn`t the closing theme tune ( Also used thoroughout the film ) sound like like it belongs in a BBC sitcom ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't really have a lot to say. It is simply a pretty bad movie, it has nothing. How can something to seem so long?? It is extremely slow and the characters suck. Nobody might believe something as bad as it is. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather than a genre, western is a style: an USA one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not a question of liking or disliking. It's not a western. Western is an American style of movie rather than a genre and it's impossible to anyone alien to that culture to repeat it. The film is the Italian way to tell a story whose characters walk in an western scenery. Even if all the "john waynes" were casted, it wouldn't turn it into a western. The background could be anywhere in this planet and the film wouldn't change.</fullReview>
