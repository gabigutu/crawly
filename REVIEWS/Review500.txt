		<fullReview>This is an Anand L Rai's production and he is known for fun filled film with strong emotional connect, here emotional connect is missing but trust me this film has quite a few moments worth watching for. There are so many characters in the film, but Abhay Deol bags the meatier role and as usual excels in his role. His love interest Zoya (don't know her real name) enacts her part so well, she conveys her anger, hope, helplessness beautifully. More than the story of Happy, the Abhay deol (Bilal) and Zoya's love angle shines in the movie.Other than all these Ali Faizal and Jimmy both known for good to great acting skills shines well. Piyush Sharma gets gem of the lines in this film and provides heavy dose of laughter. Diana Penty gets an easiest role to play here, most of the work is done by male actors here, she comes back to screen after 3-4 years but this role does not back her skills she shown in Cocktail. There are no songs you will remember after watching this, and in 2nd half the story does not move much but at climax again it brings smiles at your face.This is better watch then Rustom and Mohenjo Daro together, it's a pure fun watch. Go with no expectation and you shall return smiling.2 hours worth refreshment, that's it this movie is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was already interested in this movie because of trailer. the trailer was superb and the movie didn't let it down. it is a family movie. there is light comedy. as per name Happy (Diana Panty) is in main role but Abhay Deol took the credit for the movie. he is a good actor but unfortunately he didn't get good roles. But this movie is a great come back for him. Jimmi Shergil is and Piyush Mishra again rocked. both are great actors and deserve much than their present situation in bollywood. Ali Fazal is just time pass. I have seen his some movies Fukre, Fast &amp; furious 7 and now Happy Bhaag jayegi but in all movie i didn't get his different emotion on his face. his acting is like doing same thing again and again. but director keep his role short so it is good. I heartily laughed in this movie many times. they didn't take India-Pakistan dispute on negative level. this difference is changed in light comedy. So at the last, I say MUST Watch movie.Prashant Gupta www.caprashant.in</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time Pass Comedy Movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the trailer one would get interested in the movie just to find what would happen if a young bride accidentally runs away from borders of India to Pakistan. Would it be too grave consequences as projected by Sarjit? Would it be like Bajrangi Bhaijaan? How the story writer will take the story further? First half of movie is full of comedy. Few in audience can be seen bursting into loud laughter on the punch lines. These must be those who understand Urdu words like 'Tashrif'. Second half should have been able to take the movie equally or higher level of comedy. Abhay Deol performance is good and natural. Overall it a time pass. There will not be a regret of wasting time and money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Road, movie with quite a bit of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps one of the best-written, and packaged comedies in recent times, this one, for me, might actually be slightly better than the producer's previous comedies, Tanu weds Manu (TwM) 1 and 2.I was a little nervous going in, having reduced my expectations only to Abhay Deol's return after a hiatus of sorts.Penty was alright in 'Cocktail', but her comeback thru this was kinda muted, and the trailers also did not do any justice to what the movie was gonna be about. Well, overall, for me, this one was a pleasant surprise, and there are 3 absolutely-fantastic (purely contextual) sequences that are worth the price of your tickets, in spite of the other cliché-ridden plot points / plot turns. SPOILER-Alert on those 3: 1 has something to do with a para(n)tha, the 2nd has to do with Madhubala (non-comic, subtle dramatics for those paying attn) and the 3rd one has something to do with aadhey-idhar-jaao-aadhey-udhar- jaao (to the uninitiated, that immortal Asrani sequence from 'Sholay')....However, it has to be said that the climax/resolution is something that, quite possibly, will be considered out of place for a mainstream flick. The importance it attaches to who we think of as secondary characters (Ali Fazal and Momal Shaikh, the lady who plays Abhay Deol's fiancée) is refreshing, especially from a mainstream trope standpoint. Little things stood out, like the consistent refrain that one character's parent has to say all thru, and the way it loops back when another character says it, was simply too good to behold, and definitely is one of the best examples of how the writing paid attention to what is otherwise discarded as a detail too small to pay attention to. All supporting characters are fantastic, but special mention must be made of Javed Shaikh, Kanwaljit Singh (Buniyaad, Satte pe Satta, Rustom), Ayesha Raza, Piyush Mishra (who takes a cliché-ed role, and makes it his own, evoking the most guffaws all thru the flick - he's never been better, and I'd love to see him chew scenery the way he did in this one), the always-genial-and-can-turn-menacing-inamoment Manoj Bakshi. And I somehow feel that Ali Fazal's performance is gonna be overlooked, but kudos both to the casting, his characterization (courtesy both the writing and the execution) and his amazingly subtle/understated performance. he just disappears into his role, taking a character no one can root for, and makes us, yes, root for him (observe the para(n)tha sequence). Special mention must be made of Jimmy Sheirgill, who embraces his now-created-yet-thankless-type, from TwM1 and 2, and makes it his own, and still comes up with a fantastic performance (following his understated/underrated/under-appreciated work in 'Madaari' earlier this year) that is quite memorable, at least to those who look for finer nuances in similar characterizations, portrayed by the same actors. Not sure there has been something like this in the recent past. 'Zara si Dosti' was my pick among the numbers, especially due to its heartfelt lyrics. unfortunately, that was the only number that stood out, though the background score sounded better-than-average. Not sure how much of a hand he had in it, but Aanand Rai more than makes up, IMHO, for the disappointing ending that I thought he;d saddled TwM2 with, with a whopper of a choice towards the end in this one. Keeping it real is where it's at, for those who're paying attention. I'd definitely watch this once again on the big screen, at the next opportunity, and recommend the same for those who like their cinema to be smarter-than-average-yet-not-too-heavy. Great effort from the team.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a jovial movie with pangs of seriousness and sarcasms. Diana character in movie is similar to Kangana in Tanu weds Manu and hence was not veritable. Even the character of Jimmy is repeated in the movie from Tanu weds Manu. Despite of wanting of novelty, I will vindicate it from duplicacy because the script was new and refreshing. Tinge of romance and lots of chortle is what makes this movie a success.I loved the volubility and inexorable nature of Diana's character.Abhay Deol commemorates his character perfectly. Momal Shiek is new face and need to improve her acting skills greatly. I was intrigued by the song "Tera Tera" of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A Clumsy Comedy"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A young rebellious Punjabi girl, runs away from her arranged marriage to a local goon-politician in order to elope with her idle-musician boyfriend. However, matters go goofy and she ends up in an influential family's home, but, the one across the border in Pakistan."The backdrop of "Happy Bhag Jaayegi" is catchy enough; the film is however, short of just that.THE PLUSES ?Many connoisseurs may expect the film to be based on Hollywood's "Runaway Bride" (Julia Roberts, Richard Gere). Thankfully it isn't, also its a lot more "desi" as one could expect it to be.The film has an impressive ensemble ? Jimmy Shergill ("goon-groom"), Ali Fazal ("idle-lover"), Abhay Deol as ("Pakistani Governor's son"), Javed Sheikh as ("the Pakistani Governor"), Ayesha Raza as ("the Pakistani Aunt") and ever-strong and formidable - Piyush Mishra("the Pakistani Police Superintendent"); along with reintroducing the diminutive beauty of "Cocktail" - Diana Penty as the titular "Happy". Perhaps, many would simply throng to the theatres to watch her and they won't be proved wrong as she is indeed, better than before; likable even.Shergill is much like the Punjabi version of his "Tanu Weds Manu" character; though Fazal and Deol are not too fixating in their personas. What (rather "who") doesn't disappoint is the discovery of Momal Sheikh (portraying fiancé of Deol's character). Coincidentally, the real- life daughter of Javed Sheikh, she is the most genuinely emotive and impressive amongst cast-members.In addition, we find some heartily funny scenes - mostly involving Mishra, who is absolutely on-fire (hilariously) - and some guessable-yet-enjoyable plot-points involving lot of cross-border new and old folk-lore, and even some subtly matured relationship anecdotes ? a rarity.THE SHORTS ?The biggest shortcoming is the almost absolute lack of chemistry between the actors. Due to the reason, they are expressive enough but, never hold the interests for long. The plot-twists are almost unnecessary and seem like a stretch. As aforementioned ? good sequencing of plot-line with twists, however, never too engrossing. The direction (Mudassar Aziz, of the relatively unknown "Dulha Mil Gaya") attempts to go places but, in vain. The sound-track served is bland-ish, and doesn't help either to pull the film up.CONCLUSION ? Wish "Happy" was as happening as it sounded because it definitely was in its promos. Watch, only if you must. Passable as a 6.25/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After recently hearing about this film being banned in Pakistan and being a son of both Pakistani parents, I felt the need to write this review to make sure this film is watched by all.This film deserves great recognition for making a movie that has an unique and entertaining storyline across both India and Pakistan. The theatre I went to was packed with families and we are enjoyed this movie for showing a positive side to Pakistan and the friendship between both India and Pakistan. The acting was well played by their respective characters, the music was okay, and the scenery of Lahore was beautiful. I urge people to watch this film and take your families and elderly relatives because this is a feel- good movie by the time it's done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A small yet impactfull movie.. Yet another typically arranged marriage escaping movie but very well executed.A good story line, which I guess never been told before. A good Indo-Pak relation is proposed to be set in days to come in the history of both the countries. All actors have played their best of work. Jimmy has played as always a less spoken person but very very very amazingly talented and power-pack performance... Abhay also managed to justify his role very well.. Diana has very well tried but still lot of missing things were there in her performance, In-fact I am not convinced with the idea of casting Diana in this movie. A very dull performance given by LEAD actress.. Music is amazingly good.. Songs are too good.. In a way the movie is such a good that hides a poor performance of Diana.. All NINE stars are given by me is for movie except DIANA.. I think a squeal is needed for HAPPY BHAG JAYEGI, but not with DIANA PANTY... Good job DONE...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching the trailer,I was waiting to watch this movie.here is the review.Direction-Well directed movie ,Mudassar Aziz had given a well narration.Screenplay-The run time of the movie is not very long it's a odd of 125 mins.This short run time is good because if it would have been extended,it would have created a mess.this made the movie to be smooth and didn't have a scene that would divert the minds of the audience. Starcast-The star cast was good.all were up to the mark.this genre of movie had its matched star cast.Abhay deol is amazing, Jimmy Sheirgill is absolutely great.Diana Penty was good and her fluency in Hindi &amp; Punjabi was amazing.Piyush Mishra is a treat to watch,he is such a versatile actor.His role in the movie is something which no other actor would have suited to.He was fantastic, his dialogues were funny,hilarious sometimes.Other star cast were also good.Music-The music and all the songs are very good,especially the song "Aashiq tera" is simply awesome.background music is great. So music won't disappoint you.Overall-This movie gives laugh and also had a emotional touch.Yes,the direction And editing could have been more good,then it would have a better trade at the Box-office.But if you want something to have a combination of all then go for this movie.My rating 7/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>before going into the movie hall, I did not expect this movie to be good. To be very honest, I was dead against going to a movie which features none of the tier one stars. But in the first half only, I realized my mistake, that could have been worse, had I not come to see this.The movie is entirely meant for fun and nothing else. The people who are trying to find the underlying message of harmony between two neighboring countries, are plain stupid. This is meant for fun, to be more specific, a cross border fun and nothing else.The actors and actresses are not very good barring Piyush Mishra. Not even Abhay Deol could do cent percent justice to his role. Although, they were not all bad, but more was expected from them. Piyush Mishra was exceptional. his mere presence lit up the screen like no other. Jimmy Shergil also did good in his role. The main fun lies in this film in its dialogues. This part was amazing and often catches you cracking up into laughter, which is not very normal for average Bollywood so called "comedy" movies. The climax was not too loud and end where it should be, not going over the top. But this part may offend some audience for less excitement. But, all in all, the movie was an excellent watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No sign of Anand L Rai's magic even though he is the producer of this film. One-Time-Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is good to see Diana Penty return after her first film Cocktail, which was released in 2012. But honestly, her performance was bland and generically performed. She tried really hard to pull of a happy-go- lucky Punjabi girl but she just failed in the aspect of doing so. In my opinion, Jimmy Shergill just came on set to earn a quick buck. The dialogues in the movie were cheesy and it didn't make sense. If you like runaway wedding movies, then watch Julia Robert in Runaway Bride. The story has some minor similarities between these 2 films.I've been a big fan of Anand L. Rai ever since Tanu Weds Manu Returns. First time as a producer and he just didn't add the magic that he did for his previous films. Mudassir Aziz had very poor direction skills especially for this film. So that was a bit of a letdown.There are fair amount of positives in the film. 1) Music is the major highlight of the movie. Gabru to ready mingle hai and Zara se are my favorite 2 tracks and I have been listening to them on a loop. 2) Abhay Deol managed to give his best performance. He got on into his character really well as Bilal Ahmed. 3) Momal Sheikh was also the main highlight of the film. Javed Sheikh sure roped in someone great to play Zoya even though he was in the movie as well. She managed to stay in the comfort zone that she needed to be in.The movie did make me laugh during some parts of the movie. Overall, this movie is just above an average movie which poor direction and lack of comedy. This movie is surely a one-time watch with depth which lacked quite a lot.Anand L. Rai, try again.6/10Watch Rustom if you hadn't go the chance to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are always few films for whom you wait for a long time but once they are released, it is the sheer disappointment that comes in your share. "Happy Bhaag Jayegi" is a testimonial to this fact and the net result is utter disappointment. I waited for this movie due to 2 reasons i.e. Abhay Deol and Diana Penty but credit goes to Mudassir Aziz for spoiling the show. How cheaply, both actors have been wasted in this "Dabba" movie. The film is a total crap from head to toe with out a single aspect that gives you entertainment or even a bit of it. Pathetic story, loose screenplay, irrational sequences, unimpressive cinematography and third rated direction makes it a perfect super flop movie. Especially the people of Lahore (Pakistan) have been portrayed in a manner that is totally rubbish and wrong. I wanna let the Bollywood directors know that we the people of Lahore neither talk like this nor we dress like that. Kuch tou homework ker liya karo yaar before making your own people fools. In a nutshell, a total crap, flop and money wastage movie. I do not recommend this movie under any circumstances and even if you don't have a choice, download it from torrent or other sites rather than going to cinema to watch such a crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neither interesting nor fun....A very choppy flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer I felt this will be a good comedy film. After a long time, Diana Penty has done a film and the rest of the cast is also interesting. Zimmy Shergil and Abhay Deol are the very good actor and the most important thing is this movie is produced by Anand L Rai. The trailer is very good and it looked promising for many angels. But if you ask me about the film, I will tell you that this is not a fair choice.The story is about a girl (Diana Penty) unintentionally crosses borders of India and goes into Pakistan. There is also a wedding drama, unintentionally visit the next hero's house (which in Pakistan) and then the rest of the story is how the girl falls in love with his appropriate choice and it doesn't matter where the girl is. The story looks promising and the cast is very good. But the main problem is the way the director developed the story. The pace of the movie is very slow and background score set very poorly. You will not match the background sound with each turning scene. The character development is very unusual and you will not remember even the name of the characters. Music is not up to the mark and editing is very lazy. The lead cast is the very good actor but the script actually gives them nothing to do any acting. There are lots of opportunities to execute the humor and the suspense of a fugitive woman but poorly written script ruined all the hopes. Don't waste your money or time either. Just avoid this flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half cooked characters spoiled the fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Direction of this film is not appropriate. Writing is better than direction. Both credit go to director Mr. Mudassar Aziz. Story is fictitious. Screenplay trembles between real and reel. Dialogues are witty, especially satire and Urdu versus Hindi ones. Like when Police officer says in light way that he doesn't want to go India because he doesn't want to eat Indian salt then Bilal says that Pakistan imports salt from India. Even few scenes are conceived just to incorporate dialogues, like the climax scene just for 'Happy has Pati and Bagga has sympathy' which is too much and absolutely doesn't go with the film mood. I was damn excited for this film after watching the trailer but got disappointed. Hats off to trailer cutting and conceiving team. Characterization is taken for granted. A girl decides to run away for his lover but when love is not well established you think that girl is idiot rather than brave. Guddu character is so lame that he looks non deserving for Happy. Another couple Bilal and Joya neither look good together on screen neither their emotional bonding is well established. Bilal suddenly goes out of the way for Happy even he is established as a father fearing son, yes in a dialogue it is conveyed that he regrets his decision of not running out of his house to pursue his cricket passion, which is just established by watching him cricket and playing street cricket with kids in India after sneaking out from an important meeting in front of father and being clean bold, when kid comes to know that he is Pakistani!? After a point even Bilal starts loving Happy then he realizes that she doesn't love him, that was very obvious from beginning then what for this love triangle? Reason behind Bagga obsession with Happy is also taken for granted. There is a single emotional scene of Happy, missing her father and realizing his love for her but in another scene at airport, she behaves like he is stranger? Doesn't request to come with her or even ask that how will you come? Simple story is unnecessarily twisted with kidnapping, suicide bombing like sub plots. Why did Bilal want to Happy got married with Guddu in Pakistan, was it only solution or very easy or acceptable in India, even in a group Nikah celebration? It was just for add drama but it falls flat. Film starts with high note of a bride running out from her marriage. It was very challenging to maintain that graph and pace and clearly they loose it. This film was inspired by 'Tanu weds Manu' but in the way that no one can notice it. Background score is so lame. Performance wise Diana Penty as Happy is damn impressive, she portrays complex emotions like innocence, arrogance and emotion with ease. Abhay Deol as Bilal is good. Ali Zafar as Guddu and Jimmy Shergil as Bagga are OK. Piyush Mishra as Usman Afridi, Police officer, is fantastic, his expression and body language do make you laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let Her Go. &#x2666; Grade D-</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one thing that Bollywood feel-good films succeed in achieving, then it is that they induce a calming effect on our otherwise stressful lives. While producer Anand Rai has been creating formulaic romance dramas with a blanket cover of feel-good-ness, the feature seems to have terribly dwindled this time around.Happy (Penty) is an oversmart and fearless bride-to-be who participates in her boyfriend Guddu's (Fazal) elopement plan on the eve of her wedding day and, although logistically unworkable, ends up in Pakistan at a former governor's mansion located in Lahore, where also lives the babu's son, Bilal (Deol). Awfully played by Penty, Happy sports a single expression throughout the film and is unaffected by the fact that she is an another country without even her passport or that she is currently locked up for threatening an all-forgiving cop. While the comic theme may allow these sequences to be perceived as humorous, none of them ignite any kind of authenticity. From the beginning, the plot weaves together impractical elements all in an attempt to create humor, which is not even funny. Happy could have just called one of her friends, or even better, asked her new friend Bilal, an influential politician, to send her back to her country and we would not have to sit through these 2 hours of unfunny charade where Jimmy Shergill has to portray a character who suffers from bridelessness for the umpteenth time.It is evident even before the second half that Mudassar Aziz has run out of ideas. He uses story arcs and character development sequences to make up for the plot's hollow structure, but fails terribly as the film successfully slides into the black abyss of ridiculousness and mindlessness. Even if you adore Abhay Deol for his past performances, this film will affect it because clearly it sought the help of a thespian like Kanwaljit Singh and forced him to portray a character whose only task is to fool around and fire bullets in the air. Towards the end, moreover, the film just gets annoying. Being unfunny is one thing, but being ridiculous and ire-generating - well, that's not what you expect from a film, even of low standards. Fazal and Piyush Mishra are fine, but Penty definitely needs to brush up on acting. Newcomer Momal Sheikh knows how to make a scornful face.Other than some hazy references to India-Pakistan's decades-long rivalry and the brilliant poster designs, this romantic comedy has neither enough romance nor comedy to help it from dissolving in its own puke.BOTTOM LINE: Mudassar Aziz's Happy Bhag Jayegi is a reminder of how bad his previous films are which will soon be forgotten just like his previous ones have been. Wait for TV premiere.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES</fullReview>
