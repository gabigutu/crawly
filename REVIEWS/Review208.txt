		<shortDescription>Very touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think the plot summary of this is anything truly original or unpredictable, but boy do the writers do it really well. They do a fine job of developing the central characters and do a good job of making us empathetic towards everyone, which is always important for a film like this. You have to find a certain balance where your characters' flaws come shining through very noticeably, but where their redeeming qualities also become more noticeable as the film goes on. In this case they do. The entire cast is quite strong, with Page, Janney, and Blanchard giving some really powerful work here. It's great to see them working at this capacity and all should receive at least some attention come awards season.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ellen Page is excellent as the homeless young woman who kidnaps a baby.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much advertised and anticipated Netflix Original movie, it came available just yesterday.Set mostly in New York after she gets there, Ellen Page is Tallulah, and she usually just goes by Lu. We eventually learn that she had a difficult childhood which resulted in her not trusting others. She lives in her ratty van and cons or steals money and food to subsist. Or gets "leftovers" out of garbage cans. When her boyfriend starts talking about "love" and "marriage" and "having kids" she withdraws, tells him he can just leave if he doesn't like her position. He leaves during the night.Lu ends up in New York. We learn later through flashbacks that she had met her boyfriend two years earlier in Manhattan and she knew where his mother, an author and professor, lives. She also knows that you can usually find a decent breakfast in the hallway outside hotel rooms, from room service leftovers. There she is surprised by a half-dressed woman who needs to go somewhere, is obviously half drunk, and has a toddler with her. She mistakes Lou for housecleaning and asks her to come in, eventually giving her some money to help her dress and to watch the baby.All this eventually leads Lu to taking the baby, the mother obviously isn't fit to care for her, Lu is sympathetic, considering she had been abandoned, and she also sees it as a way to keep herself whole. She takes the baby to her boyfriend's mom's condo and tells her the baby is her granddaughter. Allison Janney is really good as the grandmother, Margo. But she has carved out her own space since her son just up and left two years earlier and wasn't in the mood to have a 20- something plus a baby stay with her.All of this creates a number of sticky and mostly humorous situations. Lu and Margo each has the effect of changing the other. Is it a comedy or a drama? I'd say a good dose of both, real life is that way isn't it? Of course all this can't last forever, the distraught mom wants her baby back, the cops get involved. Lou has to grow up and figure out a new path through life. None of the issues are resolved by the end. Viewers are able to imagine how everything will be resolved.My wife and I enjoyed the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always been scarce to rate a movie 10/10. However I can not describe how truly deserved that number is. I stumbled upon this movie very casually and came out devastated, touched and changed quite honestly. Now this may seem extreme (and I share the passion of mocking others that take reviews to the next level), but this movie contains everything I love about movies and does so with ease. Let me start with Ellen Page. Wow. Ellen has always performed magnificently, but this movie in my humble opinion has defined her as an actress. Allison Jenny, destroyed my heart and plunged me into the character (Margo) that she took on so elegantly. Never before have I screamed, cried and laughed in a single scene, at the computer, then I did in a certain scene in 'Tallulah', thanks to Allison. I would seriously encourage any movie lover anywhere (since it seriously is a movie for all), to watch this movie if they are in the mood to smile, laugh and cry. 'Tallulah' is a masterpiece and I would define it as an experience. An experience none should live without.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully made movie. Almost perfect!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WOW! After a long time I saw a movie where I couldn't take my eyes or ears off a single frame.The story as such isn't anything new. Each character is something we've seen before. The magic of this movie is in the way the story is told. The dialog, the characters, the acting, the pauses, and the music all comes together in just the right amount of drama, never going overboard in this highly emotional story.It has brilliantly portrayed and written flawed characters. Ellen Page is simply phenomenal as Tallulah, a young woman living on the fringe with a golden heart but a messed up mind. Allison Janney as the scorned, sad, bitter wife also with a kind heart makes you feel for her. Tammy Blanchard as an unworthy mother, and a extremely flawed woman, yet with a good heart underneath manages to make you sympathetic towards her despite her apparently unforgivable flaws.Oh and how I LOVE Uzo Aduba! She steals her scenes in a small part. She's simply amazing.I also loved the end. It wasn't all hunky dory yet each character finds something worth fighting for and worth living for, despite their hopelessness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully Done Movie That Will Stir Your Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The actors bring these characters to life and you remarkably wind up falling in love with all of them. They became people for me and I will probably think about them for days. I would like to give a special nod to Allison Janney, whom I remember fondly from her "West Wing" days. She is an actress to be treasured. I love seeing real women having real, complex feelings. Her presence in this movie is a gift. Without rehashing the plot summary, I will simply say that "Tallulah," is an incredibly well written, acted, and directed story about love and connection that I had the pleasure of immersing myself in this afternoon. Not many movies do that for me these days. That is why, after years of using IMDb, before there was such a thing as "an app for that," I have been inspired to write my first ever review here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was stunned by how beautiful this movie was. I didn't really expect this much, and seeing a weak IMDb score made me want to review this film. All women should watch this film. It disregards all standard stereotypes we have about mothers, middle aged women and how we relate to each other. Some reviewers talk about it being predictable, Id say its the opposite. Aside from the general outline of events in the film, no valuable aspect is predictable. Although I cannot speak for the male audience, I am worried it plays too much on female emotions and values to be able to be a hit for both genders. But I might be wrong. It contains Oscar worthy performances and its screenplay is brilliant in itself. It reminded me a lot of the feeling I got stuck with after watching American Beauty.That feeling is still there though. Don't know about this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'TALLULAH': Four Stars (Out of Five)A Netflix original drama flick; about a homeless girl, that kidnaps the baby of a neglectful mother, and then bonds with the mother of her ex-boyfriend, who she turns to for help. The film stars Ellen Page, Allison Janney, Tammy Blanchard and Evan Jonigkeit (it also features a cameo by Zachary Quinto). The movie was written and directed by first time feature filmmaker Sian Heder (a veteran writer of the popular TV series 'ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK'). The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and Netflix viewers alike. I enjoyed it a lot more than I first thought I would.Tallulah (Page) and her boyfriend, Nico (Jonigkeit), have been traveling, and living in their van, for years. When Nico suddenly leaves one day, and takes the couple's money with him, Tallulah goes to Nico's mother, Margo (Janney), for help. When Margo wants nothing to do with her, Tallulah begins searching a nearby hotel for food (and money). That's when a partying mother (Blanchard) hires Tallulah to babysit her young child. When the neglectful mom returns home wasted, and passes out after cursing at the child, Tallulah decides to take the baby. She turns to Margo for help, telling her it's Nico's child. The two reluctantly bond.The film's story seems odd, and I had doubts it would be that interesting (especially after first starting the movie), but it actually turns out to be a pretty involving film. Page and Janney are both excellent in the leads, especially Page, and the characters are both extremely flawed but likable. Heder also seems to be a pretty awesome new filmmaker to watch out for; who seems to do a great job of writing women roles. After this, I'll definitely check out her next movie.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/- KJTB5KGois</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doing the wrong thing for the right reasons.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ellen Page gives a solid performance as a young woman who lives on the road and doesn't follow the standard rules of living. When looking for food in a Hotel hallway she is dragged into a room by an emotionally unstable mother. While the mother goes on a date, Lu is forced to babysit the child. After realizing the mother is not fit to take care of the child she decides to take the child with her and visit her (ex) boyfriends mother, who had just divorced and is forcefully holding on to all that she had in her marriage. This is the moment the story really takes off, because the two are such opposites they struggle to build their relationship in the beginning but after a while they realize they both need some help getting along, and they realize they can learn from each other. The best thing about this story is the chemistry between Lu and Margo, it teaches us it is alright to be vulnerable and make mistakes. Even though the story is not that original it is the good acting and tasteful way of telling that makes this worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tallulah has no soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tallulah is a slow burner movie, I mean really really slow. I almost went to sleep in the first five minutes and I wish I did go to sleep after finishing it. The main actors are all dead pan actors and fail to convey any emotion. The plot is very predictable and the dialogue is weak and boring. The conversations are awkward and unrealistic and you'll hate all the characters in the movie because this movie wants you to hate them. I mean really the point of a movie is to go in and watch it to be entertained, have fun or be emotionally moved. This movie didn't reach any expectation I had for it. You are better off going to watch Juno if you want to watch a better movie than Tallulah. Tallulah has no soul and the characters have no soul. It's the worst movie I've seen in 2016.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trying to make sense out of a senseless life...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ellen Page is excellent as a homeless young woman, cynical, hard-bitten and foul-mouthed, who abducts a toddler from its rich, neglectful mother and makes friends with her ex-boyfriend's estranged mother--under the guise that she's a single mom raising this woman's granddaughter all on her own. A hard movie to like, but also a movie impossible to dismiss, "Tallulah" is an impressive production purchased by Netflix that has many things to recommend it, not the least of which is an array of fabulous performances from the ladies in the cast. Unfortunately, filmmaker Sian Heder is a much better director than she is a writer, and the relationship between Tallulah and her boyfriend--a crucial element in the story--is not convincing (the problem is with his character, who simply does not ring true). Page is reunited with her "Juno" co-star Allison Janney, and the two have a special rapport that is, by turns, angry and bitter and lovely and moving. However, the arc of Janney's character isn't as profound as its meant to be (for instance, she's terrible and nasty to her soon-to-be-ex husband, who left her for another man), and the last portion of the plot is gummy and indecisive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. The story is gripping, the characters interesting with authentic intensity. Slowly and with a fine tuning people are brought together who ultimately all have the same issue: Lack of Love. The story shows what happens to us when Love is missing, what crazy behavior can result from this and how desperately insecure we are wondering around in this world then. The emotions like disappointment, resentment, hurt and anger are very well displayed without disturbing the viewer too much. Also the small parts, like the scenes between Margo and the doorman, are precious. It shows that Love is in every corner of this world, we don't have to go to big lengths to find Love. It is everywhere. Just our wounds and hurt from the past blinds us to see it. Wonderful acting, heartwarming and at times also a funny. Really worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One nice thing up front: this movie gets how New York City works when it comes to giving tickets (though I don't know if it would've gotten a 'boot', more likely it would've been towed, but I digress).Tallulah is a prototypical example of an independent film that features two very well known actors (at least to some, I'd think Ellen Page is and Allison Janey may be hit or miss for some, still, even after all these years), and *feels* like a first time Sundance-festival-bound indie film. But it's not necessarily a negative, or something to be wary of, in the case of this story. A lot of that does come down to the actors, and (mostly) realistic reactions to how the story goes into one 'oh s***' moment after another and, again, it comes down to the choices the characters make which can be desperate, foolish, but also for their own good in a way.Tallulah is wandering from place to place being basically if Juno several years later was a hobo and lost a lot of the snappy dialog (Page in slightly similar attire, though grungier, more "street" to give it obnoxious quotes). Her man friend Nico runs off on her for some reason or another (he wants to go home to his mom, she doesn't want to do that, and during the night he splits - oh, and why he split in the first place is and isn't clear). So she finds his mother's apartment in New York city, she rejects him, and the she ambles about into the Waldwick hotel where she stumbles upon a drunken socialite-dilettante (Tammy Blanchard in a performance that may be overlooked but she gives this blonde dummie a lot more depth than you'd expect, some of that's in the writing). She has a baby, and Tallulah is tasked to take care of her while she's out for the day, thinking she's a housekeeper. Later this blonde lady stumbles drunk into bed, Tallulah feels wrong about leaving a crying baby all alone and kidnaps her.Good premise and a strong beginning to a story that doesn't give us a protagonist who is necessarily 'likeable' or 'sympathetic' just because we're told to like her. She's complicated, she's lost, she explains later on in the story briefly and just enough so that her faults go back to a place of abandonment (she does turn to Nico's mother, Allison Janey, for help, and she reluctantly agrees making the spine of the movie). What I liked is that the story gives some things to explain motivations for stuff - why Janey's character Margo can't let go of her past relationship which ended in betrayal (oddly enough Janey once again being the 'beard' to a gay man in a marriage like on Masters of Sex) and why Tallulah can't stay still for very long - but the actors are given a lot of room to play with, to find the characters on screen so that we can also relate to them well enough. So when something "quirky" like Tallulah pulling down all of Margo's ex's paintings off the wall to 're-paint' at first seems to turn out badly and then becomes a bonding scene, it works because we can believe these people in it.In other words, this is a movie that has some light crime-elements to it with the kidnapped baby, maybe in its way a hybrid of a New York intellectual comedy-drama and a slight, a little bit, of neo-noir, and it mostly works if you like Page and Janey (oh and some nice character people like Zachary Quinto as the 'new' guy for Margo's ex, David Zayas and Orange is the New Black's Aduba pop up and the latter even gets some good character motivation, nicely done writer-director Heder). It also has that, um, slightly odd touches that at first are acceptable and then pop up at the very end: floating in a dream can work once, but twice, I'm not so sure. And there are certain story contrivances that do come up, mostly in the last third or act or whatever, and it does make you realize this story's coming to a wrap-up in some ways that do and don't make sense.But for all of these misgivings Tallulah does function as a quality dramatic film with a few light touches about what it means to have a lack of options or resolve, to really be caught up in existential dilemmas that matter, whether it's having a baby that's not yours to become close with or to let go of a marriage that didn't work when YOU are a writer about marriage (yeah, that's here as a thing). If you asked what I thought I'd say 'I liked it, it has heart, and... that's about it, and it's enough.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tallulah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ellen Page, Allison Janney and a baby with an uncertain future. Am I talking about a sequel of Juno? Of course not; Tallulah is a more conventional drama, even though it deals with similar themes of maternity, personal responsibility and the importance of the "foster family" who doesn't need to share genes in order to bring the support and patience which can't always be offered by biological families. Besides, Tallulah hides some controversial aspects, as well as difficult questions which society might not be ready to answer. That ambiguous stance is causing some negative reactions, but I feel they are more based on the ideology of the film than on its intrinsic values (something which also happened to Juno, by the way). But, well... leaving that aside, I will limit myself to describe the multiple pros of Tallulah, starting by the solid screenplay, which tells a story that is simple in shape, but complex in its emotional ups and downs. And, with the help of the excellent performances from Page and Janney, two conflicting, but not necessarily opposite, points of view are developed. Let's say that their characters share good intentions, despite their methods being very different. That might be the key element of Tallulah: there are grey areas in life which aren't solved with logic, but emotions... something which will not be always compatible with the rules of society. I guess that, in these case, some sentimental scenes are needed, so I won't call them "manipulative", but honest and consistent with the humanity of the characters. Ugh; it's difficult to review such personal dramas when one has a heart of stone. Speaking of which, I liked the visual metaphors employed by director and screenwriter Sian Heder to condense the final message of Tallulah; I found them a bit excessive on the beginning, but the dramatic reward was satisfactory, while eloquently expressing the evolution of the characters. I wouldn't consider Tallulah a great film, but I found it quite a solid drama which is superior to many more expensive and prestigious Hollywood movies belonging to the same genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Tallulah first knocked on Margo's door looking for her boyfriend,Margo's son, who she had not scene in 2 years, because he could not stand the pressure of his parents failing marriage, she was not as acceptable to what looked like a homeless person standing in front of her. Than Margo gets the divorce papers, she still has not seen her son, and piling on to her downward spiral, her turtle dies, So when Tallulah knocks on the door again, this time with a baby she kidnapped from a Beverly Hills housewife, and she's passing off as the kid she had with Margo's son, Margo acts reluctant at first, but after everyone she cares about leaving her, she could not help but to give Tallulah shelter.Tallulah is a good role for Ellen Page, she drove this vehicle into an excellent performance. The movie opens with a love scene between Page and the actor playing her boyfriend, and she does a nude seen for it. At that moment you realized that Ellen Page was all in and was going to give everything she got to being Tallulah and you can feel that throughout the film. She interacted with other cast members well. I especially love the moments between Tallulah and the baby.Tammy Blanchard gave a great performance too as a mother who let some first world problems get in the way of parenting her child. The point was driven home by some great performances by Uzo Aduba(Crazy Eyes from Orange is the New Black) who plays a child service agent, that you would think be more sympathetic towards a woman whose child was kidnapped being she is a mother of two and is pregnant, but she sees a woman thinking only of herself. It does not help that the lead investigator looking for her child (played by David Zayas, who I loved in Dexter) Kinda feels the same way.Allison Janney handles her performance greatly as well. She seems like a stuck up snob at first the way she talks to people like her doorman, who only once to be (more than) nice to her, but as her story unravels you can see the wall she's putting up come down and you make that connection.The narration is near perfect, as everything is set up flawlessly, making the story very fluid. Nothing ever slows down and takes away from the purpose of the movie.Great cast executing a great film to watch. Good one, Netflix!http://cinemagardens.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Allison Janney and Ellen Page (who collaborated previously in both "Juno" and "Touchy Feely") re-team up for this indie flick picked up by Netflix this past year, and it's a winner. I was looking at the origin of this screenplay, and the director/writer said they were inspired by their experiences working as a babysitter for Hollywood-type women who probably should never have become a mother in the first place, and at one point she actually left thinking she should've taken the kid with her. This movie has a slow start, but once it gets going, you really find yourself bonding with the characters. And Zachary Quinto ("Spock" from the "Star Trek" reboots) had a small part; I'm like, huh, that's IT-?? LOL</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did anybody notice the similarities between the two films Gimmie Shelter and Tallulah? Obviously we had to separate story lines but to strikingly similar main characters. I won't spend the time getting into the plot, it is surely worth anybody's time to give this flick a look. A few elements stood out to me. Page's character was fairly well developed as was Allison Janney. Briefly, Janney and Page compliment each other perfectly as they both share a similar conflict-that being their inability to cope with their own loneliness. Tammy Blanchard had an absolutely disgraceful part in the film, and the writers wanted to bring some degree of sympathy to the audience because she was with a deadbeat husband and an alcoholic who later 'feels guilty' about her daughter going missing. Other than those few things, the movie was descent, not too melancholy, but was a good attempt at a comeback for the Juno girl.</fullReview>
