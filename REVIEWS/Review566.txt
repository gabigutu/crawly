		<shortDescription>Visually stunning, but without substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a way, this film is a perfect example of form following function. What better way to show how empty and perverse the model scene in Los Angeles is, than to make an empty and perverse movie about it? If Nicolas Winding Refn wanted to make this point, he has made it loud and clear.But the question is: did he really want to make this point? Or did he just want to take his cinematographic capabilities one step further, by taking the visual aesthetics to the limit, without bothering about the rest? 'The Neon Demon' is visually stunning, but lacks substance. The story about a 16 year old model being literally devoured by the fashion industry, is nothing more than a vehicle for the visual exuberance of the film. It is like a 'Vogue' magazine: there are many pages, but they are all filled with glamorous pictures, and very little text. You can browse through it, but it doesn't have a message, other than an endless display of beauty.To accentuate the perversion of it all, Winding Refn had added some horror elements, which almost seem ridiculous, especially at the end of the film. There's also an irritating and very prominent soundtrack. The acting is mostly unnatural and pretentious. But if you like browsing the latest edition of Vogue magazine, perhaps this is the film for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A neon lit parable of big city poison.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicolas Winding-Refn is a director who defies all analysis. Most considered him a surefire "Commercial Success" following on from his exceptional adaptation, Drive back in 2011. However, against all odds Winding-Refn went darker, more subversive and all together more polarising with his 2013 release Only God Forgives.The Neon Demon is sure to be equally divisive. I was lucky enough to attend the red carpet premiere of the film in Cannes and was personally blown away by it's unique style &amp; vision. It's long slider shots demand attention and draw attention to every minute detail on offer. It's use of mirrors encourages the viewer to look beyond the "real" world and examine what lies on the other side.Obviously, it goes without saying that this film looks amazing. If nothing else, most of Winding-Refn's supporters or critiques will admit that his films aesthetics are always incredible. However, despite the muted dialogues and slow pacing, the film gripped me for its full 110 minute run time. This was because, although the movie is a "horror", it's so much more. It's an examination of the human obsession with beauty.Elle Fanning does a remarkable turn as Jesse - a young runaway, trying to make it big in Los Angeles. Her beauty is so powerful that things begin to work to her favour almost immediately on her arrival. More over than that, her beauty seems to encapsulate and draw in those around her, while repelling her peers who scathe her. Her natural beauty is something that all the plastic surgery in LA can't generate.Jena Malone steals the film as Ruby - a make up artist who befriends Jesse as soon as she arrives in the town. She also introduces Jesse to the vacuous and vindictive pair of models played by Bella Heathcote and Abbey Lee. If you haven't guessed already this is a film with a real focus on females. Although there are a handful of male characters (Dexters Desmon Harrington does an incredible turn as a high power fashion photographer), the focus here is all feminine. Even down to the decision to bring in a female DOP to shoot the film.There are too many twists and turns to get into here, but all I can say is that this could be Winding-Refn's most powerful movie to date. It's an analysis on the human condition and our obsession with natural beauty. It claws and scratches at our preconceptions and breaks us down, revealing the gooey centre; what makes us tick. Stellar performances, amazing visuals, a banging score and a unique storyline will cement this as a cult classic - of this I am sure.I cannot wait for the theatrical release if only to have more time to soak in the films dreamy visuals, take in more of the films subtexts and once again be blown away by the force of nature that is NWR.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wouldn't really recommend The Neon Demon unconditionally to my friends; not because it's a bad film (quite the opposite) but because it's the kind of movie that would inevitably lead some of them to think "he told me to watch it and said it was great. What kind of freak could possibly like that kind of stuff?"To call it "not for all tastes" is the understatement of the year, since the majority of audiences probably won't really appreciate its very droll mix of violence, cannibalism, dark comedy, necrophilia and fetishism. In fact, I will be very surprised if there isn't any condemnation or manifestation of outrage from groups or individuals arguing that it's yet another shallow male-directed film that objectifies, stereotypes and vilifies women. I'd also be willing to bet that Nicolas Winding Refn, who, like his fellow countryman Lars Von Trier, has a reputation for being a provocateur par excellence, had exactly this type of reaction in mind when he made it. There is a semi-gratuitous maybe-it's-a-dream sequence where a female character is forced to fellate a knife blade that seems designed precisely to elicit that sort of response.Deliberate excesses aside, The Neon Demon is possibly Nicolas Winding Refn's most straightforward narrative in a while (certainly more linear than Only God Forgives or Bronson). The film follows Jesse (Elle Fanning), a 16-year-old ingenue who moves to L.A. (or, to be exact, to a seedy motel in Pasadena, run by a sleazy and sinister manager played by a cast-against-type Keanu Reeves) hoping to become a model. Her na?veté and awkwardness notwithstanding, she first catches the eye of a powerful model agency head (Christina Hendrickson), then an influential photographer (Desmond Harrington) and finally a big fashion designer (Alessandro Nivola) who casts her as the centerpiece of his new show, much to the chagrin of established models Sarah (Abby Lee) and Gigi (Bella Heathcote), who don't take kindly to being laid by the wayside to make room for a fresh new face. She is also befriended by Ruby (Jena Malone), a seemingly well- meaning fashion make-up artist who moonlights at the local mortuary by applying her skills to make cadavers more presentable, and by an impossibly nice young man named Dean (Karl Glusman) who would like to be Jesse's boyfriend and protector. This being a horror film, at least on the surface, things starts to get weird for Jesse when her new friend and rivals decide to do something about her rapid ascent to the rank of top model. To say more would stray into spoiler territory, so I'll stop here.Like Quentin Tarantino, Nicolas Winding Refn is a master regurgitator of old genre films. "Drive" was the bastard son of Michael Mann's "Thief" and Walter Hill's "Driver", with a few other ingredients tossed in for good measure (the film also owed a huge debt to Jean-Pierre Melville's "Le Samourai"). "The Neon Demon" is his love song to Dario Argento (in particular "Suspiria", which is visually and thematically referenced multiple times) and to countless Euro-thrillers from the seventies, starting with the fantastic but little-seen (in the USA) Belgian lesbian vampire/Countess Bathory retelling "Daughters of Darkness".Punctuated by a great electronic score by Cliff Martinez (which sounds like the best soundtrack that Goblin never wrote in the last 20 years), The Neon Demon is a visual feast that makes the neon- drenched "Drive" and "Only God Forgives" look almost drab by comparison. This is a gorgeous-looking film, set in beautiful locations, with a cast to match.The women are all impossibly beautiful and incredibly shallow and repellent at the same time: they look and move like poisonous snakes whose skin you would really like to reach out and caress, knowing full well that you are likely to receive a painful bite. Male characters on the other hand are almost uniformly visually unpleasant and slimy or feral-looking (Desmond Harrington's photographer in particular looks gaunt and menacing like a wolf circling a wounded animal). Only Dean, the prospective boyfriend, seems like a good, decent human being, but this is a movie that seems hell-bent on confirming the old adage that "nice guys finish last".Elle Fanning is good, especially at the beginning of the film where she is required to look shy and insecure -- in fact there are no weaklings in the whole cast. But the film belongs to Jena Malone, whose character undergoes the most startling transformation as the story progresses. Her performance is truly daring and committed and easily the most memorable in a film filled with weird and eye- catching characters. When you see the film, you'll know what I'm talking about.Although The Neon Demon is ostensibly a horror film, underneath all the scary movie trappings lies a very black (and bleak) comedy about a superficial world where appearances are everything and the only way to survive is to embrace (quite literally) a dog-eat-dog attitude. It's most definitely not a movie for everyone (and the only film in recent memory where a scene involving an act of lesbian necrophilia doesn't feel gratuitous and out of place), but it's the product of a talented director who has completed a metamorphosis, which began with Bronson (2009), from "simple" genre filmmaker into full- blown auteur, with a personal and distinctive visual and narrative style. If you are at all interested in cinema beyond regular multiplex fare, it's definitely worth investing 2 hours of your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utter drivel and, what's worse, boring drivel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film starts promisingly with an eye-catching and unsettling image: then the first dialogue (or should I say "direlogue"?) scene starts, and two things happen. One, the dialogue is awful. Two, the instruction in Acting 101 "Make the most of your pauses" has been translated here into "Leave 5 seconds silence before replying to anything which has been said." The self-consciously clever-dick direction, at its worst, leads to an interminable sequence which is supposed to represent a catwalk show in which nothing happens (and it doesn't happen repetitively, too) for what seems to be half a day. Refn thinks he is being clever in his direction: he isn't.The first 80% of the story is trite and obvious: the final sequence is ludicrous. Refn again. Perhaps it's supposed to be a metaphor or some sort of metaphysical commentary. It's still ludicrous.Lesbian necrophilia and cannibalism? I was too busy being bemused (when I wasn't being bored) to be outraged.If I had been even slightly engaged, I would have been left with a bagful of unanswered questions afterwards. As it was, I didn't care enough to be bothered, although I will chuck one out, just for fun - what was the point of the mountain lion in the motel room? What did that add to the narrative? As expected, the Refn Fan Club is full of the usual "If You Didn't Understand This Parable Of Modern Existentialism It's Because You're Too Thick" nonsense, to which I reply Emperor's New Clothes.If you don't see just one film this year, please make it this one.It's a stinker. And a boring, tedious stinker at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst movie I have ever seen, by far - SPOILER ALERT (for a film that is already spoiled)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the movie Drive. This is not Drive. Here's why:1. This movie is visually very weak. Don't get me wrong, I understand this aesthetic. But that is because it is totally played out. I heard NWR say that he got the idea for Only God Forgives from the mental image of a clenched fist. I would say for this one he got the idea from old Maybelline commercials, the 2006 Daft Punk alive tour and some old Mert &amp; Marcus editorials. It looks cheap, dated and badly executed. The soundtrack is the same. It worked for Drive because that electro revival of Moroder in 2001 is the perfect driving music, but now it just feels tacky. Save your money and just walk into any Sephora store.2. This movie is not "crazy" or "dark". Every "surreal" moment is predictable and cliché. Watch Un Chien Andalou and then got to Burning Man festival and you'll have all the inspiration you will need for a sequel. Claire Denis' Trouble Every Day makes use of the same clichés but the difference is that NWR thinks he is the first one to think of them. 3. This movie is not a "critique". This doesn't reveal the truth of anything except a made- up idea of the fashion world. Who told NWR that modeling make-up always involves putting a bunch of junk on the girls faces? Who told him that the center of the modeling world is LA and not New York? That Elle Fanning, who is short and pudgy, is somehow meant to be believable as a more desirable model than Abbey Lee Kershaw? If she is so good why does the camera cut away every time she is meant to strike a pose or walk a catwalk? Abbey Lee says at one point that by the time you are 20 your past your expiry date. She is 29 and had a major Calvin Klein campaign earlier this year. 4. The story sucks (because NWR "wrote" it, unlike Drive). The story is basically Black Swan. Think pseudo-lesbian jealousy corrupting a young hopeful in a competitive industry. But then add a few dozen plot holes. This girl is the modeling worlds' new It Girl and yet she can't afford a motel that isn't rape-infested? Or ever go to a hospital? You can successfully bury a girl in a six inch grave in a perfectly manicured garden in a house that isn't yours? And why are there only about 6 people in the whole movie? Parties, nightclub toilets, restaurants photo shoots and the backstage of runway shows usually have dozens of people around, not three. Especially not the same three every time.The acting is pretty lousy but who cares at this point. I'm sure most fans will think that dislike for this film comes from its dark, confronting, disturbing portrayal of our superficial society. It doesn't. It comes from wanting to watch something other than an old loser jerk himself off for 2 hours to a 2001 copy of Vogue magazine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't watch this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have enjoyed most of the Nicolas Winding Refn films I've seen. I love both Bronson and Drive. I tried to like Only God Forgives, but couldn't. I came into The Neon Demon with neutral expectations. I walked out of the end credits disgusted with myself for not having left sooner.The Neon Demon is vapid, soulless trash. It is despicable drivel. It is irresponsible. It is made without a sense of accountability to taste or reason. It is a bafflingly inept attempt at surrealism, where caricatures are passed off as characters, and bright, pretty lights and colors as compelling imagery. The potentially interesting (if trite) theme of the moral and emotional emptiness of the modeling industry is presented in a laughably inane way, as if it were a fresh, vital artistic insight.If Only God Forgives was nudging audience members in the ribs a bit too hard, The Neon Demon kicks us in the groin. Repeatedly.This is true both in the film's style and content. I'm a firm believer that any subject can be dealt with in a film. There is a line of decency and human concern that is usually difficult to discern, and is obviously highly subjective. Shocking scenes will often polarize viewers, and, usually, there are legitimate points to be made on either side. Neon demon goes miles over that line. There is no defense for a scene where over the course of what I would estimate to be a couple minutes of screen time, a woman molests a female corpse. The audience sees and hears almost everything. I won't go into further detail. Unfortunately, Refn did. If this weren't bad enough, this footage is intercut with an abstract representation of the woman's fantasy about an underage girl who earlier rejected the woman's advances. The girl is 16 in the film, and Elle Fanning was either 16 or 17 at the time of filming. I don't consider myself a prude when it comes to dark topics in film. As I said, I firmly believe there are tasteful (or at least acceptable) ways to handle any issue through the medium of film. An example of a film which is uncompromising in depicting evil and yet doesn't cross the line is The Silence of the Lambs. However awful the acts of Hannibal or Buffalo Bill are in that movie, the film is made from a place of heart, of empathy for the victims, a place of humaneness. It doesn't revel in the crimes of its villains. We are meant to be sickened by them. When Hannibal clobbers a policeman (nearly?) to death, the director is very selective in what we see, focusing in on Lecter's demonic glee. It's a thrilling, gut wrenching scene. In Neon Demon's necrophilia scene, everything is fair game. A large part of the reason this scene is so reprehensible to me is that it seems almost as if it's meant to be titillating.I wonder: How would this film have been received if the necrophile were a man molesting a female corpse?It's disheartening to me that a small minority of people seeing this film actually like it. I can't help but think (and hope?) that they're simply fooling themselves, that their affection for Refn's previous, far superior films is being unduly extended over this one. As with Only God Forgives, perhaps the cinematography is distracting enough for them to forgive its fundamental storytelling flaws.But even though I found The Neon Demon intermittently nice to look at, and in spite of my adoration for the genius of Drive and Bronson, I hate this film. Even if I was to pretend there was no sickeningly indulgent necrophilia scene, or other lingering, exploitative shots which directly contradict the premise that the film is an indictment of the male gaze, I would still hate this film, simply because it is so bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly Fantastic, but Not for Everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will preface this by saying that if you haven't seen any other Refn movies, like "Drive" or "Only God Forgives," then you should see those first to see what you're getting into. I thoroughly loved this film, and will stand by in saying that it's an incredible movie. However, if you can't get through Refn's other works, or didn't really "get" them, then it won't deliver the same payoff that I received. To clarify, I'm not saying that if you hate this movie then you "just don't get it." But, seek out other Refn works first to see if you'll like something like this. This is an incredibly cerebral experience. It's is a lot of silent and dialogue free moments where you take in the world the movie cultivates. The cinematography, like in all of Refn's movies, is simply stunning. The colors craft the tone of the movie so effectively it tells a whole story with just itself; it almost is another character. Every shot feels expertly crafted, well put together, like a painting. No time in this 2 hour movie ever feels that wasted. Every shot feels necessary, every frame is splendid.The acting is also on point. Elle Fanning is perfectly cast as the main girl in this film. Her innocence, her shyness, her entire persona is conveyed very effectively. Many of the side characters also fit their character well. Keanu Reeves fit his character well, along with Abbey Lee. But Jena Malone stood out especially to me. The mannerisms of her character, the subtleties, the way she talked was fantastic. Without spoiling anything, a certain scene in this movie with Malone contains so much passion and emotion that I was completely blown away. She, along with Fanning, were my favorite parts of this. I would recommend this movie wholeheartedly, even knowing that it's really not for everyone. It's beyond strange and weird, and is a lot more visual storytelling than a solid narrative. It still has a story, nonetheless. If you're into that, then this may be for you, and you be able to get into it. If you're not, or are skeptical, then you will be disappointed. Nonetheless, I standby in saying this is a great film, and that there ought to be something in it you can enjoy. It's weird, it's strange, it's unique, it's f*cked-up, but it's also fantastic. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mulholland Drive/Suspiria inspired film for this decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Neon Demon is yet another original effort and polarizing film from Nicolas Winding Refn. It was already both booed and applauded at Cannes, and this reaction is one I expect to play out when it gets its wide release.The film draws the viewer in with it's dazzling lighting and visuals, which remain throughout, but also with the mysteries it creates. The mystery of the film results in a compelling narrative, but the last half fails to capitalize on some of the themes and ideas it introduces. However, the main 1-2 ideas are well-developed and relevant. I won't spoil those ideas here, though.Another positive about the film is the soundtrack composed by Cliff Martinez, which is no surprise given the work he and NWR have done together in the past.While the soundtrack and visuals are certainly memorable, and the major themes are ones which I commend NWR for developing, my main gripe with the film is its over-indulgent nature. NWR has a fixation on violence and gratuity, and in the past I've had few problems with it, but in this film I felt it was taken too far. Things that other filmmakers would have implied with cues, Winding Refn shows us in great detail. Some will praise him for his willingness to show us what we don't want to see, others will condemn him. I just found most of these scenes to be unnecessarily over the top.Despite my comparing it to films such as Mulholland Drive and Suspiria, it doesn't feel derivative, but instead like a mostly original experience.On the whole I'd call The Neon Demon a very good film. It's much different from most of the releases so far this year, which alone makes it worth seeing. However, I would not recommend it to the faint of heart, or those with a general disdain for gore in film.Like most other divisive films, I expect that this one will be a subject of conversation for years to come.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Started off OK then became very disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not mind a dark movie if it has a real plot and substance. This movie started off interesting, although there were some scenes with major flaws. However, it then turned into an extremely strange and disturbing film. It was as though the writer(s) hit writer's block and just decided to write sick scenes and put them altogether for merely shock value to keep the audience's attention until the end. The only thing good were some visuals.... Except for the disturbing scenes. The acting was okay. The reactions the actors had to certain occurrences were so unrealistic. It was laughable. I am so sad I spent money to see this movie. I wouldn't have even watched if it was for free.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was Trying for Kubrick But Ended Up Looking Like Zardoz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"She's a diamond among a sea of glass," says Alessandro Nivola's unnamed fashion designer. He says this to describe the virginal, Bambi-esque Jesse (Fanning) whose arrival in Los Angeles has turned many, many heads. Before her entrance, Nivola and a few models sit idly on the leather backs of a upscale restaurant booth. He's reciting passages of Macbeth and waxing poetically about how "beauty isn't the most important thing, it's the only thing."The Neon Demon is a Russ Meyer-inspired Hollywood sleaze fable if it were told from the dour sets of the Grand Guignol. Jesse comes to Tinseltown to become a model and despite being only 16, she lands a deal of a lifetime with a major agency. In-between shoots she lives in a trashy motel headed by the irredeemable Hank (Keanu). Seemingly her only allies are kinda-sorta boyfriend Dean (Glusman) and makeup artist Ruby (Malone) who first ferries her to her first professional shoot. Everyone else seems to either want to be her or want to eat her alive.Due in large part by reexamination of director Nicolas Winding Refn's Only God Forgives (2013), critics seem to be pulling their punches concerning this nasty little fairy-tale. It seems that everyone (including yours truly) is trying to look for deeper meaning under the grotesque giallo horror set-pieces and delirious fretwork. After all, Refn keen eye was once heralded as comparable to that of Stanley Kubrick.Kubrick however never sacrificed narrative for the sake of a nice shot. His frames always has an economy of style that balanced strong cinematography, thematically salient storytelling and unbridled experimentation. Refn's Neon Demon on the other hand is much like it's protagonist, pretty and rather shallow. There's nothing thematically that you can't pry away from the film that isn't already skin deep. It's about vanity; it's about pride and the literate references to Shakespeare, Elizabeth Bathory and Kubrick himself are but filler.Of course what is on the screen is pretty breathtaking; recreating the same gloss and sheen that covers high-end fashion magazines. The hallucinatory horror that dominates Jesse's warped and lonely world conjures comparisons to the sexual cavalcade of Walerian Borowczyk's oeuvre. Then there's the lateral tracking shots which accomplish the same uneasiness captured by a Kubrickian zoom only drawing less attention to itself.Yet every attempt at technical subtlety is completely pulled apart at the seems by Refn's on-the-nose symbolism. Within the first fifteen minutes of the film, models discuss at length the meaning behind the names of lipstick contrasting the fractured female identity with the blunted phrase "are you food or sex?" The consistent use of the color red and the triangle as an emblem of the fairer sex are so painfully, abstrusely obvious that the film honestly would have been better served if Jesse spontaneously grew Icarus wings.It's a shame that Refn couldn't give the same nuance deconstruction of femininity he gave to masculinity in Drive (2011) and to a lesser extent, every other film he's ever done. I admire his temerity but I question his choice to use the same narrative pacing and visceral bloodletting we've seen in his other works. While exploring new themes he makes no attempt to bend in their direction. He doesn't create a new world, he simply adds a wing to his old ones and expects you not to notice. Despite a visual sophistication, every frame is loaded with the judgment of a five-year-old trying broccoli for the first time. It's a movie that's less of an exploration than a house of horrors; Refn being the carnival barker that yells "Isn't this gross, isn't that gross, aren't you gross for enjoying it?"In an interview discussing her role for the film, Elle Fanning compared the themes of the film with the idle hands of a generation ensnared by Instagram. "If you think of dead, altered images as beautiful, how do you relate to a real person?" It's an idea worth exploring; are we really more in love with images than people? With the hilarity of Popstar (2016) and the arrival of Nerve (2016) later this year, it's good to see the movie industry is willing to skewer self-absorption. In the case of Neon Demon, I ask why we need to retch while doing so? Frankly I was expecting something more than a monstrous and excessive retooling of Zardoz (1974).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been dying to see this movie for months now. I went in knowing Refn sometimes puts style of substance and was okay with it, until I wasn't. The visuals were gorgeous, the soundtrack was terrific, and the cinematography gave me a metaphorical hard on, but behind that was no real story. Take away the beautiful visuals and you have a very slow plot that feels like it goes nowhere. If Refn put a little more time into the plot, it could have been much better. Also the ending was very upsetting and left the story feeling very unfinished and unexplained. It got more horrory at the end, but they didn't show much of the violent bloody horror the movie became. Also Keanu Reeves felt like a waste. I think the film could have had a lot more going for it, yet I'm still giving it a 7 because of the stunning visuals and great soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Self-Serious Mess Filled With Bad Laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I guess female vanity is some kind of dark magic and you see the innocent virgin attracted to its glowing allure. As she is drawn into it she meets a coven of witches: a passover, a wannabe and a sorceress supreme, who all covet what she has. The passover wants to kill her, the wannabe is jealous of her and the sorceress supreme who occasionally turns into a wildcat attempts to seduce her, but, awake to the power within her, the innocent virgin instead opens herself to her destiny as the vessel of 'The Neon Demon'. The coven then kills her and eats her flesh to gain for themselves the powers of 'The Neon Demon'. Which is female vanity or the male gaze or some nebulous cloud of similar tropes referenced in terms of fashion modelling. The bad laughs and eye-rolling material comes on early where our innocent virgin hits all those on-the-nose beats about falling from innocence in the big city. Speaking of 'beats', long expanses of the film seem like the cinematography was only there to provide a light show behind Carpenter-esque synth jamming. An example of this was a heavily abstracted scene where our innocent virgin is finally possessed by 'The Neon Demon'. I guess 'abstract' is the word for it. 'Stoner planetarium laser show' would also suffice. Within the narrative continuity, this possession is meant to have occurred when the innocent virgin is given the star slot in a famous designer's runway show. One is left with the suspicion that the filmmakers couldn't actually show this happen in the context of an actual runway show because they didn't have a clear idea of the reality of a runway show. The scenes bookending the sequence feature some of the most self-serious and unintentionally silly dialogue in the film. After her possession, the film takes a steep dive into very silly territory. Our innocent virgin is presumably transformed now that she has accepted 'Teh Power', but Elle Fanning has none of the startling aesthetic presence attributed to her character either before or after. We're just meant to recognize her unique and startling attractiveness because it's written into the dialogue. By the foot of the second act, audience credulity on this point is strained. There's a scene of the sorceress making out with a corpse, a ten minute sequence of the witches washing the innocent virgin's blood off their bodies in slo-mo under blue light while the sorceress, also covered in blood and glitter, gazes on and one of the witches heaves for ten minutes, in another ten-minute sequence of a character doing one thing, before throwing up an eyeball. There's more goofy stuff after that. There are a lot of party-bulb and blacklight shots which go on for way to long. A lot of bad dialogue. It's not a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leads nowhere except to inevitable disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a pretty movie for the eyeballs with some wonderfully artistic visuals, but, other than that, it doesn't have much of a plot, and seems all mostly pointless and anticlimactic after an over-long, entirely way too drawn out, extremely slow story that leads nowhere except to inevitable disappointment. Perhaps that's the entire point of the movie? I felt the actors, who were phenomenal in and of themselves, were entirely wasted for the talents they represent which could have been employed to much greater effect and facility than ... whatever this film is. I recommend watching something else. Watch something you've seen before and liked, and even if you've seen it a dozen times before, it'll be more engaging, and satisfying than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refn is possessed by a demon that feasts on all that is trite and shiny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a viewer who has enjoyed a handful of Nicolas Winding Refn's works like Drive, Bronson, Valhalla Rising, and even Only God Forgives ? which I defended wholeheartedly in a 2013 Amazon review ? it pains me a little to kick off my review with the following statement: It is difficult to decide what I dislike most about Nicolas Winding Refn's The Neon Demon. Critics giving Demon positive reviews and arguing that its monomaniacal focus on style is intentionally on par with the film's message are missing the reality that NWR's creative juices are simply dried up at the moment.So what is the least admirable trait of Refn's latest? Is it the paucity original thought? The onslaught of the routinely neon- drenched Kubrickian imagery? The fact that a good sixth of the movie feels like the director got away with making fetish porn with an Amazon Studios (and about a half dozen other production companies) budget? I'm not even going to start in on the film's literal blood baths, but I think that the lack of originality is probably the worst part.Audiences have already seen everything that The Neon Demon has to offer. Cinematically speaking, there is nothing more than the usual slew of rehashed Kubrick frames (including a groan-worthy Shining shout out within the first few minutes). Aside from a memorable strobe- light inspired scene of a performance at a model- populated L.A. party, Refn adds nothing new to his aesthetic arsenal that he has not already splashed on the screen with his previous four films.From a narrative standpoint, one should not expect a fully-formed, fleshed out story or characters. These are not Refn's preoccupations when making a movie, and there's nothing inherently wrong with that. That is, if the film's style and themes can compensate. Stylistically (see paragraph above), it does not hold any substantial weight. Unfortunately, there is even more of a thematic drought.At one point in the film, the increasingly narcissistic protagonist Jesse (Elle Fanning) says that other girls will cut, carve, inject, and do anything else to their own bodies just so that they can look like a second- rate version of her. The girl from the small town who seemed so nice starts becoming a bit conceited by her time in the fashion industry. Can you believe it? Imagine that! Wow, what is the director trying to say about fashion? Hollywood? The male gaze? SOCIETY?If there is one thing that 2106 films like The Neon Demon and Zoolander 2 should be teaching would-be blockbuster directors and art-house auteurs alike, it is that the fashion industry has become one of the stalest targets for satire in any artistic medium or genre. It's not that superficiality doesn't deserve it, but at this point if a writer or a director has nothing original to say about it, then they should not be saying anything all.To be fair, the trite and shiny cloud of unoriginality that is The Neon Demon does have its silver linings. I have never felt so badly for a film score than I do for Cliff Martinez's excellent work on this soundtrack. While the message of the movie will blend in with the mental smoothie of other Hollywood/superficiality parable flicks, I will not easily be able to excise Martinez's thumping synths from my ears. I will also never forget the intensity of Abbey Lee's stares.There are also less silvery scenes involving Jena Malone taking the tired psycho lesbian trope to whole new level and an absurdly Nicolas Cage-esque Keanu Reeves as an acrimonious motel manager that I will not forget for other reasons (primarily the random shock-less "shock value" senselessness of them). I wish I could recommend The Neon Demon as a startlingly original work from a gifted auteur, but it feels like Refn simply isn't challenging himself or the audience in any meaningful way. Here's hoping that this kind of trite and shiny would-be shock fest will not be the only thing that Refn has to offer cinema in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to a screening of 'The Neon Demon' in my town this afternoon. I should start by saying that it was a particularly fun screening since I was alone in the room and it kind of helped with the atmosphere of the movie.'The Neon Demon' is the new feature film by NWR (as it was stylized in the opening title). I was a big fan of 'Drive' and I also enjoyed 'Only God Forgives' even though most people didn't like. I knew going in that the movie didn't receive the praise of 'Drive' so I was expecting something like 'Only God Forgives' and it's pretty much what I got.Elle Fanning plays a young (underage) model trying to make it big in the city of angels. The opening scene will dive you right into this world with great cinematography and a very cool song. I actually thought that the visuals, the acting and the soundtrack were by far the best aspects of this movie.This is a pretty dark movie, but I actually found myself laughing a couple of times. Keanu Reeves' supporting character has a couple of good lines and the movie itself also has an interesting commentary about the world of fashion... even though it's delivered in a radically surreal way.Saying that the visuals are great is an understatement: the art design is impressive, the lighting is perfect in multiples scenes and the colour palette is really "in your face". There are two 'mind- trip' scenes in the movie that are worth the price of admission alone.I had a couple of issues with the character development of our main character (Fanning) in the script. I hate when art films immediately gets stamped 'style over substance', and I don't think it was the case here neither. However, I don't think NWR did a good job at portraying her evolution through the movie. Without getting into spoilers, Jesse (Fanning) is initially portrayed as being timid and insecure. At some point in the film her character experiences a sudden shift in personality that I didn't exactly bought. Even though you might think the movie is a bit long at times, stick to it until the end, the final act is pretty crazy and rewarding. Jena Malone's performance was amazing to say the least, she went totally wild in this film. All things together I liked 'The Neon Demon' even though I had a couple of issues here and there. It's a cool "horror" movie with a very twisted and subtle sense of humour. Maybe not the perfect date movie, but it's definitely worth a watch!7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes you need a little bit more than beautiful visuals. The film does indeed look great, with a superb soundtrack as well. The lighting and use of colour is very NWR.The opening scenes are good but It never really gets going. Its a very slow burn. With a lead character who barely raises a smile, has zero personality, zero charisma but apparently she has it all. She displays no emotion at all. She basically walks around pouting and asking stupid dumb questions like is this your house? Erh, you dim wit, I'm in my 20's, this is mansion worth millions!I was at the London Q&amp;A tonight. There was so much I wanted to say but I bottled it. NWR is a pompous man, who I quote said 'All men want to be a 16 year old girl' Erh, do they? He's full of shite, the fashion world suits him fineThats 3 crap films this year from 3 of my fav directors. Love, Knight of Cups &amp; now this. Not 6+ for any of themThis should have been used for a music video and not a feature film. Its not interesting enough and there's not enough emotion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Defies all conventions. Flawed, yet stunning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't lie, I initially rated The Neon Demon a 5/10. However, after seeing it opening day and being transfixed yet somewhat put-off the entire runtime, I couldn't get the film out of my head, and have now decided I absolutely love it. Yes, the dialogue is a disaster, the performances are interesting at best (I was actually the most impressed by Abbey Lee and hope to see her play an out and out psycho soon), and all semblances of a conventional plot line are nonexistent, but the world and experience the movie gives the viewer is like nothing else. Films that would come close are 70s cult classics including Argento's infamous giallo Suspiria and the underrated Japanese horror/acid-fest Hausu, and I would be shocked if Winding Refn didn't at least take some inspiration from the former. I had thought films like that were all but lost in time, but The Neon Demon takes the technicolor-ed, fever dream slasher to a new level, even down to the haunting score. No one can deny it looks absolutely fantastic-- from the day-glo pinks and blues juxtaposed against black, the artful shots that looked like a cross between a Kubrick film and an underground rave, and the way LA was captured as almost a character in itself- a menacing, hollow one at that. However, all this would be nothing more than an experimental, music video-esque piece of performance art if it wasn't for the thematic elements in which the movie draws from. And though it's hardly groundbreaking in touching on its deeper elements, the movie really does have a lot to say about conventional beauty standards and the levels with which we will go to achieve them. I found myself wishing I looked like the three female leads more than once during the movie, and while I'm sure this irony, if it can be called that, wasn't exactly intentional, it does make me think a lot about the way the modeling and film industries view beauty, and how rather than try to change society, we try and change ourselves. Both are easier said than done. All in all, The Neon Demon was a visual feast with a deeper meaning. Many things are unexplained, but this just adds to the mystery. If you're up for in immersive, original experience that may leave you feeling a bit uncomfortable due to its content and the harsh reality of its themes, I would recommend it in a heartbeat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not a film, it's an ad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being French and offended by this movie I wanted to spend some time doing a review because of all the good things I read about it (a "masterpiece" of an "art film" near to become a "cult classic" that only "smart people" could understand) I only agree with the art part. What's comforting with art is that it's so diversified you'll always find some people trying to make sense of it, and thus some to defend it so that sometimes its reputation seems to be more about history, dedication, or influence. Let me explain why.First, this film forces you to think that the main character is beautiful and has a "thing" no one else possess. But that's the "thing" with beauty: it's subjective. Well, yes, maybe our society tries to normalize it by trying to teach us what's beauty and what's not, but in the end this is more of a personal feeling, and what I felt watching these thin girls wasn't beauty, at least not for me. The beauty I have in mind is the one of the Renaissance era, where women seemed more natural than ever, painted as if they were a symbol of inspiration, of fertility. I assuredly saw almost none of that as you can figure, and of course it's not what I was expecting but in this case, why did I felt like the film was trying to impose its vision of beauty as being universal?It was almost as if the script was reflecting the point of view and attraction of the director instead of the characters, and as I was watching the different sequences I found myself thinking what that director was like in real life. So I searched for some information on the Internet and he turned out to be exactly what I expected, that is to say the kind of guy having directed several advertisements in the past and thinking that characters and story have little to no importance in a film. You can feel all this just by watching it.So yes it's like an ad or more precisely a commercial, where characters and story have little to no importance and where you see "beautiful" sequences supposed to show you what the "thing" really is about when the fact is this is just some industrial crap. Where you find yourself hearing terrible dialogues trying to sell some ideas and concepts that are complete bullshit. In one scene for example, you have a non-constructive argument about whether beauty comes from the inside or not, and then one of the characters pronounces what could be the advertising slogan of a perfume company. Wow.Now about the art itself, not that I'm complaining but it felt like I saw some neon themes on computer screens that were better than what I saw in this film. In fact there is nothing about computers, which could have been interesting since Adobe's Photoshop is kind of a best friend in the modeling universe. Same for the makeup, at one point I was thinking that it would have been interesting to suggest animal blood in relation to what's used in certain cosmetics. But no, nothing there as well.So, to conclude, as I was writing my review there is one question which obsessively came to mind: is there such thing as bad art? I mean, in an objective way? Because as I said before art can take many forms and contents, sometimes more appealing to some than others, and as the director once said it "divides". So I guess it's entirely up to you to decide whether you like it or not. To me, it's just art on top of an objectively bad movie pretending to be a good one, and ironically that's the "only thing" I find interesting. When you think about it, in a poetic sense, it is what it depicts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Iffy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie because it was the 'best of a bad bunch' playing at a cinema just down the street from where I was staying on vacation. I have an open mind when it comes to movies but this one stretched things a bit too far for me. I think that the writing for it was not so great. I don't think there was a believable plot development in that a) its unlikely that the lead female character would suddenly become a raving narcissist overnight, and b) its unlikely a bunch of female models who would get freaked out over a mouse would suddenly turn into Sociopathic Killers overnight. In short I thought the premise was fairly dumb and Keanu Reeves was wasted in this film because he only had a bit part in it. I think one of the reasons I went to see it was because Keanu Reeves was listed on the marque as being in it. It was technically a 'film noir' effort but it didn't really capture much of that genre which is all about intrigue and suspense-and there really isn't much of either in the movie. Since it had a lot of Scandinavian participants it might go over well in cinema circles in Europe but probably not here. The grossness at the end probably didn't help it much. No messages here-even though some people might see it as a 'scathing critique of the modeling world' and or a 'scathing critique of the state of our society in general.' Maybe. Maybe its just a crappy movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing Drive and Only God forgives again, I decided to watch The Neon Demon. I went to a very small movie theater which showed it late in the evening. There weren't more than 6 people with me.Despite having amazing visuals and great music, the movie seemed like a lack luster to me. In the first half the movie seemed to build tension, just to result in an anticlimax.These anticlimaxes happened roughly three times for me, including the ending. Refn is known for having shocking scenes in his movies, but this one lacked in this department.The movie seemed to lean on just the shock element, which made it rather disappointing for me.I will however watch it again to make sure. I do recommend a true Refn fan to watch it though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The cinematography just can't make up for the rest of the film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this primarily because the cinematography did look visually stunning and creative, giving that the trailer didn't show much about the film. Unfortunately, right from the start there was no visible plot. Granted, I actually do enjoy plot less films, but the dialogue and acting have to really make up for it, and in this case neither did. The script is unbearable. I'm not sure what Refn was aiming at, message wise, or if he was making a statement about the fashion industry overall. It was somewhat unsettling to have a male directly with nearly an all female cast trying to say something about women in this industry and society overall. I understand excessive gore but the blood and antics in here really had no significance. As usual, it was disappointing to see a film like this use lesbian sex scenes purely for "artistic" purposes. There was unnecessary fetishization and misrepresentation as a whole. It was a shame that Elle Fanning was in this because I can see she has talent. 2/10 with an extra point for the cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 2 hour struggle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most important things that I look out for in a movie, especially in movies that are more on the indie side is originality. I first noticed director Nicholas Winding Refns' showed off his unique brand of visual movie making in Bronson, and then further so in Drive. I am sad to report that The Neon Demon is as far as I have ever seen Refn from his glory days.I entered the theater excited to see something that was not a superhero or an alien movie as most of my summer movie experiences revolve around one or both of those themes. I expected a dark LA fashion thriller akin to something like Black Swan or Chuck Palahniuk's Invisible monsters but instead I got a 2 hour overly pretentious attempt by "NWR" to make the most "NWR" movie he possibly could.I don't expect a Nicholas Winding Refn movie to have the most stimulating dialogue, i mean he has had Ryan Gosling basically be a silent lead twice in his last three movies. While I did not expect much, the writing was insulting if anything. Every bit of dialogue was used to further an incredibly slow and ultimately uninteresting plot. There was no real development of character, only the most basic skeleton of barely passable as actual human beings interacting about the plot that is made useless anyway by the terrible unlikable characters.What "NWR" is probably best known for is his sharp, 80's esque imagery that really put him on the map with Drive. There are plenty of neon colors and some interesting imagery, with just enough lens flare to make you hate your eyes for perceiving light that way. With that being said a vastly small amount of this is actually useful to the movie and even less is actually stimulating. There are also some really bad looking shots in this movie, which makes it either feel unfinished or unrealized.This has not been a great year for movies, while I have seen some fantastic ones such as Midnight Special and to a lesser extent The Lobster, The Neon Demon has been closer to the quality of films this year. All that being said I can't remember a worse movie that I have seen in 2016 than The Neon Demon. Even the music, which has been a staple of "NWR" films seems to get forgotten pretty early in the movie. If you thought it could not get any worse than Only God Forgives, I am here to tell you it can, it can be much worse. I think Mr. Winding Refn needs to spend a little more time either choosing his scripts or more time making them more interesting movies rather than all the time he spends trying to get various forms of his name in the opening credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And it is a beautiful piece of art work, just like a painting moving.Think we have to give a lot of credit to The Director of Photography for her stunning work adding to the film's beauty and intensity.I went to see this movie because I'm a huge fan of the director's previous film, Drive, but now I'm beginning to see that Drive may have been a fluke, a one time thing. Especially after seeing his follow up film, Only God Forgives, which like this movie, all his movies as a matter of fact, were shot with such style and beauty.The Neon Demon started off slow for me and I was thinking it was going to leave me dissatisfied like Only God Forgives , but that's not what happen. The confusion of the right turn this movie makes made it worth the watch. Truly like a piece of art, the overall product touched me and became very indulging.Elle Fanning leads a well done cast of character performances, even Keanu Reaves was great. I think this is Elle's first adult role playing an underage model struggling to make it in LA. The movie explores possibly the best and worse case scenario of what could happen to a young girl alone in that city.Definitely a great movie to watch. It's not Drive, but loved it far better than Only God Forgives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Labeling this a horror movie was extremely misleading. Thriller, okay, yes there was a sense of unease and tension in the film that carried through all of the scenes; but nothing supernatural. I concede that horror and supernatural do not necessarily equate each other, but the trailers all indicated some dark secret about Jessie when there was nothing but beauty and a modicum of innocence. When the lines "You know what my mother called me? Dangerous." come I expected Jessie to take flight!But no. The horror of this was all in a real world setting with real people committing a horrible act on a real person. There are people who eat human flesh (as a delicacy). There are people who have sex with corpses. It is when the people who are eaten or abused in death come for you that you have horror.An indie film from last year, "Starry Eyes", while not shot as stylistically as "The Neon Demon", is a better film. It makes no bones about what it is. "The Neon Demon" doesn't appear to know what it is and when it decides chickens out and does not show the true graphic horror! If it were not for the way the film was shot I'd say it was a complete POS.Another disappointment was that Elle Fanning proves she is no Dakota Fanning; as she could not fully carry this film.Everyone else fared better acting wise though the models playing models were so feral from the moment we saw them it was really no surprise they resorted to extremes.Keanu? Could have been any actor. Nothing special added and not an embarrassment.Have to low ball this and give it a 2; and that only for the cinematography and lighting design.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually impressive but without much substance and ultimately grotesque</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Featuring a capable cast with the superb Elle Fanning in the lead and a fascinating score by Cliff Martinez, Nicolas Winding Refn's 'The Neon Demon' is a visually striking art film that is very good in the beginning, but in the end, relies too much on shock moments to be taken seriously, which in turn diminishes much of its expressiveness.The movie starts out great with Elle Fanning's character making her way in the glamorous but shallow modeling world of L.A. where she meets some shifty characters. As the movie progresses, we get to see more and more surreal scenes accompanied by Cliff Martinez' excellent electro-score. The first half of the movie is all good filmmaking if you ask me, at times reminiscent of David Lynch, Dario Argento and Roman Polanski, but somewhere in the middle, the movie begins to drag because the plot lacks narrative structure and there are too many scenes that introduce potentially interesting plot lines that are never elaborated later on.After about 90 minutes, the movie takes a kind of U-turn, changing from a slow-burning psychological drama into a nasty gore-fest that could be straight out of the mind of a lunatic. The movie's decent into full- on madness begins with Jena Malone having an experience of lesbian necrophilia in a morgue and ends with Abbey Lee eating Elle Fanning's eyeball that Bella Heathcote just puked up. Yes, that's just as crazy as it sounds. Even though Refn obviously tries to make a certain statement with the way he ended 'The Neon Demon,' one can't deny that this final succession of weird and weirder scenes is primarily there to shock the audience, and it absolutely doesn't fit in with the rest of the movie. Don't get me wrong, I like my share of insane horror movies, but it's almost never a good idea to start a movie a certain way, keep up its style for a long period of time, and only at the very end completely break with that style. It's almost like the screen is screaming "F*** you!" at the audience.All in the all, 'The Neon Demon' is a visually striking if narratively underwhelming social commentary on the dog eat dog modeling world of today that keeps up a great style for most of its running time but ultimately discards it in favor of shock schlock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Overrated and Boring Film by Nicolas Winding Refn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sixteen year-old aspiring model Jesse (Elle Fanning) arrives in Los Angeles expecting to be a successful model. The aspirant photographer Dean (Karl Glusman) takes photos for her portfolio and dates her. Jesse befriends the lesbian makeup artist Ruby (Jena Malone) and then the envious models Gigi (Bella Heathcote) and Sarah (Abbey Lee) in a party. Meanwhile the agency considers Jesse beautiful with a "thing" that makes her different and she is sent to the professional photographer Jack (Desmond Harrington). Jesse attracts the attention of the industry and has a successful beginning of career. But Ruby, Gigi and Sarah are capable to do anything to get her "thing". "The Neon Demon" is another overrated and boring film by Nicolas Winding Refn. This filmmaker is specialist in making shallow films with beautiful cinematography. The long and annoying "The Neon Demon" is no exception. The storyline is "naive aspiring model goes to LA and is devoured by the system" is disclosed along 1h 58 minutes running time. Elle Fanning is not a beautiful teenager to justify the hype from the industry; therefore her character has "a thing" to explain her success for simple mortals like most of the viewers. The most impressive are the positive reviews and the conclusion might be the following: Nicolas Winding Refn is a darling of the cinema industry; or Nicolas Winding Refn has a strong team of people to write positive and overrated reviews of his films in IMDb. The fake horror genre misleads the viewers and fans of the genre. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Demônio de Neon" ("Neon Demon")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A message without any kind of story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first review that popped up after watching this film is "A 2 Hour Struggle". The title of that review was a perfect explanation for this film as a whole. The film itself lacked substance, lacked story. I felt like I did not need to watch anymore than the trailer to understand what it was about and what exactly was going to happen. The film itself, from the site I saw it on, was titled a Horror/Thriller, and I feel that it was neither of these. At most a weak version of a biographical film.Basically the film is an biography of the pressures that exist within the modeling industry and the extremes that people are willing to go to. This is nothing new. The film tries to trick you into the idea that there is some sort of plot followed by a climax and and and ultimate ending. The acting is sub par by most standards in the industry and the fact that it is rated higher than films that I have enjoyed much more is an absolute joke.Let me start off by saying that this review is strictly an opinion, as are most reviews. The difference here is that I actually felt, after viewing this particular film, that I should review it based on what the IMDb rating was. You can consider this unfair, or biased, if you must, but I feel as if this film tried to be two different things - an artsy film and a thriller/horror film. While I believe it was neither, I did enjoy the cinematography in the film and felt that there were some really solid shots that were unique in an artistic sense. The shots that really intrigued me occurred in the white photography studio as well as the scenes taking place at the party and the run-way show. Those shots were awesome in my opinion! The problem that exist is with the story and lack of an actual plot. I felt empty after watching this film. As if I had wasted 2 hrs of my life watching something I could have got more out of by watching an actual documentary about modeling and the pressures in that field. This is a prime example of some beautiful cinematography work mixed with an absolutely rubbish story. I get how cinema, or film, is not all intended to be about story telling; however, I feel as a film this film tried to push the boundaries of art and story telling with an absolute fail in the storytelling department. I would have much rather seen the ghost of the young model haunting the lives of the experienced, veteran models after what happened to her. Now that would be an actual horror story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NWR's love letter to 70s European Horror films in particular Dario Argento's Suspiria is a sick film with stellar performances (especially Jena Malone who literally steals the movie) beautiful Cinematography and a killer soundtrack from Cliff Martinez. while it's still not without its flaws this film will drag you in and will never let go until after the credits roll with it's dark sick themes, visual Metaphors and Satirical comments about the obsession with beauty and fame and how far some people are willing to go in order to achieve it I'm sure this is not a movie for everyone because i felt that it will make a lot of people angry especially in an age where saying anything about anything makes you a racist, a sexist and a terrible human being. Art-house film fans will enjoy it more than hardcore Horror fans that i'm sure of, it has a lot to say for itself (obviously) and it's so incredibly dark that you have to see it in order to believe it. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked director Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive. I read it as a love story disguised in a violent action movie, an uneasy combination that worked perfectly, to a large extent thanks to the presence in the lead role of Ryan Gosling, one of my preferred actors. From the same director comes now The Neon Demon a film that confirms the fame of Refn as a director who does not hesitate to create violence on screen in a manner that would almost make Tarantino blush, but yet has always another different message that provides substance to his movies.'The Neon Demon' begins as the innocent-girl-in-LA genre, with Jesse (Elle Fanning) landing in California and finding pretty soon herself engaged on a stellar modeling path. All is due to her looks, she has the charisma and innocence that makes the room light and warm up when she steps in. Her beauty is her strength, but may also become soon her main liability as she becomes a threat to the other beautiful women around and they may fight back by all means. And 'by all means' indeed means 'all means' - we are in the beauty industry, and the demons can be as dark and scary as in a haunted mansion.Much of the rest of the film is in almost pure horror genre. Some will love it, some will hate it, some will exit the screening theater at some point. My impressions are pretty mixed. I am not intimidated by explicit horror or sex on screen, I have seen worse horror in some Korean movies for example, and these actually fall within the logic (or un-logic) of the story. The film is visually striking, with plenty of beautiful video art elements, too many actually, and this is one of the aspects that I did not like. There are so many beautiful filmed scenes and they are so long that at some point the whole experience smells of narcissism. Same about the usage of electronic music. Elle Fanning is an excellent Jesse, beautiful and vulnerable, threatened and threatening. She is actually one almost sure bet for the list of the stars of tomorrow, with no less than 54 roles on record, three for each of the 18 years of her age (her first one was 'Lucy 2 years' in I Am Sam!). Keanu Reeves makes a short appearance, but his fans should not go to this film just to see him. The last 15 minutes of the film put in context all that we have seen until then, but I have seen better endings.'The Neon Demon' is not a film all will like, and it's not easy viewing even for those who will like it. It's worth being seen despite its problems. For dully warned audiences only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have feel as though I have wasted nearly two hours of my life.No doubt this movie will appeal to the pseudo-intellectual, pubescent boys (or those who think they still are) and fashion victims of the world based purely on the hype it has received.A well-crafted artistic interpretation of a story it is not. As with the subject matter, it is a poor facsimile of a truly worthy art film ? or perhaps that is what it is meant to be.The story could have been told more in-depth, after all several unnecessarily long scenes took up far more time than was palatable ? which would have left plenty in the time budget to develop the characters and their motivations.The characters were shallow and uninteresting. For most of the movie we were subjected to Elle Fanning's interpretation of her character Jesse. It must have been an easy role because her portrayal of her sickly sweet character was exactly the same all the way through whatever situation she found herself in. During the longer scenes involving only her it became annoying and tiresome.But this is typical of many American films that have attempted to present themselves as 'art for the masses'. The cinematography is brilliant but it isn't enough to distract from the obvious failings of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is something joyous about a truly American independent movie. Even the movies pretending to be independent movies sometimes have its brio. Think about the recent films like It Follows, or even Refn's previous Drive.LA films do tend to follow patterns, but this one got caught in the mechanics of LA life, without moving beyond it. This was supposed to be a contrast - glitz and grime, sexy not sexy, but it didn't work. Like Black Swan, it also has a bit of trouble with dream sequences too.The extreme end of the film didn't really take the stage it could have done. But nevertheless the film has great 80s music, good visuals and tries all it can to use the language of cinema. Smarter editing would have improved it quite a bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A seductively dark fairy-tale about the currency of beauty.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicholas Winding Refn -- whose previous films include "Drive" and "Only God Forgives" -- is a Danish filmmaker whose colorful, visually- arresting films tend to plumb the dark areas of the human psyche, often in a way that contrasts light, gauzy, dreamlike sequences with sudden bursts of shocking graphic violence. His latest, "The Neon Demon," follows in that, ahem, vein.Superficially, "Neon Demon" tells the story of Jesse, a naturally- beautiful girl who arrives in L.A. with the intent of making her name in the high-fashion modeling industry. Played by Elle Fanning in a surprisingly fun and measured performance, Jesse spends much of the film unsure of herself, surrounded by people who either want to take advantage of her or BE her. She begins the film as a kind of victim, but soon enough realizes her own latent power, and begins to be more assertive. Her peers don't like this. Shocking violence ensues.If the plot sounds skin-deep, it really is -- and, arguably, the film is all the better for it. Because what's really going on here -- what Refn is really striving for -- is a dark and dreamlike fairy-tale, dense with symbolism and Jungian undercurrents, about the nature of beauty and its perceived value within our society.Jesse is, effortlessly and naturally, what all of her peers want to be. What they would kill to be, actually. Refn uses graphic violence here as a metaphor for the ways in which people harm themselves to be beautiful. One character speaks about about women being sliced, injected, stuffed, shaved, and plucked in pursuit of beauty, and the words hurt because they're true. The violence is in our culture, the film argues. We do these things to ourselves, in pursuit of the ideal represented by Jesse. When the film inevitably turns to bloodshed, it does so as a natural extension of this idea.So, the plot proceeds simply and slowly, the dialogue is campy and overwrought (but fun) -- and the symbols, sound, and cinematography loom large, carrying the bulk of the film's meaning.Let me talk about a few of the scenes and symbolic motifs which fascinated me, because that's really the only way to get to the heart of what makes this film appealing for people like me. I suppose you're either the kind of person who enjoys "reading" a movie on a visual level like this, or you're not. (You either "get" the ending of "2001: A Space Odyssey," or you don't and probably never will.) Personally, I just love films which rely more on the visuals and the sound to tell the story than on the plot or the dialogue. Refn's films really appeal to me, because they function in sophisticated ways on this level. SPOILERS AHEAD!1) Jesse's hotel room. Jesse stays at a seedy hotel, where her small room is decorated with gaudy wallpaper, curtains, and a bedspread which all evoke a jungle theme. This might be easy to dismiss were it not so visually striking. The patterns, the textures, the colors -- the camera lingers over the walls of her room during a couple of long tracking shots, well-establishing that this place where she lives -- the only place we know as her home -- looks like a jungle.2) The spirit-animal. Returning home to her jungle-like hotel-room late one night, Jesse is startled by a noise and a shape moving in the darkness within. She gets help from the hotel manager (played by Keanu Reeves), and when they return to investigate, they discover that the intruder is a freaking LION. A lion. Pacing the jungle of her room, her room which is her home. How did the animal get inside? Where did it come from? Nothing is explained.3) Due to the aforementioned incident, the hotel manager dubs Jesse "Wildcat."4) The transformation. Jesse is selected to participate in a prestigious fashion-show. One of her rivals -- a woman whose candor about her many plastic-surgeries is startling -- is sick to find how easily Jesse found a place there. And then -- insult to injury -- Jesse is selected to CLOSE the show! Gasp. But watch what Refn does with Jesse's fashion- walk. Rather than show us the actual event, he gives us Jesse's internal impression of the event. What we see does include a runway, but on the other end of that runway, FACING Jesse, is another Jesse. Surrounding the runway are inverted triangles. Triangles, the symbol of power. Jesse approaches herself in a mirror, kisses her reflection. This is the transformation scene, folks. This is the scene where she embraces her inner lion, and becomes the super-predator she was born to be. Notice how, when this scene ends, we next see her leaving the backstage area, and she is completely transformed. Makeup, hair, her whole look -- it's all different. She no longer has Doe Eyes. Her eyes are now more predatorial, threatening.I suppose I could go on, but I don't really feel like spoiling the rest of the film, and you get my gist: The film lays-out symbols which build on each other and become meaningful motifs, motifs which occasionally take the foreground, driving the plot and the action. All of which plays into a multi-sided metaphor about the currency of beauty, and the violence people are willing to do to themselves (and others) in its pursuit.So, yes, I really enjoyed "The Neon Demon." Many people will not. It is violent, and metaphorical, and the portion of its narrative which is made explicit is just the tip of the Jungian iceberg. But those with a taste for visually evocative films -- especially the works of Stanley Kubrick and David Lynch -- will find here much to enjoy and discuss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"So I asked myself, of all the melancholy topics, what, according to the universal understanding of mankind, is the most tragic? Death. And when is this most tragic of melancholy topics most poetical? When it most loosely alludes itself to beauty. The death, therefore, of a beautiful girl is unquestionably the most poetic topic in the world." So spoke the ghost of Edgar Allan Poe in Francis Ford Coppola's movie Twixt. These words are a paraphrasing of Poe's own writing, from his essay "The Philosophy of Composition". Coppola and Refn both seem to have taken some interest in using Elle Fanning in films about the death of a beautiful woman. The topic is insanely fascinating in this presentation.The Neon Demon is about a girl who goes to Los Angeles in order to become a top model. The work, compliments, admirers and envy all start to roll in. The movie is essentially thematic, largely relying on the visual and on atmosphere.NWR is an extreme addict of beauty, and the movie contains some staggeringly voluptuous photography. The message is that physical beauty is superficial. But there is no sanctimony to be had from Refn here, on the contrary he goes for full immersion, a beauty-holic on a bender. The film is a testimony to the power of beauty, it is a mesmeric, galvanic glory. The tail end of the beast mutates into images you see only in rare dreams, a mix of the abject and the byzantine. A judgemental reaction to this dreamworld would be a nonsensical act.</fullReview>

I like this film for it's emotion, it's well acted and well sequenced, a good viewing for the serious movie goer. A side note: the extraneous aspects of a woman is a strong feature of this film and my personal opinion is this is most defiantly the first point of attraction for any relationship but as they say, beauty is only skin deep while true beauty is held both in the body and the mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mulholland Drive, yes that is what it reminded me off but that was not a good thing. The movie consisted of no story and was mainly a series of scenes that seemed unrelated. The same here, Elle Fanning is sweet but not convincing as a stunning mesmerizing model threatening her surrounding with her beauty. The soundtrack consisting of throbbing bass, twinkly sounds and industrial metal clanging would make this series of impressions suitable as a music video. In the end the movie has to resort to blood splattering, slow blood showering and corpse kissing to provoke any response. If any review needs 4 paragraphs of 20 lines each to explain why this is a new exploratory piece of art it probably isn't that good. Unless you were born in 1996 and missed the entire Lynch area, Scandinavian dark cinema this can be thought provoking. I still keep it open that this could be a spoof with all the caricatures and cliché depictions of the fashion industry. Not impressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sort of reminded me of the Korean film "Beautiful" except more Nicolas Winding Refn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicolas Winding Refn is a director that films things that HE want to see on screen instead of just focusing on what the mainstream viewers would want to see. And I give the guy some props for that, which is one of reasons why I like the way Gareth Evans directs his films. The two directors seems to have very different taste, with one focusing on the artistic side of thing while the other focuses in on the action. Nicolas Winding Refn is a director that likes to show it instead of relying heavily on the dialogue. And it really shows in this film and his previous films as well. The imagery, the symbolic colors, the music, the cinematography in general which includes the subtle details makes this film stand out. This film delves upon what the power of beauty, vanity and narcissism has upon the world and how success and the environment can change people. The consumption of beauty and the dog eat dog side of things when it comes to the modeling and entertainment business. Where jealousy, envy and backstabbing run amok. The Metaphor and foreshadowing is done really well in this. Which makes the 3rd act which brings about the shock factors that can elicit reactions from the viewers which is something Nicolas Winding Refn was aiming for. This film sort of reminded me of the Korean film "Beautiful" which came out in 2008 except more Nicolas Winding Refn which isn't a bad thing. I wouldn't be shocked if he was inspired by that film. Overall, if you like art-house films that uses the imagery to tell the story, you just might enjoy this one. Also check out the Korean film "Beautiful" which is a really standout film with a message. And is equally as haunting. This is suppose to be a artistic horror movie that revolves around girls. Although it isn't all that scary, but it is disturbing and to a certain extent impactful.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually Marvelous but Thin on Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of Nicolas Winding Refn's most "beloved" works (Drive, Bronson) and what many see as his worst (Only God Forgives), I would say that The Neon Demon matches his stunning (colorblind) eye for lighting and cinematography while in some ways tempering his tendency toward visceral brutality, replacing it with disturbing, "maneater" psycho-sexuality. The film follows a young model (Elle Fanning) whose natural beauty stuns the modeling world, quickly turning a makeup artist (Jena Malone) and two beauty-obsessed models (Bella Heathcote, Abbey Lee Kershaw) into obsessive lust and jealousy.As with Only God Forgives before it, the film uses symbolism and unspoken implication to create its allusions, which in this case seem to highlight the illusion of beauty and the obsessive fantasies created to either fake it or make it. However, much of this gets lost in the sparseness of the material and in the symbolism that doesn't immediately connect to the themes Refn is conveying to the viewer. With an underdeveloped narrative, the film has a brooding underbelly that never brings us too far under the surface.Despite a charming Karl Glusman, a sinister Keanu Reeves, an eerie Desmond Harrington and a pretentious Alessandro Nivola in supporting roles, the film is very thin on story and character development undercutting the power its four main female characters could have. With things moving too quickly to their conclusion, the film never truly realizes the promise of its exploration of a beauty-obsessed industry full of Lady Macbeth types. So while it may rejuvenate Refn's standing following Only God Forgives, it doesn't move him far away from the perception of Refn being pretentiously visual while lacking substance or immediacy. This perception was created by Valhalla Rising and Only God Forgives in quite possibly an unfair manner. Nevertheless, there is enough here to satisfy the niche audience of Refn fans who enjoy his violent surrealism. However, there won't be much for audiences outside of that niche to consume... if you excuse the pun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Experiment in Deliberate Style over Substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I doubt Refn himself tries that hard to legitimise the imagery, along with the story arc, of this film. Perhaps like some visual artists, they will deliberately obscure any real meaning and allow the observer to find their own meaning. Refn takes a visual approach to the storytelling, with only sparse dialogue to spell out what we can decipher in the setup. Such as an MTV video of the early 90's period, when music video became high art, the synthesiser score mates the theme of this film "Ultimate Beauty". With such striking imagery, Refn lingers on each shot to turn it into a fashion photo. There is certainly is no doubt that Refn is a directorial force to be reckoned with. He gets strong performances from his actors. He can be genuinely disturbing to the point that you almost are flinching waiting for something violent to happen. The best news about this experiment, is that it was impossible to pigeonhole the production as "Lynchian" or "Kubrick-esque". When you feel the drift into the hallucinatory world, it is a different experience compared to what Lynch might do. I paid to see this film in the theatre because I believe Refn is one of the more important filmmakers around right now. His half-successful experiments are far more interesting for me than the umpteenth remake of Tarzan. One thing for sure is that Refn will continue to make films worth paying attention to. And some of those future films will be considered masterpieces. However, on this outing, I can applaud the fact that Refn has found his voice in recent films, but needs to allow some depth into the drama. You can certainly wait until the DVD comes out to give this one a try. However, the cinematography is the best I've seen so far this year, and I was satisfied to see such mesmerising visuals on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style over substance, and beware the second hour (no spoilers!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Neon Demon" (2016 release; 117 min.) brings the story of Jesse, an aspiring model who just arrived in LA (from Georgia). As the movie opens, we see Jesse at a photo-shoot where at first it seems she is dead in a pool of blood. There Jesse befriends make-up artist Ruby, and they decide to go to a party, where they meet other up-and-coming models. "Are you food or are you sex?" asks one of them (referring to Jesse's preferred lipstick). It becomes clear that in this cut-throat competition that is the modeling business, Jesse, barely 16 but instructed by a potential agency to tell everyone she's 19, doesn't know what she's up against. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Danish writer-director Nicolas Winding Refn, who blew us away with "Drive" and also brought the ambitious "Only God Forgives" (both Ryan Gosling-fronted). As was already the case with "Only God Forgives", here again Refn brings a movie heavy on style (and beautiful at that), but alas too light on substance. It might've helped had the characters been given some depth so that we have an emotional connection or reason to care. While the first hour is vaguely entertaining, the movie unfortunately derails badly in the second hour (I won't spoil specifically why). I simply couldn't buy into it all, and instead enjoyed the screen for the eye and ear candy that it brings. Yes, I said ear candy. Once again, Cliff Martinez, who also scored the previous 2 Refn movies, brings a mesmerizing electronic score that is one of the better aspects of the movie. Can't wait to check out the soundtrack. Ellie Fanning is okay as Jesse. Is she beautiful? Sure. Is she so stunningly beautiful with an obvious "it" factor that people left and right clamor for her (in the movie anyway)? I honestly don't see it, but that's just me I'm sure. Also keep an eye out for a barely recognizable Keanu Reeves, who has a small (less than 10 min.) role as the manager of the motel where Jesse is staying."The Neon Demon" premiered at this year's Cannes film festival with considerable splash. The movie opened this past weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and the Tuesday early evening screening where I saw this at turned out to be a private screening, as in: I literally was the only person in the theater. I can't say that I was surprised, as this movie hasn't created any type of a buzz nor was it marketed aggressively. As you have garnered by now, this was not the best of movies, but if you liked Refn's previous movies, I'd suggest you check it out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Typically, I prefer to go into watching films knowing as little as possible. I managed to achieve that as I shuffled in to see The Neon Demon early this morning. All I really knew were the names that made up the cast and crew.I've been conflicted over Nicholas Winding Refn for a while. He makes visually stunning films, but I often find the stories lacking in substance. Additionally, in interviews he comes off (possibly intentionally) as a misogynistic and pompous ass that I'd like to punch in the face.So, as we entered the hell-hole that is one of the smallest and shittiest screens at the UA Riverview Plaza Stadium 17 to see Refn's take on women, LA and the modeling industry, I wasn't expecting much.Boy was I wrong. The film WAS visually stunning as I've come to expect, but there was so much more. This was a tale of the occult/supernatural (witches?) and Dario Argento's Suspiria was clearly an influence.Instead of the misogyny portrayed in the media interviews and I thought I would see on the screen, the film actually showed that, yes while women can be terrible to each other, society as a whole is to blame for our obsession with and sexualizing of young women. There are innumerable metaphors that I would love to discuss, but I hate giving out spoilers.I now feel the need to go back and give Only God Forgives a second chance. We only made it a half hour in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Neon Demon - Review: Substance within Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directer Nicolas Winding Refn didn't just create a movie with an artistic visual style, he crafted something with a cool color palette, awesome soundtrack, exceptional performances, moderate storytelling, and nuance.Quite frankly, I absolutely love this movie, I've seen it three times, and it just gets better.First and foremost, this movie isn't for everyone, people who love Nicolas Winding Refn might enjoy it, but this could possibly even tear Refn fans apart.After my first viewing of The Neon Demon, I was confused, after my second showing, I was frustrated, and by the third time I had picked up on something I didn't notice before, I nourished in it, and then I felt refreshed, by the way, this movie is not a masterpiece, it still has its flaws.The Neon Demon is a movie that should be examined closely, preferably with a microscopic lens.Everything in this movie should be examined closely, the color palette during the opening and throughout, the facial expressions and body language of the characters, the otherworldly and abnormal scenes, and the atmospheric music play a crucial part in ones ability to fully comprehending the narrative no matter how outlandish it may seem. From the start everything seems simple, but with closer examination you'll notice that there's something brewing just beneath the surface.The Neon Demon is a slow burner, it takes awhile for things to get started, but the movie elevates with each new scene.The first act is stellar, the second act is magnificent, and the third act is acceptable; Everything falls apart during that third act, however, using the tools required, the viewer should be able to fathom its bizarre execution.The third act wasn't perfect, it could've taken the traditional approach and ended on a sad note, the earlier scenes did provide some insight lending in, but trying to fully grasp it is a nightmare, I was left scratching my head, and I thought that certain scenes weren't really necessary, however, I do believe that some of the final scenes made sense.Overall, I really enjoyed The Neon Demon, I pretty much liked everything about it, except the third act, but that still didn't ruin my overwhelming enjoyment, and so you either roll with it or you don't. For a viewer to fully grasp an understanding of the movie, one needs to know what colors represent, look out for these colors because they're scattered throughout, also look out for mirrors, and pay attention to the music within context while also enjoying it; every little detail was clearly planned and thought out right down to the color choices.

		<fullReview>The Neon Demon is gorgeous, hauntingly quiet, and all sorts of messed up, and I think I loved it. Emphasis on "think". There are many big names starring in this movie, but there are truly only two main stars and their names are Cliff Martinez, and the madman himself, Nicolas Winding Refn. (Also need to mention Jena Malone, because she had the best acting performance by far in my opinion.) If you've seen a Refn movie before, you might know what you're getting yourself into, but even at that, you still might leave the theater with your jaw on the floor. I know I did. It's not a perfect movie, but if anything, my biggest fault of it was that I simply wanted more. You could use the phrase "style over substance" but I thought there was a lot of substance there, just not enough. Christina Hendricks and Keanu Reeves were also horribly underused which was frustrating. I do think the final act will completely divide people, if the first two acts didn't divide them already, and it's most likely a "love it or hate it" film. I'm leaning towards loving it, but I need to watch it a few more times, and eye absolutely will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicolas Refn's the Neon Demon is a conceit of a very contemporary nature: form without content. Completely dedicated to the stylised image it could almost be an advert for some sort of Apple product. In one sequence model Jesse is positioned in front of a huge dazzling saturated white backdrop which almost seems to envelop her with its cold sensuality. As she poses in this setting, she is painted gold by the fashion photographer, I expected a gold Apple iPhone to somehow appear and transfix itself into the scene. The setting was perfect opportunity for product placement.Neon Demon is very much the product of the Apple generation, a parallel cinematic form of the mediated reality that permeates and defines the iPhone life style in which life is not experienced directly but only indirectly through a screen which accesses image and information. Screen takes the place of life. Gazing becomes living.The cool.Refn wants to make a cool film. He only requires of his audience that they watch the screen with detached interest as he invents and shows a succession of locational architectural backdrops accessed by tracking shots down narrow runs walkways and corridors. He then fills the spaces with content. It doesn't matter what the content is. The only point of the content is as a product to attract the gaze. Colour, eye catching interiors, blond women from the parallel universe, violence, sex, blood, cannibalism etc. The more transgressive the image the less it affects. In fact there is an inverse relationship between the extremity of Refn's provocations and the intensity of audience reaction. Penetrative necrophilia, eyeball eating become "plaisirs des yeaux", bagatelles. The important thing about the content is that it should be and is vacuous, empty. The scenario develops situations, events, actions in which the audience cannot invest with meaning. 'Never never' land becomes 'Whateverland'.Into this refined space, characterised often simply by colour and architectural form, Refn promotes Jesse, who is in many ways rather like an Apple product. Jesse is blond shimmering white and perfectly designed by nature. She does not attract empathy as she is a contextualised product. She tells that her parents are 'gone' but otherwise she is carefully screened to remove the personal. She is an object to be gazed at. Like the objects in the Apple universe, admired as image. Like a product, Jesse has little to say about or for herself. She lets other people do the talking. It is for others to fill her out with their projections.For the most part Jesse is the subject of other people's observations and desires. Jesse has such beautiful skin hair nose. She is just so perfect. And desired. They want to suck her. (except her boyfriend) As heterosexual sex, except abusive rape (suggested but not realised in a dream sequence), wouldn't fit with the extreme product design, Refn and his writers, have gone for a baroque rendering of that old movie stand-by: Lesbian Cannibals from Outer Space. And the final sequence of the film plays out with a series of grotesque tableaux, like some kind of 18th century masque, of the hunting killing and eating of Jesse by a group of deranged other worldly blond coat hangers.The Neon Demon, is not a horror film or anything like that. Refn has made film that is produced for the state of mind that is characteristic of certain patterns of contemporary consumption. A state of mind that finds significance in objects and products, and by engaging in life through the isolating filter of a screen that is detached but desirous of visual excitement through image. As Marshall McLuhan observed: the Medium is the Message. And how 'cool' is that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is just so bad. SO bad. I guess most of the budget was spent on Christina Hendricks and Keanu Reeves, who somehow agreed to participate in this piece of poo - why they did is completely beyond me.The director's ego is obviously enormously more expansive than than his talents, which, if this movie is anything to go by, are practically non-existent.For one thing, the supposed models in this movie don't even look like models, but are at least 30lbs and 4 vertical inches away from being allowed to attend a cattle call. Geezus. Then there's everything else - EVERYTHING else, from the sets to the lighting, that's just so bad. It is just so bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My rating: Visual: 9/10 Audio: 10/10 Story: 5/10God, there is so much to say about this movie. Firstly, it is not a perfect film. It is far from perfect. But damn was it a good experience. I assume watching this high would be great. Very similar to 2001 A Space Odyssey.The first half of this film deals with the stressful and exciting life of a small-town girl who has moved to Los Angeles at the age of 16 to pursue a life in modeling. No family, she fills her social void with a few acquaintances from her primary photo-shoot. She applies to a modeling agency and they think she's perfect. Everybody thinks she's perfect.That's what this whole story is about. The new girl from town who is perfect in appearance and grace, and how vulnerable she is to the world and influences as she weighs her friendships and competes in the modeling industry.This first half I mentioned has every making of a perfect film. It's got a strong, developing protagonist. It's got antagonists and great rising action. It's got lights and music and it's gorgeous and sexy and brilliant honestly.AND THEN IT IS RUINED. The story and the director go off the deep end, every bit of development so far is ruined. The story flips angles, great characters are ignored or abandoned, and the movie loses the visual stimulation/music and modeling theme which carried such a huge weight and built all tension.By the end of the movie I was laughing ironically at the terrible lines, the disgusting and unexpected visuals and sexual content and gore. I found myself in pain at how my beautiful characters I had grown to love weren't behaving like themselves. Not that they had grown to that point, but that they simply didn't fit in this story. Ruined. Absolutely ruined the latter half of the film.Go see the movie if you like weird movies and can handle graphic (and I really mean graphic) scenes. And please, by all means watch this film intoxicated because it really ins't worth your sober time.This movie will become a cult classic for me but I'll stock up on rum before I watch it next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicolas Winding Refn never fails to bring something gaudy to the big screen. He also tends to bring heavy themes and thought provoking ideas to his films. With The Neon Demon, however, neither one of Refn's aforementioned talents ended up impressing me.I knew absolutely nothing going into this film in terms of its plot. I knew it starred Elle Fanning and it was directed by Refn, so in turn I figured it had to be a thriller of sorts. Right from the opening few scenes, I felt the comparison to David Lynch's masterpiece, Mulholland Drive. Both feature young women moving to Los Angeles with high aspirations of making something of their lives. Both films take a neo-noir-ish approach to L.A.'s landscape making for a rude awakening for each respected main characters.One of the issues I had with The Neon Demon was its tonal choices, particularly in the final act. Now, the opening shot of the film features Fanning covered in blood as she poses for modeling pictures, but the rest of the film went into a more eerie and mysterious direction rather than blood-filled drama. Much like Crimson Peak from last year, the final act takes those smaller bloody elements and turns the entire film into a grotesque take on obsession filled Hollywood.I can certainly appreciate the attempt at creating an unsettling story so that the mistakes of the 3 models and makeup stylist aren't duplicated in real life, but I just thought the tone of the film could have had a more fluid. Something The Neon Demon does very well is complement is visual flare with a brilliant and addicting soundtrack. The electronic sound that composer Cliff Martinez brought to the film was as good if not better than the score he produced for Drive in 2011. Not only does it have tracks I could listen to in my car, but it also has quite a few tracks that gave the film the thrills and horror jumps that make this one unique film going experience.Elle Fanning is also quite good as the lead character, Jesse. She's supposed to play a barely 16-year-old girl with growing confidence that may or may not get her into a little trouble. I couldn't have thought of a better fit for such a character, especially having seen Fanning early in her career, I bought into the innocence of Jesse. Overall, The Neon Demon is a visually impressive and has a little bit to say about obsession and greed, but the inconsistent tone and its overbearing style proved to be too difficult to grapple my interest.+Fanning+Visually appealing+Great score/soundtrack-Tone shifts towards the end-Didn't completely buy into the themes/ideas5.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A feast of several kinds, one of which is to its own detriment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Neon Demon" follows Jessie (Elle Fanning), a runaway teenager attempting to make it big in Los Angeles' modeling world. Her natural, ethereal beauty gains her quick successes, but a trio of industry veterans twice her age descend on her and her youthful allure.This film had been on my "must see" list for months now after having seen the dazzling, subtly creepy promotional materials, and unlike much of the film's audience, I am a newcomer to Refn's films, which have divided critics and audiences alike. The film is, needless to say, fantastic on a visual level. It is steeped in a profoundly well-conceived aesthetic, a characteristic that apparently defines Refn's films. It is a cinematographic wonder to the eyes, bathed in darkness and the neon lights of downtown Los Angeles. Set to a pulsing synth score, the film is at times reminiscent of a late '70s or early '80s horror movie, and comparisons to "Suspiria" are well-earned.The second area in which the film excels is its symbolism and concepts, which are equally rich; the premise is terrifying on a base level, and the audience can feel a disaster coming down on them as it lurches toward its twisted climax and denouement. It manages to be satisfying and chilling in its final statement, which is a potent cocktail of metaphors meeting harsh (and macabre) realities.Where the film fails to live up to its visual and thematic vigor is in its characterization. Fanning's performance as the doe-eyed, nervous teenager-cum-vain runway darling struck me as a bit of a tough sell. This is partly due to her insouciant performance, which is initially convincing, but slowly begins to buckle as the film gains momentum. It could also be because the characters surrounding her are so vividly realized, even in spite of the fact that they maybe have one quarter of her screen time. Jena Malone's performance as the obsessive makeup artist is profuse with lust and longing, while Bella Heathcote and Abbey Lee turn in phenomenally understated performances that are nuanced, skillful, and completely entrancing. I don't say this to undermine Fanning's talent, as she does a solid job overall, but as the film plunges into its second act, her character slowly becomes a void around which the women circle?the show is stolen from her, which may be an intentional thematic move on Refn's part, but it does leave a sense of imbalance. I frankly found all three antagonist's performances (especially Lee's) to be far more interesting, which seems counter-intuitive to the emotional groundwork that Fanning's character should be implanting, but never quite seems to have the chance to.In spite of this, I feel "The Neon Demon" is a worthwhile effort, and certainly one of the more mature experimental horror offerings in recent memory. It is above all an aesthetic achievement that manages to entrench its dark thematic material in a beautiful package. Fanning's characterization leaves the film a bit disproportionate as she descends into her vaingloriousness, but fortunately there is enough visual and symbolic material here to feast on with the eyes and ears as she grows peripheral to the characters around her. This eclipse may certainly be thematically appropriate to what is transpiring in the narrative, but I couldn't help but feel that it was to the detriment of the film's emotional core. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no sex or nudity worth mentioning in this macabre and boorish mess, unless you like cadaver sex or think the brief UN-erotic shower scene (both near the end) are redemptive. If we all knew the game of these psychopathic models before the final 10 minutes of the film and we had some of that narrative for the first 75 minutes, this could have been fun and engrossing but it was neither. And no, you don't get to see any Fanning skin in case that was your motivation. She is the neon demon though having just turned 16 and about as waspy a Kansas bred doe as a girl could be. The logic behind that label is only revealed at the end and is so thin it is laughable. I was chuckling audibly the last 15 minutes realizing how badly I was had. Really awful film making, stylistic visuals and film score aside.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A cocktail of sensual experience and craziness, "The Neon Demon" is a cinematic endeavor that deserves to be lived in the widest screen possible and whilst you will probably not walk out of it emotionally clear or satisfied, you will have had a mind trip in the weirdest possible directions and a physical reaction to it that is something I rarely ever get with films.Right from the opening to the very end this film is all about aesthetic and visual beauty, both explicitly and thematically. The latter part might be the less successful element of the film, but as long as this movie was playing I didn't really care. The viewer sinks into a world and no matter how dark and fuc*ed up it appears to be, I wanted more of it. Natasha Braier gives us some of the best cinematography there is: both visually breath taking and inventive in its storytelling. Come to think of it, this film is very close to Anotnioni's "Blow Up" stylistically, dialogue is barely given any importance and serves more as a connective tissue throughout the crazy journey we are taken through.To talk about the visuals in this film proves to be very difficult, both because they are so clearly and complexly assembled and thought out, both for their immense beauty and abstraction, there are a number dolly shots scattered around the film that work magnificently, with superb staging and lighting, they were definitely highlights of this visual masterpiece. Yet, the images of this film are only one part of the many that combine seamlessly in making a piece of art that overcomes its flaws with the sheer value of the overwhelming sensual and moving feelings you get to live.Cliff Martinez is just as deserving as Braier and Refn, his score is spot on with the tone of the film and ranges from unsettling and scary atmospheres to full on techno and it all molds perfectly, the way in which some parts of the film over power the sound with music pumped loud and clear to serve the story were really original and didn't bluntly imitate for example Sorrention's way of doing it, which could have been very easy, there was a unique voice behind the camera and that is always something that is good to see. Moreover, the performances are all particular and special in their own way. Elle Fanning goes to places that are uncomfortable and fascinating to see explored, Jena Malone goes even further and manages to make you buy into it. Yet the standout for me is Abbey Lee, when I first saw her last year in "Mad Max: Fury Road", I wrote in my review that she really had something special and this is the proof of it, her prescience on screen is stunning and she manages to build a character visually first.Thematically, as I said before, the film struggles to emerge, there is not a deep emotional connection established, no particular pay off nor a profound or interesting moral, yet the film clearly isn't as interested in being a traditional, three act story and that comes with both pros and cons.I wasn't turned off by anything in "The Neon Demon", I had a blast and actually could care to watch it again on the big screen and whilst I didn't get too much of an emotionally satisfying experience I definitely had a lot for my mind to process.</fullReview>

Only on a basic level, but Refn does a great job of keeping your attention and I'm still scratching my head over those last ten minutes. I thought it over-stayed its welcome, but I'm also very intrigued by those last ten minutes. They completely went over my head, it'd be great to hear some theories. Some kind of stupid dialogue and some scenes bordering on being so ridiculous as to be laughable, but overall it was a transfixing piece of work that kept me up longer than I wanted, replaying many of its scenes in my head. More than anything, I can finally say that Drive isn't the only Refn film I like, and it also continues the trend of great psychological horror this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth seeing if only for the incredible score and visual extravaganza</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been others here who have done great full reviews of the film so I'll avoid that and just try to add my own two cents.This certainly isn't Refn's best film (for me that honour still belongs to Drive) nor his second or third best. It seems like with this one he fell in love with himself, and with his persona as a director, a bit too much and started overemphasising the audiovisual aspect at the expense of story, emotional depth and character development. As good a job as some of the actors did, I simply didn't feel anything for any of the characters, not even the poor naive boyfriend, and didn't at all care what happened to them.That said the audiovisual aspect is phenomenal, even more awe-inspiring than any of Refn's other works, and it's worth seeing this film just for that. Cliff Hernandez's score particularly is just another level of analogue synthesiser heaven and by far his best work to date. It gives the film almost every bit of emotional depth it has and lifts it from an "interesting but ultimately superficial" to "exceptional and utterly unique" piece of work -- and this from someone who still bears begrudges Refn for dismissing the Johnny Jewel soundtrack for Drive in favour of Hernandez.In summary, go see it and enjoy it for what it has to offer, even if it's noticeably flawed in other ways.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>" You know how my mother used to call me? ? Dangerous" This is the sentence that will echo in your head after watching "The Neon Demon", the latest Nicolas Winding Refn film. Some people hated it and felt that this film was a waste of their time, superficial, vain, not adding anything new, not very well drawn characters, some others loved it and named Winding "The King of Ultraviolence", whatever it is, this is not a "nothing" film, it will make you feel something, can't predict if good or bad, but will definitely make you feel.Jesse, a wannabe model, moves to the "City of Angels" to become the next "big thing", but in order to achieve this, she will have to pay the price. (I don't want to go too much into the plot, as otherwise the spoiler alert will be read on each sentence I type).The film is hypnotic, mesmerizing and thought- provoking. The visuals are stunning, every frame, every shot it's obsessively measure, will make you feel as if you were watching a music video. The colour palette goes from blue and violet to white and red contribute to the mood, also helped by Cliff Martinez's soundtrack, Martinez excels here, "The Demon Dance" is a fantastic and addictive piece, perfectly suited for the film, we can feel the "Kubrick's influence" present in here.While watching the film you get transported into the universe of so many other well-known films, such as "Mulholland Drive" , "Black Swan" or "Suspiria".Is Jesse the pray or the predator? Is beauty subjective to the viewers eyes? What would you do in order to become the next Queen Bee? How long will it take until your crown is taken from you?. This and so many other questions float in the air throughout the film.The best performances are coming from the supporting cast, Elle Fanning's performance lacks strength, charisma and falls flat compare to her contenders (maybe this is done on purpose). Abbey Lee and Bella Heathcote , playing Jesse's rivals are witty, funny and poisonous , Lee has that sort of magnetism and feline demeanour that takes her character to the next level, while Heathcote tenderness and fragility creates that sort of sympathy required. We care more for the "baddies" than for the "good girl"."Neon Demon" is not perfect, it is visually as I said, but the ending doesn't make justice to the entire film, leaving a bittersweet taste in your mouth, maybe this is also intended, as this is a vehicle to tell us the story of "Cinderella at the cannibals ball".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only after i have seen Drive,I decided to watch 'The Neon Demon'. The director have shown subtly conveyed the image being put glowing triangles of Jesse bottom stage, symbolizing the desire for power, but she gradually towards. Or as Jesse met modeling scene in discos, play intense music to sound like heart beat, together with red flashing lights to signal the danger awaits available at the people she is facing. Throughout the film, each scene has a contrasting tones and the unique light, sending fully express artistic intentions of the director of the upcoming events that the characters face.Images and sounds are also a significant plus point for The Neon Demon, making the movie became a sumptuous feast of lights, costumes and sound. Beautiful costumes and picky, accompanying scenes meticulously arranged, all supported by strong soundtrack and emotional Cliff Martinez is one of the most distinctive impression that the film brings.But.. as i said too many scenes have been cut in my theater so:It's hard for me too understood all the story Nicholas Winding Refn want to say . The atmosphere of tension and the height that the movie tried to built in the first half has not been meet and solve a knot. The story in the second half seemed to not eat so much input with content is built very well in the first half of the film.However, it should be seen as The Neon Demon was quite successful in telling a horror story that doesn't need "jump scare" or ghost. It offers a look overwhelmed about frivolous fashion, glossy but contains too many contradictions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Neon Demon (2016)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Nicolas Winding Refn returns to the big screen with his lesbian cannibal necrophiliac thriller The Neon Demon that got one of Cannes infamous "boos" (which realistically means nothing). There's also this whole thing about the modeling industry too. Elle Fanning plays Jesse, a 16 year old aspiring model in LA, gets signed by an agency for her natural beauty and youth. However, as she quickly rises through the ranks, other models start to become jealous and will stop at nothing to steal her beauty and youth in a world that's literally eat or be eaten. Refn can certainly stage some elaborate visuals because the entire movie is eye candy. There's a color scheme reminiscent of Suspiria, some hypnotically beautiful visual set pieces all put alongside an awesome 80's-style synth score. Refn makes a clear distinction from the high society of the modeling industry and Jesse's real life living in a run-down motel with a sleazy owner. While the modeling world has all the fantastic visuals, the real world is portrayed in a gritty way that shows that living the high life in LA might not really be as great as one might think. The actual plot is difficult to follow at points since the story sometimes takes a backseat to the visuals, but it's interesting enough and even pretty disturbing at times that it'll keep you engaged. There's a slew of crazy scenes involving cannibalism and necrophilia that more hardcore viewers might enjoy, just don't go in expecting another Cannibal Holocaust. The disturbing parts are more subtle and slow than your usual gorefest. The ending especially will either shock you or infuriate you. The Neon Demon is going to divide its audience based on if they're willing to stomach the more difficult scenes, but it's a visually stunning, often disturbing and poignant satire of the modeling industry in Los Angeles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a marmite number I would say. In Drive, Nicola Wynding Refn made a stonewall classic that was so cool, so violent it just oozed class. No real reference points although I think some people found it reminiscent of Heat.In this latest outing however Refn is wearing his influences on his sleeve and most obvious of them all is David Lynch (in his Twin Peaks/Mullholland Drive era).Again it oozes class thanks to the superb cinematography by Natasha Braier and this astonishing electronic soundtrack (following up his Drive opus) by Cliff Martinez.It's achingly slow partly so that Braier can seduce the film's lead ( a very young looking Elle Fanning) with her camera, and boy can she look stunningly beautiful (albeit verging on Lolitaesque).The violence is slow in coming but eventually it does with an ending that smacks a little of Heathers.The story is slight. The theme is around natural beauty that only Fanning possesses. Her rivals on the catwalk world, that she breezes into in LA, have been nipped and cut to blazes in a vain attempt to preserve their once natural beauty.Needless to say, they hate her; the new Queen Bitch.Overall it feels a little voyeuristic. The treatment of Fanning verges on the uncomfortable and the plot is pretty weak. But it's a thing of beauty. An artifice. But so what?Sometimes art survives on artifice alone.This does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful film but not quite a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before going into 'The Neon Demon' I really did not know what to expect. The trailers made it look like I was about to see a beautiful movie, but as Nicolas Winding Refn's previous movie 'Only God Forgives' showed beauty is not everything. The movie states the opposite however and claims that beauty is the only thing. Well if this is true than 'The Neon Demon' should be considered as a movie that is almost close to perfection. The 'Neon' part from the title really shines throughout the movie as every scene is gorgeously lit. Furthermore almost every set is carefully constructed, when combined with the amazing soundtrack by Cliff Martinez and the neon what is left is a movie that without an accompanying story would be worth the price of admission on it's own.The movie does have a story however as it tells the tale of a fairly unknown model who goes by the name of Jesse. Jesse is one of the most beautiful women you'll ever meet. Her rise to fame is fairly quick as all of the designers and photographers want to work with her while on the other hand most of the models go to great lengths just to be more like her. The story really shines in the first half of the movie and, despite the surreal way some scenes are, seems very realistic. As the second act begins the events start to become quite abnormal and really contest the viewers suspension of disbelief as certain characters undergo an enormous shift in character. Although this was foreshadowed in earlier parts of the film it would have been a lot better if this change happened a little more gradually throughout the movie. Also even though their resolution would have no real effect on the story there were still some loose ends by the time the credits appeared on the screen.Speaking of foreshadowing the movie does this a lot. Scattered throughout the movie are a lot of breadcrumbs in terms of visual clues and a few lines of dialogue causing certain events to be foretold. The movie hardly does any hand holding however as these breadcrumbs are just large enough for the observant viewer to notice. Although I have only seen the movie once I am certain I missed a lot that were hidden in plain sight.The actress Elle Fanning who portrays Jesse does so in an amazing and unique way, with another actress in Jesse's shoes the movie probably would have turned out quite a bit differently. I hope to see more of here as she certainly established herself in a leading role. Supporting Ella Fanning is Jena Malone as well as Bella Heathcote and Keanu Reeves. Although Malone's performance really sticks out amongst the four they all acted out their role extremely well.Overall I can say that 'The Neon Demon' is a real treat for those who enjoyed Nicalas Winding Refn's previous movies or are fond of artsy movies in general. The movie is well acted, well directed with an amazing soundtrack on top of it all. Beauty is certainly not it's only thing!My rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Neon Demon (2016) *** (out of 4) Sixteen-year-old Jesse (Elle Fanning) arrives in Hollywood with big dreams of becoming a famous model but soon she realizes there is always a price to pay.In my opinion Nicolas Winding Refn's DRIVE was one of the best movies from the past couple decades and he followed that up with the so-great-it's-awful or so-awful-it's-great ONLY GOD FORGIVES. As strange as that film was there's really nothing that can prepare you for THE NEON DEMON. I'm not going to spend too much time on the plot but lets just say that the less you know the better. In fact, revealing too much plot would ruin some fairly bizarre twists so be sure you don't read too much detail.As far as the film goes, it's visually a masterpiece and technically it's one of the greatest films from recent memory. The film certainly has a very European feel to it and it appears that the director was inspired by various Italian filmmakers including Dario Argento and Mario Bava. I can't help but think that SUSPIRIA was a major influence and especially the visual look of the film as well as how the music plays in the madness. The cinematography here is among the best that you'll see in any movie and there's no doubt that the director knows how to make something surreal and bizarre.The story itself is one we've seen countless times before. We learn that Hollywood is evil. Women are sadistic on each other and especially their looks. Men are perverted creeps. The film will probably "say" something different to everyone who watches it but I do think there were some major plus. One being that the film takes way too long to get to where it's going. I thought the build up to the final act dragged on a tad bit too long and I think a shorter film probably would have really helped the psychological aspect of the film.One of the greatest things about the movie was the performance of Fanning. I was really shocked at how wonderful she was in the film because she's basically playing a naive and innocent girl who finds herself in a world she's just not ready for. The way Fanning showed off her innocence was really something remarkable and her transformation works extremely well and it's very believable. Christina Hendricks, Jena Malone, Bella Heathcote and Karl Glusman are all extremely good as well. Both Abbey Lee and Keanu Reeves are also very good in their supporting roles.Again, I'm not going to spoil anything but the entire film is downright strange and surreal but the final act takes a turn that will have most people leaving the theater, if they're still even there. This certainly isn't going to be a film for everyone and like the director's previous movies it's easy to see how people would walk out very early on. Those who don't mind challenging movies will certainly find a lot of great things here but I only wish it had been a little bit tighter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The weak, lazy third act undoes around 70 minutes of unnerving slow burn ambiance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Neon Demon is the new film from Nicolas Winding Refn, the Danish auteur best known for his blood-spattered fetishisation of Ryan Gosling. The film's not released until 8 July, but I was fortunate enough to attend a preview screening and Q&amp;A with Refn, or NWF as he's now calling himself, at Manchester's HOME cinema.Let's begin by saying that it is a marked improvement on his last work Only God Forgives, the Bangkok-set misfire which strew terrible characters, terrible dialogue and dull Oedipal metaphors over 90 tedious minutes.For The Neon Demon, Refn has left Thailand and taken us back to Los Angeles, the sprawling city that Newton Thomas Sigel photographed so beautifully in Drive. Sigel hasn't returned but Natasha Braier, his Argentine replacement known for her work on The Road, provides similarly dazzling visuals, from sweeping shots of the dusky Los Angeles basin to surreal and sparkling strobe-lit sequences.Composer Cliff Martinez supports Braier's sterling work in his third collaboration with Refn. He has produced a goosefleshingly brilliant medley of industrial electronica that sends its heavy, menacing baselines thudding through your body. Indeed, Martinez has probably outperformed his director for the second time in a row.At the centre of this audio-visual spectacle is Jesse (Elle Fanning), a wholesome young girl whose angelic, virginal beauty sends her hurtling to the top of the modelling industry, much to the catty chagrin of Gigi (Bella Heathcote) and Sarah (Abbey Lee).Gigi has been cut, sliced and hammered into shape by LA's most esteemed surgeons, and she'll proudly tell anyone who listens. Heathcote's outrageously defined jawline delivers much of her performance, but she also effectively creates an artificial wide- eyed façade that barely masks a desperate insecurity and venomous jealousy.Rather than being artificial, Australian supermodel Abbey Lee is often just plain wooden as Sarah, the more overtly bitchy of the pair. Lee's dollish face has an emotional vacuity that's appropriate for the character, but her line delivery is regularly stilted. However, she does shine in a scene where she breaks down in front of Jesse, asking what it's like to have that 'thing' that gets you noticed. Lee's steady improvement is a reflection of Refn's preference to shoot chronologically.Gigi and Sarah are the primary antagonists of a toxic industry that wants to sink its teeth into young Jesse and suck all the life out of her. It is only Ruby (Jena Malone), a make-up artist, who appears to have Jesse's best interest at heart. But even Ruby's intentions are dubious, as there are disconcerting sexual overtones to her friendliness.Perhaps the greatest danger of all is Hank (Keanu Reeves), the thuggish sexual predator who runs the dodgy motel Jesse's staying in. Sleaze sweats from every pore of Reeves's gruff face as he leers and intimidates Jesse and Dean (Karl Glusman), an amateur and affable young photographer who Jesse has firmly friend-zoned.All of these thoroughly malevolent individuals cast a menacing shadow over young Jesse. If she isn't sabotaged Showgirls-style at work, she might be shanked to the sound of Bernard Herrmann's strings in the motel shower. Despite this, it does not feel like a horror film, it's really a warped social commentary, a bit like Cronenberg's Maps to the Stars, only without the humour and scathing satire.The Neon Demon becomes more of a horror film in the final 20 minutes or so, which is when everything falls apart. After about 90 minutes of preamble, Refn undoes the slow-burn tension with a lazy denouement that indulges his crude metaphors of the beauty industry's 'cannibalism'.Fanning has said that the ending was created and improvised on set, and it really does show. Instead of remaining ground in reality, which the film generally does up until this point, Refn takes the easy route by falling back on viscera of the comically supernatural variety. Some Refn fans will sneer at such criticism and hark on about the grand symbolic value, but not only is the fashion industry an easy target for derision, but the metaphors are flat, too.This is the problem with Refn ? he's prone to pseudo-intellectualism. For example, during the Q&amp;A session he said that the main reason for making the film was to live out his fantasy of being a young girl, concluding with total certainty that 'there is a 16- year-old girl in all of us'. Speak for yourself, Nick. He continued to delve into his strange brand of pop-psychology, dubbing himself as a 'sadist' in his profession but a 'masochist' in his home, because his wife and two daughters outnumber him. This is a pretentious and somewhat incestuous way of saying his wife wears the trousers.He also spoke about directing Jena Malone in the film's most sexually explicit scene, asking her to spit there and rub that. Some would say he was blurring the lines between film director and porn director, between Ron Howard and Ron Jeremy, but Refn said that 'it was all okay, because we found her character together.' This is such guff, Nick ? you were getting off on it! Refn has, after all, confessed in the past that he's a 'pornographer' who makes films based on what excites him.Perhaps the most interesting thing Refn said during the Q&amp;A was that he considers Richard E. Grant to be a 'c*nt', which after seeing Withnail and I, is something I think I can agree with.Thematically and metaphorically speaking, The Neon Demon is about as shallow as the industry it critiques. But Fanning's endearing lead performance, Natasha Braier's stunning camera-work and the ambiance of Cliff Martinez's score make it a film worth watching on the big screen, especially in Cinema One at the brilliant Manchester HOME.3/5www.vulturehound.co.ukwww.hawkensian.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird, Disturbing, and Visually Extravagant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is listed as a horror film, and while it has it's moments, they are all crammed in at the very end. When it does shift more into horror territory, it becomes some of the most disturbing and crazy stuff Refn has put to film (which says a lot). Up to that point though, it's just the story of a girl finding success at the chagrin of those around her, and her evolution from an innocent and shy teenager to a proud and narcissistic fashion model.Visually, and unsurprisingly, Neon Demon is a masterpiece. There's a lot going on, and the sheer amount of longshots just pause the movie to make sure you devour every detail there is to offer. Colour is used to wonderful effect to illicit moods and moments of significance. Blue and Red have a big part to play in particular, signifying the shift of both character and movie from innocent to chaotic. Green, as well, plays a big part, and is only used once at the end. Space and composition play a big part as well. There are a number of shots with the subject placed centrally, and the space around either filled with blackness or interesting architecture. The opening shot uses space really well, expanding it around the subject and revealing the almost amateur quality of the studio. This is juxtaposed fantastically later on when Jesse enters a professional studio. Everything is white and clinical, and the amount of space is vast. There often isn't anything to see of the room itself; no windows, no bricks, just white (and later solid black when the lights are turned out).Character-wise, I found a lot more to digest in Neon Demon than I anticipated. Elle Fanning does brilliantly as Jesse, encapsulating that innocent country girl vibe early on, and slowly evolving it as she gets more successful, and her looks start to go to her head. By the end her smile is more menacing than sweet, and her whole stature a lot more "dangerous" (as she describes herself). Bella Heathcote and Abbey Lee are also great as the two envious models Gigi and Sarah respectively. Gigi is a lot more forthcoming and two-faced, possibly embodying the more stereotypical idea of models with her obsession of plastic surgery and trying to look perfect. Abbey Lee is a much more menacing presence, with cold blue eyes that puncture those around her and hide something psychopathic behind them. Jena Malone probably steals the show as Ruby though. Ruby befriends Jesse early on, and guides her into and through the big league. Ruby gets a lot of development as a character, with many inconsequential scenes signposting more disturbing twists that occur later on. For example, the way she looks at Jesse is less like the daggers Sarah offers, and more like the stares she receives from male characters. This gives her a slight edge of lesbianism that plays a bigger part later on, but is never outwardly stated until that moment. Similarly she moonlights as make-up artist at a morgue, dressing corpses up ready for their funerals, signifying she has no qualms with gore and dead bodies. The degree to which she feels comfortable with the dead made me fear what she might be capable of.The various male characters are treated very differently to the female characters. They all appear slimy with long voyeuristic stares. Not only does this paint the male characters as somewhat unlikeable and give the female characters more focus, but it also helps the movie drive home it's message about society's obsession with beauty; an obsession that is driven primarily by male eyes and the objectification of women. Karl Glusman is the first male to appear, and it's with a creepy stare as he watches Jesse, the subject of his photography. Dean turns out to actually be a nice guy, but this shows that even he is susceptible to the lure of female beauty. Desmond Harrington is brilliantly unnerving as the professional photographer Jack. Again he has an unflinching stare as if he's undressing his subjects with his eyes, and his gaunt appearance gives him just enough of a creepy look about him that you dread what he might do when he orders everyone to leave his studio. Keanu Reeves plays against typecast as the douchebag manger of Jesse's motel. Again he can't keep his eyes off Jesse or her assests, constantly looking her up and down and checking her out, but his antagonism extends beyond that. Reeves oozes that darker side so effortlessly that you forget he ever played good guys.Neon Demon is a bit of a tough movie to judge objectively. To some people, it'll play as a boring and pretentious piece of cinema that serves no purpose other than to show off some pretty pictures, while others will hail it a masterpiece filled with ingenious storytelling techniques that bubble in the subtext. Of course being a Refn fan, I went in expecting the latter, and I can't say I was overly disappointed. There's a lot to take in, and while the plot itself is fairly linear, it becomes a little confusing by the end. There's a lot that isn't explained (like how did the wildcat get in Jesse's motel room? Who put it there, and why?), and the third act just takes such a sudden nose-dive in tone that it can feel a little jarring and played for shock value, no matter how well it was signposted throughout. I give it a deep and insightful, if a little messy 8/10. I certainly wouldn't just recommend it to anyone though.</fullReview>

Artistic DIrection was faultless , only spoilt by one scene which could have been cut as it need not have happened and does not contribute to the films artistic merit . The use of mirrors, neon lighting , was spectacular , the gore did not really worry me that much as I was prepared for it .I came away asking what was the real plot?

		<fullReview>"The Neon Demon" is an art film that at least some people will probably find boring. It's not heavy on story or character development and it's not fast-paced. Personally, I loved it. It's visually spectacular and weird. I wasn't expecting to see lesbian necrophilia, but this film shows it. I'm not kidding. I don't understand *why* there's lesbian necrophilia. Weirdness for the sake of weirdness, maybe? I guess I was a bit shocked by it. Thankfully, it's only in the film briefly. Plus, I'm not against weirdness for the sake of weirdness.The film's about a teenage girl named Jesse, played by Elle Fanning. Jesse is an aspiring model who moved to L.A. She lives in a motel room by herself. Somehow, a cougar gets inside the room. Did someone put it there? I have no idea. It's never explained. Artistically speaking, is that good or bad? Well, I like ambiguity when it's done right and I think this film did it right. The cougar is probably meant to be symbolic. If that's the case, I'm not sure what it's symbolic of.Writer/director Nicolas Winding Refn previously directed "Drive", which is really good, in my opinion. It's well-acted, it looks great, and the music's great. Same with "The Neon Demon". However, if you're expecting this movie to be like "Drive", you'll probably be disappointed. They're pretty different. "The Neon Demon" is kind of like a beautiful dream. If you like art films and you don't mind a noncomprehensive story and a lack of character development, you might enjoy this one. What I didn't like about it is that it felt *a bit* too long and the eye that someone regurgitates at the end (yes, that happens) looked fake. Nevertheless, the film was quite an experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something Lurking Beneath the Surface</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this film is like experiencing some kind of twisted dream. Interestingly this dream is frighteningly close to reality in its portrayal of our modern world. We want easy access acquisition of everything these days. No long-term investment of time or money appeals to us. We want a quick fix. We move hastily and find it tiring to dig past the surface. This film is a shot of adrenaline. The most horrifying thing about The Neon Demon is how well it plays with society's obsession with all things external. It hammers on the head of our fixations of youth, sex, and violence with blunt force. It proves us shallow as we are utterly mystified by the visuals but repulsed by the horror on display. This review is being written after my second viewing and with it comes a better understanding of the film. There is an overwhelming deluge of sensory information in this film, it is practically numbing to witness. See it twice in the theater if you can. It is my belief that the story is never meant to focus on one particular character. Jesse is a Trojan Horse into this mad world - this all too real world. All of the performances are frighteningly simple and easy to understand. The characters are laughable and precise. This is the ultimate experiment in voyeurism. As a viewer you are a voyeur into a depraved world structured carefully by Refn. His film deals with modern surface-level existence. It showcases a group of models and their problems in their dangerous world. It is a crazy place that cannot be defined with words, therefore Refn chooses to make his music tell most of its story. The Neon Demon is rock hard candy. It is dream fuel. It is a mirror we all look into.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jaw-droppingly beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Neon Demon" is the newest film by polarizing director Nicolas Winding Refn, who made the critically acclaimed "Drive," and the critically panned "Only God Forgives." With "The Neon Demon," Refn returns to make a bold film that some people love because of its dreamlike aesthetics and messages about the fashion industry, and others absolutely hate for its supposed lack of substance and perverse content. On one hand, it makes sense why people wouldn't like this movie. It's disturbing, it's slow (but never boring), the characters are unlikeable, and the film has a very minimalistic story. But on the other hand, this movie is magnetic. From start to finish your eyes will be glued to the screen, with your jaw agape in absolute awe of how incredibly stunning this movie is to look at. Elle Fanning plays Jesse, a 16 year old model who breaks into the fashion world with a bang because of her natural, unadulterated beauty. Jesse almost immediately gains the attention of professional photographers, modeling agencies, and basically everyone she comes across because of the fact that she radiates innocence, goodness, and, of course, beauty. This quickly makes Gigi and Sarah, the more experienced, more hardened models, jealous, as Jesse makes it big almost immediately with no effort, while they actually have to work at staying pretty.That is basically the plot of the film, and while it's not incredibly deep or complex, it is consistently interesting and never boring because of just how unpredictable this movie is. From the cast of characters (Keanu Reeves is fantastic in this, playing a dark and hilarious role, and Jena Malone completely steals the entire film as Ruby), to the surreal fashion runway sequences, to the clinically insane third act, you'll never be able to guess what is hiding around the corner."The Neon Demon" is easily one of the most gorgeous films of this year. The colors, the clothing, the sets, the music, the actresses, the violence; everything about this film just screams pretty. This movie is basically a two hour long feast for the eyes and for the ears, and because of this one could say that this movie is the epitome of style over substance. But is that really a bad thing? In a film that depicts the superficiality, vanity, and on-the-surface beauty of the fashion industry by being superficial, vain, and beautiful on the surface, the answer is no.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most movies serve as entertainment. Many serve as stories. Others serve as messages. And some serve as works of art. The ones that serve as art sometimes, but not always, receive negative reviews and feedback from critics and audiences alike. These are movies like Only God Forgives (2013) and The Tree of Life (2011). And The Neon Demon (2016) is, without a single doubt, a work of art.I gave this the same score I gave Only God Forgives (2013), but really, this kicks that movie's ass. I was slightly worried that this was gonna be a knock off of Only God Forgives (2013). The trailers made it look like it could be. But this movie is something else. Something different from anything from Nicolas Winding Refn. Something different from any other movie I've ever seen. And something beautiful.This review is purposefully short and vague because I think this movie is best experienced when you know nothing about it. This was a one-of-a-kind experience that you absolutely need to experience in theaters. Just don't take mom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Experimental film director Nicolas Winding Refn gives us his newest film The Neon Demon, all about a young girl trying to make it big in the fashion world of Los Angeles but other models grow jealous of her and she soon starts to develop enemies. I've watched the red band trailer for this film about twice a day (seriously, no joke!), the music, the mood, the mystery, the god damn cinematography...and that's just the trailer. Does the film live up to the trailer? Yes, an overwhelming yes! Never have I seen a film so hypnotising, so psychologically disturbing and so jaw-dropping. Elle Fanning gives the performance of her career, Jena Malone gives the performance of her career, heck everyone does. The cinematography is gorgeous, the shots are just effortless and the visuals used throughout the film are so entrancing. The soundtrack is straight up my kind of soundtrack (it's so good, I've already downloaded it), electronic/trance tracks that match the psychedelic modelling world the film conveys. I do have to talk about the final third act of the film...literally so disturbing that I had my hand to my mouth the whole way through. Extremely brave, definitely warrants the 18 rated certificate here in the UK. Overall, an experimental film that I can only imagine some viewers will love and some will hate but with fantastic performances, beautiful cinematography and jaw-dropping scenes, I highly recommend you watch this one as it deserves to be watched (even just for the sheer bravery of Refn's work).- Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an interesting art film, that is not your typical mainstream, mass-produced "feel good movie". Instead, it is dark, complex, and cynical. Solid acting from Elle Fanning and Christina Hendricks. They are both beautiful and talented. The film has a great soundtrack and integrates the music into the story line.It uses various metaphors throughout the film to communicate ideas and philosophies, but most of these will not be understood by dim-witted members of the audience (feminist types) who will simply bash the movie and complain about the female nudity and call it "sexually depraved" or "exploitative" or other such nonsense. Obviously, people who say such things are not well educated or intelligent, and are the kind of insecure women who stamp their feet and have a little tantrum anytime a movie shows a bit of female skin. The nudity in the film is mostly near the end, primarily during a scene where a woman engages in implied sex with a corpse. The "corpse" was obviously a live human actress pretending to be dead, and no actual sex was shown, so its nothing really that bad. We did get to see some female genitalia (a bit of vulva/labia was briefly seen for a couple of seconds) which was refreshing, since most movies nowadays only show male genitalia. The scene certainly made sense in relation to the context of the film, and I'm surprised that anybody would get their knickers in a knot over it. There was also a scene that showed women bathing in blood and implied cannibalism. This was related to several concepts, including references to bathing in the blood of a young virgin to maintain youth and beauty (which references the countess Elizabeth Bathory), and the tribal idea that if you kill and eat your enemy, you consume their power and it becomes part of you. There are also references to the maxim "Truth is beauty, and beauty is truth", narcissism, shallowness, transformation, etc. The movie will NOT make you feel good; that's not its intention. Its designed to make you think. People who gave it a 1/10 rating obviously were unable to see beyond their own prudish prejudices and sexist/feminist intellectual limitations to understand the deeper metaphors and ideas the film was trying to communicate. So dumb, close-minded people should avoid this film. For the rest of us, I give it an 8/10. The film would have done a lot better if it had more television advertising and better marketing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a cruel, cruel world, and Nicolas Winding Refn disturbingly captures it in his own cruel, cruel way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think THE NEON DEMON is a fabulous horror that many would mistakenly file under a WTF film. Writer/director Nicolas Winding Refn is one of the few original voices out there, I've been a fan of his work for quite some time and this latest, THE NEON DEMON is nothing short of fascinating. Mysteriously sexy, hypnotic, shocking and scary yet very irresistible. It allures you, it seduces you and ultimately it devours you.Elle Fanning plays an aspiring model named Jesse, your typical small town U.S.A girl who moves to Los Angeles in pursuit of her dream. Things start to go well for her, so well that other girls in the business start to see her as a threat. Turns out, there's something about her youth and vitality that leaves some in awe and others in hatred.Let me say that Elle Fanning is a remarkable young talent, she's so captivating on screen, to the point where at times I don't even remember anymore that she actually has a sister, Dakota, who used to be in a string of big budget movies. As the aspiring model Jesse, you can see Fanning's wide range of skills on display as she goes through Jesse's arc from innocent to dangerous. It's quite amusing to see Jena Malone, Abbey Lee, and Bella Heathcote play these supporting characters who are basically jealous of Elle Fanning's beauty, I say amusing because my goodness, Jena, Abbey, Bella and Elle are all beautiful in my book, any guy would be damn lucky to be in the company of those four gorgeous ladies.But watching THE NEON DEMON is a total mind-trip, so many colors and so many artistic or creative choices that may seem brazen but they fit the story well. Refn is never one to shy away from experimenting with new possibilities and illustrations just to get his point across, even with the accompaniment of graphic violence. Like a fly that can't keep its eyes off of a UV light, that's how the audiences will be fixated on this film. That said, at the very heart of it, THE NEON DEMON speaks about society's view on youth and beauty, especially when it comes to women. It's no secret that when one hits a certain age, even when she still looks fine by regular standard, all of a sudden, certain industries no longer see her as beautiful. I'm reminded of that classic fairy tale when the mirror tells the witch she's not the fairest of them all, THE NEON DEMON also depicts the ruthlessness of the competition that comes out of such deep envy. It's a cruel, cruel world, and Refn disturbingly captures it in his own cruel, cruel way.-- Rama's Screen --</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Neon Demon on Acid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in the high stakes, debatably vain and fabricated world of fashion, "The Neon Demon" is Nicolas Winding Refn's take on external beauty and the ultimate effects it brings to those who make or try to make a living exclusively out of it. Relying on formulaic plot schematics to move the story along Refn again presents a film that makes the viewer question whether he is in fact valuing style over substance or if there is something else on his mind. To fully appreciate "The Neon Demon" one must acknowledge that this is no ordinary film as this is no ordinary director: love him or hate him, Refn is an auteur in his own right and a true visionary. His predominant surrealistic approach pulls away most people but others are inexplicably drawn in. I can't honestly say that I loved or hated the film. I was drawn in by its surrealistic approach, the haunting cinematography and soundtrack, despite some extremely embarrassing dialogue exchanges and cringe worthy performances at times.Some films are not meant to be watched as straightforward closed product; they are meant to be digested subjectively as you would a different piece of art. "Demon" could have been the ultimate film about the fashion beauty industry and its carnivorous (!) repercussions if only it had been filtered down and conveniently edited, but that isn't what Refn is about as an artist or what he intended for the audience. He did not (and never has before) tried to appeal the masses, he is merely projecting what he is and what he would want to see in a film and that is not wrong at all. Again, love it or hate it, Refn couldn't care less.</fullReview>

The writing is superb throughout the film as it will take at least one more viewing for me at least to fully appreciate all of the clever uses of foreshadowing, symbolism, etc. I was glued to my seat wondering what will happen to Jesse as she aspires for greatness. But I was also interested in all the characters as well. Everyone played a part that added to the story that made you wonder "what are they going to do next". Even Keanu Reeves was great as the dark comic relieve.The scene stealer in this movie for me was Jena Malone as Ruby. I believe she desires at least consideration for a Best Supporting Actress nomination. That character will definitely be in the back of my mind for awhile, put it simply she gave me chills.I wouldn't recommend this movie to the faint of heart as the blood and gore is definitely used a good amount. If I would compare this to another movie just so you can get an idea of what you are getting into, I would say Black Swan. But even the Black Swan is a light movie compared to this. The Neon Demon is very dark in tone but a very beautifully bright picture that should not be missed by fans of horror or people who love movies with a dark theme.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is, like most Refn films, a parable on one aspect of modern- day life. This time around it is obsession with beauty. Wonderfully shot, combined with one of the best soundtracks of recent years, this is a MUST see for everyone that likes Refn's other works.Don't expect tempo, don't expect complex dialogues, however in what Refn delivers he is a pure genius! I have seen the movie yesterday in Karlsruhe, Germany and haven't felt better entertained since Taratninos Hateful 8.110 Minutes of sheer art!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Is that your real nose?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very first seconds of the film, as techno music thunders - hoping to sound either modern or like a John Carpenter production - it's evident that "The Neon Demon" is going to be strange. The most recent example of this disquieting setup appeared in "Under the Skin"; but the obvious comparison here is "Black Swan," particularly as the modeling industry draws parallels to the apparent cutthroat nature of ballerinas and the psychological deteriorations that can occur with achieving supremacy. But rather than showing the stresses and the physical sacrifices undertaken to dance at the apex of the business, "The Neon Demon" skips over must of the visual details necessary to establish those extremes (there are no runway shows or photo shoots - at least not in the traditional sense). Instead, this picture is all about the character's actions toward one another, and how they are mentally transformed by the drive not just to be beautiful, but also to be the most beautiful.The opening scene does establish the brutal nature of modeling, but with the routine misdirection of the 16 year-old Jesse (Elle Fanning) lying in a pool of blood, throat slashed, and eyes glazed over - though merely posing for a macabre photo shoot. Jesse (sporting a "deer in the headlights" look) may have just arrived in Los Angeles, residing in a trashy motel in Pasadena (run by a creepy Keanu Reeves, oddly emoting more than the rest of the cast), but she's destined for stardom. Immediately signed to the Roberta Hoffman agency (by potential-screener Christina Hendricks), despised by fellow models Gigi (Bella Heathcote) and Sarah (Abbey Lee), and befriended by makeup artist Ruby (Jena Malone), Jesse is in over her head but overwhelmingly charged and rejuvenated by the attention she receives from everyone around her.After meeting Ruby, Jesse is whisked away to a hip party, wherein director Nicolas Winding Refn can abuse his familiarity with strobe lights, psychedelic flashes of color, slow-motion, and bondage. He tries very hard to create a style through overwrought visuals, but it's at great cost to the narrative, which drags terribly and meanders toward its uninspiring resolution. The problem with Refn's efforts is that while he thinks he's being artistic, his use of symbolism is actually dreadfully obvious and overstated; it completely lacks the subtlety necessary to impart poignancy or innovation. Despite injecting the immoderately plain plot with controversial (or certainly vivid) concepts like vampirism, necrophilia, and cannibalism - all literal images that blatantly represent the soul-sucking influences of competition, rejection, and ascendancy - there's nothing clever beneath all the graphic sexuality and violence (most of which leans toward easy body horror or laugh-out-loud absurdities like dog-eat-dog/devouring-rivals motifs or the legends of Countess Elizabeth Bathory)."God I love this color on me." The dialogue is supposed to be authentic, but it sounds incredibly hackneyed. "I would never say you're fat" and "Is that your real nose?" are intended to betray the doublespeak, the vapidness, or the thinly veiled insults of peers, except that they're too common to indicate creativity. All the talk of boyfriends, plastic surgery, and sex fail to breathe life into the characters or even create brief moments of comic relief. Instead, this banal yarn about innocence lost becomes almost sleep-inducing with all of the abrasive music, cinematography, and editing that attempt to turn every moment into a dream sequence. To its credit, the film does generate a decent atmosphere, with stretched, widescreen shots that keep the focus to one end or the other for a perpetual sense of disorientation - or the notion that something could spontaneously jump into frame. Unfortunately, nothing ever does. When characters start drawing on mirrors with lipstick, it's evident that everything is only going downhill from there - both in mental acuity and in fertile filmmaking.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<fullReview>10 Leafs - A Perfect Pot Movie Taskit and I medicated on a Colorado Grape hash parfait across a bed of White Rhino before seeing this late show Saturday night and it was phenomenal! There is a long tradition with us since we lived in Austin involving medicating to European Horror movies from back in the day, as the visuals and music combine into an extra-sensory experience when communing with the plant. Neon Demon takes the themes of Jean Rollin's films, particularly Fascination, and presents it through a visual palette like that of Dario Argento's Inferno. It is a trip that keeps on tripping all throughout the movie. Jena Malone deserves a Best Supporting Actress award for this film. Remember, it is a horror movie, and the last act had audience members pleading with the screen to stop. We are going to see it on the big screen at least 3 more times, like we did Drive, next time with Pineapple Express lollipops. Medicate and go see this big, you will fly forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of the director's past movies Bronson, Valhalla Rising and Drive. If you haven't seen those movies then you may not be expecting the style of this movie. It is very subtle yet in your face. Visually hypnotizing with a soundtrack to match and some disturbing scenes to top it off. Not everything is explained, not everything makes sense and yet I want more. I have been thinking about the movie for the past two days now and I can't wait to see it again. If you need a lot of exposition in movies, then this isn't for you but if you are in for something unique, visually stunning and all around entertaining then I suggest you support this movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Neon Demon' is the latest film from director Nicolas Winding Refn. Much like his previous movie 'Only God Forgives', this one is quite polarizing. It seems that early screenings had people either cheering or straight up booing. For me I'm kind of right down the middle. The film is about a young girl that is trying to break into the world of modeling. After she signs with an agent she starts getting work at an alarming rate. Needless to say this makes the other models, who have been working for far longer, pretty upset. And that's the basic run down of this films story.Of course if that was the only thing that the story had to offer I probably would be one of the people that did not like this. Even though many people hate on Refn's latest two films, I can't say they are bad movies. Did I really enjoy either of them? Not really. But when watching this movie it's impossible for me to ignore the technical craft behind it.Because this film is absolutely beautiful to look at. The production design, color grading, and lighting is all incredibly well done. Each scene is set up in the most perfect way. This is what I appreciate most about Refns work. His natural knack for style is something that you don't get to see very often.Top that off with excellent cinematography and a superb soundtrack and you have a movie that is a sensory masterpiece. Where I want to focus most is on this films story though. Because it has me at a cross road. There are a lot of things that work well inside that story and a lot of things that just don't. For one, the message that it is trying to convey is actually really great. It talks about how far some people will go for fame and fortune. Whilst also harping on how beauty is perceived in our culture today. One of the best scenes in the movie is when a fashion designer is arguing with someone about how beauty is the only thing that matters. It did a great job of putting into perspective how little people care about personal identity. This created an interesting contrast with the films characters. Not one single person had any kind of personality to be found. While I wish that this was an intentional choice, it never really goes any deeper into the beauty is everything argument. Which makes me think that this was not something done on purpose.Without anyone remotely interesting this film is very hard to sit through. I found myself constantly checking my watch or playing with my on fingers in order to pass the time better. It tries so hard to be something different that it forgets to do the most basic thing, make even pacing. Until the last act of the movie, the pacing is all over the place. The first half of the movie pretends to be a generic underdog type story and last half a completely unique visual metaphor. &#x200b; Without anything holding your attention the last act of the film feels way out of left field. It introduces new character motives that don't go anywhere, new plot points that feel forced, and not so subtle visual symbolism. I was never confused about the symbolism the movie introduced but, by the end, none of it paid off. Everything ended up feeling crammed into place without much thought of why it should be there. As I left the theater, I was left with a dry taste in my mouth. Not only because the last thirty minutes are pure shock value but because I felt like nothing really went anywhere. It's a movie that has a lot to say, and while some of it works, the majority feels forced and poorly evened out. It wasted the visual style and overall technical achievements with bland, uneven storytelling. 'The Neon Demon' begs to be talked about and I will talk about it, but probably not in the way Refn intended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-The Neon Demon is a 2016 internationally co-produced psychological thriller film directed by Nicolas Winding Refn and co-written by Mary Laws and Refn and starring Elle Fanning, Christina Hendricks and Keanu Reeves. The plot follows an aspiring model in Los Angeles whose beauty and youth place her in significant danger amongst the women she becomes associated with in the industry, who are murderous and dangerous.-In April 2016, it was announced that the film would compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, making the film the third consecutive film directed by Refn to compete for the Palme d'Or, following Drive and Only God Forgives.--Soundtrack: -Composer Cliff Martinez, who collaborated with director Refn on Drive, stated the films have similar styles, musically speaking, noting that for The Neon Demon he sought a "sparse electronic score." stated in an interview that the first half of the film resembles "a melodrama like Valley of the Dolls, and the second half is like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre." The soundtrack for the film will be released on June 24, 2016, physically and through digital download, before being released on Vinyl on July 8, 2016, by Milan Records. Sia composed an original song for the film titled Waving Goodbye. On 24 May 2016 at the Cannes Soundtrack 2016 awards, Cliff Martinez was recognised best composer of the Cannes film festival for his soundtrack to The Neon Demon.--Critical response: -The Neon Demon received mixed reviews from film critics. It holds a 47% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 34 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 57 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".-Owen Gleiberman of Variety gave the film a positive review writing : "A horror film is what The Neon Demon is (sort of). It's set in the Los Angeles fashion world, and it's the kind of movie in which models look like mannequins that look like slasher-film corpses, and corpses look like love objects. Beauty mingles with mangled flesh, and each fastidiously slick image seems to have come out of Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me or The Shining or a very sick version of a Calvin Klein commercial. Every scene, every shot, every line of dialogue, every pause is so hypnotically composed, so luxuriously overdeliberate, that the audience can't help but assume that Refn knows exactly what he's doing ? that he's setting us up for the kill."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Polarizing Film By Nicolas Winding Refn, And I Loved Every Minute Of It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In September 2011, I saw a film by Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn, who up until that point was known for his gritty crime thrillers like the Pusher Trilogy (1996-2005) and Bronson (2008). That particular film was called Drive (2011), and the critics adored it so much at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival that it earned Refn the award for Best Director. Drive was only a modest box office success at the time, as many audience members had been expecting an action-packed heist film in the vein of The Fast &amp; The Furious. I understood that Refn was creating a small character-driven story, but it seemed like a lot of people just didn't get it, and the film ultimately left my local theater after just two weeks, and was completely ignored at the Academy Awards that year. Thankfully, Drive has spent the past five years growing into one of the most adored films of the decade. It helped make actors like Ryan Gosling, Oscar Isaac, and Carey Mulligan become household names, whilst it gave others like Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks, and Ron Perlman some of the best performances of their careers. With it's simple, but investing story, gorgeous visuals, editing, and of course Cliff Martinez's classic 80s-inspired soundtrack, Drive has become one of my all-time favorite movies, and I, like many, couldn't wait for what Refn would come up with next.in 2013, I got my wish, as Refn released a new film, Only God Forgives (2013), a film that also starred Ryan Gosling. It had everything that made Drive great; fantastic visuals, editing and cinematography, and another inspired soundtrack by Martinez. Everyone waited for the word from critics at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival to sing praises of Refn's latest magnum opus...and ultimately, the critics were not so kind to it.In fact, from what I heard and read, some critics outright despised it. I heard stories of the film being simultaneously booed and praised at Cannes. Many complained that Refn had made a film that had no point, and that it was just an exercise in his own artistic pretentiousness and the desire to show gratuitous violence. The film regrettably came nowhere close to my local theater, so I had to wait for it to come out on video before I could watch it, and I'll admit that I loved it. Refn did what he promised, take the style of Drive and amplify it. He didn't care if he drove critics or fans away, because he wanted to make movies that appealed to him and not a studio system, and I came to admire him for it.Now, it's 2016, and Refn has returned with his latest film The Neon Demon (2016), and like his previous effort, it has received polarizing reviews. Once again, Refn has made a film that was either booed or applauded by critics at Cannes, and it seems to have divided audiences down the middle; it's either seen as a scathing criticism of the modeling industry in Los Angeles, or a pretentious wanna-be horror film that focuses on scenes of graphic violence and...other activities involving violence that I will not dare spoil, despite the insistence of many top critics to do so.The Neon Demon is the story about a young model named Jesse (Elle Fanning), who arrives in Los Angeles and is quickly viewed as "the next big thing". She has it all; the looks, the style, the walk, etc. Everyone praises her for her natural beauty and skill, and how she does not need to rely on body modification, or usage of drugs and sex to get the best gigs at fashion shows or photo shoots. Naturally, this draws the attention of older, and less-than-perfect models/make-up artists Ruby (Jena Malone), Gigi (Bella Heathcote) and Sarah (Abbey Lee), and eventually reveals their obvious jealousy and rage that could potentially put Jesse, who becomes enamored with the prestige and high-life, in mortal danger.I will not say any more because that would be spoiling, and I believe this is a film that needs to be seen to be believed. The Neon Demon has all the hallmarks of a Refn film I could want. It looks incredible (I could literally put frames from this film on my wall), it sounds incredible, once again thanks to another phenomenal soundtrack by Cliff Martinez, the performances from everyone are spot-on, including a surprise turn to the sinister by Keanu Reeves (who I swear is having a Renaissance in the vein of Matthew McConaughey), and of course, Refn's method of using visuals to show his point of view, which I will admit is pretty twisted, but fascinating.Refn makes it clear from the very first frame, that this is a world where you're successful one day, and then out the next, and that many industries, in this case modeling, will literally and figuratively devour you. Watching this film made me feel both exhilarated and uncomfortable, and some of the imagery that Refn uses here did make quite a few people in the audience, myself included, gasp in shock and awe.In conclusion, Nicolas Winding Refn has done it again. He has crafted a film that at times is a very tough viewing, but it constantly kept pulling me in with its rich visuals, fantastic music, and some truly terrifying performances. I just feel sad for those Refn aficionados who may not get to see this on a big screen. It appears that Refn will once again have to watch another one of his films see true life on television and home video, as indie-fare is constantly pushed aside for mediocre sequels and big-budget extravaganzas. Who cares, though. It's a future cult classic, and I highly recommend it, ONLY if you really like Refn or films that really focus on visuals. Otherwise you might despise it like a lot of critics did.VERDICT: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The thin line between experimental and masterclass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Neon Demon (2016) - When Nicholas Winding Refn's Drive (2011) came out I was instantly a fan. There is just something about the way he can direct his characters and almost immediately set the tone. He grabs the audience and makes them realize the brilliance of his work. Walking into this movie I thought there is no way that this movie could be better than Drive, I was wrong. And yes, I'm aware that they are two completely different movies, Drive is brilliant and beautiful in its own way. But The Neon Demon brought Refn from an up-and-coming director to one of the greats. I would compare this to Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange (1971) and Cronenberg's Videodrome (1983). Now, What is so good about The Neon Demon? We can start with the cinematography. The entire film is eye candy whether its the beautiful use of darkness and light or the constant vibrant colors the help tell the story believe it or not, It's all very inventive. Refn's directing is top notch. Most of the character development and plot lines are told through visuals and physical movement, Refn is one of the best directors working today when it comes to this.There wasn't one error with any actor/actress. Talk about a flawless cast, I can't see anybody else in these roles. But, the spotlight goes to three... Ellie Fanning, Jena Malone, and the one and only keanu Reeves. This movie isn't for everybody, especially the squeamish. But, for those of you who can get past some disturbing imagery and are able to follow a visual storyline, you'll find an important theme that is relevant in our time period. I give it a 10/10. One of the most well made and entertaining films to be released in 2016. Check it out and see for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>His most experimental film among his entire filmography.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching his previous film "Only God Forgives" and also his Norse themed film "Valhalla Rising", I never thought he could make a more experimental film but I was wrong. His latest film "The Neon Film" by far is his most experimental film. You could almost say he made "his Eraserhead" just now. Also, he homages to Dario Argento's Suspiria(or even some of Mario Bava's films) when it comes to the cinematography of the film. Throughout the film, like Suspiria, you see the usage of the bright red light, in a surreal nightmarish way. People also seem to compare this film to a mash-up between David Lynch's Mulholland Drive &amp; Dario Argento's Suspiria. While I do completely agree with the Suspiria comparison, I'd say it's more Inland Empire than Mulholland Drive, due to its extreme surrealistic dreamlike presentation(considering Inland Empire is even MORE surreal than Mulholland Drive). I've even also heard people compare the film to Black Swan, though I think the way The Neon Demon depicts its brutality and the violence, it reminds me more of Satoshi Kon's Perfect Blue than Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan. However, The Neon Demon, like both Perfect Blue and Black Swan, do focus intensely on the theme of physical beauty, superficiality, and the facade among the "entertainment industries".One thing I personally thought was interesting, even aside from the gorgeous cinematography that's very Argento &amp; Bava like and Cliff Martinez's usual brilliant contribution with the film's soundtrack, is the main theme of physical beauty. But unlike most of the films about physical beauty and supermodels, this film actually "admits" that beauty actually gets you to places. Even has a scene where the characters are discussing inner beauty vs. outer beauty, where one of them states the most uttered " fact", about how inner beauty is more important, while another character, a fashion designer, actually states something most would never say or even admit, which is that it's actually the outer beauty that makes most people give the "attractive person" a second glance. Which I honestly thought was interesting, the way the film focused on the narcissism of physical beauty and the brutal reality of receiving many opportunities if you are pulchritude and beautiful while among the "non-attractive people", only a few selective and anomalies will be given many opportunities. I honestly have had discussions with a friend of mine about this topic, about how most people say it's the inner beauty that is the most important, when the brutal and harsh reality is that outer beauty is actually what gives the person many opportunities in life. And I think there is some real truth to the outer beauty aspect that most people don't seem to delve into in real life(or at least don't admit it out loud). I genuinely enjoyed the simple, yet somewhat of a subversive take, on physical beauty and narcissism. Remember: "Beauty isn't everything. It's the only thing." I could see why some, if not most people, would not enjoy this film. I've even heard people call this film Refn's worst film. Personally, I think it's his most experimental, inventive, and surrealistic film(even above "Valhalla Rising" and his previous film "Only God Forgives"). The cinematography, just like his last two film(Drive &amp; Only God Forgives) is gorgeously shot, and the fact that the film reminded me of Suspiria(wouldn't be surprised if he admitted Suspiria to be one of the main influences for The Neon Demon) made me smile, especially as a cinephile. The soundtrack of the film definitely is reminiscent of both Drive &amp; Only God Forgives(as Cliff Martinez took the similar routes and tackled the same genre of synth music). Only, for me, The Neon Demon is slowly becoming my personal favorite, even among Drive &amp; Only God Forgives. And the introduction of Julian Winding(Refn's nephew) as part of the soundtrack team, was the perfect decision. As for the acting, they definitely are decent. By no means are they Daniel Day-Lewis or Marlon Brando, but they do a decent job at it. And honestly, the acting in the film is a minor factor and one of the least things that carry the film(it's really the artistic genius outlet by Nicolas Winding Refn). Though I will give Elle Fanning for accepting such a dark(or even dangerous if you will) role at such a young age. And I'd say this is Jena Malone's best role since Donnie Darko. As for Bella Heathcote &amp; Abbey Lee, while their actings aren't necessarily their most impressive aspect of them, they are undoubtedly eye candies. There's also a somewhat of a minor role for Keanu Reeves, but surprisingly I ended up liking his character and found his character to be darkly humorous.Overall, The Neon Demon is THE most experimental film made by Refn. It definitely will not be for everyone, but for appreciators of art-house/experimental films, looking for some stunning cinematography, or even if you want to look at the "facts" of physical beauty from a different and subversive perspective, I say check it out. Plus, I'm sure even the ones that might not like the film will at least enjoy the soundtrack. The film's a 10 out of 10 for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film is a Visual Medium: Style IS Substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The use of the phrase "Style over Substance" is like a requirement in most reviews on "The Neon Demon". I believe this reveals a misconception, not only about this film, but about film in general. Where is the substance, after all, if not in the material of the film - the bodies, the faces, color, room, framing, motion, and how these elements are edited? Or is it supposed that the substance found beneath the images, on the plot level? One movie can have a complex plot but be artistically shallow, while substantial classics (Vertigo, 2001: A Space Odyssey, for example) virtually ignore any plot logic. Admittedly, you can work with neon colors, pretty girls and lush environments and only create a perfume ad out of it. But Nicolas Winding Refn, I believe, is not just interested in showing Beauty: He believes that Beauty is ferocious, and that in Violence, Beauty can be found. This stance is amoral, but certainly not immoral.To feel sorry for Jesse (Elle Fanning) because the L.A. fashion world makes an ice-cold model out of this awkward girl with a big dream would be pointless: She is a shell, and remains a shell. She isn't just beautiful, maybe she is Beauty. What she says, thinks, where she comes from is irrelevant, not just within the narrative. The film itself treats plot and dialogue as secondary things, and it communicates with images. "Beauty is not everything, Beauty is the only thing!" is its most interesting verbal statement, delivered by a fashion designer (Alessandro Nivola). One could say about the film: "The Surface is not everything, the Surface is the only thing!" Shortly before Jesse comes to her end, she walks through an empty baroque villa, as if showcasing. At this point, the film is on the edge of becoming boring, but it is a deliberate boredom akin to the one in Stanley Kubrick's "Barry Lyndon". Baroque ornaments indicated overwhelming wealth and decadence, as our ornaments do now, even if we prefer smooth surfaces over opulent embellishments (just think of prevailing Apple aesthetics or that phone healing its own scratches). But Art as idle and clean as this becomes dull, and needs its creator to provide another quality. As Refn put it: "Art is an act of Violence. It is about Penetration." That Beauty is hard to digest is something Gigi (Bella Heathcote) and Sarah (Abbey Lee), two aging models rivaling Jesse, have to learn in the end. Literally. After Jesse has grown overconfident and over-successful, they throw her into an empty swimming pool and... we don't see what happens next, but in a later scene, Gigi regurgitates an eye, of all organs! The film is full of these cases of ambivalence. Health and Decay, Death and Life - these are not juxtapositions, but two sides of the same coin. And while Nature and Artificiality are rivals in this movie, the latter carries the day. We get our "Back to the Roots" message in special effects-laden blockbusters or expensive adventure holidays. The "Neon Demon" is a film that doesn't offer a cheap exit to Nature, but delves into this artificial world that we humans build and perfect (wasn't the use of tools in Kubrick's "Space Odyssey" simultaneously the first instance of Culture as well as an act of Violence and a rebellion against Nature?). And it is too fitting how the audience reacts to this film, or how the audience sitting with me reacted anyway. Attentively silent during the sporadic conversations; chatting during scenes were "nothing happens", at least nothing of mere plot interest; half-stifled laughter when sex or violence occur.That a film like "The Neon Demon" should disturb, even appall a mass audience is taken for granted. But it was also booed at at Cannes (the second Refn film after "Only God Forgives" to earn this honor) and it would be a pity if it were widely ignored and doesn't find the audience to make it profitable at least. Film, says "The Neon Demon", is a visual art. Many good movies, especially from Hollywood, offer exciting stories and complex characters. But even among those, only the ones that are able to express themselves with moving pictures are remembered, and it is those moving pictures with which you can approach more abstract themes. Film is also a violent medium, not just when it shows murder and blood, but when it does not explain itself but communicates with pictures, and when you can't simply rate it with a check list in mind. And although movies are inevitably commercial commodities, they shouldn't be as predictable and as easily digestible as a lollipop.Cliff Martinez won an award at Cannes for his wonderful music. His soundtrack will likely get away in scathing reviews as the movie's only good thing. But it is just like the film - repetitive, bold, unsettling, radical. And penetrating, of course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. I just saw this movie and my god, this movie has total staying power! The plot follows a young 16 year old girl who moves to LA to pursue her love of modeling, but soon strange things start to happen with her fellow models - and in it's third act the film takes the most unusual, scary and horrifically violent path ever taken in a film. But it was amazing. It was truly, truly amazing.The cinematography in this film was beautiful! Every shot in this movie was absolutely gorgeous to look at. NWR definitely used colors to his advantage. The soundtrack to this movie was eerie, surreal and very very scary. This film was more of a very intense psychological thriller with adult undertones in its first and second half, but is definitely a gruesome horror film in it's third. The transition was quite abrupt, but worked very well.Referring back to the soundtrack, Cliff Martinez made a wonderful electronic soundtrack for this movie that is scary and happy at the same time. It resembles the soundtrack from the 'Portal' game franchise. However, I understand this movie will not be for everyone. And critics most likely wont like it, (on Rotten Tomatoes for critics it's rotten, but for audience it's fresh.) The result will end up being like the reviews for The Butterfly Effect, which has a staggering rating of 31% for critics, and 81% for audience. And personally, I loved The Butterfly Effect. The only con that I can really think of is that the script at times can be weak and the first half of the film drags on a bit - but don't be put off by that. The film is a beautiful, scary, intense, gruesome, and stylish metaphorical horror film. Definitely worthy of a 10 out of 10 for me - don't let the critics put you off. If you like stylish, scary and violent films - the Neon Demon is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Morbid. Worth it. The character of the make-up artist surprisingly took center-stage for me. In the end, the pretty girl is nothing but a reason. It's the make-up girl that somehow drives the action, takes decisions, albeit very disturbing ones. Everything is superficial. Who cares. Watch the movie. When ignoring the storyline, it's a beautiful shot that's for sure. Digression: In Dostoevsky's "The Idiot", the protagonist Mishkin observes that a certain type of beauty can save the world. That observation rang false then, and it rang falser yet after watching The Neon Demon. The point of the movie seems to be that otherworldly beauty morphs us into animals - we regress to some kind of primordial state where false concepts of morality have evaporated under the pressure of the flesh. I don't argue. Anyway, don't take this comment too personally, I've had a couple glasses ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beauty and Violence go well together in the movies, as many horror flicks and thrillers prove. Nicolas Winding Refn knows why, or he feels it, and finds the deep connection between the two - on the Surface.To feel sorry for Jesse (Elle Fanning) because the L.A. fashion world makes an ice-cold model out of this awkward girl with a big dream would be pointless: She is a shell, and remains a shell. She isn't just beautiful, maybe she is Beauty. What she says, thinks, where she comes from is irrelevant, not just within the narrative. The film itself treats plot and dialogue as secondary things, and it communicates with images. "Beauty is not everything, Beauty is the only thing!" is its most interesting verbal statement, delivered by a fashion designer (Alessandro Nivola). One could say about the film: "The Surface is not everything, the Surface is the only thing!" Shortly before Jesse comes to her end, she walks through an empty baroque villa, as if showcasing. At this point, the film is on the edge of becoming boring, but it is a deliberate boredom akin to the one in Stanley Kubrick's "Barry Lyndon". Baroque ornaments indicated overwhelming wealth and decadence, as our ornaments do now, even if we prefer smooth surfaces over opulent embellishments (just think of prevailing Apple aesthetics or that phone healing its own scratches). But Art as idle and clean as this becomes dull, and needs its creator to provide another quality. As Refn put it: "Art is an act of Violence. It is about Penetration." That Beauty is hard to digest is something Gigi (Bella Heathcote) and Sarah (Abbey Lee), two aging models rivaling Jesse, have to learn in the end. Literally. After Jesse has grown overconfident and over-successful, they throw her into an empty swimming pool and... we don't see what happens next, but in a later scene, Gigi regurgitates an eye, of all organs! And it is too fitting how the audience reacts to this film, or how the audience sitting with me reacted anyway. Attentively silent during the sporadic conversations; chatting during scenes were "nothing happens", at least nothing of mere plot interest; half- stifled laughter when sex or violence occur.That a film like "The Neon Demon" should disturb, even appall a mass audience is taken for granted. But it was also booed at Cannes (the second Refn film after "Only God Forgives" to earn this honor) and it would be a pity if it were widely ignored and doesn't find the audience to make it profitable at least. Film, says "The Neon Demon", is a visual art. Many good movies, especially from Hollywood, offer exciting stories and complex characters. But even among those, only the ones that are able to express themselves with moving pictures are remembered, and it is those moving pictures with which you can approach more abstract themes. Film is also a violent medium, not just when it shows murder and blood, but when it does not explain itself but communicates with pictures, and when you can't simply rate it with a check list in mind. And although movies are inevitably commercial commodities, they shouldn't be as predictable and as easily digestible as a lollipop.Cliff Martinez won an award at Cannes for his wonderful music. His soundtrack will likely get away in scathing reviews as the movie's only good thing. But it is just like the film - repetitive, bold, unsettling, radical. And penetrating, of course.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible script, but the fantastic visuals, music, and all-out craziness of it win out in the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simultaneously one of the best and one of the worst films of the year. Refn is one of the most talented visual directors around, but his writing straight-up stinks. When this movie is silent (or at least just focusing on the images, because it's usually backed by a sweet-ass Cliff Martinez score), it's stunning. The plot is a very lame one about an ingenue (Elle Fanning) who enters the modeling world in L.A. and becomes consumed by its vapidness and competitiveness. I'm honestly not too bothered by the clichés. It's the dialogue that really harms the film. It grinds to a halt anytime anyone opens their mouth, and none of these actors can make Refn's tin-eared dialogue not sound like garbage. The movie gets more and more fun - and more and more disgusting - as it goes on, with the final act descending into really crazy Grand Guignol. My theater even had a walk out! People may whine about the overabundance of crappy sequels that no one wanted and the umpteenth X-Man movie, but I thank God I live in a time when I can watch a woman menstruate torrentially at my local mall cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Neon Demon is a beautiful looking, psychological horror film from the warped mind of director Nicolas Winding Refn - and is some of his best work to date.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jessie (Elle Fanning), a young and innocent aspiring model moves to LA to make it in the fashion industry, where she encounters the harsh brutalities that come with it, both figuratively and literally.It's not the most original of plots for Refn's first foray into horror, but add his signature style to the mix and it's a unique viewing experience overall. The director has a rare ability to take an average story and turn it into a very personal art-house piece of cinema, one that often divides audiences. He relies mostly on audio-visual elements to drive the story of the film, of which he is a master of. Though as often is the case, the story and characters suffer for it.In this instance, the characters are a bit weak in the sense that the film doesn't delve too deep into their backgrounds, but does just enough to give us a glimpse of their personalities on the surface. Elle Fanning is great as the doe-eyed, small-town beauty and Bella Heathcote and Abbey Lee are both on point in their roles as Gigi and Sarah respectively - two ruthless, established models trying to survive in an industry that chews up and spits out its stars without mercy. Jena Malone plays Ruby, the makeup artist/friend to Jessie and is great in her role, coming off as the most-grounded character, but one that may or may not be hiding something.It makes you wonder whether the characters were purposefully made all surface and no substance, considering the film is based in the fashion industry where it's usually only what's on the surface that counts. It doesn't just only relate to the characters though, as the whole film is essentially about what you see in front of you. Visually, the film is gorgeous and by far the best looking Refn film to date. The use of colors, framing and sound of every scene compliment each other perfectly, with almost every shot providing an image you could potentially hang up on a wall. When keeping that in mind, it doesn't sound fair to call the characters weak any more, as looking at the film as a whole, it all makes sense.One can not talk about a Refn film without mentioning the score. Cliff Martinez returns to provide the score for this film after previously providing his talents to score the director's other films Drive and Only God Forgives. The creepy electro music fits the style of the film perfectly, building the tension where necessary and adding a further sense of terror to the imagery.The Neon Demon might not be Refn's best work (Drive is hard to beat), however it's right up there as his most enjoyable. From the opening title, the audience is drawn in on what feels like a hypnotic journey into the seedy side of the LA fashion scene. The whole film feels like a two hour photo-shoot for Vogue, but is not without some tongue- in-cheek humour and of course, the signature brutality and obscenities of a Refn film are ever-present.The Neon Demon won't appeal to a lot of people, which is fine. One of the best attributes of the director is that he's yet to 'sell-out' to Hollywood. Fans of his should love it. Horror fans should love it. Anyone with an open mind looking for a bit of an experience will love it. It's a film that warrants multiple viewings, which could, and should probably be the only measure of success a film and its director needs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... And it is. Natasha Braier's pictures under Refn's prodding, with the performances on show here will leave you so unaware of what you're feeling ... but feeling it so very hard that the world will be muted for an hour after you leave the theatre.For me this is what cinema is for: Taking me away and *making* me feel. Feel it hard. This is guttural, and intensity born of coldness. I don't remember feels this hard from anything Refn has displayed before, but I do rather sleep around a lot ... so perhaps his films have just melded in to all the other films I've gotten in to bed with.One note: I might be dumb, but I saw no metaphor here, as others have suggested to me that this has on show, but that could be the aforementioned ignorance. LA is a monster, maybe?The Neon Demon easily brushes aside the other films I've put in front of my eyes this year. It needs to be put in front of yours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Clockwork Neon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicolas Winding Refn always manages to leave a taste of undecidedness in your mouth. But, in short, it's a visual masterpiece. I've enjoyed his previous four films, with Drive being a personal favourite. Only God Forgive was better the second time round, I appreciated it more rewatching it and Valhalla Rising/Bronson being my introduction. Loaded with amazing, dramatic, artist shots and long pauses that teases the audience and creates an incredible tension, allowing everything to flow in epic fashion so when it hits, it hits hard. This film is intense and done so beautifully well. It's about a fresh, young Jessie coming to terms with the pretentious modelling world that appears to have chosen her. Those already there become envious of her natural beauty and undivided attention she receives, cravings leading to conniving, it becomes vicious and disturbing, cat walking more than one controversial taboo. Elle Fanning, Dakota's (The Patriot, World of The Worlds) little sister plays the lead who has an uncanny look of Carey Mulligan who was originally set to cast. We watch the metamorphosis of complete innocence, childlike empress to an almost sinister, enchanting bitch that evidently ends up as just a piece of meat. You see how misplaced and uncomfortable she is and then there's that sudden realisation, the switch and how her face changes in that elongated brief moment. Hungry Games' Jena Malone plays her seductive 'friend' and is strangely chaperoned by fellow, egotistic models Bella Heathcote (Aussie soap Neighbours, Pride &amp; Prejudice &amp; Zombies) and Abbey Lee (Mad Max: Fury Road, Gods of Egypt) who both resemble androids, like something from a Philip K. Dick novel. Not quite human, artificial and trying to be something else. The soundtrack is mind-blowingly good and makes fifty percent of the film. NWR's regular, Cliff Martinez does an amazing score that if you could colour music, it would be neon. Haunting, atmospheric and at times ambient. It's something like what Vangelis did for Blade Runner, dotting conversations and awkward silences with gentle sounds and then pounding the cinema with heavy beats reminiscent of a night club. There's more to this movie than even the trailer suggests and the cast and roles are intriguing and at the same time vulgar, full of self importance. This is what I expect from NWR and arty films. The cinematography being vibrant and elegant yet quite brutal and disgusting. It's not going to be for everyone's taste, maybe a selected few but for me, it's impressive filmmaking, a visionary, a clockwork neon. Running Time: 6 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 9 Story: 8 Script: 7 Creativity: 9 Soundtrack: 10 Job Description: 9 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for the vision and the incredible pairing of soundtrack and film. 86% 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful on the outside - empty on the inside?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not for the faint-hearted. On the other hand maybe that's exactly who it is pointed at - the people who turn a blind eye when things get too rough. The Neon Demon takes some of the darkest facets of the human psyche, turns them into unimaginably repulsive visual metaphors, then stuffs it all down the viewer's throat.First of all the movie is a slow-paced visual masterpiece. Every scene is masterfully lit in mostly cyan and magenta colors and shot with velvet smooth camera movements. In one scene where the Fashion Designer uses two fingers to gently guide Jesse's pose, the moment is close to cinematic perfection.Large parts of the movie is directed as a music video and after a while it gets old. We spend too much time looking at the characters, mostly in slow motion, instead of spending time with them. As the climax approaches we don't really know any of the characters beyond how they look and what they want. Even Jesse is a somewhat empty shell who has been floating around passively for the whole film - being acted upon rather than taking action herself. Well that does sound a lot like the fashion industry. The entertainment value of the film takes a serious hit with this approach, but it feels right. The whole film is structured like the preconception of a model; beautiful but empty. ...And then NWR tosses the climax at us. Ruby engages in necrophilia in uncontrollable lust for Jesse who is killed and eaten by Ruby and the two models, one of which then cuts her own stomach open to leave the last model Sarah as the victor who survives in the fashion industry. Was all that necessary? The metaphors are rather simple, but the way they are presented uncensored and gruesome with a calmly moving camera is powerful. Until now the whole film has presented us with facades. When the climax literally cuts to the bone and shows us the misery in clear sight we turn away from the screen in disgust. The audience leaves the theater as no one wants to see the gory insides of a beautiful model.Beautiful? Definitely. Entertaining? Barely. Relevant? Probably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hypocrite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My ex-model ex-girlfriend, who is as heartless and superficial as the evil models in this movie, would find THE NEON DEMON to be a perspicacious criticism of the fashion world. This alone should discredit the movie.That's the thing about these people. They love to emit pseudo-criticisms of themselves and their corrupt world...pseudo because although the content is critical, the form is not. This is even a handy heuristic for outing hypocrites of all stripes: does he or she adopt a cynical critical distance towards his or her persona while continuing to engage in bad behavior? If so...run away.This director is such a pompous sell-out that he has actually transformed his initials into a brand that appears during the credits. Buddy...in this life, you can't have it both ways. Every shot in this movie is an homage to surfaces. The script is vacuous. There is nothing resembling subjectivity here. The very form of beautiful, static images is oppressive. By cloaking itself in a self- righteous message, THE NEON DEMON can attain its true objective all the more efficiently: making the spectator feel as envious, as worthless, and as empty inside as the "bad" models, who are the true heroines of this movie. Try to imagine how they were cast. I should also mention that THE NEON DEMON is a rip-off of a much better movie: David Lynch's MULHOLLAND DRIVE.I will never see another film by this evil man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am sooo tired of these artistic films trying to discretely push their thoughts about real-world issues that are totally out of touch for 99% of the global community!! All done by people who have passed their expiration date by a good many decades, and try to live their fantasy through the power of the greatest media tool available today! Just asking them to keep to their private clique and social circles that recycle their own praise and glory of each member's works. Will somebody get in-touch with these film studios and tell them that there are a couple of theaters in France that will be happy to show these films as a one-off, but leave the rest of us alone!! I believe I speak for most movie watchers (not you folks who are reading this post as most likely you are movie lovers who take the time to read and write posts on these movies and are in the less than 1%). But what about the bulk of movie watchers, those who pay to watch great epic movies that can connect with us normal folks? Why do these producers who make these types of movie genres then make a trailer that spin the movie and show their movie using the "optics" of Hollywood style BIG theme BIG impact hype and tricks. How do these actors and directors allow themselves to get so delusional and think-this is what people want to watch with the little bit of time they have left-over after working a full hard days work! Just shocks and surprises me each time again and again. One would think about the second kick of a horse would teach them...</fullReview>
