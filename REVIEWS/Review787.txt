		<shortDescription>Better -- and more disturbing -- each time I watch it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie never fails to generate strong reactions, both positive and negative.Much of the negative criticizes the wooden acting, soap-opera beautiful stars, and unreasonably military tactics that lead to an enormous human body count. But that misses the whole point. The actors and plotlines are supposed to be caricatures of themselves. We are presented with a seemingly utopian society, where everyone is beautiful, the world is united under a single government, and patriotism is rampant.The further the movie goes, the more the viewer realizes just how horrific this supposed utopia really is. Patriotism is exploited to trick young men and women into going off to a pointless war. The beautiful people are mercilessly chopped to pieces by their insectoid opponents. And the united world government uses its control of the media to brainwash the public into supporting this bloody war.Yes, the Nazi symbolism is a little heavy-handed. But that's the whole point -- the intertwining of this "perfect" society with such a deeply evil subtext is supposed to be disturbing. What's even more disturbing is how close to our recent (American) history this movie truly is. Yes, it's a caricature, but it's a caricature of a very real and frightening phenomenon.How different are the government propaganda ads in Starship Troopers from the "Loose Lips Sink Ships" campaign or the "10% for War Bonds" posters in 1940s U.S.? How dangerous is it to have a society where everyone looks the same, thinks the same, and acts the same, even to their own death? This is the message behind Starship Troopers, and it's a chilling one at that.And for me, it works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best satire since Dr. Strangelove</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is a subtle and insidiously subversive movie that proved frighteningly prescient in the wake of post-9/11 uberpatriotism. Both Heinlein's book and Verhoeven's film are valid and interesting political statements at opposite ends of the spectrum. Heinlein's novel was criticized as fascist at the time of its publication, and for all his obvious talent as a writer I'm inclined to agree. The movie is as much a sendup of the original novel as it is a satire of jingoist American politics. It really is a shame that despite the squeaky-clean heroes plucked straight from the soaps, the Mormon extremists, the multiple-amputee mobile infantry retirees and the propaganda shorts masquerading as news, the vast majority still seems to regard Starship Troopers as a stupid action movie and, for some reason, absolutely refuse to consider that it might be something more.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Pro/Anti-War Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>_Starship Troopers_ is the greatest pro/anti-war film ever made. This is something that no one seems to recognize considering that, when it was first released, most critics seemed to have been somewhat disturbed by the fact that the `good guys' resembled Nazis and that was about as far as they went before blowing it off as just another shoot-em-up. No one has bothered to re-assess the film since. Why has Starship Troopers with its profound comments on war and human nature been relegated to the ranks of films like _Rambo_ and _Universal Soldier_? One reason is that the satire is extremely subtle and another is that people are prejudiced against action films. This is probably justified though since the vast majority of them are pure fluff. However, _Starship Troopers_ ruthlessly satirizes the genre while being one of the best of in its category, which is a feat that is quite brilliant. There is so much about this film to analyze and it might even take a book to cover it all, so I will stick to only one thing here: the alien bugs, which are the enemy in the film.The Earth is at war with these creatures. They're inhuman, vicious. This is graphically demonstrated through out the film but most notably via a propaganda website that the movie presents to us as a futuristic version of `Why We Fight'. At one point, a cow is lead into a pen holding one of these giant insects, which quickly cleaves the cow in two. We are horrified! These insects truly are barbaric, evil! Look what it did to that cow! They must be destroyed! (Yet how many of us had steak before seeing this movie?) Then the website narrator proudly states that people on Earth are doing their part in the war effort as we watch a woman and her children dump Earth bugs on the ground and stomp on them. These bugs are native to our planet. Like the American-Japanese in WWII, why are they getting picked on? How are the bug-stomping mother and her children any more humane and caring than the repulsive alien insects?The film is insanely violent. People are literally cut to pieces by the smaller creatures and slowly, painfully melted by a plasma the larger insects spray. However, the alien bugs fair no better. The people and cows getting hacked up relentlessly in this film horrify us but we cheer as machine rifles and grenades blow the giant insects apart. The body count is high on both sides. It is all literally and purposely utter, senseless violence. But then at one point a psychic uses his powers to read one of the alien's emotions. He triumphantly yells, `It's afraid!' and a legion of human warriors jubilantly cheer at this pronouncement. Who's barbaric here? What is humanity? These bugs are clearly not `human' yet they are intelligent, advanced, and most importantly they have feelings. If they can be afraid, can they not also be sad, happy, in love? These are questions the writer has left to us to ask with out leading us by the hand through what could have been a much more preachy film.Considering the fact that, in his book _Stranger in a Strange Land_, Robert A. Heinlein--who wrote the novel upon which Starship Troopers was based--pointed out that there were millions of people already in America before the Europeans came and ruthlessly slaughtered these `subhumans' on their new property, it is safe to say that there is a lot more going on in this film than a simple slug-fest. The dazzling special effects and heart pounding action are all just a distraction--like all the noise in real life--from the more important things said here. Even the trailer and commercials for this movie were purposely misleading with Blur's delightfully mindless `Song #3' blaring and the singer yelling `Whoo-hoo!' as a stream of soldiers pour out of ships to go to battle. Every aspect of the film was one gigantic, satirical slap in the face of humanity and no one noticed.Some may suggest that the satire was not intended but that would be incredibly insulting to screenwriter Edward Neumeier because that's what he excels at. If you didn't catch the not so subtle satire in his earlier screenplay for _Robocop_ then you're under the age of ten. Despite being so financially successful, _Starship Troopers_ is one of the most important, yet overlooked, movies of the 1990s from an intellectual point of view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its AFRAID !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my favourite films, this one.I love the way Verhoeven approached the idea of Man v Beast. Our "heros" are beautiful, white-teethed Americans, firm of body and morals; our villains are decapitating stick insects, cockroaches, and giant maggots.Yet who are the real heroes ?The white-teethed Americans are vacuous, shallow thugs. They are thrust into a war with the Bugs, whose planets, we are told, have been invaded by the Americans. The Bugs are justifiably annoyed. I couldn't help but laugh at some of the "Nazi" parallels drawn by other reviewers. What Verhoeven is putting across in this film is not a polemic against Nazi ideology, but an attack upon American Imperialism in the latter part of the last century. He is satirising American crusades against other countries, whose inhabitants are portrayed in the American press as no better than Bugs. Had Verhoeven wished to attack Nazism, he could have given the good guys German accents; he didn't, he gave them American accents. The "Nazi" symbolism as commented upon by other reviewers is not Nazi symbolism at all - it is totalitarian symbolism, full stop. It is right-wing, "bomb them back to the stone age" American totalitarianism.Why do I believe this ? Check out the scene where American kids are encouraged to stamp on cockroaches by an overly excited parent. Check out the high fives.Verhoeven has done a mighty job here. He has made a film which has great action, great cinematography, very cute women (and boys) and yet the film still manages to take the mickey out of the New Order in a very funny and effective manner.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The negative buzz kept me from watching this film for awhile, but I'm glad I've seen it now!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the famous Robert A. Heinlein novel, Starship Troopers is set in a world of the future where militarism is the norm, largely because we've discovered alien civilizations of huge insect-like creatures and we're at war with them. The film follows a quartet of high school friends as they make their varied ways through the military.Starship Troopers is both a tongue-in-cheek satire of society and an intense sci-fi/action/war film filled with horror-like insect monsters and a healthy dose of graphic gore. That's a genre combination that will not please all viewers, especially if the tongue-in-cheek humor goes over their heads. For those more in tune with the genre melding, Starship Troopers promises a quick, edge-of-your-seat ride from the first moments to the last.The film can be looked at in three sections, with slight crossovers from one section to another. The first is focused on the social satire. The cultural differences of the future are given in mostly indirectly, and occasionally, the point is what hasn't changed, or perhaps what is currently (per the film's setting) in vogue as a retro element. The second and third sections could be seen as a sci-fi Platoon (1986), with the second section focused on military basic training and the third focused on wartime. Like Platoon, the basic training scenes show order and a clear sense of purpose, while the wartime scenes show comparative chaos.That the film could be compared to something like Platoon shows that although director Paul Verhoeven and screenwriter Edward Neumeier are aware that the material could easily be seen as absurd, they have the chops to make it believable and suspenseful at the same time.This is not to say that Starship Troopers is a rip-off of any other movie. The film-making here is highly original, and we could almost see the entire film as a computer-based CNN-styled collection of wartime newsreels of the future. It remains quick, witty and intense throughout. My only regret is that they didn't incorporate Yes' song Starship Troopers in the score somehow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant &amp; timely critique of fascism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The truth is that this is a brilliant film that, like Verhoeven's earlier "Robocop", is an insightful satire and critique of fascism and at the same time succeeds as a sci-fi thriller. It can be enjoyed at both levels, though obviously it is much richer when the viewer comprehends the satirical and critical level as well.It's not as if the satire is so subtle it's hard to get. If anything, it hits you over the head with it. But at the same time, it is very disciplined and consistent in not tipping its hand and giving the game away, which to me makes it much more successful and enjoyable than if the satire and social critique were blatantly broadcast. That's the strange and wonderful thing about "Starship Troopers" and "Robocop" -- one viewer might totally not get it, while to another, the critical/satirical level is totally in your face and is what the film is really all about.I don't know if I'm describing it well, but watch it with the film-makers' commentary turned on (on the DVD version), and director Paul Verhoeven and writer Ed Neumeier lay it all out very clearly: the film is about how war makes fascists of us all. Very timely today (2004) with US imperialism wreaking havoc in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan.On a technical level, the film is excellent. The bug special effects are top notch and the whole bug society and hierarchy is deeply thought through, as is the future Earth society's politics and technology. The acting is excellent, and the balance between the characters' interpersonal story line, the bug war story line, and the underlying political satire and critique, is perfectly handled.A truly exceptional film, Verhoeven's best so far, topping even "Robocop" in my opinion, and fully deserving a 10 out of 10 score, which I rarely give.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique, subversive masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about the ignorance of conquerors and the fact that war makes fascists of us all. Now that doesn't sound like a lot of fun, does it. But guess what: it is fun (by the truckload - at least if you have a pitch-black sense of humour and you do realise what this film is and what it wants to achieve).Paul Verhoeven was a master at making Sci-Fi films which worked both as perfect mainstream popcorn cinema and as very intelligent social commentary on the direction - he felt - society was headed. And despite the fact that the over-the-top satirical elements and highly political undercurrents in Robocop and Total Recall were only appreciated by a few critics at the time, those two films became huge hits at the box office: because they also offered great action, amazing special effects and overall great entertainment.My guess is that Verhoeven felt encouraged by that success, and so with Starship Troopers, he didn't just sneak in some subversive parts: he went full-blown satire. Sadly, that didn't go down too well with audiences and critics alike; apparently most viewers didn't get the film at all (the - seemingly - good guys wear Nazi uniforms? What the heck?). Verhoeven even got accused of being a fascist, and it took the director's commentary on the DVD to finally make it once and for all clear what Starship Troopers is about and what the writer's and the director's intentions were. I wonder whether the studio execs realised what Verhoeven was up to with that film; maybe the director just took their 100 million dollars and ran with it. The result, in any case, is a unique oddity that I personally feel is on par with films like District 9 or even Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove. It's a masterpiece. And much like another glitch in the Hollywood machine, David Fincher's Fight Club, films like that rarely get made (and not with such budgets), because more often than not, they end up as flops.Apart from the underlying themes, on the surface Starship Troopers also has a lot going for it: amazing effects that still hold up very well and insanely intense battle scenes with more blood and guts than even the meanest gore-hound could wish for. So no matter how it came about that a studio ever green-lit this and gave Verhoeven a 100 million dollars - I for one will forever be grateful for this unique subversive masterpiece.

		<shortDescription>Pure Science Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Again the same story of: "go to watch a movie after read many reviews telling you how bad it's the movie just to find something incredible" and really it was. I remember wait to see and action film about great space heroes, and even when I found heroes and action, I found a awesome and satirical story about the evolution of the human race and how the path of war falls in a road to hell. More than that, Starship troopers it's that kind of science fiction films with great a big special effects but at the same time a terrific script. A shocking story, more realistic and cruel than many movies about real conflicts, where you can feel the havoc and the pain of any battle. The acting it's good, the soundtrack it's one of the best works of Basil Poleoduris. After this you can read the book of Robert Heinlein founding how far goes Paul Verhoeven in every scene and every character creating. But the best of all is how everything has a reason, there's no word or scene without a meaning, even the promise of the beginning remain intact making clear some disturbing things about some character(s). An movie to watch more than two times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Military sci-fi at its cinematic best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On one level this is a pure action flick at its best. Amazing effects, mindless violence by the tanker-load and the good-guy gets the girl. Nothing more to say, really.However, this isn't a pure sci-fi action film; this is military sci-fi in all its fascist glory. Guns, warriors, alien scum and pretty explosions rendered in a disciplined manner. I wouldn't call it tongue-in-cheek, its too hardened for that. I wouldn't call the satire in your face or subtle; its more... subliminal. Sublety by another name perhaps. I don't read so far into films as others do; maybe I'm right for it, maybe I'm not. You just cant get it so wrong. Certainly people spend less time actually reviewing films.Uncharacterized enemies, a one sided view the situation, rampant jingoism, those are the trademarks of militarism. This film catches them well in a futuristic setting. A little slow to start but still enjoyable, with just the right sense of innocence and its loss, replaced with the hardened edge that invariably lies within success. When the action finally gets going, it really gets going. The effects are stunning for 1996 when they were made, and even 10 years on they'll still be impressive. I thought Casper van Dien was more impressive than the film really shows; certainly the screen test on the DVD seemed to show a greater depth IMO. Denise Richards was a little too wide smile for the film, but Dina Meyer pulled off the 'chick with a gun' more convincingly than any other woman I've seen on film (they always seem uncomfortable with it, but Meyer carried herself naturally). Her character was pretty good too ;-) . Clancy Brown clearly enjoyed himself, hamming up the stereotypical drill-instructor pleasingly, and Michael Ironside was wonderful as the hard-nosed and competent Leiutenant. The cheesiness beloved of action films was there but it never became too cheesy to detract from the work (unlike say 2004's King Arthur). Another thing that takes this to the level of military sci-fi.Basically, brilliant. As clever as the others here say, depending on the level you watch it, but maybe not subtle in the way some like to think. If you want a working definition of the military sci-fi I've been harping on about, this the one i refer you too. I just wish there were more examples like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all about the battle, not the enemy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about war and militaristic society and its effect on mankind. I agree with Leonard Maltin (the professional movie critic) that everything is directly modeled on WWII battles and WWII movies.The enemy is irrelevant, and characterizing the enemy is not important. That is why we never get any explanation for why the bugs are attacking us, how their weapons work, etc.The movie is extremely gory to make the point that "war is hell", and war consists of a lot of "blood and guts". It is also making the point that our tolerance for violence is constantly accelerating. In this future world, it is no big deal to get stabbed through any part of the body, it is even a part of military training. Pain is of no concern, you simply call for "Medic!" and get on down the road.The movie does not try to be cute or funny. The viewer does not have to listen to the aliens being called all sort of combinations of cuss words by the heroes.The characters are realistic. They sometimes do the right things for the wrong reasons and vice versa. At times we are not sure who is good and who is self-motivated.I also liked the shower scene. Just the concept of 19 year-old, physically-fit, men and women casually showering and bunking together is fascinating.It is obviously one of those movies that you either love or hate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While some of the characters and lines in the movie were a little underdeveloped, the overriding story of the evolution of our society into an aggressive, militarist regime cannot be ignored. The action scenes were great, with flawless computer animation (how Titanic beat it for SFX I will never know) and enhancement supported by what can only be described as gore-laden prosthetics. I thought they could have left the love story out, but that's Hollywood.Very watchable, and a nice change from the Alien movies - this is WAR, not some isolated pit-fight! I love the Alien movies, but Startship troopers just has a lot o' lead, heads, and bodies flying left, right and centre! I thought the Mobile Infantry could have used better weaponry (apparently in the novel that it's based on, the MI has powered armour with assault cannon and missile launchers etc.) to battle such a foe, but I'm just being technical.If you want a nice beer &amp; pretzels movie to yell and scream at, then this is it.10 out of 10</fullReview>

I know this film has been criticized for its apology of violence, but those who say that, don't understand Verhoeven sense of humor. Dark, very dark. In the same manner displayed in Robocop (Ed Neumeyer was also the writer of that one, if I'm not mistaken). We do feel we are watching a true universe, which by the way is amazing. Look at the starships (massive), the battles (awesome), the bugs....man I do love this movie!!!! The music by maestro Poledouris is magnificent as always.

		<shortDescription>an unmitigated pile of crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As soon as I remember who it was that told me this movie wasn't actually as bad as it looked in the trailers, I'm going to wring his or her neck. I wasted nearly an hour of my life watching the 2nd half of this film last night, and I'm still retching. This was truly putrid filmmaking at its worst. The "big payoff," as has been more than adequately noted in these reviews, is the fact that this movie is actually a satire and that humans can be the bad guys. Fine, but so what? I need the director of "Showgirls" to tell me that? Hey, folks--here's a little observation: the category of "satire" does not raise a work of art above criticism. Just because it's not supposed to be "good" in any straight/conventional sense doesn't mean it is absolved of the responsibility of being a good satire. A brief overview of any of the spate of horrible Zucker Brothers-clone movies churned out over the last decade (or even some of their own later films, for that matter) should prove conclusively that is is very possible to make a bad satire, and this is an awful one. It is neither funny nor profound, and I would even argue that this is that worst of possible satires--a completely insincere one which pretends to mock the subject matter it in fact sensationalistically exploits for sales and cheap shock. I will admit that I liked "Robocop" and even "Total Recall," but Verhoeven's direction is getting lazier, sloppier, and more contemptful of his audience with every film, to the point where he now clearly no longer cares at all whether he is insulting that audience's intelligence or not. This film is utterly pointless, thin, devious, corrupt, banal, and cynical--in the worst sense. If I could have given it a zero, I would have, but a one will have to do as an expression of my loathing for this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Incredibly Good Film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is either a really good, surprisingly intelligent satire of sci-fi and war films in general (particularly the WWII era recruitment films that Hollywood cranked out like they were actually a part of the War Department) or an incredibly vapid film that should only be watched for it's glitzy, flash-bang qualities. I choose to believe the former, otherwise I can't justify watching it as many times as I have, and I'm not nearly as smart as I think I am.... ST is only anecdotally related to Heinlien's novel, a choice made for various reasons, probably linked to the possibility of a sequel. Verhoeven raided the casts of various soap operas for his characters, a decision that exemplifies the portrayal of killing the enemy as a glamorous occupation in most war films, and the dialogue is filled with ironic machismo of the kind that can only be deeply satirical. (I hope.) FX are fantastic as are the one-liners. Don't watch this film and Arachnaphobia in the same 24 hour period or you'll spend a month's salary on bugspray. P.S. The proximity of this film to the Ra-Ra Homecoming of American troops from the Gulf War should also not be ignored....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Am I the only one who thinks Verhoeven hates Heinlein?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the reviews of 'Starship Troopers' on this site seem to fall into one of three groups:a. Those who hated it, because of the silly 90210 look, mediocre acting, goriness, poor science, or infidelity to Heinlein;b. Those who say "Give it a break, it's a fun beer &amp; pretzels movie"; andc. Those who applaud the anti-militarism theme.I disagree with all of the above. Actually, I somehwat agree with group a., but for different reasons.Criticising a movie for infidelity to a primary source or technical inaccuracy is like criticising it for being in colour; they are very few mainstream movies not like that.In this case, however, any dismay by Heinlein fans is deserved. There are huge differences between script and novel, and where a resemblance does exist the movie seems to _mock_ the book. In fact, I became convinced that either Verhoeven or Neumeier strongly dislikes Heinlein - in particular, his social beliefs - and deliberately parodied his work.'Real' science fiction is about exploring the possibilities of actual (and plausible future) science and technology, and its effects on us and our society. Hollywood's version of 'sci-fi' is often an action movie decked out with bizarre gadgets, blaster guns and slimy-skinned humanoid villains. Sci-fi fans call this 'science fantasy' to emphasize the difference. To a sci-fi fan, 'science fantasy' is derogatory - just as 'sci-fi' is to a 'serious' novelist!! Heinlein was a science fiction author, and both sociological and technological details in his books are important to the plot. The movie is pure science fantasy. Of course it's rare for Hollywood to produce a non-fantasy sci-fi movie, but when seen from the viewpoint of the anti-Heinlein theory, the bad science in this movie does seem needlessly exaggerated. Heinlein was careful with his science, and even included physics calculations in his work; this movie has starships piloted by kids staring out the windshield, and being shot down by the farts of giant bugs. A parody, perhaps?Forgetting the times in which Heinlein lived, people have sometimes accused him of revealing fascist traits. One idea from 'Starship Troopers' was of extending suffrage only to military veterans. Bizarre extremism to present day readers, but remember the context: Heinlein was writing just after the vast armies of WW2 saved the world from the Nazis, when national service was still nearly universal, and the Cold War was just hotting up. Anyone advocating the abolition of compulsory military service looked suspiciously like a commie fellow traveller. But there was Heinlein (a naval veteran) suggesting a novel compromise path: make military service voluntary, but with suffrage as an inducement - while those who refused service to the nation didn't get to run it. So the "fascist Heinlein" claims are somewhat shallow. Compare "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress" - admittedly a much later work, but distinctly liberal/leftist (it's about an ingenious and inclusive popular revolution overthrowing a repressive colonial government). Now we seem to have the movie 'Starship Troopers' taking the "Heinlein was a closet fascist" theme and ramming it down our throats. The Mobile Infantry are dressed in SS-like uniforms instead of power armour, the Terran government uses Nazi propaganda techniques, and an intelligence officer is dressed as a Gestapo agent. It's so blunt no-one could miss it - but many did. When some viewers asked about the strangely fascist newsreels, we were told it was a parody of WW2 Nazi newsreels. Huh? Why parody 1940's Nazi newsreels in a movie set in the future? Unless it was a comment on the social ideas being parodied at the same time...I'm surprised the 'beer &amp; pretzels' crowd didn't notice the blatant anti-violence, anti-military 'messages'. It almost seems as if the makers are offering their eye-candy science fantasy (and sex) as a lure to get the 'beer &amp; pretzels' types to watch their ?messages'. If so it is rather, erm, ironic that a movie parodying Nazi propaganda techniques should employ slightly subtler but essentially similar methods itself...Finally, a couple of particular gripes: Some people have lauded the special effects. I believe that when it was first released, this movie had the greatest number of synthetic images realistically interacting with human actors. Bravo for that. However the point of special effects is not to rack up statistics, it is to create astonishing images not otherwise possible to film. In this respect, 'Starship Troopers' was ok but not anything special. Compare the pedestrian starship combat to the breathtaking starship battles in 'Babylon 5'. Or look at the scene of crewmen on the exterior of a spaceship hull in 'Star Trek: First Contact' - as the 'camera' slowly panned away and revealed the massive grandeur of the scene, it really evoked a feeling of hanging by your bootstraps above an infinite void. _That_ was an inspired effect. Anything like that in 'Starship Troopers'? Nah.Some people were also impressed by the battle scenes. WHAT?!?! You get more convincing battles in the average cowboys-and-indians flick. Case in point: 90 zillion bugs, packed into a broad canyon, are swarming toward you. You have tactical nuclear rockets, and a radio link to a star fleet. So you pull out your assault rifle and try to shoot them one at a time!Overall, I neither loved nor hated this movie. I'm not sorry I went, but I won't see it again. My strongest impression is a mild annoyance that Verhoeven seems to have thought he could mess with a whole bunch of heads, and mostly they didn't even notice him doing it. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the Rotational Velocity of Deceased Authors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably one of the worst movie adaptations of a book in the history of cinema. It bears only the most superficial resemblance to the classic novel by Robert A. Heinlein, and proves once more that Hollywood has utter contempt for the profession of writing, whether of books or screen plays. Hollywood producers seem to believe that writing is a superfluous element in the making of films, and their disregard for its importance is obvious in movies such as this. We have seen a trend to use special effects as a crutch for weak plots and inadequate acting, but here we can add to this the defamation of the work of a deceased author. As for judging it as a movie on its own merits, it has none. If you have nothing better to do than watch this movie, try harder.Starship Troopers (the movie) isn't worth the time investment (even if you fastforward through it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That was bar none (even Glen or Glenda) the WORST movie I have ever seen. As a satire, it failed. It told me nothing I don't already know, (Well, actually, it told me nothing.) and satires are supposed to be funny, not a sick joke. As a film it failed. Unoriginal plot, bad acting, easily hate-able characters who I would've liked to see more of die. As an action movie...nope. Lots of violence, but it seems to think that blood and gore = shocking. No. This movie reminds me of a Marilyn Manson song. All shock value directed at 13-year old boys who would like to think they're rebels. It's a waste of time. Don't ever see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste of time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ranking on my all-time bad movie list--right up there with Waterworld--Starship Troopers could not have disappointed me more than it did. Based on the novel by Heinlein, the film limits the scope of the novel to that of a cheap comic-book. The script, casting, acting, and music were of such a low standard that the brilliant computer-generated special effects seemed a complete waste of effort. I have played video games with more developed characters and plotlines. Bottom line, this filmed version of Starship Troopers is an insult.I would rather be eaten by the "bugs" that appear in the film than be forced to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A high-tech splatterfest disguised as a heavy-handed satire that actively perverts the novel it purports to adapt.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Verhoeven disguises this queasy ode to gore as an anti-military cautionary tale. It's kind of like watching a prude drooling over pornography while protesting to the world how evil it is.The combat scenes are laughable. The soldiers have the tactical acumen of a heard of sheep with assault rifles. The movie doesn't just ignore significant aspects of the book, it goes out of its way to deliberately distort them. A single example (one of many). The protagonist of the novel, Johnny Rico, was a Filipino. Verhoeven casts stereotypically Aryan Casper Van Dien as Johnny. Is this a cynical distortion of the book to `prove' that the author wasn't `honoring diversity?' Or is it a cynical marketing ploy to appeal to a particular demographic? Or didn't Verhoeven care?The movie's supporters seem to fall into three main categories. There are those who enjoyed watching people being torn limb-from-limb while thinking `Gee, what a great science fiction action movie!' There are those who justified watching people being torn limb-from-limb because they were thinking `Gee, what a clever satire of a militaristic society!' And there are those in the first category who apparently had to see the movie more than once to move to the second category. This is amazing to me since I thought the satire was about as subtle as a brick through a window.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to start? The title, if anyone has ever read the book Starship Troopers they will understand that the title of this movie was used for nothing but marketing purposes, the book and the movie have almost nothing in common with each other.The acting is horrible, Dawsone's Creek has better actors then this movie. The movie is supposed to be a parady of a violent society and does a very poor and obvious job of sending this message. The plot line is somewhat pridictable and doesn't have any great twists or turns in it.The movie is also just plain stupid, the soldiers are armed with assault rifles and travel on foot while battling giant insects, they run in a mob and then just stand up in a line, completely exposed, and start fireing into the ranks of insects, after a while of this some random soldier yells retreat and the order is followed, the soldiers run away in the same mob fashion. Lets think about this, if you are battling giant insects wouldn't a tank be better then a foot soldier? Their is no artillery, no armour, no heavy weapons, no air support, the soldiers simply run around as one big mob. A child playing Command and Conquer on his PC knows more about military tactics then the person who wrote this script.I give this movie a 1 because it has a horrible plot, horrible actors and is a poorly written film. If you like action movies and don't care much for the details then this is an appropriate movie, while it lacks many things their is no shortage of bloody and action packed combat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satirical and Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Verhoeven is, obviously, a magnificent filmmaker (even if he directed the universally hated "Showgirls"), and he really knows how to make both a smart and fun movie!On the surface, it is an action-packed science fiction film. However, there is something bellow the surface, much smarter than your average sci-fi action flick. It is a wonderfully cynical and clever satirical masterpiece.In a style comparable to that of "Robocop", it uses fake news and propaganda clips to, essentially, explain to the audience certain plot points. But, it also increases the satirical element. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of satire BESIDES these news and propaganda sequences, but those specific scenes ARE the most noticeable satirical scenes. There's also a lot of satire in the training sequences. The satirical situations are really exaggerated, but still pretty clever in execution.Other than the satire, the film is genuinely fun and entertaining, although it is clear that the more satirical elements definitely increased the film's rating for me. While the special effects aren't the greatest (or anywhere near the greatest-at all), the film is still very well made. The sets may seem a little cheesy, but I, personally, really liked their look, so they weren't much of a problem in my opinion.The film also includes some surprisingly brutal sequences that highlight the horrors of war, which I genuinely didn't expect from this movie, especially since, most of the time, the film doesn't take itself seriously at all.While it isn't as openly satirical as Verhoeven's masterwork "Robocop", it still has tons of great, witty satire. Plus, it is a really entertaining action movie, so even if you aren't into satire, you still might really enjoy "Starship Troopers"!Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Book was a Work of Art, the movie raped it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If any of you have not read the book, I seriously suggest going to your local library and borrowing it, it is truly a classic.The basic plot is about the same, that is, Bugs attack us,we fight back, go mankind go. However, in the book, extradetails about the society that people live in are shown.The movie makes fun of the "fascist" government, whereas thebook tries to explain how things got to be like that. Their are other differences. Many of them little differences, but theymake the book flow. For example, in the book, the Mobile Infantry is all male.No females are in it. This may sound sexist,but all space pilots are female (quicker reflexes, etc. Dizzy Flores is an unimportant person who dies in the first chapter, he, that's right, HE is used to show the spirit of the fighters in the infantry. Heinlein uses this book to share some of hisviewpoints about what a citizen owes his/her country, and how people cannot vote themselves into prosperity. "Everything oftrue value has a price". The book has a lot of action, but a lot of interesting thought provoking parts too. In the book, warfare has become more advanced, not just people wearing vests, cheap helmets that they take off all the time, and using machine guns and atomic bazookas, they use very complicated armor, and eventhe bugs have simple lazer guns. The movie has unrealistic parts like the bugs shooting a blue spray into space to destroy ships, but in every Heinlein book, the math and physics of anysituation are sound, Heinlein was an engineer, he worked things out first, and if science said they were impossible, they didnot go into his books. Anyway, I ended up just trying to sell Heinlein. In all honesty, he is a great author, I am addicted to his books. Butthe movie Starship Troopers butchered his book, and I canalmost hear him grumbling from his grave. But since this movieturned me on to Heinlein in the first place, I give it a 8 out of 10.My buddies Leslie Kieth, Lyle Monroe, and Anson MacDonald are not too fond of the movie.</fullReview>

The characters are as unimportant as they are good-looking, which doesn't motivate you into being even remotely interested.This is a Sci-Fi film which brought a fan (me) to the brink of walking out. What a complete waste of time! It's the sort of film that some people misunderstand Sci-Fi to be about. The perfect antidote to all this: 12 Monkeys!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anybody who's actually read the great book by Robert Heinlein on which this movie is supposedly based will not help but give it a trash rating. The book is subtle, intelligent, well written, thought provoking and fun. This movie is none of those things. I understand what the director is trying to achieve and I appreciate the underlying cynicism of the overly simplistic story. The point is Verhoeven did a major disservice to an exceptional novel written by one of the great science fiction writers of our time and for this he cannot be forgiven. Apart from that of course the movie itself sucks too. One of the commentators asks, "How to explain the poor showing of this movie at the box office?", I'll do it for you; Poor acting + Poor script = Crappy movie. Verhoeven would have done well to actually read the book, it would have helped. (He should have sent his script writer to school, which also might have helped). Avoid this one and if you think it is good go read the book first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More playful Verhoeven satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An author by the name of Samuel Delaney once wrote a piece on the book "Starship Troopers", stating that as a young, gay, black man, the novel made him feel better about himself. He acknowledged that the book was basically a chauvinistic macho adventure, but pointed out how deftly author Robert Heinlein had fooled the reader into living the adventures of a dark-skinned man. You don't find out that the novel's hero is coloured until halfway through.Heinlein's novel portrayed a gung ho, fascist utopia. In his future world, soldiers were more worthy than mere civilians, as they willingly placed their bodies between their loved ones and danger. The mere act of becoming a soldier gave a man status and honour, and allowed those who belonged to the "soldier caste" to eventually become politicians and decision makers. In other words, civic duty was encouraged. Give your life to your country and reap the benefits.Recognising Heinlein's sinister undertones, Verhoeven's film is thus pure Aryan propaganda. In Verhoeven's society, the world is controlled by a manipulative and totalitarian Nazi government who are bent on eradicating giant alien bugs (Jews/Muslims) who live in caves. We watch as a group of naive, perfectly sculpted teenagers, graduate from high school, turn into heroic soldiers, and promptly die in the most brutal ways imaginable. Verhoeven's children are ushered from High School to their graves, yet they keep on smiling. War is great. War is honourable. Only the young and the beautiful shall fight for the motherland. As such, Verhoeven structures his film as a German propaganda picture, ripping scenes from Riefenstahl's "Triumph of the Wills" and inserting numerous John Ford "Why we fight" styled news reels.Heinlein was a naive libertarian who wanted total equality. His wars were waged by contemplative men and politicians who put their own bodies on the line. His soldiers weren't Kubrickian prostitutes, rather, they were men and women who sought honour and class. His soldiers used the military to better themselves and their society.Verhoeven, in contrast, has created nothing less than a total replica of a propaganda film, the film's goal being to recruit brainwashed young men and women who shall later be exploited by the mighty war machine.Like the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Centre towers, the film has a flashpoint (attack on Buenos Aries) which is used by the politicians to instigate war against the bugs. The propaganda snippets that lace the film all play off the emotions, fears and blood-lust generated by this singular event. The population does not know why the bugs hate them, so naturally they view the bugs as being one dimensional embodiments of evil ("They have no brains!" one journalist yells). Only later in the film, in a throwaway bit of dialogue, do we realise that the destruction of Buenos Aries was an act of retaliation. In short, the bugs attacked us because we ticked them off and encroached on their land. Of course the folk back home have no knowledge of their government's intergalactic foreign policy. While post 9/11 America demanded vengeance and promptly rolled their hardware into the deserts of the Middle East, Verhoeven's futuristic society likewise gears up and ships out to the desert, fighting a patriotic war based on a lie.So though the film is bathed in Nazi symbols and nods to World War 2, Verhoeven's sights are firmly on America. Like all his Hollywood pictures, "Troopers" is an angry assault on its American audience. Verhoeven whips his adolescent audience up into a state of euphoria and blood-lust, treating them to nudity, gore and picture perfect Aryan supermen. Poster couples for white American purity, the audience almost expects the troops to gaze at each other and say "Look at us! We are so beautiful! We are going to make such wonderful, white American babies!" (ie the ending of the fascist "Saving Private Ryan") And as the audience cheers, revelling in the battles, the heroics, the glorification of violence and the thrill of victory, conquest and patriotism, Verhoeven sits back and smiles.On screen, he's deftly depicted a society's conversion from innocence, humanity and tolerance, into the simplistic and ruthless political will to go to war. Off-screen, his unknowing audience behaves likewise, brainlessly lapping it all up. The audience gets caught up in the action and heroism, and never notices the fascism growing all around it."Starship Troopers" confused critics when it was initially released. But post 9/11, its violence, with its upbeat acceptance of humanity's warlike and genocidal alter ego, is now hardly a speculative reality check. Verhoeven's newsreel footage, rolling death toll counts and by-the-minute battlefield reports, now read very much like CNN's real-time news coverage of the second Gulf War.The film's statement that "the only good bug is a dead bug" perfectly echoes post 9/11 mindsets ("the only good Al-Qaeda is a dead Al-Qaeda!"), the laments of idealists and intellectuals suddenly taking on an obnoxious tone to a now hysterical, spectacle-hungry public.8.5/10 - Early in the film, a veteran soldier remarks that figuring things out for ones self is the only freedom one truly ever has. Much of Verhoeven's American films challenge their audience to look beneath the superficial sex and violence, but few bother to do so. When so many Hollywood movies (Star Trek, 300 etc) are so openly fascist, how could they? It is now so immersive in so much of contemporary popular culture as to be virtually invisible- ideology at its purest.So on one level, Verhoeven's totally over-the-top cartoon sensibilities serve only to completely neutralize all satirical intent. Just because the film is self-reflexive, conscious of its portrayal of fascism, does not imply that it necessarily disavows it. The truth is, Verhoeven, in a sort of reflexively impotent fatalism, sadistically enjoys every moment of it in spite of all its horrors.Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heinlein is rolling in his grave!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a long-time Heinlein fan and have read Starship Troopers.Being a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, Robert Heinlein had a lot of respect for military service as a way to serve humanity in a cause bigger than yourself. Starship Troopers, the book, was built around the theme of service. It is a pretty controversial book in that Heinlein makes the case that only those who have served in the military, i.e. served a cause bigger than themselves, should be enfranchised with the vote as they have demonstrated themselves to be responsible enough to think about more than just themselves.You won't get any of that out of the film. Instead you will get mindless action and violence that portrays the military as incompetent and fascist.(Combined-arm tactics - what's that?)The betrayal of Heinlein is so complete that it cannot be a mere accident. Clearly the writers and director of the Starship Troopers movie despised Heinlein's views. Disagreeing with Heinlein is their right, but it is both scummy and unethical of them to use Heinlein's name to convey a message that is the polar opposite of what Heinlein believed. Perhaps if you go to this movie looking for some good mindless action and some pretty faces you won't be disappointed; as I was, but make no mistake you are not seeing anything truly related to the book this film was allegedly based on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>theme of movie vs book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read some of the comments by others and I have a few things to say myself.First off: the file stank. I was very excited to see it, based on the title and having read the book, so I dragged a few friends to the theater. I was never again allowed to choose a movie for the group.The film stank for me because I had read the book. If you hated this movie because of its thematic content, then I can honestly suggest you read the book because the book is very good and has exactly the opposite theme.The film stank for my friends because they like interesting movies with one or more of the following: a good plot, good acting, good character development, or a good visual show. This movie didn't quite cut it in these categories, although it makes the highest marks in the visual show. It wasn't to our taste, but it is pretty good raw action.The movie has a facist theme, and emphasizes the homogenaity of a society brainwashed by censured news bites. The society makes a mockery of free choice and liberty, and displays no value for human life or suffering, and the characters show no growth, nor growth potential. Some commentators have suggested that the movie is an attempt at satire. If so, it is extremely heavy-handed without the subtlety required for satire.The book celebrates democracy, liberty, individuality, diversity, and free choice, in peacetime first; then wartime. The central character, Johnney Rico, starts off as a clueless high school senior. As the story continues, his character evolves as a result of his choices (primarily) and events (secondarily) and he becomes an adult, ultimately earning his father's respect. The book is an intelectually challenging and serious work.I did not have a problem with some of the anachronisms that another commentator did, while I did agree with every other criticism. The book was sci-fi from a previous generation (first published in 1959) and the vision of the future was very different then. For example, in the book there are no electronic computers, so in order to pilot an orbiting spaceship, a detailed flight plan must be calculated by hand in advance. With the help of a sliderule, of course, which is how it is even possible.You might ask why the butcher who took the book and made the screenplay didn't update the weapons anachronisms (since they took care of the computer anachronisms). I can't defend it, even though it doesn't offend me. But hey! there's plenty in this movie to offend everyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing critique of fascism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fascist advertisements in the beginning of the movie appear very appealing in their perfect society. We learn that after the fall of democracy, the veterans of war take over all of the Earth's government to for the Global Federation of Earth. The system works perfectly. Crime is mostly gone and sexism as well as racism is nonexistent as well. We see in the game of Jumpball that the quarterback is Dizzy which is a woman. In the shower scene men and women shower together with no issues and no disclosure or privacy. The whole system works on the idea that civilians can work someway in the service to become citizens whether it would be to serve in the military or help out any other way. The difference of a civilian and a citizen is that the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not. Once a citizen you can vote and perform other tasks that a civilian could not do otherwise. In the shower scene a woman claims that she joined the service to become a citizen to make it easier to get a license to have a baby, which by today's standards may seem absurd but also kind of makes sense. The only restriction on having a baby today is grabbing any willing partner and preforming a certain task. This results is a beautiful creatures of life but not always are the parents willing to provide for the child. Some are left to fend for themselves which almost all are unable. Not saying a baby could survive on their own but it leave a lot of trauma throughout that child's life. Getting a license to be able to have a child is the government's way of securing that child's future.The government's whole idea thrives on the idea of force. In the movie they talk about that force is the use of violence. Naked force has resolved more human issues than any other form. History is written by the victor. In a lot of ways most would disagree with a fascist government but this movie makes the whole idea make sense. It's not a complete disregard for people's rights. It's more of a system where you choose to obtain more rights than others. You choose to become a citizen and there is no punishment for choosing to stay a civilian. Civilians still have the right to get a license to have children is just easier if you're a citizen. There is no segregation or separation it's just the idea of bettering yourself and the community around you and you are rewarded. Fascism is not good in a lot of ways but this movie's version is pretty good. What you should take from watching this film is motivation to better yourself and your community to become and asset not a setback. Would you like to know more?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My title is a quote from director Paul Veerhoven who makes no attempt to water down his political views in "Starship Troopers", a merciless, satirical skewering of those superpowers throughout history who believe war solves the world's problems.That opening sentence is a mouthful, so let me explain a little further. In the director's commentary, Mr. Veerhoven makes no bones about naming the USA as the greatest offender. In an awkwardly funny moment, his co-commenter, screenwriter Edward Neumeier, mutters "Yeah but we did save your ass in World War II." To which Mr. Veerhoven clarifies, "But this is not about World War II, it's about what happened *after* World War II." And thus, the entire philosophy is explained in a way that patriots as well as pinko commies can understand. "Starship Troopers" is a cautionary tale about what happens when war ceases to be a necessary evil and instead becomes an unnecessary thrill. It begins with some hilariously obvious propaganda satires, all about joining the military (including a funny scene of a 12 year old kid in full battle attire). The rest of the movie is peppered with such dark comedic skits, a lot like Veerhoven's "Robocop" a decade earlier.Where the film is brilliant (or disastrous, see below) is in the way the battle scenes do thrill us, almost to the point that we lose ourselves in the hysteria of warfare, and only upon sober reflection do we realize that Mr. Veerhoven has just proved how easy it is to become a mindless minion of violence. The disastrous part is that I'm afraid many audience members never sobered up and walked out of the theater thinking "Go war!" Such is the pitfall of making a satire; you run the risk of promoting the very thing you seek to ridicule.Something very interesting that Veerhoven did was to use giant bugs as the enemy. I mean, who doesn't hate bugs?? Certainly no human I know. And that's the point: by presenting an enemy that's so universally hated as a bug, Veerhoven turns the magnifying glass on ourselves and challenges us to answer why we hate bugs, why we like to kill them so violently (crushed until their guts spew out) or gassed so that they die of painful asphyxiation before our eyes. If you caught the message of this film, you'll probably think twice about stomping that little spider who had the misfortune of being sighted in your presence.Oh a final note that's a very nice touch. There's a scene in this film where a bunch of kids are stomping on cockroaches. You'll be pleased to know that the cockroaches were fake, and literally no animals were harmed in the making of this film. Touch, Mr. Veerhoven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I avoided Starship Troopers for a long time for two reasons:1. It was directed by the guy who directed Robocop, which was a bit too violent for me. Don't get me wrong, I'm not morally against the level of violence and bloodshed in Robocop and I'm definitely not saying it should have been censored. It just wasn't for me. 2. The book was okay but it wasn't awesome. I mean, there are better science-fiction books out there, like the Dune series and the Foundation trilogy. I'm not much of a fan of Robert A. Heinlein because he seemed to be more concerned with preaching than telling a good story. I'm sure that even his fans wouldn't say Starship Troopers is his best book. Out of the four that I've read (Starship Troopers, Friday, Stranger in a Strange Land, and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress) I'd say The Moon is a Harsh Mistress is the best.But I saw a bit of Starship Troopers on TV and decided to rent it and see the whole thing. It was actually pretty fun. I know quite a few Heinlein fans hate it because rather than being a direct adaptation of the book, it's a parody of a militaristic fascist society, which kind of implies that the book supported fascism. I know Heinlein was not a fascist. I'm not sure if he ever affiliated himself with any political party, but I think that by the time he wrote Starship Troopers, he was a libertarian, which is about as far from being a fascist as you can get.Still, it's a fun movie. It's got a lot of action. It's suspenseful. The Klendathuan bugs aren't quite as awesome as the xenomorphs from the Alien series, but they are good enough for a movie like this. I'm afraid I must give it 9 stars instead of 10 because, well, I just don't like Denise Richards as an actor. She's almost always smiling in this annoying way. I would have given the movie 10/10 if Carmen was played by an actress more like...let's see, what actresses were about the same age in the second half of the '90s? Maybe Reese Witherspoon. I don't know. You might be a bit disappointed if you're expecting it to be as good as James Cameron's Aliens, but I'd say Starship Troopers is definitely worth seeing if you like sci-fi action movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania.What a terrific film this is. Of course, i guess it's not for everyone - you either love it or hate it. "Starship Troopers" is a science fiction, action adventure at it's very best. The special effects are really special, when this movie came out back in 1997, i was blown away each time i was in the journey with this film. The characters are simple but strong, the settings, everything works here for a great escapism fun. I have seen this film 6-8 times, and it's never gets to long or uninteresting. If somehow you sill haven't seen this action gem, do yourself a favor an watch this on the biggest screen possible, it's a hell of a fun. And the siege scene in the middle of the movie is still a benchmark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eye candy and not much more....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey, Casper Van Dien and the rest of the cast certainly provide plenty of eye candy for this film, however, I don't see much more in it. First, we are given no indication of why these "bugs" are attacking humans...it would have been nice to supply more of a premise than the three or four lines spoken by a reporter about how the "bugs" resented human encroachment...just before the bugs kill him. WWII movies could get away without supplying the premise for why we were fighting WWII, because it is to this day universally known why, but I'm afraid that the WWII formula won't work in the Starship Trooper context, we need a plot including the premises for why this war started in the first place.Next, let's look at the credibility of some of the things seen in this movie--Reporters standing in the middle of a combat mission? When was the last time you saw a Geraldo Rivera-type standing in combat uniform in the middle of an actual battle ground in a hot war? The Earth appears to have been politically united and science moved forward enough to get humans across our galaxy...yet the best weaponry we have are hoards of combat infantry armed with machine guns? And in terms of realistic warfare, we saw infantry without armored support, without air support and apparently only armed with a total of two grenades (which were used by Rico and Diz respectively to kill two big bugs). Eventhough conventional weaponry seems to have been the choice of this film maker (and I guess Heinlein) we see no weapons like the bazooka or surface to surface missles, mines or tanks. There is one shot of what looked like a light anti-aircraft gun in action...why is the weaponry so primitive given the backdrop of intersteller space travel? Even now we are experimenting with particle beams, lasers, biological warfare and things more sophisticated than a machine gun, for sure. Apparently, between now and the time this movie is set, we forgot a lot of science, except how to travel across our galaxy. Maybe they needed a formula for bug spray?There are loose ends in this movie too--we needed some exploration of the difference between citizen and civilian...seems like some new definitions were being applied here, which again, were minimally or not at all explained.One cannot help but notice the symbols used that so strongly resemble those adopted by the likes of the Nazis, Falangists and other fascists. Given that it seems the earth is being run by fascist types, one might like to see in this movie an answer to the question "Just what exactly is back on earth that the troopers are defending?" It doesn't seem like democracy and freedom play much of a role in this new world--one that is hardly explored by the movie-makers, but I could be wrong since the moviemakers never told us what was happening on Earth, other than Buenos Aires was destroyed and that there was some kind of federal council sitting in Geneva (perhaps an apt venue for a fascist dictatorship given evidence of Swiss complicity with Hitler, but I digress).I could write reams on what I observed that is wrong with this movie. I'll refrain from saying anything more other than to comment that if you want a movie with no plot, with really no beginning and no end, with minmal character development and growth, no premise supporting its existence, showing you illogically waged warfare with lots of action, then this is the movie for you.I for one would have skipped it had I known what was in store...but at least Casper and the other members of the cast were pretty to look at. I gave it a 4 just for Rico and Zander's looks....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers ( 1997 ) is an all time low for a Director who makes movies structured on the lowest common denominators of graphic violence, schlock humour posing as irony and two dimensional characters all filmed in a flat TV movie style. The film is a relentless onslaught of violent images joined loosely by scenes whose characterisation and dialogue are laughable if they weren't so appallingly poor. Mr Verhoeven's idea of imagination is to think up increasingly horrific endings for his characters, eschewing taste, humour or any other saving grace. Please, Mr Verhoeven, retire now and do the universe a big favour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Bad, I Don't Know Where To Begin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so bad on so many levels, only a bullet point list can capture this rapture of misguided sci-fi schlock gorefest:o Pointless gore that adds nothing to the horrors of war, advances the plot, or makes us root for the "good guys"; o Ridiculous plot, which has us imagine that we need to send combat troops down to a planet rather than just nuking them from orbit. Totally absurd; o The plot is totally unoriginal, borrowing from just about every sci-fi bug hunt movie ever made; o Bizarre mixture of interspersed "WWII war bonds" type advertising, which is misplaced in context and tone and totally out of character with the general tenor of the movie. And now for the good points: o A babe and butt fest. What a good looking cast! o Co-ed shower scene almost has an unassuming naturalness that makes you think it's a movie with a director; o Special effects are first rate (the movie's most redeeming feature).Overall, the later three points don't make up for the first four. And I disagree with a previous review alleging the film is some insightful, sly commentary on war films. Sorry. This is a pointless film that neither inspires heroic jingoist bug bashing nor makes we want to join the army, despite the steamy soap-on-a-rope suds fest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw it again; still no substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before you ask, seeing this again was the price of maintaining a long-distance friendship. I still can't figure out what Paul Verhoeven was trying to do with this picture.SCIENCE FICTION ? Decidedly not. We're supposedly 200+ years into the future. Think back to the weaponry of, say, the US Revolutionary War. Compare it to current weapons. Now make a leap of similar magnitude beyond that, and what do we get? Heinlein postulated MI in powered-armor suits, dealing death in a dozen ways as personal as a punch in the nose. Verhoeven has our troopers still fighting with machine guns and hand grenades. No "smart" weaponry whatsoever, not even hand-held energy beams, and communication systems that are still blocked by canyon walls and bugged with static. Food service is still slop served with spoons from a heated aluminum tray. Bathing is still bar soap rubbed on by hand under a shower of running water. Finally, how did only 200+ years of immigration wipe out the genetic heritage of Buenos Aires? I see no influence of the original natives, only Carmen bears Spanish features, and nobody shows any of today's huge mixed-Japanese population.THE HORRORS OF WAR ? Forget it. First of all, the technical and continuity errors left this a slapstick affair. Second, to get me to feel the horrors, you have to engage me in the characters. The shallow formula characters continuously reminded us that they're only cardboard cutouts of people. Even John Wayne got better character depth. Third, you have to engage me in the plot conflicts. Verhoeven needed to decide whether or not he had time to work on relationship tension -- four lines to work out a deep emotional attachment just doesn't cut it, and merely exposes the development problems. As for the war itself, we never get any real tension of battle or long-term planning.PARODY OF WAR MOVIES ? Perhaps. War action scenes with stupid tactics even at the squad level ("They can spit napalm: let's bunch up!"), one technical error or discontinuity after another ... and after that's established, we have to suspend belief in *those* "world rules" whenever there's a mano-a-mandible close-up (note the changes in pace of battle and troop reaction time). Even then, some great foreshadowing and set-up opportunities go by unharvested, and the utterly superfluous shower scene defeats its own purpose.SPECIAL EFFECTS ? Nah. The formula stuff in action films gets standard-of-the-art computer simulation; the day-to-day details are incredibly cheap. For instance, when Rico is recovering from his leg wound, they give him a huge floatation tank, some cute wound-knitting creature, but force him to breathe through a gas-can hose and lie inconvenienced for "three more days". At first, I wondered why their established Name Actor (Neil Patrick Harris) was shuffled to a peripheral role. I finally figured it out: if they hadn't, Dr. Doogie would never have let them get away with all the errors in human physiology. With Carl out of the way, we get the classicly hilarious brain-sucking scene and Carmen's Polyanna attitude some 5 minutes later (when she should be bleeding heavily while Rico radios for a medic). Overall, "Starship Troopers" erratic, sloppy, and ill-planned.</fullReview>

Unfortunately I read the book at the age I should have seen this movie, ie. about 14 years of age. "90210 in space" is a well-used commercial review of this film and I couldn't agree more. What could have been a gritty sci-fi spectacular in the mould of "Predator" was turned into an infantile fashion parade. The only real surprise for me was that the Spice Girls didn't land a guest spot. Maybe it was decided that 3 billion noisy insects was enough for one movie, an extra five weren't needed ...Don't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being the enormous science-fiction fan that I am, I was very anxious when Starship Troopers first came out. I saw it on opening night.Needless to say, I was phenomenally unimpressed by Paul Verhoeven's work. RoboCop is his only American effort that I can watch and actually enjoy because of the ever-prominent subtexts. Starship Troopers tries repeating his same function of social-bashing, violence, and general cornball attitude. It fails...First off, the cast kills the movie right away. Clancy Brown makes a poor comparison to R. Lee Eremy and the 'boot camp' scenes--harshly described in the book--are portrayed less in the style of Kubrick and more in the fashion of Saved by the Bell. Speaking of which, where in Hades did the casting people get their ideas from? Watch Levi's ads on TV?Secondly, the message of futility in war and the inventive Heinlein hardware in the book are scrapped for more Nazism by Verhoeven. The man may be the closest thing to James Cameron, but he can't adapt a personal touch to his work like Cameron can.Finally, the story and logic in itself are terrible. As time goes by, this degenerates much in the same fashion as Full Metal Jacket leaving only the action fans happy and everyone else wishing that it were over.Overall, a sappy movie that is not worth your time. Stick with RoboCop and don't bother with this. The style is unsophisticated and the method is weak. 1.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a cartoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just read a few reviews which claim this is a subtle parody of propagandist/ totalitarianism films. No it's not - Verhoeven doesn't have the capacity. Check out some of his other works (eg. Total Recall). The man makes cartoons, which is what this is. It's Scooby Doo In Space.Whether you liked or disliked, agreed or disagreed with Heinlein's book, it at least provided you with some talking points. Heinlein's personal politics were none-too-subtly woven into the plot of the book. Verhoeven's film removes all of those, and replaces them with explosions, lots of gunfire, and Denise Richards' lips. The acting is wooden, the characters shallow (I just couldn't bring myself to care whether *any* of them lived or died), and the script terrible. [SPOILER](Why does the lead character rescue a critically wounded private mere moments after shooting his own critically wounded CO? Apart from the obvious reason that he had sex with the (female) private only a few scenes prior).The lead characters are, without exception, all Beautiful Young Things. Not a pimple, nor even a misplaced hair in sight, no matter how "dangerous" (hah!) the situation gets. I won't pick it apart scene-by-scene, other than to say that if it is intended as a parody or anti-war film, the least the producers could have done is to hire a military consultant. The number of elementary military mistakes makes it look like an episode of the Simpsons.In the movie's (meagre) defence, the big crowd scenes are well orchestrated, and the special effects are good to the point of not noticing them as special effects. Or maybe the actors lowered themselves to the level of the CGI!However, the movie does no justice to Heinlein's book whatsoever. It's either an incredibly lightweight "adaptation", or, if it is intended as a parody of the original work, it should not have used Heinlein's name, title, characters, etc. There's nothing wrong with taking an opposing viewpoint to Heinlein (plenty have!), just don't "adapt" his work to do so.If you want a great sci-fi movie, see Blade Runner. If you want a great (anti-)war movie, see Platoon. If you want a great cartoon watch the TV on a Saturday morning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to bomb a system that paid you to lick his a....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another review of this film? I just have to... First of all, I don't like movies with large amounts of action, violence and military units - but although this movie delivers more of these than any other movie I've ever seen, I love this one. Second, I don't give a damn what Heinlein intended to tell in his original book - if I want to know what the writer has to tell, I read the book, if I want to know what the director has to tell, I watch the movie.And this movie I watched because it was made by Paul Verhoeven. I'll make it short and get to the point. The reason, why so many people obviously do not get the satirical notes of this movie, is that the satire is "balanced" by permanently triggering hung-ho emotions so that the viewer is led to forget the satire he or she just recognized the scene before. This technique of permanent sensual overload and distractions is exactly the same, that every fascist society uses to pull the strings of its inhabitants, to make them dull and sleepy for what really happens. Sometimes the terrible truth breaks through, but it is immediately swapped over by the latest news of some celebrities' excesses or divorces, the next best free porn on the internet or any form of social or political gossip. Verhoeven does exactly this - using this manipulative technique, so that you have the chance to realize how this manipulation really works and what it makes to YOU: your senses, your emotions, your mind. To me this is Verhoeven's finest work - a real achievement of what in Europe is known as "enlightenment", a way to make citizens more aware, more conscious, more "autonom".Starship Troopers is Verhoeven's ultimate assault on Hollywood, on Social Media, on totalitarian Societies in general - and the USA in particular. You can love it (if you appreciate freedom of mind in any way) or hate it (if you identify with systems outside of yourself) - but you just can not miss the huge ironic dimension, that this very expensive movie was financed by a system that the movie attacks with everything at its proposal. Verhoeven showed guts - something very missed in mainstream cinema today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtle satire as was Heinlein's book but on slightly different lines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just wanted to register another 10 score to add to the many excellent defences of this fine movie. Of course it's a satire on multiple levels so congratulations to Verhoeven and the entire film-making team for doing this so well, yet also succeeding brilliantly at the shoot-em-up thrills and coming-of-age story aspects (which latter I thought were non-trivial despite some probably deliberate clichs).It seems to me that Heinlein was more ambivalent than Verhoven about fascism, although far from unaware of its dangers. The contrast isn't too surprising, since Verhoeven grew up in Holland not long after World War II and appears to be a thoughtful, essentially empathetic type of person, whilst Heinlein was heavily drawn to playing with theories on an intellectual level. However, Verhoeven's apparent preoccupation with the lessons of the Nazi era may have obscured some of Heinlein's themes.Heinlein was an adult by the time of the war, lived in the US, and never served in the European theatre, so the war's emotional effects on him were different.The heart-rending nature of the screams of the dying arachnids is another of the subtle features of the satire - you may not notice this during a first viewing of the relevant scenes.Apart from that I've nothing to add to earlier reviews except no one seems to have mentioned the comparison that strikes me between the battle scene at the fort, near the end of the film, and at least one major scene in "Zulu". Surely this implied analogy is also intentional and part of the film's message.</fullReview>

Not his fault, really; he simply overestimated his audience's intelligence.American audiences have been ever more heavily propagandized in the 13 years since this film was released. With the rise of Faux News and their ceaseless pandering to the lowest common denominator, the average American is incapable of discerning the true nature of this film.It's not 'satire' - it's a cautionary portrayal of what happens to a culture that has lost its way and has been force-fed fear for half a generation. With stunning precision, it anticipated the Cheney/Rumsfeld/Bush agenda to use fear to collapse the American middle-class and create generations of cannon-fodder for the new corporate state.Look at any of Leni Riefenstahl's Nazi propaganda films. Compare this to the sub-plot of 'Inglourious Basterds'. Verhoeven and Neumeier's deliberate revisioning of Heinlein's novel is pitch-perfect.</fullReview>

I remember how excited fans of the book were that it was finally being made into a film, and how disappointed they still are that Verhoven did it.I'm not surprised people will try to give the film credibility by talking about how "complex" it is. Um ... no. It's not, really. It doesn't come across as having a bad script and bad acting and a morally bankrupt point of view because it's making a statement, it comes across that way because has a bad script it's truly badly directed and yeah, most of the acting isn't great. On the other hand, the script's subtle-as-a-jackhammer political agenda and wooden dialogue would have been hard to rise above even if the director did have some sort of vision that was worth sharing. Why bother using Heinlein's book if you have so little respect for it? Why ruin the film adaptation of a book for your own purposes? How arrogant, self-serving and irresponsible is that? The combat sequences make no sense whatsoever, with the hi-tech Space Marines charging the Bugs in a way that would seem more appropriate in "Braveheart" being especially bad.I can't remember being more disappointed by a film, ever. You won't just want your money back; you'll be regretting losing those two hours of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glossy , Entirely Dumb But Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Verhoeven's STARSHIP TROOPERS is certainly a film that doesn't stand up to repeated viewing . The first half consists of the most unlikely military recruits put on to celluloid . You get the impression that the recruits are taking part in a beauty contest rather than a military training camp , all those these bimbos and pretty boys totally fail to convince . Like ancient Rome they're joining the military to receive citizenship but why ? They all have perfect teeth which means this future meritocracy has a much better health system than we've got in present day Britain so is this authoritarian society so bad ? By the way if we're subjected to a one world government does this explain why everyone speaks with a similar accent no matter what their nationality or ethnic background ? Apparently main pretty boy Johnny Rico is Argentine but looks like he's stepped out of Beverly Hills California same as nearly everyone else in the film . So much for diversityDespite stepping up several gears in the second half of the movie the audience are still subjected to a complete lack of logic in the story . Roger Ebert has asked if the human race is capable of interstellar travel then why are they incapable of coming up with an effective insecticide ? A good point but why even bother with insecticide ? Surely it'd be a good idea to send missiles containing warheads of several megatons of explosive towards the bug colonies ? No matter how much you try to explain it away you're left thinking of what a ridiculous idea it is to send ground troops to a planet to engage in pitched battles with literally billions of self aware homicidal insectsActually I've just realised why , because if humanity nuked the bugs then we'd be left with two hours of THE OC IN OUTER SPACE with the last two minutes composed of a couple of large explosions and that would have made for an extremely boring film . Say what you like about the first sixty minutes of the running time ( And if you've nothing nice to say about it I'll agree with you ) but the second half of STARSHIP TROOPERS is very gory fun with Verhoeeven delivering the goods . It's certainly not a masterpiece of intellectual SF cinema but it is very entertaining as long as you don't think about it too hard</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This travesty is a tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All of the comments praising Verhoeven and this satire/parody of war movies miss the true horror of ST the Movie: he co-opted the title of a truly wonderful story about what it means to be a citizen, what it means to be individuals cooperating to create a society. Taking a few names from Starship Troopers (the novel), the points that Verhoeven makes in his (IMHO) ham-handed manner are made at the expense of the points made in the book. (The government of the novel is, for example, not fascistic, nor is propaganda used to sway public opinion. In fact, questioning authority and tradition, through fact gathering and analysis, is a requirement for becoming an officer in the Federation's military.)I don't mind Verhoeven making points of his own, but I detest him abusing a classic work of literature. I've seen comments saying that "perhaps it wasn't close enough to the book." There is no perhaps in this case, this movie took a few proper nouns and the idea that the main enemies are "bugs," and that is the sum total of Verhoeven's theft. What's next for him, Paris Hilton as Tom Sawyer, rafting down the Seine?Read the book and avoid the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can watch this film in three ways I think, one, is with a bag of popcorn, a few beers and some friends, and just try to enjoy the ride. Two, is with your thinking cap on, and to really try to take in all the subtle, and not so subtle satire, and anti-propaganda that this film offers. Three, is a mix of the above, and it's the way I think a lot of people have started to watch this movie, at least that is the case for me.When I first saw this movie in the theatre, I loved the movie for really simple reasons(not bad, but simple) it was visually stunning for it's time, it had funny, over the top characters that you just can't help but to love, and a cast of really easy on the eye actors.Then I bought the DVD, and started to notice all the social commentary that I kinda missed the first time around, and now I hold this film as one of my all-time favorites, maybe even top 5.I see a lot of difference in opinion on these boards, and I can't help but to think that the people that do not like this movie, have not moved away from the first example I wrote on how to watch this film, and simply do not like sci-fi films, and don't want to give credibility to the genre.For people who DO like sci-fi, and are open to new takes on the sci-fi genre, this movie is a godsend. It's a treat for the eyes, ears, and brain, and just one of the most entertaining movies I've ever had the privilege to see. If you haven't seen it, I envy you, cause you're in for a real treat.If I had rated this movie back when it came out, I would have given it a seven, maybe an eight, but now, after so many years, and views, I have come to the conclusion that this movie deserves a top score, ten out of ten from Sweden.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NAZIS IN SPACE!!! Well it sure as heck ain't Starship Troopers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Starship Troopers Film adaptation (Henceforth reffered to as "Nazis in Space") is the worst interpratation of Heinlein's novel. The only thing "Nazis In Space" has in common with the Starship Troopers novel is the title and names of the characters, ships, and planets. Oh yeah, they keep the Bugs, however the bugs in the Novel are more intelligent.Also the Government system portrayed in the book is more akin to the Athenian government, with Veterans the only ones alowed to vote. In "Nazis in Space", the govenment system is a Socialist Dictatorship.Now we get to the Powered Suits, the vehicles that give the Mobile Infantry it's name. These magnificant Machines are left out of "Nazis in Space". Think "Top Gun" without the Fighter Jets, that's the same scenario you have with "Nazis in Space".In conclusion: If you want to check out Heinlein's work, go read the book or watch a "Fansub" of the Japanese Anime version (Yes there is one out). If you want utter crap that is a deviation from the book it's allegedly based upon, "Nazis in Space" is for you.PS: Please excuse the poor spelling. That's the price I pay for being an Engineer (we can't spell for beans).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>misunderstood masterpiece??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, maybe not masterpiece. But Starship Troopers is one of those great films that grows on you the more you see it.Verhoeven has said his life was changed by witnessing the violence of WWII up close and personal. On the surface Starship Troopers is an homage to those gung-ho WWII (propaganda) movies, but Verhoeven shows what those movies NEVER showed: the horrifying, grisly reality of war. The casting emphasizes his point: he takes barbie and ken doll actors, sets them up for a fun adventure fighting bugs, then literally rips their arms and heads off! The only problem is the characters are still gung-ho barbie and ken dolls at the end, with some well placed smudges and bruises. Had they been burned out human wrecks I think people would have gotten what Verhoeven was going for. But maybe that would have been too much.I also think this was misunderstood because the 'heroes' are, in a sense, the bad guys! A reporter makes a comment half way through the film that the bugs were harmless until humans invaded their territory. The opening TV news show even says that the conflict started when Mormons opened a mission on the bug planet (this is something I missed first time around.) But again, the relatively lame ending soft pedals this theme, so by the time Doogie Houser shows up wearing an SS trenchcoat, torturing the poor Brain Bug, people tend to laugh and dismiss the deeper meaning.Starship Troopers also has some of the best FX ever! The bugs are flawless. Notice how the dead humans resemble squased bugs! The 'Alamo' sequence is breathtaking, especially on the big screen. Same with the big battle scene, with hundreds of orbiting troopships discharging hundreds of landing ships, while plasma blobs shoot up from the planet. We even follow one of the landing ships to the ground (while others get blasted with plasma), then watch the soldiers run out and over to a cliff, where huge Tanker(?) bugs literally fart out the plasma blobs that are destroying the orbiting troop ships. It's an mazing sequence. The music score is also great.I know a lot of people who hated this film when it first came out. But I think it's because they took it at face value. This is a film that really comes together on second viewing. If only the ending weren't such a thematic cop out...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swiftian satire at its finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off with saying that I hate Heinlein. No, don't get me wrong, he's one of the best serious sci-fi writers of the 20-th century, along with Asimov, Stanislav Lem and Yefremov. But it is social and political aspect of his works that I just can't accept. It goes like some strange blend of Italian fascism, overwhelming racism and purely Kiplingian he-man romance. And Paul Verhauven does great job satirizing precisely this aspect of Heinlein's writing in his "Starship troopers".Now, merely good satire is basically source material concept developed into absurd via its internal logic and laughed at. Truly great satire reconstructs the utopian world of writer's dream... just emphasizing some over-the-tops and inconsistencies. And it brings this world to rubbish to laugh at. It is always subtle and razor-sharp. That is why people often don't get it and despise "Starship Troopers" as a no-brainer actioner. It is far from that.Enter the squeaky-clean fascist utopia. Everyone is mild-mannered and clean shaven, well-educated and white (living in Buenos-Aires, mind you). Big clean biology class, where all students must cut live bugs in halves to know what's inside (and for most part they like it). Your unfortunate exam results are readily available on the large screen for everybody to see, as well as your name in KIA list later. And don't forget to enlist - otherwise you can't vote and impress your girl. Kill big dangerous bugs - as an infantry trooper and with rifle fire only. Want to learn more - get a citizenship? Do you still want to live in such a society?One of the best moments for me is when friends show our hero his KIA card through the regeneration-camera glass. They are all very happy indeed... and don't see anything wrong with it. While I'm getting shivers down my spine. It's really scary, they don't understand what IS wrong with it! And the downbeat ending, even if it doesn't look this way... joyful fascism goes strong! No bugs could defeat it! (and, you know, now you may enlist at an earlier age. Want to learn more?)Summary: very good movie combining awesome CGI with profound satirical insight into technocratic fascist utopia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They sucked our brains out....and it was good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps nine out of ten of you will recoil in disgust even at the name of the movie, before you've even cracked open its ectoplasmic shell and gorged on the space goo inside...shame on you. Whilst the cast is a bizarre troupe of shambolic non-actors, (save for Ironside), and whilst the story seems to have rolled out of the mind of a toddler playing Spaceships and Aliens, Starship Troopers is perhaps one of the most engaging, outrageously entertaining pieces of cinematic history I have come across. Screenplaywright Neumeier takes Heinlein's somewhat obscure and simplistic model of "alien-threat-mankind-doomed-war-ensues" and moulds it into a deeply, deeply dark comedy. Credit where credit is due, Verhoeven has captured and then gifted us with shockingly surreal scenes that stun and catch us off guard. It is not often one can boast a film that sees a soldier-cum-reporter describing mid-battle the "ugly, bug planet" only to get ripped in half by a ten foot arachnid whilst his cameraman continues capturing every gory second. The boot camp process is dealt with an unnervingly brutal efficiency, without losing an ounce of the blackly comic introduction to the later, and equally blunt settings. The defence of the Fort is a brilliantly defiant yet hopeless stand, and the settings of an alien planet appealing to both that hung-ho, Chuck Norris-esquire persona, and the childhood nightmare, Tim Burton-esquire fear that run though us all. The gore and violence intertwines perfectly with a comic love-square, in a surreal tribute to man's competition against one another. Such violence is bewildering yet strangely enchanting, and I found myself drawn into the film as a result. Akin to the hopelessly adolescent antics of the Japanese class in the Battle Royale series, Starship Troopers strength lies within its availability to be one of the most startlingly blunt films ever. It doesn't demand a deep concentration in order to engage with it, but it commands an interest that leaves you feeling bizarrely battered, but nonetheless entertained. Who can resist immortal lines such as "They sucked his brains out!", "Fire 'em up...give 'em all you've got!" and Rico's bitter scream of "DIZZY LOOK OUT!" as an arachnid forklifts her? I challenge you to sit down, kick off those dancing shoes, and enjoy a film made for one purpose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bursting with action and cringe-worthy cliche's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NOT one of Paul Verhoeven's best efforts.This movies a real mixed bag. On one hand, it has lots of great action sequences that feature some really great looking effects, which are often incredibly complex and fill the screen with an amazing amount of activity. On the other hand, this movie packs an unimaginable amount of the most cringe-worthy, clich-ridden dialog you're likely ever to witness from a single movie (barring Ed Wood movies), you'll hear actors a plenty spout out lot's of angsty verbage that's intended to sound macho - but generally just sounds forced and juvenile. That's a pretty accurate word to describe much of the acting seen throughout this movie, juvenile, though meat-headed would also be perfectly fitting and I'd be willing to bet this movies quite popular among WWE Wrestling fans and those, above the age of 12, who still eat macaroni and cheese on a regular basis. Just listen to it "Starship Troopers" the very title of the movie is VERY childish and generic sounding, as if some 3rd grader came up with it one day and told his daddy. This is one of those unfortunate movies that feels as if it's sapping/lowering your IQ while your watching it and that's primarily due to the typically terrible dialog your constantly hearing from a less-than-convincing cast, which is filled out with a bunch of pseudo-tough-guy actors. Note: You may notice that none of these actors ever appear in an action film of this budget ever again. Why is that? The star, Casper Van Dein is primarily a direct-to-video actor, but he did reprise his role as Johnny Rico in, gasp, "Starship Troopers 3:Marauder". That's right, this over-the-top Sci-Fi rubbish spawned at least two sequels (which I've fortunately never seen) of which I'm sure are of even lesser quality then the original, the sequels probably look more like a SCIFY-original movie (cringe) and we all know how GOOD those are. Sharknado anyone? First Show Girls and then Starship Troopers, hmmmm...........it would certainly seem that Verhoeven had hit a rough patch in the mid-90's, but rest assured he'd dig his way out of it with several quality movies afterwards; although his best work (Robo Cop and Total Recall) were well behind him by then.Note: If machine-gun fire is your only interest, then factually speaking, Starship Troopers is the best movie ever - as it does hold the record for the most blank ammunition ever used in a film.A good joke. Starship Troopers currently boasts a 7.2 rating - Oh my!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technologically impressive but I'm not sold on the satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface, "Starship Troopers" is a standard sci-fi actioner about a group of soldiers sent to battle giant bugs on a distant planet. However, the movie also functions as a satire on fascism &amp; militarism. While the intent of the filmmakers was admirable, the result didn't completely hit the mark.The first stumbling block is the cast. Featuring the likes of Denise Richards, Casper Van Dien &amp; Patrick Muldoon, the emphasis is clearly more on looks than on acting ability. While I can understand that this supports the movie's propagandistic approach, it's still no excuse for having to endure their wooden acting. On the bright side, Dina Meyer is a capable lead and there's some characteristically strong support from Michael Ironside &amp; Clancy Brown.The story isn't without its flaws, either. The characters' romantic entanglements wouldn't be out of place in a soap opera. With the cardboard cutout characters, this aspect of the story holds very little interest for me. The action-oriented parts of the film are well executed but the supposedly ironic glorification of war doesn't quite achieve its goal because of so many other movies that have unironically done the exact same thing.As for the good, the Oscar nominated special effects have held up surprisingly well and are still pretty impressive most of the time. Paul Verhoeven's past work proved him to be a talented director (especially of sci-fi) but its still surprising how successfully he got his actors involved in the action in such an effects heavy movie. Overall, the presentation is slick almost to the point of soullessness but the movie does definitely look good.Ultimately, your reception of "Starship Troopers" will probably depend on whether or not the satiric elements work for you or if all you really want is to simply enjoy soldiers fighting giant bugs (with a little T&amp;A thrown in for good measure). I give Verhoeven credit for crafting a movie that's deeper than it initially appears even though the execution doesn't always live up to his lofty vision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'War makes fascists of us all.'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Starship Troopers" is a glossy, tongue-in-cheek love triangle teen soap opera set in a future ultra-fascist military state during a war with an aggressive and repellent alien insect species. The action is over the top, extremely violent, yet it's so full of itself and it's own bombast, it's hard not to like. There is no deep message, no award winning acting. It is a propaganda movie of the highest cynicism, portraying war as all, and silently saying 'yeah, you love it, don't you?' The movie's plot also hints at a lot of ideas, obviously remnants of Heinlein's original book. The principal characters, all teenagers, live in an idyllic, yet fascist society that promotes violence as strength. That violence is directed outward, towards a common foe. The story follows the naive adolescents as they go through military training and then find themselves at war with giant bugs from space. Civil rights are granted only to those that survive their military service. The parallel with the insect society can't be a coincidence. As to Verhoeven's remarks about his "satirizing", I think that the Hollywood political correctness machine put the pressure on him. I mean, has he done anything significant since this movie? Though this movie doesn't delve deeply into the political concepts of the book, it still unfolds from those viewpoints and people who think it is deriding those concepts may be overreacting to the satirical moments in it.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most underrated film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not sure that I have ever seen another film before that presents and criticise so well the all human nature. Which summarily can be told as "conquer or submit".I strongly believe that if a person, a nation, a society, a civilization, or a specie, lose its will power to conquer others, it is finally doomed to be submitted to others. Being a master first of all means that at least you are not a slave. What I love in the Starship Troopers is that it shows in a unique way both that the war is a waste of human resources and how unethical might result to be, but also how necessary for your own survival is to rule others. In that film humans are no better than those alien bugs, but also they are no worse. They both just trying to dominate the other side for reasons that goes too deep to explain.So Starship Troopers is an epic tribute to the nature of war and at the same time is one of the strongest satirizing war films. Even more is satirizing not just war, but mainly using a war as a reason to satirize the core of the human nature. It is both militaristic and anti militaristic without presenting a simplistic nationalist or a simplistic leftist point of view. We all know if it wasn't the USA it would be the USSR or if it wasn't the British empire it would be the German empire, and so on if it wasn't the French it would be the Spaniards or the Dutch. There always be an enemy and if you don't fight him, he will fight you. Verhoeven's Starship Troopers is a philosophical paradox that in this story judges humans for their fight of their own existence. It is like doing the right thing, for the right reasons, but you can never win without doing the wrong thing for the wrong reasons. Paradox!Other popular films with similar subject, like Avatar or Independence Day, they are not even close to the full perspective of ST.Surely is one of the most underrated films. It should be in top 50 at least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers was made in the craze of all the sci-fi films. and gladly so! Because like a lot of them, it is also very good caliber of story, dialogue, acting and world design. Based on the famous Robert A. Heinlein novel, Starship Troopers is set in a world of the future where militarism is the norm, largely because we've discovered alien civilizations of huge insect-like creatures and we're at war with them. The film follows a quartet of high school friends as they make their varied ways through the military.Starship Troopers is both a tongue-in-cheek satire of society and an intense sci-fi/action/war film filled with horror-like insect monsters and a healthy dose of graphic gore. That's a genre combination that will not please all viewers, especially if the tongue-in-cheek humor goes over their heads. For those more in tune with the genre melding, Starship Troopers promises a quick, edge-of- your-seat ride from the first moments to the last.Paul Verhoeven was a master at making Sci-Fi films which worked both as perfect mainstream popcorn cinema and as very intelligent social commentary on the direction - he felt - society was headed. And despite the fact that the over-the-top satirical elements and highly political undercurrents in Robocop and Total Recall were only appreciated by a few critics at the time, those two films became huge hits at the box office: because they also offered great action, amazing special effects and overall great entertainment.</fullReview>

The actors all did a good job, especially Casper Van Dien, he wasn't too bad to look at either. The movie's script and dialogue was alright, nothing to brag about crazily, but if you put in this movie, I doubt very much you're looking for good dialogue. As far as the action goes, which is most likely what you are looking for. The action was good, not great. I don't have many complaints for this one. One character dies that I was unhappy with, I wished they would've lived. Also, I didn't really care for Neil Patrick Harris's character, I would've been perfectly fine if they would've scratched him out of the movie. The creatures were pretty cool looking, especially the main leader of them all, that big blob thing. That was really cool to see. Overall I'll give starship troopers a 7/10.</fullReview>

Did anyone notice that the men and women were treated equally? That both sexes could perform any position to fight and save the world? The first time I watched this, I thought it was OK, good action, campy. The more I watched it, the more I got the meaning and the humor. Now this is one of my favorite movies. And I hated Battle Star Galactica... however you spell it. I like Sci-Fi but not brainless non-humor Sci-Fi.

Wanton, egregious violence, complete with Spaghetti-o gore chunks and rent limbs, tossed carelessly through the frame like so many croutons in a cooking program. Dialog so silly it would've been rejected from the Sunday funnies, delivered with all the passion and subtlety of a knot-laden tree trunk. Not-quite-there CG, featured prominently throughout, and blunt, cringe-worthy humor, smeared over every inter-scene segue. In many ways it's worthy of applause, if just for casting aside the rulebook and giving in to total, uninhibited overindulgence. It certainly isn't a boring picture (well, excluding maybe ten minutes in the early third act) so it's got that going for it, and the creepy-crawly enemy creatures are appropriately strong throughout - even when it would've been easy to turn them into mere cannon fodder for the final battle. The scale seems all wrong, though, with the lead constantly tripping over familiar faces despite a sizable chunk of humanity being involved in the military offensive, and I never really cared for a single one of them. Although it offers a few interesting underexplored subcurrents and an admirable knack for ballsy action, I usually found myself laughing at this one for all the wrong reasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Meta as a satire. Maybe it is great if you agree with the message, but not that great as a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is not a very good movie by itself. It can be very interesting if you leave the movie and try to place it in context of the real life--especially if you agree with Verhoeven's message.People point out that the movie is supposed to be full of biting satire. Yet, the problem is that the satire is not especially obvious to most viewers, unless they were, somehow, already receptive to the movie's message. To the more naive viewers, the movie just seems like full of poor, over-the-top, and unmotivated acting without much of a plot (all of which are true). If the seemingly ignorant reaction of the audience is itself part of the satire (even if unintended), that seems like like an indictment of the movie rather than a plaudit: if the audience doesn't get the message, the movie failed to deliver it properly. If the only people who get it are those who agree with the movie's themes already, it is a poor communicator, which, in turn, makes for not-exactly-a- great movie.If the movie were actually better written, acted, and its point more apparent, it might have been an actually good movie whose virtues can be appreciated by everyone, whether they agreed or not. In its current form, it is just a polemic that leaves the audience has to fill in what it is polemical about--and leaves them confused if they don't know the context.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heinlein would have hated this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a military sci-fi epic set in a future in which Earth is engaged in a total war with spider-like aliens. We follow Rico (who looks like a Ken doll) as he is joins the infantry, is trained, goes off into battle and gets caught up in a battle to destroy the enemy aliens.The film has certain characteristics that some will find hard to get past. They have been described in detail in other reviews, so I'll pass on most of it. A few points though...The worst problem for me was that the basic training, infantry life and battle scenes seemed so ineptly done, clich and unrealistic. There was no grittiness, no toughness. Just pretty Hollywood puppets playing at it. For the love of pete, they ran into battle as a ragged line, shooting from the hip! Really??I haven't researched it, so I don't know why the movie was done this way. I have to wonder if they had any military advisers, and if so, why didn't they listen to them. Why was there little or no effort to show the military in a realistic light? Contempt?This wasn't just Hollywood's usual clich take on the military, it was like they purposefully tried to parody the clichs. Was that it? Was Verhoeven trying to show how outdated Heinlein's world view has become? Was this a parody? The movie had this strange camp feel to it, an unexpected earnestness, an over-the-top quality. There was plenty of gore, of the cartoonish movie variety. Barbie and Ken being ripped apart by spiders. (Come to think of it, this probably explains the relatively high IMDb score.) Why did someone from Buenos Aires speak perfect idiomatic American English? Sorry, I just don't get it.The dialogue seemed wooden and clich at times. I couldn't get into any of the characters at all. OK, maybe the problem was that they tried to fit too much in. This might have been better as a series.Having said all this, there were a few cool moments in the movie.I loved Heinlein when I was a kid. I bought his tough philosophizing and glorification of the military. I ate it up hook, line and sinker. Indeed, I loved this book and wanted to be a starship trooper. This movie has reminded me how much I was into Heinlein.I should have loved this movie, but I'm going to rate it fairly low for now. I'll reread the book and then watch the movie again. Perhaps there is something I missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best. SciFi. Movie. Ever. I waited a long time to watch this because the trailer made it look like such a cheesy B movie. Totally wrong. Sure, you pretty much have to forget everything you've ever learned about physics, biology, etc, but that hardly matters, because this film is actually a very sharp and biting social commentary and satire cloaked in a SciFi story with halfway-decent special effects. Without a doubt, the movie is very campy (but that's part of the both the appeal and the satire), and if insects make you uncomfortable, then this movie might not be for you, since these highly aggressive (highly defensive?) multi-legged monsters could eat elephants. The film hits you over the head with many of its big ideas (not that they're dumb ones), but other insights only strike you after you've reflected a bit (assuming that you bother to do so). Unfortunately, in today's highly politically-charged world, I'd wager that many people will actually take this film at face value. The fact that this self-contained movie had sequels is worrisome, since any need to carry on this story is purely superficial and would almost certainly only dilute it's substance--this isn't a Godfather-type situation at all. I'm guessing that a lot of people simply weren't interested in any deeper messages, and the studio cynically exploited the great unwashed's desire for more bug splatter. So, in conclusion, this is really a great movie that's highly entertaining (two hours fly by before you notice it), with the added bonus of carrying some actual reasonably substantial intellectual weight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Entertaining Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed Starship Troopers, having read the book beforehand. While it is different from Heinlein's original novel, Starship Troopers is a very good action-oriented sci-fi film that most people will enjoy. You can watch it as pure entertainment, which it does a very good job at; or you can watch it and analyze the underlying themes, plots, and the attempts it makes at being more like the book. Either way, you won't be disappointed. All of the main actors do a decent job and Michael Ironside does a superb job in a significant supporting role. The special effects are quite good and the director (Verhoeven) keeps the story moving along at a fast pace while still allowing the audience to get to know and care about the characters. There is a large amount of violence in this picture, so you won't like the film if you can't stand a good bit of blood and gore (both human and alien). This violence, however, just makes the mood of the movie seem more realistic with the "down on the ground" feeling of war that this film attempts to impart to the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A kind of good Sci-Fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating-7/10Starship Troopers is a Sci-Fi film that borders on the utterly crazy, but it actually turns out well and with some good old 90's action scenes, makes for a cool feeling film too. The whole thing could be criticised much more but I didn't feel it deserved much at all and with the film having humorous parts as well as serious, it makes for fun and thriller all the same. I felt the film was safely kind of good, near being just OK than good but here is why I thought that about this movie.The story is fast when fighting and slow when not as it should be obviously, but sometimes the film can be maybe just a little slow and ruins any thrills we might get from the characters. I liked the action scenes and the fighting is interesting to say they face such strange creatures throughout, they seem to never know how to kill them properly though. The plot gets better as it goes on, I could feel it was slightly unreasonable as a film but nevertheless it is entertaining and fun all round.The cast are not the part of the film I would call anywhere good, most seem to falter in battle with wooden acting in the face of possible death, and over the top screaming when injured, the cast don't do such a great job. The main actor and hero Casper Van Dien try's his hardest to get it started but with so much bad acting around it is only a matter of time until it fails in this department. Not all the blame can go on them as I felt acting in such a crazy plot but being serious also must be hard.I enjoyed the effects a lot and when they are in space not only are the sets for the place extremely good, the entire effects system for the spaceships are fantastic to say it is in the 90's. Scripted averagely and directed the same they never pick up and although not bad, they don't help the film to it's final rating much at all. The creatures are also well done and better effects are known now but still you see the aliens in this and believe they are real(to say that if you are engrossed in the story).It's criticism comes from what I have already said, wooden acting, but also the film never gages your interest and although by the end you feel you have seen a Pretty Good movie, the movie fails to leave a legacy with you, but that was just me, certain some will love it more. I don't think anything else is wrong but I know some will find this ridiculous and stupidly made, form your own opinion on this, it's worth a watch.People who like Sci-Fi should enjoy this but it never takes that much of a dark tone to say it is a 15, much worse is around now and only at a 12 but Starship Troopers still manages to entertain and bring violence and gore that isn't fake. On that note if you don't like violence and gore don't watch it, it contains a lot and especially near the end, not loads of blood is seen but Alien guts don't make for a lovely sight.Overall a 7/10 from me and it was Safely a Kind of Good film that pleased me but not so much as to say it straight good. I know some will like this and I think it may have a cult audience already, it's the kind of movie you can love to hate or hate to love and divides opinion because of it's cheesy like themes and not great acting, nevertheless see it and see what you think, calling all you Sci-Fi fans especially.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Way to Make Science Fiction Edgy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was reminded of this film when recently watching Pacific Rim. I found many similarities that in comparison I could point out moments where Pacific Rim could have been better. Primarily, there are the scenes as our young protagonists train for battle. Director Verhoeven takes potentially clich and dull scenes and makes them edgy. While training, the drill sergeant breaks someone's leg during a fight demonstration. Students dissect a bug and the female lead vomits on screen. The soldiers shower coed. Then there is some dark humour. Verhoeven also pushes the gore to the extreme, including a scene where someone gets his brains sucked out.But once the action kicks in, there are many many huge effects shots that are flawless. This film was released before the new Star Wars prequels, and I distinctly remember thinking that this film has now raised the bar, and that expectations for Phantom Menace would have to be at least comparable to the effects in Starship Troopers (they were). I thought the casting was workable. All good looking, and given some conflicts to resolve. Although there is a scene where Casper Van Dien's math grades are posted on a huge public display. I doubt even in the dystopian future that schools would allow anyone to look up other student's scores.Other side characters add a lot of humour and thrills, keeping the film interesting as it explores their lives. I was disappointed with the dull character exposition in Pacific Rim, and felt the director should have taken cues from this film. I got the impression when Verhoeven first took on this project, he looked for ways to add excitement, including the character exposition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>false flag attack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy 100,000?120,000 light-years in diameter containing 100?400 billion stars. The bug planets are on the other side of it from us, at least 50,000 light-years away. Meaning even with the speed of light those asteroids would have needed to travel 50,000 years before hitting earth (talk about good aim). I think this information was given deliberate in the movie and points to a false flag attack. Also loads of death young people lead to a greater feeling of patriotism and willingness to endure a totalitarian regime which might be why the first assault is as dumb as landing on the most fortified area of the Atlantic coast on d-day was. But maybe that is giving the excellent screenplay too much credit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>more than just an action sci-fi gore fest - political and propaganda narrative too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Known as a cheesy b-movie, Starship Troopers is better than I expected. It is a gore-fest, it isn't big on intelligent script or scintillating wit, and is big on action but it has a bigger story to tell about a future utopia threatened and how society fights to save itself. It speaks about equality, it speaks about leadership that does rather than orders, it speaks of earning citizenship for all - not having privilege as a birthright and there are overtones of right wing military propaganda and the ends justifying the means. As Sci-Fi writing it is very good, and I'd like to read the book by Robert A Heinlein.The acting isn't superb, but Dina Meyer was excellent and very committed to her role - I liked her in Johnny Mnemonic - and Casper Van Dien was alright, but much of the acting wasn't superb lots of running around and shouting, except for some of the familiar veterans. It's rather gory and violent but much of the SFX are very good, others are quite shockingly bad. It's a mish-mash. All a bit gung ho and heavy on the propaganda aspects. There is something quite sinister about some of the wardrobe (reminiscent of Nazi/3rd Reich), and Neil Patrick Harris' character. It also highlighted the cruelty towards POW's being considered justified, the "brain" creature's treatment was quite disturbing. As a SFX/CGI sci-fi violent action film it was fair to middling, but as a deeper meaning futuristic sci-fi I'd like to know more and the film has more run in it's tank.</fullReview>

Just a personal preference, but Dizzy was like 10 times hotter and more attractive than Carmen. Also, like most, I believe Carmen's hooker ass should have been the one to die off in the movie. She comes off as a disloyal, ditsy slut. What movie kills the hot chick and leaves the so-so looking chick alive, especially one with such unappealing qualities? That being said, the special effects were fantastic and most of the story line was excellent!! Too bad the sequel films in the series didn't live up to the first. I'm certain it had to do with budgetary concerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starship Troopers ? Glorious sci-fi action without being too serious about it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is a science-fiction action flick that is also a little caricature of itself. You can't take it seriously, or you'll be missing the point, really. The bravado is exaggerated, the undertakings are epic, and the army isn't very bright.That being said, the future it depicts is an interesting take, and it was well exploited and presented.I love Casper Van Dien, Dina Meyer, Neil Patrick Harris, and Michael Ironside in their respective roles. They really give this flick all its flair. You want to slap some sense in Denise Richards' character and kick her co-pilot's ass, but that's what the director had obviously in mind. All in all, it's a nice cast.Now, this movie has a special dichotomy: most of the CGI are very well done, whereas some of sets especially when it comes to shuttles, interior or exterior, look a little bit on the cheap side. Maybe it's a question of bad design, but it's weird.Anyway, it's good entertainment, especially if you like sci-fi and action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great cheesy awesomeness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Awe man where to start with this one. The film is ultimate cheesy goodness. The plot, dialogue, and a few of the action scenes are goofy as hell and make it hard to take the movie seriously at times but then you get awesome alien killing action and the overall tone of the film feeling like a parody of modern war films. All of the war propaganda and the whole reasoning for the war seemed to share a lot of similarities despite the fact that these are alien bugs we are fighting. I suppose the message would be that war is war no matter who the enemy. Back to the cheesiness tho since this seems to be where the movie really gets it personality. Spoiler time! Dizzies character constantly made me laugh. The way shes always trying to hard to get her man and making obviously jealous faces and denise richards. This was, well, cheesy and then when she passes you feel bad for her character but cant help but laugh at her passing words. Another part that had me constantly shaking my head was how each character "coincidentaly" continue to run into each other no matter where they go, its incredibly unbelievable but its easy to get over because in a money like this, it kind of fits. One other noteworthy part would be the stupid football play they do where buddy does the funny looking flip over his opponents and then they decide to use it in combat, you all know what part im talking about, its comedy. Now going hand in hand with the cheesiness is the awesomeness, and by this i mean the battle scenes against the aliens. These scenes are incredibly gory to a point that its almost surprising and unexpected. I loved every minute of it. Starship troopers is a badass sci fi, alien war movie that has to be seen to believe. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Archie and Jughead in Outer Space!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an example where the movie is an improvement on the literary work from which it springs. I first became aware of 'Starship Troopers' while flipping through a book called 'DiFate's Catalog of Science Fiction Hardware'. This tome was co-authored by Vincent DiFate and Ian Summers. It described many things; among them being the 'Power Suit' that Johnny Rico and his fellow 'Starship Troopers' wear in the novel of the same name. There are also side, front and top view drawings of a couple of the items Johnny gears up with to fight the bugs.Now the 'Power Suit' is conspicuously absent in 'Starship Troopers' the movie, though a modified version of it does appear in 'Starship Troopers III'. There is no need for worry, however. The Science Fiction World of Robert E. Heinlein is so vividly realized the omission of the 'Power Suit' hardly seems worth mentioning.'Starship Troopers' easily ranks up there with the top twentyfive Science Fiction films of all time. An argument could be made placing it among the top five, because, as I mentioned before, it feels like you're looking at a real world and observing a real culture with its own specific quirks and idiosyncrasies. The fact that the film is undergirded with the literary imagination of Heinlein has a great deal to do with that, but the director has given the story subtle twists that make it more timely and comedic in its appeal.Before 'Starship Troopers' I had read 'Assignment in Eternity', a book of short stories and novellas, and was yet to read the novel 'Stranger in a Strange Land'. The last work considered by many one of Heinlein's masterpieces. But 'Assignment in Eternity' gave me a pretty fair idea of what to expect from Heinlein.When I got to the end of 'Starship Troopers' the novel, I felt like Heinlein was singing the praises of a society that valued its fighting men and its militaristic advance across the Cosmos above all else, and this short-sightedness made the novel something of a cultural curiosity to me. The director of the movie also promotes these values with a straight face, but rips into the vivid horrors of War with such pedal to the metal abandon no one has to tell you war is hell, nor is any character needed in the story to represent the Anti-War sentiment. That is left to you and the nature and the depth of your own moral reaction. Simply by asserting the rightness of military action the director makes you aware that something has been left out of the equation, as I felt when reading the book. Certain things simply do not fit, but where this makes for satirical comedy in the movie, you were simply aware of a culture that was filling its vacuousness with exploits of military valor.The novel was like 'The Red Badge of Courage' in Outer Space; a true coming of age story. I felt you had to take it on its own merits in spite of its jingoistic message at the end. The movie, however, is a different matter. Like 'The Maltese Falcon', seeing the characters personified by real people clarifies the themes in a more agreeable and satisfying way. The novel 'The Maltese Falcon' brings you to see the roots of Sam Spade's misogyny, but the movie is a somewhat more playful exercise in cat and mouse deception. Here too, with the film 'Starship Troopers', you get to see how Media and Education can culturally condition a whole generation of young people to throw their lives away in Outer Space without anyone questioning their moral or spiritual right to do so.The main characters remind me of Archie, Jughead, Betty and Veronica with regard to the level of their character interaction; slightly above that of a comic book as it was in the novel. But I more than recognized my own high school days and even some of my teachers in the scenes at school. 'Starship Troopers' is an exhilarating ride into the seduction of Military Propaganda and Fascism as patriotic show business.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great movie. Paul Verhoven for the most part holds true to the book. I'm not going to point out the differences because you can get the book and read for yourself. But what we have is a young man Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) making up his own mind contrary to what his parents want, primarily his father, to join the military and become a citizen. However he must graduate from school. He has four main friends Carmen (Denise Richards), Dizzy Florez (Dina Meyers) and Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris). While friends they each have their own unique talents and interest. All four enlist in the military or the Federation. Rico and Flores to the Mobil Infantry, Carmen to the Fleet Academy and Carl to Military Intelligence.They each go off to their respective training elements to gain the knowledge and skills they will each need to succeed. Rico becomes a Squad Leader but during a live fire exercise one of his squad members is killed. The end result he receives disciplinary punishment. He receives 10 lashes. Which makes no sense to me in a society so educated can fly to the stars and communicate anywhere with no time delay they use lashing as a form of punishment. In the meantime Carmen is on her spaceship. She has just made a course correction which is more efficient. Some individuals feel this was a mistake on her part because it put her ship in direct line with the asteroid that eventually struck earth and destroyed Buenos Aires. That's just nonsense how was Carmen to know that was to occur. When it did occur, in my opinion she responded coolly and confidently. Her actions saved most of the ship and preserved her shipmates. Naturally her Captain should compliment her. Most pilots will tell you that flying is hours of boredom punctuated by moments of stark terror.Eventually the Federation realizes the mistake of landing directly Klandanthu the Sky Marshall resigns and a new one is appointed with a different plan. While on Klandanthu Rico was severally wounded and was listed as KIA ( killed in action). When he was actually placed in a rehab tank so the wound is leg could be repaired. When he gets out Ace Levy, Dizzy and Rico are assigned to the Roughnecks. Sort of equivalent to Army Rangers or Marine Recon.It's while in this group that Rico is first promoted Corporal, then to Sergeant and eventually Lieutenant. It is at that rank that he rescues Carmen and is responsible for capturing a brain bug. The bug responsible for controlling all the other bugs. I'm not about to get into the mind of Heinlein and state what the bugs represented. The book is great read and the movie is a great movie. Make of each what you want. The movie is out on DVD and if you subscribe to Netflix and stream it you can get the movie that way as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie; Atrocious film adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert A. Heinlein's 1959 book Starship Troopers had a massive impact on science fiction. It's a staple of Military Sci-Fi and created the rather beloved group of warriors - The Mobile Infantry "Marauders" - that has inspired very many popular series like Warhammer 40,000 and the Halo video game series with their use of iconic armor. The 'Power Armor' as it is called and the massive equipment was a large part of the atmosphere of the story, the soldiers being equipped with enough hardware to be able to drop into a battlezone with numbers in the dozens and take on a whole army with the usage of tactical nukes, armor-mounted jump-jets and extreme strength. This power armor, integral to the original story, was completely disregarded and changes the whole tone of the film.I do like this film, and It's a favorite "mindless action" film of mine because of the Zulu-Esque onslaught of alien nasties that is used in many science fiction stories and many feel never gets old and the general art and uniforms and equipment of the MI soldiers is very cool indeed. But they completely leave out the Marauders until the 3rd film in the series (in short: Don't subject yourself to it. Second one either). Why? It's very frustrating to me that they left that out. And when they finally decided to put it in two movies later, it was extremely lackluster. There are several other small things that are disregarded as well, like the fact that Rico's full name is "Juan 'Johnny' Rico" and he is, in fact, Hispanic as his name and home suggests.I suppose my biggest qualm is that with the misappropriation of the "Starship Troopers" name, and I will be a bit biased and snooty about this, but that's a very large point to me. The movie is fun, and the action sequences and effects are great. It has a few completely idiotic moments in it, but it's still a fun ride, stuffed to the rim with mindless violence that is somewhat tastefully done at times, albeit very grizzly. If you want to get some friends together to watch a cheesy "sci-fi" action film to just have some fun with and not watch a film that deals with much more Sci-Fi than "Aliens" and "Spaceships" or emotions than "Kill the bad guys F*** yeah we're number one", this is your film. If you're wanting something that lives up to the book in any way other than names and very few background elements, look elsewhere and prey somebody can afford to make such an ambitious film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film when I was just a boy and back then I didn't even know that there was such a thing as satire, yet alone recognize it. And I still thought that this was a fun film to watch. I could appreciate its colourful characters, its humour, its blazing action scenes and its interesting setting. And when I grew older I started to notice its commentary on war, media and the social structure that seems to put more weight on killing and warriors than helping its citizens to live happy lives. And I liked that aspect of the film as well.For me this film is the best kind of cheesy fun, the kind that I don't have to feel ashamed of for liking. Because underneath all the corny action shots, the stereotypical yet likable characters and all the almost parodic lines of dialogue, this is an intelligent film. It doesn't shove it to your face that much, and I dare say there are many people out there that don't even realize that this is a satire, but it's there. But the fact is that at least for me this is an enjoyable action film even without all the political and social commentary. I could watch this just fine without thinking any of the underlying questions, but those certainly don't make the film any worse. Quite the opposite in fact.Is it a perfect film? No, it's certainly not for everyone as it is rather cheesy, corny and clichd all at the same time. But there is a hidden face to it and it is full of dark humour. I personally like it, but it's not for everyone. But for those that like either good action films or clever satires, this film is certainly worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't read Heinlein's original novel, so I didn't walk into "Starship Troopers" with any expectations. And maybe if I'd seen this in 1997, it would've lived on for its staggering (for its time) special effects.The movie opens with a close-knit group of friends on the eve of high school commencement. Enlisting in the Federation offers a convenient path to citizenship, so the film follows our cadre of pretty teenagers as they enter boot camp and eventually find themselves swept up in a planetary war with the bugs (really big arachnids).When the bullets aren't flying, the film plays out like a high school drama. Casper Van Dien joins up because his trophy girlfriend (Denise Richards) does. And the unrequited lover (the much more attractive Dina Meyer) joins for Van Dien. But it turns it, Richards in love with her piloting career off in the galaxy, leaving the door open for Van Dien to finally notice Meyer. Add in the slice of Americana, from the big football game to prom, and you've got yourself "90210 in Space" (it isn't lost on me how overused that expression might be, but the shoe fits).To the film's credit, there are some rousing battle scenes (mostly during the bug war), and an impressive effects budget. And the film's anti-war satire was amusing, although a bit campy. Enough to elicit an "Oh, I see what they did there" reaction. It's the teen drama angle that really dragged "Starship Troopers" down for me. I didn't care about any of these people, and the film spends way too much time on them. For a Verhoeven movie, it's no "RoboCop", but it didn't leave me with feelings of disgust like "Basic Instinct", or (god forbid) "Showgirls".5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I set "8 1/2" as my standard for the best. In that context, I see a six as a fair rating for "Starship Troopers." Nevertheless, it's hugely entertaining even though some of it is cheesy and there are various hard critical reviews professional critics would offer. However, they frequently leave out that, despite cheese, a movie can be immensely entertaining and this movie is in that category with me. "Starship Troopers" has the three vital ingredients for a movie that I watch and re-watch for its entertainment value: spaceships, massive explosions and gratuitous nudity. It's fun and so what if it's predictable as I already know how it's going to turn out when I re-watch it anyway. In fact, it's now 2012 and the next thing we'll be doing after finishing this review is to watch it again.Something like "8 1/2" is worthy of reviewing but it's not a movie one watches to be entertained. I'll watch that one when the time is appropriate to give it the level of attention it requires.</fullReview>

The patriotism in the movie is a good thing and the brotherhood it creates and how it motivates young men and women to go out and serve humanity and often sacrifice their life's for it. This is what the author of the book was trying to convey and that you are twisting his work into anti-American sentiments is just wrong. You can interpret it however you see fit but this is not how the writer of the book meant for it to be seen. Next time before you try to twist media for your own goals make sure the author has the same views that you have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Join the Mobile Infantry... travel the galaxy, meet other races and crush them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Genocide Doesn't Compare to This." In a fascist future where earth is united under the Federation, young people finishing school are encouraged to gain citizenship through joining the military. Citizenship in the Federation is not a birthright and can only be gained through risking ones life and sacrificing for the Federation. Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) enlists in the Mobile Infantry, along with his friend Dizzy Flores, while his academic girlfriend Carmen enlists as a pilot, and his psychic friend Carol joins military intelligence. They are enlisting at a time when tensions between the Federation and the Arachnids from the planet Klendathu are at an all-time high. The Arachnids ? also derogatory known as 'Bugs' hurl asteroids towards our planet, which has modified spaceships around the planet to detect incoming attacks and destroy them before they kill humans. But when Buenos Aires, along with other cities, are destroyed by a major Arachnid asteroid attack, the Federation declares war on the Arachnids, prompting an immediate and deadly retaliation where the Mobile Infantry are sent to the Arachnids's home planet to wage war on the "Bugs" and destroy them in order to secure the safety and survival of the human race. A good bug, is a dead bug. That's a line that is uttered on more than a few occasions in Paul Verhoeven's satirical sci-fi masterpiece, which sums up nicely the general view of our enemies. But, as is seen in the film, we greatly undermine our enemy and in the first battle of the war, are defeated, at the cost of thousands of soldiers. Perhaps I over-analyzed this, but I couldn't help but feel like this was an allegory for the Second World War, as well as being a satirical in it's portrayal of Fascism (The funny news bulletins - "Would you like to know more?" greatly accentuate this). It really hit me when the Mobile Infantry first landed on Klendathu in the spacecrafts, which reminded me straight away of the Normandy Landings on D-Day. Very impressive, and if it was meant to be an allegory or whatever, it's very clever. I enjoyed the premise, and story? and the action is superb. It's very intense in places, and is typical gung-ho as the soldiers fight the bugs with over-sized machine guns that never seem to run out of ammo. They also carry 'nuke' launchers. Verhoeven directed this, loosely based off a novel published in 1959 by Robert Heinlein (It was really ahead of it's time apparently). However, I've read that it differs in many ways from it, although I have not read the novel. Verhoeven (Director of "Robocop" and "Total Recall") directs this really well, and the special effects are truly amazing. Some scenes are very stagy looking? like the night invasion of Kelndathu, but that all just adds to the fun and campness of the film. The love triangle is interesting, whereas in most films I find it to be irritating. The acting is good as well for that matter; Casper Van Dien is brilliant as the protagonist Rico, and he is backed by some great performances from actors such as Clancy Brown ("Bad Boys", "The Shawshank Redemption") as the cruel drill sergeant Ricco has in basic training, and Michael Ironside ("Top Gun", "Total Recall") as Ricco's teacher in high school who ends up becoming his sergeant in the war. This is a fine example of a film you either hate or love. There's really no in between. You'll be offended by it and hate it for it's over-the-top heroism and antics of the futuristic young soldiers, or, like myself, you'll love it for it's innovative approach to futuristic galactic warfare and it's intense, breathtaking, and undeniably astonishing special effects and violence. By the way, don't you just love the film's tagline I've chosen? Sums it all up pretty well I would think :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching and enjoying this film, I realized I had been duped. This film is quite entertaining because it is filled with excessive violence and nudity. Lots of people say it is a satire, which it is, but it also tries to be straight forward, mainstream entertainment. Its got war, it's got sex, and it's got a remarkably attractive cast, most of whom strip nude for a memorable coed shower scene. Not a bad way to sell tickets. I do not think that a movie can make it's money entertaining people as one thing and then justify it's own mindless plot by calling it artful satire. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the film.

		<shortDescription>A misunderstood thrill ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can you say "underrated"? Unfairly labeled as nothing more then Sci-Fi exploitation trash, this film is far more deep and thought-provoking than most critics and viewers give it credit for.First off, let me just say that if you're a fan of the novel by Robert A. Heinlan (great book), but you've never seen the movie...do NOT expect a faithful adaptation. The movie is basically nothing at all like the book, with slews of new characters and new plot lines created for the movie that had nothing to do with the book. This however doesn't have to be a bad thing always, and this film is a prime case of that.Where the novel was bleak and poignant, the film is both an in-your-face parody of war and Sci-Fi films, and a biting satire of the rise of fascism and militarism. From Michael Ironside teaching his students in the class room that violence is the "ultimate power" from which all other power is derived, to the blatantly Nazi-esque uniforms that the intelligence officers wear, it's hard to believe how very few people understood this was a satire at heart.The acting can be very wooden at times, but in a way it's actually helpful to the film. Like Southland Tales, another gravely misunderstood film, the actors in the film are supposed to be wooden. They're the perfect war-movie clichs, from the quickly rising hero (Van Dien) to the motor-mouthed wiseass (Jake Busey) to that one overzealous guy who decides he can single-handedly defeat an entire race of bugs. Dina Meyer is actually pretty decent at times though, and Michael Ironside is ALWAYS fun to watch, regardless of what he's in. And did I mention the film includes Neil Patrick Harris? That wins points immediately. Plus this is probably the only film you'll ever watch with Jake Busey in it in which you don't want to claw your eyes out every second he's on the screen (I loved his character in the film as a kid, so much so that I wanted my friends from then on to refer to me as "Ace" in honor of his character. They laughed at me and I was never called Ace again) Another thing worth mentioning are the designs of the alien insects, which are all absolutely fantastic. They look 100% real, and like living, breathing organisms and not computer-generated pixels. The "brain bug" in particular is wonderfully designed.In the end, there's something for everybody in this film. If you want to take it on face value alone as a cheesy sci-fi action romp, you'll no doubt have a great time watching it. If you're looking for something deeper though, this is also a film for you. Upon closer inspection, you'll realize that the human's are not the heroes in the story, but are in fact the invaders encroaching upon space that isn't theirs.Definitely give this one a try if you never have. Maybe you won't pick up on all of the subtle fascistic hints here and there, but it will be virtually impossible for you to not alteast enjoy yourself watching this film. I've seen it probably 20 times since I was a kid and it never gets old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like this type of humor, then the movie's hilarious. I like this type of humor, ergo the hilarity. Basically, over-the-top action sequences with parodies of Nazi-esque propaganda, mixed with some campy acting. Probably a little different than the serious piece of sci-fi storytelling and future sociological admonitions that Heinlein had intended in his novel, but that's what movie adaptations and cover songs are for: a reinterpretation or re-envisioning of the original work.Neil Patrick Harris and Michael Ironside's performances set the camp tone (with decent support from Dina Meyer), and Van Dien, Richards, and Busey providing serviceable framework characters.Verhoeven seems to make either gold or lead.

		<shortDescription>VERY distinctive film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starship Troopers contains many striking features, the most obvious of which is the visual and sound effects. The landscapes, space vehicles, creatures, machinery, and equipment are all very well done. The frightening sights and sounds of the creatures are also a major source of the excitement and angst produced by the film. Unfortunately, other visual effects which depicted grotesque injuries, hideous deaths, and the overall gratuitous violence seem far over-the-top. Since the aircraft and space ships depicted in the movie have devastatingly effective weapons, why is it necessary for the foot soldiers to land on the surface, only to be eviscerated by the hideous creatures? More suspense and fright can often be produced by events which are not seen, but only suggested. It is not necessary or desirable to leave nothing to the imagination of the audience, since what a person fears most in his or her own mind can be more terrifying than anything that could be depicted on screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit that I did not read the book.But having seen RoboCop in the past, I know Paul Verhoeven's always there to make a satire out of today's society.Just look at it all. A fascist society that relies on army service in order to attain citizenship. People only caring about blowing crap up during their service. And what is the motivation of the enemy? Perhaps they have a deep kind of motive to want to destroy the humans. But the military simply doesn't care. They're enemies, pure and simple.People and 'bugs' regularly get ripped to shreds. No big deal. If people get wounded or stabbed, a medic is casually referred to.This film is obviously a fun satiric flick that makes fun of totalitarianism, violence and mankind's presumption of having superior intelligence, all dressed in some kind of fascist propaganda skin which apparently upset quite a few people. Didn't bother me, though. I still got some laughs out of it.Would you like to know more? Just watch it, if you're into people getting ripped into small particles, gigantic 'bug' type creatures, explosions, and space ships. The music by Basil Poledouris is also a good excuse to keep on watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bizarre action-flick that somehow entertains...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember the first time I saw Starship Troopers. I was scanning channels aimlessly and stumbled upon an alien war zone. Intrigued, I watched from about the middle of the film to the end, merely to see what was going to happen next.Recently, I revisited the film to take a better look. What I found was an oddly entertaining sci-fi flick that may or may not have an interesting message to convey.The acting is mediocre at best, as the film's focus seems to be action over character development. Denise Richards is awful and emotionless as a love interest and space pilot. Neil Patrick Harris is wildly miscast as a psychic intelligence officer. Casper Van Dien is occasionally interesting but mainly uninspiring as infantry-man John Rico.The CGI is mediocre. The film came out in 1997, (this is the same year as films like Titanic, M.I.B., The Lost World etc. all of which depend on CGI for their success)and has surprisingly poor effects. The gore is campy and bizarre, and the aliens lack detail and realism.The film runs it's course, and somehow, I can't help but realize that I enjoyed watching the movie.Playing off the aesthetic of WWII era war films, we see a militaristic nation fighting to destroy an alien race that is threatening humanity. With flying captions and campy narratives, we are informed of the valor of the "Starship Troopers" and their war against the evil "Arachnids" At the end of the film, you realize the political undertones involved, and find yourself forgiving the terrible acting and one-liners. What we have here is a biting satire that also entertains and excites the audience.This movie was poorly executed. Very interesting premise. Poorly done.I spent more time laughing at the absurdity of the CGI, choreographed fight sequences, and hole-ridden plot than I did pondering militarism and it's effect on society.6/10 Entertaining for the wrong reasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a horror movie, with a second layer...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't just another movie about mankind battling aliens and saving the galaxy. Sure, it's the main plot; but this movie also has a lot of (dry) humor. It's pretty obvious at some parts, but there is also a somewhat invisible 'layer' in this movie.What I mean is that you can make several similarities with propaganda used to recruit soldiers for wars in the past. This movie ridicules that aspect, and it makes the movie quite funny. But it also acts as a warning on how easy we can be fooled. How easy we follow something without knowing exactly what we can expect in the long run.Starship Troopers entertained (and disgusted) me in a good way. The effects are well done and the acting is okay enough. Nothing to write home about though.A solid sci-fi action ride. Watch it if you are bored and you'll get a kick out of this film. I give this 7 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing style and wit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had incredible style and sophisticated wit. I've never seen anything like it. Soft porn stars fighting giant bugs in co-ed battle teams, with a background of very smart fascist satire. Oh, and Denise Richards being a most delicious space babe.I'm a big fan of the book, and I thought the movie more or less stayed faithful to the book's principles. Fascism is shown, but so is the"service means citizenship" belief system. In the book, Heinlein asks interesting questions about the nature of the relationship between the individual and the state, and the obligations of each to the other. "Starship Troopers" society in the book is a democracy, but only people who have endured the brutal hardships of military service are allowed to vote -- others are granted rights but have no say in government. The movie sort of addresses these issues in oblique references to "service guarantees citizenship," but most casual moviegoers probably didn't get it. Also, the movie puts a biting satire on the most fascist elements of the society -- showing the kids "doing their part" by stomping insects and the mother hysterically clapping and urging them along. Although the satire wasn't in the book, I liked it. It showed how totalitarian societies whip up the populace to believe anything, and totally go off the deep end. It happened in 1930s Germany, and it can happen today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Battle Cry!", in space.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's all about what you want. If you have fond memories of pondering the depths of Robert A. Heinlein's book, you're probably going to hate this movie. It keeps a few details and a VERY general plot line (more of a story concept, really) from the novel. The rest bears much more resemblance to Leon Uris' "Battle Cry!", a gung-ho, patriotically themed WWII story about a squad of U.S. Marines in the pacific theater of the war.Whatever satire existed in the original novel (frankly, I found it little deeper than the movie), it exists here in a funny but ham-fisted way. If you can laugh at humor that the director smacks you upside the head with... so be it. I've found the manner in which this "satire" is presented as entertaining as the satire itself.In addition to the Battle Cry elements, there is a "teen movie" element, with your sappy romances and petty jealousies... which I tolerate for the sake of viewing Denise Richards in her heyday, young and hot, unblemished by the hand of Charlie Sheen...But, I digress.It's a perfectly viable movie for some pretty mindless action. Verhoeven is not a "realistic combat" kind of director. Another reviewer describes the soldiers as having the "Tactical acumen of sheep armed with assault rifles", which is not only pithy but very apt. Napoleonic tactics, really; you're standard massed infantry charge with a dose of light artillery and some naval bombardment. Very un-Napoleonic, however, is the lack of cavalry or anything like it. Despite this being an "advanced" future with space travel, etc., no armored support is used. There are no aircraft, rotary-winged or otherwise, providing close ground support. There is a single appearance of aircraft that bomb a herd of these "bugs" with something like napalm... and then leave. In the novel (the only aspect of the novel I really approve of), Heinlein describes each soldier as a self-contained, self-mobile unit, able to fight with a modicum of effectiveness even singly or in small numbers.And don't be fooled by the rating, Denise Richards remains clothed. Dina Meyers has a brief scene of nudity. I advise against watching this movie on television to to VERY heavy editing. Really, what's the point? On DVD, though, it's a fun little gore-fest action-flick with some decent eye-candy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie contains everything a good sci-fi must contain: futuristic places, weapons, spaceships, love, orbital invasion, black humor, city bombarding, epic battles (goodguys dying!), heroism, nuclear weapons, idyllic society, good music.The opening scenes of the movie will make you sure that the world has changed, and democracy is no more on it's original way and nobody cares about blood on TV anymore. The history was probably changed after the second world war, we know this because "Hirosima was destroyed". Only those can vote who were soldiers of the federation. (And there is logic behind this.) There is only one nation: humanity, this provides the multinational feeling in the movie. The story presents a bit idyllic picture of the future: there is order. The only thing can be strange: the uniforms of the military. They actually look like the Wold War 2 German officers. But you can get used to it.The characters are everyday, the main character is not the best guy on Earth. Finally you can forget about the American cities: the first half hour takes place in Buenos Aires. Rico is "only" the team leader of the local football team, bu the's bad in maths, no special psychic abilities. He makes mistakes. So not like the average StarTrek character. At the 3rd minute the viewer can't tell that Rico will survive the movie.There are of course logical mistakes in the movie. Why the Roger Young didn't discovered the meteorite earlier? Where are the tanks? etc. etc. But the movie compensate us with very intense battles, and CGIs that look like real bugs.This is a must see movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching James Cameron's film 'Aliens' in 1986 (which I believe was loosely based on the Starship troopers novel) I have to admit I wasn't really all that impressed with 'Robocop' in 1987.At the time I thought the best parts of Robocop where the ED209 boardroom scene and the in-between TV Commercial shorts which where quite funny.I have to give credit to Robocop though because I really like the way Paul pushed this idea to the limit and incorporated it into Starship Troopers with the satirical Federation broadcasts.He has an amazing talent for visualizing classic Sci-Fi and I think he did a fine job on Total Recall based on Philip K Dick's short story 'We Can Remember It for You Wholesale'. I think Verhoeven is a fantastic director who is not afraid to poke a bit of fun at Heinlein's fictional idealistic future and us also at the same time in our own crazy world.Don't get me wrong I love Heinlein's novels and hope some day that another Director might try and visualise the Mobile Infantry closer to the MI in the novel.I would hope that such a director might adopt some of this film's brilliant concepts such as the Arachnids organic weaponry.I think Heinlein would have been just a little bit impressed with the CGI in this fine film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to compare 'Starship Troopers' on an another film your best choice would be 'Robocop', because it is very similar in style to it. And it was also made by Paul Verhoven. But the difference here is, that ST forgets that it is a satire from time to time.There are some pretty good satirical elements in the film, like the propaganda war commercials and the full citizenship, that can be acquired only via military service, but when the action kicks in those pointers just seem to fade away into the background and the screen is filled with spectacular and bloody action. Not that it's a bad thing.The beginning of the movie is almost like a parody of a teen movies or TV-series but when the main protagonist enlist in the army the teen manners are rapidly removed from them. With the exception of Denise Richards who just is pretty but has no deeper character. Well actually none of the characters do, they all are pretty stereotypical in any way imaginable.But still as it is, 'Starship Troopes' is very good action film, if you just don't start searching any deeper message from it, as at least I feel it does lack a bit in the satire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why no tanks?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched this film, the first thing that came to mind was "why don't they have tanks?" It seems like you could reduce casualties with a few armored vehicles to help out those thousands of grunts with rifles.But that's just me over-thinking this. Starship Troopers is one of the better sci-fi films out there, and I can't say I didn't enjoy it. The main draw for me was the believability of the world created by this film. I'm not saying that I'm expecting the future to be like this, only that I could see this world existing and didn't spend the whole time snorting and saying "Yea right".The characters and acting on the whole remains one of this film's strong points.Casper Van Dien came across as a little wooden at times, but the rest of the cast came off well, especially Dina Meyer as the spurned and long-suffering Dizzy Flores. The characters came across as very real for this world, including my favorite the grizzled old Centurion-like Lt. Jean Rasczak (played by Michael Ironside).So on whole a pretty good sci-fi action movie. Characters good, action scenes exciting and gratifying (especially when you're able to pick out a soldier or minor character and predict their grisly demise). See it if you like that kind of thing.Still, a few tanks or armored cars wouldn't go amiss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's the big spoiler, I guess. The film's barely based on the book.I saw this film way back; it looked like Aliens, one of my favourite films. I'd never even heard of the book - and I'm well read. Believe it or not. As an action film it's pretty good, and watchable. I picked the book up a few years later by mistake, assuming it was a 'book of the film' thing. Very mistaken.Of course you'd expect that, the book is 50 years old. But it has many values ahead of its time, if coloured by their era; for example Heinlein ranks all humans equally, but never mentions race explicitly. He decides that women are better at maths, piloting and so on, whereas the film takes a more realistic 'all equal in all roles' attitude. I still haven't decided upon the political bias of the novel. It's not particularly right wing, as has been claimed; rather the opposite in some ways. The film, however, is distinctly satirical and anti... well, I'd say anti politics in general. Pro people, perhaps?This is very watchable. As an action film, it works. As a societal film, it works. Satire, works. Comedy, works. Taken as all the above it works well. Anyone who's left might find it interesting to compare with the novel. I'm not sure who composed the soundtrack, but it's infinitely Bruckheimer-inspired.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has essentially nothing to do with the Sci-Fi classic by Robert Heinlein .In the book the 'Bugs' are intelligent and have spacecraft and weapons of their own .In the book, the Bugs take prisoners(which explains why they just don't nuke these bug infested planets)In this film the Power Suits are out, to hard to realize, even with the enormous budget of this film ~ 90 million dollars .No talking smart dogs, the book's K-9 Corp !In the novel, Dina Meyer's character Dizzy Flores, is a man who gets killed early the book .The book's main character, Jonny Rico, is revealed to be Philipino, in the movie, he is a white boy ~Johny Rico's father is not killed in the novel, he survives to join the military himself .Also, the film vaguely alludes to the cause of this war- - in the book, the author is indirect- but it boils down to a battle for cosmic real estate, 'living space' . .Finally, the movie has no mention of the other alien race, the 'Skinnies' - - living them out kind of make this movie a little like ALIENS = a sterile universe . . . .Very little of the philosophical discourse of the book is in this movie, which is 'the cause' for the novel - a tome that has much to say about American society that is strikingly prophetic(the novel was penned in 1959) about our country at the end of the 20th century .Robert Heinlein was indeed a visionary ! (story has it he invented the Water Bed)I saw this movie partly because I like Dina Meyer . Denise Richards is better remembered in this movie, but I think Dina is obviously a much better actress .Her death scene is the only deep emotional scene in this whole movie with its' mostly cardboard characters .Dina Meyer should have gotten some kind of award for that scene alone . . . .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good yarn in spite of the insertion of political commentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Confession: I read Robert A. Heinlein's book "Starship Troopers" decades ago, so my memory of it may be a little bit fuzzy. At the time of its publication, RAH was writing good sci-fi adventure yarns for boys. But even in those, he slipped in some disguised political commentary. I don't recall any overtones of fascism in the book. What I got from it at the time was that a society under attack, at war, could not afford to be a wuss society, something the U.S. needs to internalize at this particular moment. I think that Paul Verhoeven is the one who has inserted this element into the story, most obviously the Nazi-looking greatcoat uniforms on the intelligence officers. As for the film, The CGI bugs were seamlessly inserted and looked quite real, at least on a TV size screen. It's gotta be hard to act when half of the stuff isn't really there. The best acting performance was Dina Meyer, with honorable mention to Jake Busey. If you ignore the political overtones and just enjoy the movie, it is a darn good adventure sci-fi film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A decent movie; Good actors, good plot, a little spacey at times, and a good director. Yet if you were to watch this movie closely you would begin to think "What went wrong?"If you thought of it as a cheesy rip-off from the classic novel then you're in the right, a symbol of political oppression displayed in the confines of the film... it's a slight possibility, or an outrage in military tactics and over all attack strategy you've hit the jack pot!No offense meant to Verhoeven but.. why? The full scale invasion made by a fleet of pilots who can just out turn an asteroid going at lets say 50,000 Kilometers per minute, but get slaughtered in orbit when they could have easily dodged plasma going no more that 200 Kilometers and hour.And nothing but infantry on the ground in an hostile environment, and to make my point on Tango Urila they had fighter/bombers eradicate the bugs with napalm, yet there were five times that many fighter/bombers above Klendathu in the first conflict, where was the victory? The brain bug? A grunt getting their brains sucked out does not account for the tactical plans of fifteen generals who are more than likely highly experienced and are omniscient about the state of the fight.Even if you ruled out the fighters, this is the future! Where are the tanks, mobile suits, light squad vehicles; If the film featured these Klendathu would have been a cakewalk, maybe a few hundred casualties mind you, but all the same a scene of total obliteration thousands of bugs splattered and another planet secure.Although short in the basic actions and conduct of real warfare, a good film or any film for that matter will have it's short comings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excuse for a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some years ago Edward Neumeier developed a script about a war between Earth and a planet of highly intelligent spiders. The relative strength of the script is unknown by me, but I do know he could not sell the script. Somehow, he became attached to a movie based upon Robert Heinlein's controversial novel, "Starship Troopers." When Heinlein wrote the book, he had been writing novels for a younger readership that were called, "Juveniles." His editor was horrified at some of the sentiments of the book and refused to publish it. Heinlein literally took the book to a publisher across the street who was delighted to get a work from a best selling author. They published the book and Science Fiction's highest honor - the Hugo award for best novel.The political sentiments expressed in the novel have been called Fascist, among other things. Technically, Fascism is an economic system and not a political one. Nevertheless, the objectionable part of the book was, for the most part, background material and not the purpose of the book. There was also hand to hand battle with the "Bugs." In the book, the Mobile Infantry, the military group portrayed, did battle in personal armor, not in platoon sized transports.Verhoeven's vision was Hollywood at it's worst. Verhoeven decided to view the movie through the lens of the invasion of his boyhood home, Holland, by Nazi Germany. In doing so, he robbed the book of its heart and soul. The heart of the book was the growth of Jonny Rico, and the relationships built among him and the other members of the Mobile Infantry, and it is almost never dealt with.In the run up to the movie, there were several clips that spoke about Heinlein's wish that he had actually included women in the Mobile Infantry, but I am convinced that he would have grieved over the emasculation of his story. A writer of his caliber, one of the three grand masters of Science Fiction, deserves better.When I watched this the first time, I could not help be reflect on the usage of Verhoeven as direction. They used a director whose vision of life was was diametrically opposed to that the of the original writer. Verhoeven owed him more. I wish he had read the novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totalitarianism is very good looking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read lots of comments already made there doesn't seem much to add though I seem to unique in loving both the book and the Film. I clearly believe this is meant as a satire and am as amazed as many other posters that some people simply didn't notice that the humans were the bad guys.Heinlen's original novel postulated a fulfilled society with low crime, high employment, and global harmony. The price was fascist government, capital and corporal punishment for offenders and you don't get to vote. UNLESS you indenture with the government for two years to suffer and maybe die in the process. I think many people round the world in hellholes like Somalia, North Korea, Iraq etc would go for it given the choice.The famous "Shower Scene" is mainly remembered for Men and Women being naked together- shock horror!! But what is shocking is the characters revealing that without military service you can't i) vote ii) join the media iii) breed!! Now that sounds like a good way to control the population as only ex-military types get to have children/choose the government/publish their thoughts.Things I loved - bug stamping propaganda- some of the music - Cheesy smiles to the camera after blowing up BIG insects-"Make it 20 minutes" Not so good- some of the acting- some departures from the Novel e.g. the accountability of top officers. If you cock up the operation and get 100,000s of soldiers killed you don't get to retire quietly.Final point I don't think this satire is squarely aimed at the U.S. but mankind's attraction to State power/militarism. It just so happens that right now the US is the only Superpower in the world and just happens the most powerful and expensively equipped armed forces in history so the glove just appears to fit most comfortably there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Splatter-fest for bug haters...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 1/29/2006, 4 out of 10(Dir-Paul Verhoeven): Splatter-fest for bug haters and those who like movies about killing bugs. But seriously, it was hard for me to get too serious about this unique sci-fi story about saving the human race from bugdum. I think that's why the Director, Paul verhoeven, played it kind of tongue-in-cheek at the beginning, but it eventually turned into an action gore-fest with the bugs killing, sucking brains, chopping limbs off, etc... The story began and ended being played out like a military recruiting commercial, where in this world, you only got considered a citizen with voting rights if you joined up. This was a world that had evolved to the point where it understood that violence and being the aggressor kept the species alive and that humans were not a whole lot different than bugs in this way. Supposedly, the only reason the bugs were fighting us was because we invaded their territory (doesn't this sound familiar, huh??). So, we enter a world that's always fighting but in this movie it just happens to be bugs. We follow the three main characters thru their military training, their battles etc... They are played by Casper Van Dien, the reluctant infantry man who just entered initially because a girl wanted him to. That girl, played by Denise Richards, becomes a top-notch flyer and Neil Patrick Harris is the nerdy one who enters intelligence to figure out how to fight the bugs. Despite the three of them going in different directions career-wise, they vow to stay friends forever. What a nice little setup for what lies ahead for them... battles against foes that they way under-estimate. These bugs are not only deadly fighters, but smart(which the humans didn't account for). The movie had an appealing approach, but it didn't seem to know whether to have humor or not. The humor came out pretty lame and the action became the main part of the movie, but once you've seen one human dismembered you really have seen it all. Despite the movie have an interesting and unique approach, in the end, the movie as a whole was not as appealing as it's parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some might say this film is good for this reason and that reason, but the truth is that this is not a very exciting film. It is too violent, over the top, and as a result very boring. If you want war films, check out something like Saving Private Ryan - but do not waste your money on this rubbish. The graphics are just sick (who thought these ideas up?! UGH!) and although some props and effects may be cool, and the plot may be quite interesting, overall this film is just disgusting and somewhat stupid. My brother got it two times: first time I felt disgusted and bored, the second time I told him where he could put it. Luckily he didn't rent this, he only borrowed it from the library ;) If anyone disagrees, that's up to you and is perfectly natural, and you are entitled to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good entertainment, but stuff to think about aswell.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with many people who saw this movie, the first time I watched it I only grasped the upper surface of this movie: A cool Sci-Fi action movie about war against "The Bugs": cool special effects, very nasty aliens and a lot of good action. The cast consists of people who were at the time fairly unknown, but nevertheless do a good job and are entertaining to watch. The fairly unknown, but very goodlooking cast, together with the futuristic scenario of the story created a kind of "glossy" feel to the film, that boosts the Sci-Fi value at least in my experience. Thus ends my summary of a highly entertaining Sci-Fi action movie... ...but only later, when I watched the movie again at least once, I started noticing more and more things that made the movie even more interesting. Because underneath he simple, but entertaining film there's a layer of ethical discussion and reflection. I also know now that the film was based on a book with a fairly strong political undertone. Although I am not the only one who at first didn't notice this in the film too clearly, I now like the film only even more for it.**Possible Spoilers Ahead**Society as it is in this film raises ethical questions, besides the fact that ethical discussion is literally present in the story at some points. For instance, to a lot of us the army in this movie will look strangely familiar because of it's methods and philosophy, and (on a more accessible level) by the way the officials of their intelligence department dress. :-&gt;Above all, this is an entertaining movie just as it was when I first watched it. But I certainly hope that at least some people who are gonna watch the film will also notice that it actually presents a well made and almost funny caricature of the things it may seem to be about when you first watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty good film which goes for effects above all else!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Starship Troopers" is one of those films that follows in the wake of "Star Wars" and "Independence Day" as well as films of that ilk which emphasise special effects and action above the story, plot and acting. While the cast is pretty good, mostly made of teens and B-Movie stars, the main emphasis is on the battle sequences themselves. The focus of the plot is a war against a race of big ugly bugs, granted other stuff happens but it isn't entirely important since we're all here to see stuff being blown apart, the special effects are definitely the central "character" of the film, all varieties of the bugs are excellently done and the myriad of ships and asteroids are done well. Basically this is the kind of movie you watch when you don't want a complicated plotline to follow.9/10 for amazing action and special effects sequences!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dream to some, a nightmare to others **WARNING: SPOILERS**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can certainly see why so many people disliked this movie, but their reasons for trashing it are precisely the reasons I love it. From one of my posts on the message board: **WARNING: SPOILERS**In my opinion, the entire movie is a long dramatic propaganda (dramaganda? Propagrama?) broadcast, interrupted occasionally by other "news". Not only are we shown the tough but admirable road Johnny travels (as with all propaganda films) to great success, but we see the actors in the movie-within-the-movie giving factoids about the fight (Carl on shooting bugs in the right spot) and, after their story is told, now LEADING the fight. What I think are a couple of other clues:- Beautiful people everywhere - the key to making popular TV/movies. In casting for propaganda films there is also a long history of hiring babes who cannot act.- Constantly repeating key lines ("...Wanna live forever?" "...I'll shoot you myself!"), the key to effective advertising. Creating pre-packaged catchphrases for the new cannon-fodder while at the same time desensitizing them to the fact that they're likely to die.- Nobody ever questioning the way society works or that the bugs are really to blame. The single dissenting voice is portrayed as a shrill talking-head on TV who is obviously wrong.Am I just trying to ignore the film's shortcomings by imagining them as strengths? Perhaps, but the beauty of art is that we all get to interpret it the way we want - and I want to believe that Verhoeven is a genius! Unlike some, I can see how some would have a drastically different interpretation of this movie. But if nothing else it's got the best space special effect I've seen yet!Oh, and don't believe the nonsense people spew about the book being much better - the book was pulp trash that RAH knocked off quick to make a buck (a fact he himself acknowledged).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A silly movie surrounded by top-notch effects and awesome battle sequences.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** out of ****Starship Troopers could honestly use a few more likeable characters and a more convincing lead, but otherwise, this is as thrilling as movies come, a lightning-paced, hilarious rollercoaster ride of bullets, explosions, gore, raucous humor, and gratuitous nudity. So yes, this is my kind of film, and I relished every minute of it.Troopers is set sometime in the unnamed future, where South American society is apparently dominated by white, blandly attractive teens with Spanish last names, but look and sound distinctly American. The whole things plays like a big satire on fasicism, when these teens graduate from high school most of them sign up as citizens (basically a more innocent term for someone in the infantry or fleet). Unlucky for them, signing up is almost a guaranteed death warrant, now that the humans have declared war on the Klendathu aliens from a distant star system, giant insectoid creatures that apparently feast on human flesh (once the soldiers get there, that is). Thus, the movie chronicles the adventures of one such platoon, led by Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien), who's assisted by pals Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer) and Ace Levy (Jake Busey). Massive chaos ensues.A lot of people I know see this as a stupid movie. An equally large amount of other people I know see this as a brilliant satire. Both can nitpick or examine whatever stupidities or issues they want, I merely see this as a remarkable thrill ride. On a pure popcorn level, Starship Troopers is easily one of the best sci-fi action films of the 90's (perhaps behind only Jurassic Park and Star Trek: First Contact), so deft as it is at blending action and comedy.Starship Troopers is a very funny movie, for all the right reasons, too. The first hour is relatively sparse in action (actually, virtually none at all unless you count that over-the-top football game), but it's more than made up for by the first-rate humor. Definitely the standout segment must be the training camp scenes, which manages to outdo Full Metal Jacket when it comes to sheer brutality and certainly surpasses it in dark, morbid humor. The movie has a pervading silliness that admittedly weighs it down a bit (especially during repeat viewings), but if this material had been played straight, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed the film half as much.The first hour nicely plays the introduction of our lead characters, some of whom make an impression and a lot of whom don't. Casper Van Dien, the vapid, lantern-jawed actor that he is, is not a good actor, and while I could have gone with a more convincing lead, at least he does well during the action sequences. Denise Richards is equally vapid as one-half of his love interest. Faring far better is Dina Meyer, whose kick-ass turn as Dizzy is a lot of fun. Too bad she exits the film too early. The adult cast is fun, too, especially Clancy Brown as the sadistic, yet caring Drill Sergeant Zim.But Starship Troopers ultimately succeeds because of its action, and what magnificent action it is. The second hour is akin to strapping yourself into a rollercoaster. We're treated to harrowing, Zulu-style battle sequences in which our heroes are surrounded at all sides from ferocious, unstoppable enemies. The action is blistering, bloody, and appropriately over-the-top. It's from Paul Verhoeven, would you expect any different?Starship Troopers succeeds because it's great fun, boosted by awesome special effects and a great score from Basil Poledouris. The film concludes on an open-ended note, obviously a ploy for a possible franchise. It'll probably never happen, which is just as well, since there are only so many ways you can show human beings killing giant bugs and vice versa.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the few times a movie is better than the book it's based off of. Maybe it's just cuz I saw the movie before I read the book.I first saw the movie in 1999, on HBO or some other channel. I loved it, partly because of the cool Aliens, and partly because of the gore (I was 14 at the time). Now when I watch it again, the gore doesn't impress me as much (de-sensitized generation X-ers :) ) but now I watch it for the action and story, which are pretty good.The movie is pretty much a typical Sci Fi Alien-Blast-Em-Up. There's also a love triangle romance involved, but it's not too 'intenseive'. The jist of the story is that a group of Aliens blows up a big chunk of Earth, and we send troops to kill them all etc.The CGI aliens look pretty good by 97's standards, and still fairly good today. Unfortunatly we don't see too many different types of them.The acting is pretty good all around, though not spectacular. But most of the actors/actresses are 'unknowns' so they did pretty well for their first feature length movie.The plot is good but slightly flawed; there's not much backstory behind the Aliens or the UED. Also, I could have done without the Romance.WARNING: This movie is very gory, especially for younger viewers. There is also some nudity.That's basically all there is to say; this is a typical 'popcorn' movie that you watch with your buds to see the aliens get blown away. If you don't analyze it too much, you'll have a good time.OVERALL: 8.5/10James "Black Wolf" Johnston</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the posters and reviews for this film I thought I'd hate it. In fact, if it hadn't had Verhoeven's name on it, I'd never have watched it. As it is, having seen it three times or so on tv, I can safely say that it's easily my favourite among those of his films that I've seen (Robocop, Total Recall, Showgirls, most of Basic Instinct -- all on tv) and one of the few films made in the last fifteen years that I'd be happy to watch again and again.It's been described as an antiwar film and as a satire on fascism. It seems to me that it's something much more specific: an examination of how wartime propaganda works, in the shape of a successful attempt to create a working piece of propaganda. It is propaganda, moreover, that advertises its deceptiveness but still gets us to watch.Why, first of all, are people from Buenos Aires, with surnames like Rico, Flores and Ibanez being played by square-jawed, "perfect" Aryan types? Because all the Nazis who fled to South America after WWII have overrun the population? Or because we're being shown a highly idealized picture, calculated to make the protagonists' appeal as wide as possible. Pretty obviously the latter, I'd say. The obvious discrepancy between the actors and the characters is just one of many indications in the film that what we are watching is not trustworthy.The way the enemy is presented is typical of propaganda, too. The bugs are stupid and vicious and attack out of sheer malignity. They have no intelligence and their behaviour is irrational. Then it becomes impossible any longer to hide the fact that the bugs are capable of laying effective traps, so the line changes: now most of them are stupid and vicious, but there are a few "brain" bugs, who are directing them and who are particularly dangerous.Carl assures everybody that a captured "brain" bug feels fear. How does he know? Through telepathy, no less. In fact, everything we "know" about the enemy is filtered through Carl and people like him. Did the bugs really destroy Buenos Aires? How can we be sure?However, in spite of all the warnings that we should doubt what we see, we can hardly avoid getting involved in the stories of the protagonists. Those stories are basic, almost archetypal and are calculated to engage our sympathy even while we know we're being manipulated. Propaganda needs to work even when it's obvious that it's propaganda.Denise Richards may not be much of an actor (although she was perfectly adequate in Wild Things) but she's well cast here, as the bland, happy, smiling math genius and hotshot starship pilot. She's just about perfect, and that's exactly what the part requires.</fullReview>

What could be the ultimate extension than portraying them as insects?The other irony I see is that winners write history, and more accurately can "re-write" history. I sense a lot of anger at those who felt the movie betrayed it's "original" history (i.e. the novel it was based on). I can understand the disappointment of those who may have loved the novel to have seen it distorted, but hey, the first casualty of war it the truth, they say.The movie did it's job without complaint; like a good soldier doing it's duty.

		<shortDescription>verhoeven's finest moment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is a superior movie, and it might be the most subtly subversive anti-war movie ever produced. Its worldwide box-office take was little more than what it cost to make the film. Many moviegoers and critics disliked the film, claiming that it was too fascistic, too unrealistic, too much like U.S. propaganda, too far from the novel it was based on, etc. The point that many missed would have been clear had they examined in any detail what director Paul Verhoeven achieved: an intelligent, visually exciting extravaganza consistent in theme and purpose with the best science-fiction concepts.The meticulous care that went into the making of Starship Troopers is evident throughout the film. The curious viewer can watch multiple times and glean new details at each iteration, to a far greater extent than is possible with similar sprawling sci-fi or fantasy movies. Several dynamic crowd scenes were not so much staged as they were choreographed, made all the more impressive where live action blends with CGI animation and articulated props. In all fairness, the movie's copious amounts of spurting organic fluids are not for the squeamish viewer. Overall, however, Starship Troopers set standards for audiovisual realism in fantastic subject matter that have yet to be matched by any movie, including the Star Wars cycle.The plot is just as meticulously outlined. The story of how a war unfolds is carefully laid out using standard narrative flow, flashback, and (most importantly) segues to news-program-type `videobytes' supposedly accessed by an interested (or not) viewer during the war itself. The news programming tells the movie's real story. The clear picture of the nature of the war, the government that wages it, and the filmmakers' intent emerges as on-camera citizens evoke a society that sometimes questions, more often embraces aggression, all with superficial wholesomeness. These scenes amount to the reality television of a possible future. The speculative concept is half of what makes the film outstanding science fiction.The other half, Starship Troopers' didactic tone, also blooms in the movie. Amidst all the flashy spectacle, a cautionary message emerges: humanity in general, and the USA in particular, might take heed of its aggressive ways before expanding outward with self-absorbed, self-justified purpose. The movie's training-film-style imagery and dialogue effectively depict clean-cut, gung-ho youth used by a government to fulfill an agenda of insidious aggression disguised as defense. The final line, `They'll keep fighting! And they'll win!' imparts an ominous chill that might be lost on some viewers. Regardless of individual tastes and perspectives, the message is there for those who choose to reflect upon it. Starship Troopers is great science fiction, outstanding moviemaking, and a wonderful mixture of visceral fun and thematic weight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>absolutely ausome sci-fi flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie. I loved it when I saw it in theaters, and I love it when I watch it at home. Some people said this movie was gross and gruesome. It is not gruesome if it is not possible. An example would be a giant bug cutting someone in half. It is not possible so it is not gross and it is rather funny. Dont get me wrong Im not one of those guys who watches Faces of Death everyday. But say a man hacks up a guy with an axe, thats possible so its gross. There are the occasional ones you cant help to laugh at, no matter how gross they are like Travolta shooting Marvin in Pulp Fiction and Arnold shoving the pipe through the Docs eye in Total Recall (another Verhoeven masterpiece). Plus the special effects are amazing and the score is good too. So if you like sci-fi violence this is the movie for you. It is not the best sci-fi movie, nor is it Verhoevens best, but if you have not seen it, rent it. If you have seen it, buy the special edition 2-disc DVD. Too bad MGM is too cheap to make a special edition for Robocop</fullReview>

Thus `Starship Troopers' is great art; for those who are looking for sci-fi thrills, it answers; for those who want to ogle The Beautiful Ones, it answers; for those critical of militarism, it answers; for those wary of government, it answers: for those who see how society brings on its own ills, it answers; for those who decry sexism and seek gender and racial equality, it answers; for those who despair of callow youth and cynical age, it answers; for those who like meat to their movies it answers; and for those that like none, it answers.The depth and intelligence of this film are inexhaustible; it is unique, yet familiar; comforting, yet disquieting; and amusing, yet horrifying.

		<shortDescription>Satire Troopers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, anyone who really thinks that this movie was some kind of "rah rah go America!" thing, is dead off. Verhoeven has made quite a few movies that have at their heart what seem to be "American" themes, but this is because he (who is Dutch, by the way) is making movies for an American audience. (Also, there was some complete git on here who thinks that Full Metal Jacket, one of the most scathing anti-war films ever, was also "rah rah go America" a la Plattoon...I shouldnt even have to comment on the vacuous nature of that individual's brain).Anyhow, the movie is a well-done satire on totalitarianism (again, not specifically from the American idiom, but certainly from a Western one) that features lots of exploding bugs (done in decent CG most of the time) and people being sliced and diced in typical Verhoeven style. And if anyone thinks that Verhoeven didn't know what he was doing when he cast Doogie Howser as a leader in the rather SS-esque scientific corps is really missing the point here (and to the individual who said that this movie has nothing to do with the Nazis because they don't speak with German accents: I suppose Animal Farm has nothing to do with the communists because they don't all speak in a Russian dialect?).Watch this movie with a critical mind and do not take it at face value. And enjoy yourself for goodness sake.</fullReview>

Lieutenant Rico,the model soldier comparabale to Eric Banas role in Black Hawk Down was also very well made.He made it from a simple recrut to the Lieutenant.The last scene seems very crucial to me though - the drill instructor just had captured the brain bug and Rico told him:"Go on recrut"."They`ll be keep fighting and they`ll win" finishes the advertisement for the army. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>In general this is a satire of 1950's Sci-Fi movie with a huge budget, bad acting, over the top effects and action, and poorly put together story. However there is one thing that saves this movie from being a total bust: The Co-Ed Shower Scene. Rule. When the movie was over; I could tell that was why they made the movie. Sure some of the other stuff is interesting; but nothing beats the showers.I love how they just invade the planet and it has the exact same atmosphere as Earth. They'll probably get back to Earth and never bother isolating anyone because, damn it; there are no diseases on that other planet. Why didn't they just release some biological weapon on the planet (like a huge tank of Raid) and leave. Wouldn't that had been easier than having legions of troops die there.Well, in general; they needed more nude scenes and more comedy. I was laughing with and at this movie; but when I wasn't I was rather bored. It lacks punch and it seems to just drag on towards the end.When we look back at the 90's we can feel happy that with films like ID4, Demolition Man and Starship Troopers are nothing more than 50's films with better effects and bigger budgets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thankfully, this film has nothing to do with the eighties pop song of the same name, so don't let that put you off.Casper van dien plays as Johnny Rico. He's in his last year at high school, and it's time for him to choose his future. He can't do maths, he isn't a psychic (apparently a lot of people are in the future) but he is very athletic. He eventually decides therefore to join the army. Unfortanately, he does so during an intergalactic war with a bunch of ferocious insect style aliens known as arachids.The film has many memorable scenes. It has the worst boot camp since full metal jacket ( with a drill seargent to who is even worse than Lee Ermery's), a D-Day style assualt on the planet Klendathu, a lot of hi-octane gory battles with the arachnids, and a steamy unnesescary shower scene (who's complaining?).Watch this film, but only do so if you can stomach some gruesome death scenes. People are sliced in two, impaled, be-headed, and one man has his brains sucked out in one of the goriest scenes i've ever seen. Be warned.Overall, i'd give this film 41/2 stars out of five. Go rent it now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers must surely rank as one of my favourite cinema experiences. There I was enduring what at first seemed to be a futuristic version of Beverly Hills 90210 only for some guy to get his head blown off in a truly shocking moment which was only a glimpse of the carnage to come. This film cranks the violence gauge up to maximum and just gets better to the point where I wanted to get up and applaud.Anyone who believes this film to be nothing more than a piece of shallow, gore-heavy sci-fi just doesn't get Verhoeven's and writer Ed Neumier's sense of humour and I would advise them to look closer. Just as Robocop was full of sub-text so is this adaptation of Robert A. Heinlein's novel.It is a quite blatant comment on how war can create a facist society just as Robocop was a comment on 80's corporate idealism (with religious alegories thrown in too).The acting may not be the greatest ever but remember this Verhoeven so tounges are placed firmly in cheeks! A special mention must also go to the SFX which five years on are still pretty much faultless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A video game movie with Verhoeven's flair added in,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is like a video game, most likely a computer game ala Myth or Starcraft. Although it drags at times and the acting is mediocre, it's still worth seeing once. At least it doesn't have the lame PG-13 dialogue, this one is R-Rated. Add in the fact that the great Paul Verhoeven is at the helm, and you know there will be something memorable here.ST is about a futurisitc world where the beautiful people have been drafted to fight nasty aliens (these guys are some of the nastiest ever created). This film is done in a tounge-in-cheek style, it's not to be taken seriously. We follow a number of attractive army cadets through their training and actual fighting. Every cliche is in the movie as well. Verhoeven also brings in his beliefs that men and women don't need seperate rooms a few times.The young cast do a decent job of not getting in the way of the action, the film's dialogue is reminiscent of any film with Bruce Campbell, and although it's long and has some tedious moments, there are also some scenes of sheer excitement and terror. Not bad, but it would have benefitted from 15 minutes less and the fact that Doogie (High Forehead) Howser is in it.</fullReview>

I earned about $2000 playing one of the officials in the 'football' game, which we spent a full 6 days shooting (and it's almost impossible to see me in the final cut). I most remember Casper Van Dien being a really nice guy worried that he wasn't athletic enough to keep up with the others in the football sequence and I don't blame him -- some of the players were former college players and one was an olympic level track star. The other thing that sticks in my mind was the money spent -- the production people on the set actually bragged about how much was being spent; at one point when we were once again going into 'double overtime' on the salary scale, I calculated it was costing at least on dollar a second just for the people on the set.</fullReview>

Verhoeven was clearly working his way up to this movie over the years. Not only is it one of the best sci-fi movie ever made, standing alongside the likes of EMPIRE, 2001 and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, it is easily one of the 100 best movies ever made.

This might also be the misguided attempt of some kind of a fascist dutch guy who misses the good old days of the 1940s.

		<fullReview>On the surface, this film seems like another pointless Hollywood action flick. The actors are plastic and shiny, the explosions are big and shiny, the special effects are bright and shiny. Everything and everyone is perfect looking. However, a few minutes into the film, I realized that all the glitz was there for a reason. After I realized that, other layers of meaning became apparent. Starship Troopers turns out to be surprisingly deep and satirical film which brings up several interesting philosophical questions. Why do states go to war? What form of society is more productive, a democracy or a totalitarian state?. The hero's in the film dress like Nazis and watch US style war propaganda on television. Is war propaganda basically brain washing? Men and Women are equal in this militaristic utopian society... however freedom of thought has been subverted. They are taught by the state in school that Might = right. Strength = Morality. Religion, Ethics, Pacification = Weakness which is therefore immoral behavior. The film paints a bittersweet image of the future which forces us to analyze our own past and look at it in a different light. Our are schools basically the brainwashing branch of our Capitalistic society. Are we taught lopsided history lessons like the students in the film? Does a society based on aggression need to keep it's war machine churning even if the enemy doesn't want to fight, or didn't want to fight in the first place? WOW. I've seen the movie a dozen times and I am still finding new layers. Starship Troopers is probably the best picture any of its actors will ever be in for a long time. The acting was great at some parts and darn cheesy at others? which is what you expect from a film made by the same guy who made Robo-Cop. Not even the occasional overacting could ruin a great story and plot. This film will be a classic. Heck I could even see some university philosophy professor doing a lecture on it. See the film.

And like very good sc-fi concept it makes you think about the here and now and the world that you actually live in.The whole bubble gum 90210 feel of the start is deliberate. The action is terrific. The characters two-dimensional. This is very good film if you can actually get your head round the fact that it is a satire - otherwise you may feel like you've seen the truth that it's a pile of steaming dung whilst everyone else is too stupid.....unfortunately the reverse is the truth and you are the one too slow and/or blinkered to understand what you're seeing on the screen.</fullReview>

Well actually, (I wanna break this to ya gently!) what we have here is a cloaked celebration of the US war effort - pretty much in any war you care to mention. and Holy-napalm, does Verhoeven pull this off or what? You gotta LISTEN to this film, see how just about every gung-ho piece of spouted machismo is given its due moment. Hell, we got heroes coming out of the woodwork here!About as faithful to Heinlen's original novel as the Ford Edsel was to public demand, Verhoeven pours on the visuals as Van Dien marshalls his troops, including "WILD THING' herself, the deliciously constructed Ms Richards, in several attempts to repel multiple attacks of the arachnid aliens. The ONLY flick I would care to nominate where the digitising is simply awesome with the result that the screen is frequently filled with wave after wace of the marauding bugs spilling blood on a level rarely seen. This is adrenalin pumping excitement on a grand scale and understandably was an enormously popular film on its release.Do not look for the meaning of life here, any monoliths or even an Oscar winning performance. Just be happy to soak up the type of "rush" $150 million buys! As in TOTAL RECALL, Verhoeven does not short-change you here!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes bad movies have a good message, at least it got people talking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm amazed at the amount of comments this movie inspired! That said, I finally watched it years after friends recommended I take a look. I had always wondered why since I don't like violent movies and prefer to read sci-fi rather than watch it. But I agree, it has to be seen to be believed. Anyone who took it serious missed a massive, glaring and obvious point! Kind of a "what forest? all I see is a bunch of trees" situation. From the first scene its satire and symbols. And anyone who thinks it twisted Heinlein's work has obviously not read enough of his books! He begs for comment on his fascist statements and lack of explanation at times. And occasionally that was the point. Like most authors, he sometimes created a world in a masterful way, but that didn't make it a good place to live! And time changes all things, including whether something stands on its own without updating. Heinlein wrote (in nearly all his books) of a male dominated future because he lived in a male dominated past. He had no reason to believe at the time that the complete exclusion of women from ALL things wouldn't continue for a few hundred years. ****mild spoilers past here**** Now the message. I think the movie used a rather ingenious form of subliminal messaging to get its point across, a bit too subtle for some people apparently. It absolutely hammers you with the sort of mindless and gory violence of most action/sci-fi movies, cranked up to unreal proportions, and then peppers the entire thing with minute details that comment on facism, genocide, WWII newsreels and war pictures, and Nazi's! How these can be missed is beyond me, I'm 20-something and still know a Nazi-looking uniform when I see one (the scientist scene at the very end, he's in the "staff coat" and you see several Nazi officer hats in the background), and understand the fascist party-line when I hear it (serve in the military to vote etc. among other things). And the movie makers themselves have told us it was all intentional, on the DVD and in interviews about it. Doesn't make it a good movie, but that's just my opinion. I still appreciated the message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Anson Heinlein's posthumous insult.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starship troopers is pure hollywood gravedancing in its top form. Truly Starship Troopers is not one of his best works, my personal favorite is The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, but for christ's sake. The screenplay is a travesty, the dialogue is heavy handed at best, and at least R.A.H. admitted stealing the quote "c'mon you apes, you wanna live forever?" from a nameless WWI sergeant. About all the "writer" kept of R.A.H.'s book were the names, and of course referring to the troops as "cap-soldiers" when they have no capsules,and "mobile infantry" though they are on foot. Does it make sense for a desert planet to have free oxygen in the atmosphere? Does it make sense that the "cap soldiers" would be walking around in cheap plastic armour, arms bare, carrying only a British-built assault rifle covered in plastic in a terribly hostile environment? Does it make sense for the entire communications array of a space vessel in the most vulnerable part of the ship? I think not. I think they could have had a lot more fun with the special effects that they hid behind, if they had kept the mechanical mobile suits and the egglike capsules the troops were dropped in in the book.This is a terrible insult to one of America's greatest Sci-Fi authors, and i think its a crying shame. Peace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship troopers has subletly. It moves at quite a fast rate and the work gone into the effects on the giant bugs is beautiful. Although I thought the camera angles weren't that good, the action is great and you'll probably think different about bugs again. The downside though is weak acting, as I think they over-do it a bit. When it comes down to it I really enjoy watching this movie and it'll be a good one to watch when you have nothing to do.84%</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always made it a point to avoid this movie because I'm not a big fan of sci-fi - but a friend persuaded me to see it because of the supposed gore and violence - Big mistake! The action was unbelievably slow - (even for a movie from the director of Total Recall), the acting was pure crap (which should be expected considering the main characters are Casper Van Dien and Gary Busey's 'prodigy' son) - And finally, the anticipated gore. All of the blood and guts I expected to see were computer generated low budget effects. I had to stop myself from laughing when the 'alien insects' tore the soldiers into pieces. If you are looking for action/gore/sci-fi, rent the original Alien, or even Predator. Avoid this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People either love or hate this film.Some people hate it for it's unbelievable story line (mankind fights for survival against bugs) or its comic book characters.I love it as the respectful parody of every black and white war film that I have ever seen. Verheovens perspective is very clearly shaped by having grown up in Nazi occupied Holland, and by god it shows!Mankind against bugs? If that isn't denying the humanity of your opponent then what is. When Johnny Ric exorts "I come from New Buenos Aires, and I say kill them, kill them all" then you know where this film is coming from.Dont think of this film as being futuristic, think of it as being a second world war film. Duty to your species equals duty to your country, your enemy is subhuman and fit to be nuked, and the military is the top of the food chain. Failed disastrous attack on the bug home world - read it as the German failure to over-run "subhuman Russia" in 1941.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest I am not a sci-fi fan in any way what so ever. But I saw the previews for Starship Troopers and quite honestly I have to say I was drawn to the action. But after actually watching it I can proudly say its a brilliant film. Its obviously not up there with the likes of Citizen Kane or Ben Hur but its for this generations youth who most dont want to see a good story they want to be entertained.And this is what Starship Troopers does. It creates value for money. I now own the film and cant stop watching it. Its combination of sci-fi, action, adventure, war and even romance shows the screenplay was well written with everyone in mind. No matter what genre you enjoy your certainly going to find it in Starship Troopers.I dare you to watch and than to put it down again. I challenge you to find a more entertaining movie which allows you to sit back and suspend disbelief for two hours and come out of it completely satisfied. This is one such movie. Its not a movie which has one small battle than one big battle for its climax rather its covered in skirmishes with the bugs all throughout the film as it traces the lives of three recruits through boot camp than into their postings in their chosen careers.If you dont watch it your missing out on one of the most spectacular films in recent years.</fullReview>

They completely reverse the entire position of the MI on violence - turning Zim into a sadist rather than a decent philosopher who knows his job and knows why he does it - and make all of humanity into genocidal freaks. While making the MI a coed organization is probably a more accurate view of what our military will be in a few centuries, it is unnecessary and detracts from the story.

		<fullReview>-potential spoilers-From the minute you hit PLAY on your VCR, you know you've rented a cheesy film only to be compared to a 50's sci-fi movie... but that's alright. Asside from a long and banal intro (until everyone leaves the acadamy to go to war with the bugs) you will like this gore-fest but be rather baffled by the designs of the alien creatures (that seem to consist of fleets of giant lice, beatles that breathe fire, and a smart-bug that looks like a large sexual organ crawling around.) The intro is 90210 in the future and not very entertaining. It makes you look for the fast-foward button like a dog looking for more buiscut in the carpet. Some of this would be good character development if the writters would have given the actors a substantial script to support development in such a long period of time instead of letting these thin characters be explained in 10 minutes. It sucked that they killed off Dissy, who actualy had a character to work with, and at that point made Rico a moody a**hole that is hell-bent on nuking the brain-bug at the end instead of following orders and capturing the brain. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really good Sci-Fi flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rated this one 9 of 10 stars.For starters, I really liked the soundtrack to this movie. The orchestration is great, and does an excellent job of setting the mood. You see this most notably during the big dropship scene precluding the first human invasion.The premise isn't overly realistic - a "bug planet" inhabited by ornery insects has used biological plasma blasts to launch asteriods at earth, killing millions. But this is Sci-Fi, and if Star Trek can have Klingons, and Star Wars can have Jawas, then Starship Troopers can have bugs.The second reason I really like this movie is that it, along with "Aliens" are heavy influences on a favorite video game of mine, "Starcraft." I highly recommend both movies, and the game as well.The lead roles are those of Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien,) Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards,) and Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris,) along with supporting roles; Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer,) and Ace Levy (Jake Busey.) Rico, Carmen, and Carl are friends from Buenos Aires who all join up with different branches of the military. Rico enlists with the Mobile Infantry who are analagous to the US Marines - ground troopers who are the first in and the last out. Carmen works towards becoming a pilot in the Federation Fleet, while Carl who has innate psychic ability joins the "Games and Theory" division, which is Military Intelligence.The main focus is on Rico and his enrollment in the "Roughnecks," along with Ace and Dizzy (who is also from Buenos Aires.) The ensuing battles are bloody, the explosions are big, and the bug-guts are messy. The overall special effects were done wonderfully, and it lent a sense of devastating realism to the movie without making it too flashy and gory.If you like any of the other Man vs. Alien movies (Aliens, Predator, Terminator, etc...) you should give "Starship Troopers" a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it's a good film, and just that. great production and a fair acting, but a lousy script and decoration, specially buenos aires, which, i know it, has no mountains around. of course the FX are the most outstanding feature of the film, and i specially liked the infantry rifles, the best i've ever seen for a sci fi film. And the girls are really nice, it's kinda sexy the idea to have 'em fighting in the infantry along men. And talking 'bout the infantry, it's the biggest slaughtery i've ever seen in a movie. This flick is the kind that won't leave you thinking 'bout it, it's just a well done movie made to make you have a good time and also will make you enjoy the idea of being a civilian. Maybe it shows the vulnerability of the human race, but not much more can be said 'bout this film. Except that if you want to see a sci fi action film, i would recommend Aliens. And one more thing: it was quite a strange military; after being in it for- what a year, a year and a half?- all the characters ended with a big promotion, to lieutenant, captain, colonel, etc. Or they actually did an incredibly terrific job or they were desperately needed of officers. That's an army i'd join- if the only bugs i had to think 'bout were those under my fridge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it and I just saw it again recently on TV, and very little was cut out on this TV version since it was aired on a movie channel. I remember expecting a really bad movie based on reviews and what some friends said of it, but I was curious about it since I like sci-fi and war movies. Starship Troopers isn't an awesome movie, but it is really entertaining. If you want to see a movie for good acting, see a Coppola or Scorsese film.From what I've been told, the movie does not follow the Robert A. Heinlein novel very closely. Most of the characters are from the novel, and the overall plot is similar, but the details are quite different.I've heard that one specific scene that was in the novel, but wasn't made in this film, disappointed a lot of fans when this movie came out. It was described as a scene where the mobile infantry drop down to a planet from space in their "mech" suits. This sounds really interesting, I guess I'll have to buy the book.I would recommend this movie If you like sci-fi, action,or war movies. It is corny and comic book like in some parts. It is also very violent, not a horror movie like violence, but graphic war violence.I rated this movie 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this was supposed to be a fun movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I'm all for brainless action movies, but STARSHIP TROOPERS was just awful. This movie never gets going until about the 55 minute mark, leaving us until that time with dull, slow-as-molasses-in-winter character "development." We follow the characters as they graduate from high school, decide what to do, argue with their parents about their future, enroll in the federation, go through basic training, meet new friends, more basic training, and endure the wrath of drill instructor Clancy Brown. That's 55 minutes were you are completely bored out of your mind. The trailer was full of action and bug killing, so you spend those 55 minutes wondering when you're going to see just that. The development scenes do nothing to add to the characters, as they're already dull and lifeless to start with. We also get to see Casper van Dein lose girlfriend Denise Richards to Patrick Muldoon, so she must have not been very much in love with Dein to begin with, as she does nothing to disuade Muldoon from advancing on her. A shame this heartless, two-timing airhead ditz is allowed to live (and Richards again, as always, proves she doesn't have one cent of acting ability. And her smile is particularly scary.)****SPOILERS****The only character in the movie that generates any sympathy from the audience (or me, at least), and the one female character who cares for our lead and loves him, is Dina Meyer's Dizzy, and she--of course--gets killed. Veterans Clancy Brown and Michael Ironside lend some good support, and Jack Busey (who has such a frighteningly-uncanny resemblance to his father) is surprisingly-good comic relief without ever getting obnoxious.The special effects are certainly the highlight of the entire movie. With effects wizards Phil Tippet, Alec Gillis, and Tom Woodruff Jr., you get nothing less than excellence. The action scenes are appropriately thrilling, with lots of action, violence, and a dose of screaming and yelling. You really do get a sense the soldiers are in grave danger when these arachnid aliens come around. Another highlight of the film is Basil Poledouris's adrenaline-pumping score, mostly hidden under the layers of shouting, gunfire, explosions, and other sound effects, but a rock-solid action score that plays great on its own, full of heroism and hard-hitting action.But the painfully-obvious answer to ending the alien threat damages this movie. Who gives a crap out how the aliens think? Why not just nuke the whole damn planet from orbit and be done with it? How many meteors have to come dangerously close to Earth before they finally decide to do something about it?People kept telling me to check the film out and watch as just a plain fun action movie. I'm a fan of those, but STARSHIP TROOPERS just plain stunk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Verhoeven does it again. After having such success in the science-fiction genre with Robocop and Total Recall, he's back with another grand vision of the future. Starship Troopers is the definition of entertainment. If all movies were done on this scale, would bad movies be made? I saw this movie recently after avoiding it since the first time I saw it in 1997. For some reason it didn't appeal to me on that first viewing. I'm glad I waited, because it was like discovering a classic. In fact, now I'm very surprised that anyone could dislike this movie. Most of the hate seems to come from people who read the novel. I never did. I have talked about it quite a bit lately and everyone has showed a great appreciation for it. And it's relatively unknown young cast have all went on to gain fame. Well, maybe I'm a little upset with where Casper Van Dien's career has led him. He could have been a fine actor. But I'll be alright because his greatness is captured in this film. A few of my favorite veteran actors pop up in this to boot (Michael Ironside, Marshall Bell, and Clancy Brown all kick a moderate about of butt). Did I mention the red stuff? This movie earns its R rating, as one would expect from a Verhoeven film. The World War II propaganda commercials are another highlight; just hilarious. Starship Troopers is unbelievably good sci-fi and a must-watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read Robert A. Heinlein's novel in 1978. And that's what you should do. If your library doesn't have it, surf on over to IMDb's companion site, Amazon.com, and buy Heinlein's Starship Troopers.THEN you will wonder, as I do, how in this day of visuals over plot the most haunting visual of the book never makes it into the movie.Heinlein shows the reader scene after scene of the Troopers jumping down from space platforms to planet surfaces in their "mech" suits, part spacesuit, part tank. The sight of thousands of mech-suited Troopers dropping out of space, filling an alien sky, would give your average ground-dwelling humanoid the chills.This is THE scene from the book. Heinlein gave it to the director on a silver platter. But do we get to see it in the movie? No! So if they can't even get Heinlein's imagery right, you know they just tossed out his philosophy, plot and characters.True, many other SF movies are similarly mindless and superficial. But most of them weren't based on something good.If you want the real story, read the book. And you, too, will wonder why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Extremely vague pseudo-spoiler) When I first saw this movie; me and a friend hired both this and 'Guyver' from the video store. I know it now sounds odd to mention both these movies in the same breath, but in the UK until that point; unless you followed the 'movie-scene' (which we didn't at the time) SST was an 'unknown'. There had been very little promo material about it (comparably) and really I was watching it because of the pretty picture on the box.We decided to watch SST first out of the two movies. When we had watched it once, we were so impressed with it we decided to skip 'Guyver' and watch SST *again*.This movie has often been taken on face values, a lot of my friends like the 'bug shooting' and 'wartime' aspects of the film. But just like 'Robocop' (also Paul Verhoeven (sp?)) this movie has very little to do with the story as presented at face value.This movie is about growing up, pure and simple. It documents the lives of some pretty idealistic kids and how they grow apart when they leave an insulated environment and have to cope with the wide world outside their doors.However; Mr. V has taken the unique perspective of the 'kids' for this journey, and he has tried to make you empathise with *their* struggle, rather than the usual take of 'Parents watching kids grow up' which dominates most big movies.All in all; a unique perspective on maturity which can hit you on so many levels if you're open to it, that it's not funny.. Watch it, you wont regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, this sucks... but the action is tip-top</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are not enough war-in-space movies. There's Star Wars, of course, but for someone like me who wants space dogfight action, it's a little outdated. There's Star Trek, but I hate Star Trek like I hate Barbara Steisand (First Contact wasn't that bad though). The first trailer of Starship Troopers made me believe it was a war-in-space movie. I was about to wet my pants in happiness. Then I saw another trailer and it turned out we fight space bugs on a planet. Eh, it's not as good as space, but giant alien bugs getting blown to peices is still a sound idea! I was pumped for this movie, let me tell you. I may be a big, serious film guy, but I'm also a guy, and a movie about blowing away space bugs sounded like a no-lose situation.Well, the movie gets some points for its action. This movie has brilliant special effects and puts them to good use (yes you can have good special effects and do nothing with them; remember Episode 1?). The fighting is fun and intense. So, yeah, I like that. Also there is some nudity (but not involving Denise Richards, damn it).Okay, besides all of that, the movie reeks. Everyone I have ever met liked this movie because of the bug action, but they all, ALL have admitted the movie sucked anyway. Well, it does. First off, you couldn't cast worst people to play these bad characters. Denise Richards is hot, this is true, and it is also true that she wasn't that bad in Wild Things (mainly because she played an annoying, rich, yuppie, white girl which is easy for an annoying, rich, yuppie, white girl). But, she can't act, AT ALL. Casper Van Dein (I don't feel like checking the spelling, shoot me) is one of the worse actors I have ever seen. He looks like somebody you would see in the military, so he looks his part. But he acts like, well, like a soap opera actor. And the other people, well, they all suck too. Actually, Michael Ironside is pretty cool, but other than that, they all suck.Now the plot sucks, but that should be no surprise to anyone. I knew the plot would suck the moment I heard of this movie. You don't go to see movies like this because of plot. But some plot points are just plain insulting. For example, the main character dies in battle. WAIT, I didn't spoil anything, because the movie isn't over yet due to the fact THEY BRING HIM BACK TO LIFE. No, they don't treat his wounds or anything, he really DIES and they BRING HIM BACK. Maybe I didn't catch that scene right or something, but I swear I think that's how they explained it. Oh, and don't even get me started on the "brain" bug thing... It looks like a crawling anus. No joke.There are also these scenes which make fun of army recruitment commercials. If you want to know what I mean, do you remember the fake commercials in Robocop (directed by the same guy, Paul Verhoven)? Well, they're a lot like that. Some of them are funny (like when they feed a cow to a bug soldier), but some come off as just plain distracting.So, I think my mission of pointing out the movie is bad is accomplished, but is the movie good in a fun way? Well, it kind of is. The biggest problem facing this movie (other than the odd assortment of really bad actors; really, I want to shoot who ever is responsible for this casting job) would have to be that the movie has too many human scenes. Normally, character development is good, and I feel like I'm committing the biggest movie-sin of all time in saying this, but there is too much development in this movie. WE WANT BUGS. Plain and simple. People don't go to movies advertised like this for anything else. In fact, we never even get to the bugs until about half way through the damn movie! This is an injustice. Oh well. The training part is pretty funny, as with all movies with training scene.In conclusion, this movie is horrible. But is it fun? I have concluded, yeah, for now. At some point, another director will come along and make a better space bug movie that will EASILY replace this one. But until then, this will satisfy my male urge for guns, death, and giant space bugs exploding.Ratings:On a "serious, film" perspective: 2/10On a "fun, dumb movie" perspective: 6/10</fullReview>

Compared to most of the other sci-fi movies out there, this one isn't afraid of it's own cornyness, and it IS corny sometimes. But the schmaltz and the cliches is there to prove a point. People arn't always so original and individual. So by over-playing it a bit (more then a bit sometimes, to be honest) the (often) brilliant director Paul Verhoeven really delivers. And more.It's 90210 in space, with giant limb-ripping bugs. I love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Talk about a movie that is accessible on many levels... This film could be a very superficial sci-fi actioner about a group of enthusiastic soldiers fighting alien bugs, or it could be an ultra-satirical parody of World War II propaganda films, right down to Doogie Howser's SS coat. I've seen this film exactly twice, and admittedly wrote it off after my initial viewing as nothing more than another movie where the only good performance delivered is by the special effects artists. Well, on a whim, I rented it again last night and, after watching it again, I realized the full extent of the satire and loved it. The writing in this movie could easily be described as ultra-cheesy, trite, and conventional, but I think this is exactly the point. Even down to the non-descript title, this film is trying to be a complete parody. It's an anti-war movie at heart, and an excellent one. It just needs to be thought about with more in mind than the gratuitous nudity and extreme gore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is a great film, one of the best of the decade. it is woefully misunderstood by audiences and critics who were expecting a giant bug flick. It has great action and wonderful effects, but at its heart is a WW2 movie transplanted into the future. Paul Verhoven chose to use his director's chair to make a movie ridiculing Militarism and fascism. He also parodies the racist propaganda films and newsreels that are made to whip up hysteria against your enemy. Verhoven is one of the few directors who can make a movie that is makes you think and makes you laugh. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is a great movie for young teenagers who are looking for the most gruesome movie made in the late 90's. To everyone else this movie is an insult to our intelligence. There is so much technical wrongness in this movie. The troopers use small machine gun bullets on huge overgrown armor plated rhinoserous beetles. Oh yes, when they are stabbed repeatedly by 3 inch bug daggers they get back up and start firing away again. And why does the ever so smart military just shoot nuclear missiles and blow up all the bug planets anyway, instead of sending down people with pea-shooters. The diologue is just awful, when you here the main stars talk when they arrive on the military base in the beginning of the movie it makes you sick. There are only three good actors in this movie, Michael Ironside(Rasczak), Jake Busey (Ace), and Clancy Brown (Zim). The worst part of all is that in all of the nudity in this, Denise Richards character never gets naked!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm tickled pink to see that fans of overrated blowhard paleo-libertarian Robert Heinlein are outraged at the liberties taken with his book. Clearly Verhoeven and his screenwriter were on to something...and ST is one of those rare flicks where the film *is* better than the book. I've watched the movie three or four times since 1998, and my only regret is that I didn't get to see it on the big screen, where the superlative SFX would have been even more impressive. There are so many things to love about this movie...its cheerful and often hilarious embrace and subversion of wartime propaganda films and 50's teen/sci-fi flick cliches, the casting of impossibly beautiful second- and third-rate actors (I wonder if they realized what use they were being put to?), the touches that seem silly but upon second thought, disturbing (e.g., the cast seems too old to be in high school -- or maybe in this future, the government finds it useful to extend 'adolescence'?), the occasional hints that the 'bug war' was purposely fomented by the government, the way the liberal dream of gender equality as the norm (e.g., the football game, that famous shower scene) is juxtaposed with the enthusiastic fascism of its beneficiaries, the way the homoerotic/sadomasochistic overtones in military culture are made explicit (e.g., Rico's whipping)....ST is both perversely playful and a great action flick. Seeing Doogie Howser in SS drag alone is worth the price of rental! It's a pity that so many have misunderstood ST that the director and writer, in the DVD commentary, are compelled to begin by stating categorically that they *don't like war*.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read "Starship Troopers" by Heinlein when I was young. I always imagined what a great movie it would make. Paul Verhoeven single-handedly destroyed my vision. In response to those of you who think the plot is 'unoriginal'--the book was written by one of the forefathers of science fiction. The reason the plot looks unoriginal is because so many have copied it! (Read some books by Heinlein, Asimov, or Bradbury and you will notice how much Hollywood has 'borrowed' over the years--in fact, I think they're making a movie version of 'Fahrenheit 451' right now...) Anyhow, Verhoeven butchered the book. Yes, he grew up in WWII Europe, so he had to throw in his own violent/naziesque view of war (hence the bad tactics and the nazi uniforms). He's a also knows what sells (hence the ultra-violence and the pointless nudity). If you liked this movie, you probably liked 'Independence Day" too, and that's okay. If you hated this movie for the above reasons, READ THE BOOK! It's great, the weapons are better, the armor (Murauder suits) are way better, there is a whole other race of aliens involved... it's much better. (Incidently, in the book the Troopers use nerve gas on the 'bugs,' and said 'bugs' actually carry weapons and have space ships.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it's a pity that they didn't manage to work in the Frank Loesser song, "The Ballad of Rodger Young." In the novel, this song is a leitmotif... I am both a Heinlein fan and a liberal. (Hey, I admire Wagner's music, too...). I first read "Starship Soldiers" (the original title) in the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in 1959. I was fascinated by the film. Although like many Hollywood adaptations it departs from the novel in many ways, I felt that it nevertheless was acceptably faithful to the original. Much more so than, say, the George Pal version of "The Time Machine." Heinlein's politics are handled in an interesting and evasive, ambiguous way. They are, in fact, presented fairly accurately; but, just as the novel pretends to be set in the future but really reflects World War II, the movie (somehow!) combines a Star Wars "look" with a Frank Capra World War II "look." It must be a joy for cineastes, as it incorporates innumerable cliches, both in dialogue and in "look," from old war movies. To me, the effect was satirical--and as a liberal AND Heinlein fan, that suits me just fine (In Heinlein's novel, of course, the purely evil Bugs serve to sidestep any questions about the morality of war. Germans and Japanese are humans, Bugs are not). True, I wish the movie makers had chosen to depict the exoskeleton "suit" technology Heinlein describes. It would have been fun to see our soldiers leaping tall buildings in a single bound. But maybe there was a feeling that the moral relativism might creep back in if both the bad guys AND the good guys have exoskeletons!</fullReview>

Let me say I enjoyed watching it.Now, after that let me say it was absolutely horrid. Yes, good special effects, yes lots of fun blood and guts and action, yes there's even some nudity. If that's the stuff you're looking for this is a great movie. Otherwise I just laughed my head off at its rediculousness. I definately realized that parts were supposed to be rediculous (the propaganda, some of the lines), but there were other parts that I wasn't sure about. Because of that I think the movie fails at trying to get any point or even satire out. Any political bit that the book might have gotten to is brushed off. You know it's there, but the movie just doesn't get into it enough to figure out what the hell it's trying to say. So, as my title reads, this was great as a B movie. Absolutely fun to watch and laugh at.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an impressive film! The film is based in part on Robert Heinlein's novel about a futuristic battle between mankind and giant insects in another galaxy. But behind all the science fiction is a brutal condemnation of war and the glorification of war. Sure the movie delights in showing people butchered, brains sucked out, limbs flown all over, etc... But the film looks at all this with a skeptical eye, much like the classic Erich Maria Remarque novel All Quiet on the Western Front. The script is fast-paced, fun, and visionary. It is laced with the aforementioned negative response to war and what it offers us, even though it may be necessary under "right" conditions. If political philosophy isn't your bag, don't worry. The film has so much action in it that it will keep you on the edge of your seat as well as keep your eyes amazed with state of the art technology. Visually this film is a stunner. The acting is good too with all the leads doing a pretty good job, with a some real nice performances from Dine Meyer, Casper Van Dien, and, especially, Michael Ironside. The film does have a lot of gory moments, and if you are looking for something tame and thoughtful, this is not it. Pictures that try to make a point about the effects of war, by nature, must be brutal. War is hell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why did they make this movie? (Other than the $$)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that Robert Heinlein's novel Starship Troopers is still considered the original model for all hard sci-fi warfare stuff. (Just read a few jacket covers in the Sci-Fi section at your bookstore and you'll see what I mean.) It was ground-breaking for its time and still stands head and heels above most in the genre. The book is a combination "coming of age" and "why we fight" novel and, in addition to the action sequences (which start page one) there are several philosophical passages concerning when and why we should fight and what being a "citizen" means. Read it.Now, the movie called Starship Troopers has none of this, except for the action. All of the characters have been re-written and given different motivations and abilities. Casting was bizarre (Johnny Rico is a dark latino sort(as I remember the novel), the nudity (while nice) was gratuitous. Though the film attempts to portray women in a more modern light it fails - in Heinlein's novel they are actually superior in some ways, just not physical "grunt" stuff.As to the technology depicted - I can't believe that hollywood is not up to a portrayal of the type of technologically-intense warfare depicted by the book. The armored combat suits are key to the novel and influence all of the strategy behind the warfare depicted. The movie assures us that hundreds of years in the future, with apparently faster-than-light drive, we still send men and women into combat armed only with rifles (and with no ground transport to boot!)! Ridiculous!The acting is stilted and boring with one or two exceptions - the plot is full of holes (not true of the source material) - though these things don't surprise me given the director's track record.The director obviously doesn't like the message of the original novel, seeing Heinlein's society as a fascist one - to the point of giving the officers Nazi style outfits. (So again - why make a movie out of this novel?) As to my original question - why did they make this movie - I guess to offend anyone who's read the book. Why not just call it - "Kill the Bugs!" Because thats really the only similarity between the movie and the book (besides a few plot points).In short, despite the decent special effects (just decent, though)this film is among the worst contemporary adaptations of a science-fiction novel ever made. In recent years only the incredibly bad "The Postman" by Kevin Costner beats it. Watch the movie, if you must,for the pretty bodies and some of the special effects - but then promise your self to read the book! Maybe it will cleanse your soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thinking Man's Action Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where most movies of this genre desperately try to be not too openly fascist, Starship Troopers goes to every extreme: the actors are TV - soap - gorgeous (that's because they all are TV soap actors), the enemy is not just a bit evil, they are brain - eating bugs, the plot goes through every (and I mean each and every) conceivable clich, the weapons are mechanized versions of John Holmes' private parts, the soldiers postmodern versions of Nazi storm troopers, the form of government a globalized militaristic dictatorship.Paul Verhoeven has essentially created an honest, entertaining, and generally underrated movie. His message seems to be: visual fascism is fun, let's stop pretending and just go for it -- and I agree with him.As for the technical qualities: the bugs SFX are fabulous, the spaceship SFX are mediocre, and the set design is mostly cheap and tacky. The acting is as intentionally naff, but who needs emotional depth when you can have warp drives and nuclear grenade launchers (and Dina Meyer getting her kit off)? Despite of some technical shortcomings, the movie overall looks and feels great. Recommended viewing.</fullReview>

When Verhoeven hits the sci-fi switch step away, grab a beer and just appreciate the fact that you have eyes to witness this cool journey. If you loathe bad acting, turn your head everytime denise richards comes on the screen, yikes! But for the true laugh, watch out for those troopers whose names you don't catch, they bite the dust in the most horrible ways.

There really is a plot, if you pay attention past the glitz. Yes, a few things might be seem strange (keep in mind when the story was written, and about "big brother", militarism, "love of god and country", etc.). The film contains one of the best special effects scenes ever, when the fleet is attacking the planet, one of the ships "breaks in half", you can see all the different decks/floors at the break! WOW! And some of the stock sayings will stick to your brain: (when going on a suicide mission): "You want to live forever?" "The only good bug is a dead bug", etc. A classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best war movies ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all: I havent read the book, so my review refers only on the film...In my opinion, "Starship Troopers" is one of the most underrated movies of the last decade. On the first view it is a fast, violent, entertaining and gory popcorn movie, which contains the best drill sequence since "Full Metal Jacket". But there is much more like this, because Paul Verhoevens film shows urgently the absurdity of war: young soldiers are wasted for a senseless venture. One of the most important scenes is the short take, when the bombers raid over a flock of bugs and destroy them in only a few second. A while later a little group of soldiers fights a hopeless battle to defend a fort against an superiority of insects...An other positive point is, that "Starship Troopers" doesnt deal with the usual good-and-evil-clich: the "evil" bugs only act in self-defense after the "good" humans were intruding into their territory. In this way, Verhoevens film could also be watched as a cynical statement on every form of colonialism and oppression. But different from other war movies, "Starship Troopers" doesnt build up any hostilities against other countries, races etc. The film makes clear, that there are neither "good" sides nor "bad" sides in a war, because every party has got its very own motives and understandable reasons to fight...And finally, "Starship Troopers" is a brilliant satire: the actors look like if they were taken from soap operas like "Beverly Hills 90210" or "Melrose Place" (I think, they are...). All men, all women are so stylish, are so good looking... its an obvious example for the human vanity, megalomania, to see ourselves as the top of the evolution. Also there are many sideswipes against the growing influence of the medias. Via Internet they make publicity to join the army and goad on the hatred against bugs. The screen shots are modern variant of the propaganda films which were shown at the cinemas during World War II, to give a totally wrong impression to the public about the present situation. My IMDb rating for "Starship Troopers": a perfect 10!!!</fullReview>

A lot of people can't credit the film with the intelligence needed to be an effective satire, but I think it works. I wonder if I was the only one who was actually frightened by the fact that the world could very easily wind up the way it's portrayed in the film.

I found there was a strong reminder of the style of other Paul Verhoeven movies, especially Total Recall; I couldn't put my finger on what exactly it was, maybe you can spot it?The plot is simple, the dialogue equally so, and thus the film presents little challenge to the viewer.

		<fullReview>If you are looking for a movie that has fairly good special effects and a pretty high content of blood and gore, then this is a good movie for you. I went into this movie expecting just an action packed special effects demonstration, and I came out fairly satisfied. Some of the satire was a little over done, and a little hard to handle, and much of the acting was not high quality. But overall, I still thought it was a decent mindless action movie. Then I read the book, and was SEVERLY disappointed in the movie. It was nothing like the book. I am sure had Heinlein been alive, he would not have allowed the screenwriter to so blatantly rob the title of the book. They only got a few details right: the society of Earth was a very militaristic one, the right to vote had to be earned through service, Earth was a war with an arachnid life form, and the key character names were the same. But the movie missed a very large portion of the book's focus. The book actually deals with the actual war for maybe half of the time. The movie also missed a very critical concept with the Mobile Infantry. In the book, the MI was made up of highly trained, highly equipped, and highly motivated soldiers. The MI of the movie was a mass of people who had been handed a weapon and pointed in the right direction to shoot and die. This is by far the absolute worst novel adaptation I have seen.I know a lot of people are probably saying that viewers shouldn't compare it to the book, to watch the movie for what it is, a mindless action movie with good effects. Well, it is kind of hard not to compare the two when the book that is being butchered is a well written political and sociological commentary by an astounding writer such as Robert Heinlein. When a book such as this one is so expertly hacked, it is sadly disappointing to those of us who thourghly enjoyed reading it.</fullReview>

The special effects blend amazingly well, to me the most important part of it. Take a look at Gladiator and you can tell the difference between a well done blend job and a hackneyed take. Verhoven didn't need to pay his actors much, so all the money could go there. Everything else pretty much adds up the satire. Who else would take these actor and put them in these costumes? Doogie Howser the SS officer, the machismo talk and glamour faces...As for the nudity, we as an audience are the only ones who care, as an American audience most of all. The carnage is the same as the Wild Bunch and westerns, we watch violence and blood and gore. If you didn't like this one, well, if its more graphic then its safe to say its more realistic too.I'm usually a purist about movies following books, though considering Heinlien it fits. Increasingly conservative in his own politics, this is the spirit that he wanted, though perhaps not portrayed this way. And if Verhoven mocks it, well, someone should. Duty and responsibility are fine things to promote, but Verhoven wants to warn us about what happens when any one group takes control, and its closer to reality than Heinlein's vision.Calculated and over-the-top, but a well crafted and fun movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Poisoned Parfait</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie shamelessly, 'shamelessly' denoting I SHOULD feel shame for doing so - lots of it. Paul Verhoeven has many deeply troubling tendencies in his work, primarily for being the Culture Of Death's most alluring cheerleader...John Wayne Gacy would have moral problems with Verhoeven's movies. Unfortunately, he's an inspired, kinetic filmmaker who always shows at least flashes of greatness. STARSHIP TROOPERS is his best work, hands down. What he's selling here is the most heartless, amoral, decadent vision of Western civilization ever mass-marketed by a major studio, wrapped in old-Hollywood surface tinsel and handed over with a wink so deeply lascivious that your bone marrow freezes for a second before you take the package, tearing off the wrapper greedily with twitching hands. Yet, because it's all played out in space-opera conventions, it has just enough distancing from us to really allow you to wallow in its bright, sensual imagery and watch the subgags, as densely packed and layered as a Harvey Kurtzman MAD comic, whizz by. 'Dense' is an apt word to describe this movie. Its simple-minded plot is one kind of dense, of course, but as timeless and classical as any good cliche must be. The treatment is another dense altogether: there's more MOVIE in this movie's first half-hour than most directors could shoehorn into a trilogy. Verhoeven also implicitly understands CGI aesthetically as well: if the technology now exists to make anything possible in a movie, then you may as well give the audience DeMille-scale flabbergastery. My only quibble is that, had these effects appeared in a lower-budget indie, no way they don't get mau-mau'd by the board with an NC-17 (aka the dreaded X for the nose-ring generation). This double-standard is a nice Verhoevian touch: as his films are brilliantly-visualized celebrations of the strong devouring the weak, I've no doubt he appreciates the irony of the R rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost a modern day Nazi propaganda film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Verhoven's crudely Neo-Fascist and fast-paced war show is an entertaining test of your new home theater system. Almost like a modern day Nazi propaganda film in most areas, it celebrates the triumph of the Master Organism, Man, over the vermin bugs and their socialist system.To qualify as a True Citizen, our heroes must prove their mettle by serving the Federal Reich, in the face of the gathering hordes of unter-life loitering towards the East (at least on the 'space maps' depicted in the movie). From kids to Citizens, the heroes and heroines transform from model students and join different arms of the Federal Wermacht.The rich kid star athlete discovers the purity of hard work and earned respect, his brainy sweetheart finds her true calling in the Fleet/Kriegsmarine, the genius geek becomes a decision-making leader in the honourable trench-coated Gestapo. Michael Ironside and Clancy Brown provide the craggy experienced soldier-types who impart wisdom and courage, and teach our heroes the meaning self-sacrifice and of reaching the goals, whatever the costs.The inferiority of the Enemy is proven by the instant improvisation of our saviours in the heat of battle, and the folly of the commune-based hierarchy is shown up with the capture of the 'Superbrain' bugs/commissars. As a 'great leader' once remarked on the eve of Barbarossa: "Kick the door in and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down".This flick won't try to question the meaning of life nor make any attempt at pushing the boundaries of human relationships, but its good subversive fun, especially if you've always wanted 'them vermin to come git some'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one's truly enjoyable. If you want a pastiche of American moral standard (at least the way Hollywood shows it), then you've got it. Ferocious allusions (Vietnam War, Nazi looking officers working hand in hand with GI-like guys, Maccarthyst ads ...), sardonic humour, ultraviolence are sown all throughout this movie. Verhoeven even provided a pseudo-moral ending with guys cheering up for their victory, a laughing glance at painful sci-fi flicks (ID-4, Stargate). So, if you're looking for a classic good sci-fi film, forget it !Somehow, this movie raises a question : how did Verhoeven manage to have this movie produced by a commercial american studio ? The result is, of course, a relative commercial failure in the US, and a relative success all over the world (just take a look as IMDB stats about US/non US voters and compare with the same stats for ID-4 !) However, it seems Verhoeven has been brought back to the right way considering the ridiculous stereotyped Hollow Man.My rating for these mean Troopers : 10/10 !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I've heard from friends who've seen that movie wasn't really that convincing. Not at all. I've been warned NOT to watch this movie. At least, one day when I felt the lust to watch kinda space-movie, the moment had come for me to pick it anyway... Seriously: amazingly good thing I did! I was totally surprised from the first second on and this enthusiasm didn't lower until the human race was finally saved. The humour was one thing I would never have expected and the scenarios were damned thrilling! Example: To get rid of one of those fast and god-knows-how-dangerous human slashing bugs, a whole crew of starship troopers is being required and they've got to shoot with all firepower at one of'em 'till the b****rd finally finally gets down - after having lost at least half of the fighting human crew which counted about ten people in the beginning, 'bout four after the battle. Damned hard work if you're asking me. Next thing the poor troopers are being confronted with is the view of a huge and wide landscape being overrun by a horde of these mindless bugs and they're running straight into their direction... That kinda "being totally lost"-frustration that takes place in this movie had been seen before like in "Independance day", where alien had destroyed ceveral locations on earth and the movie-watchers are asking themselves "how the hell are they going to win that war after all that loss???". Same question in ST after the impression that there is no chance of survival at all. Only THIS time, the idea how to win that mess anyway is much more convincing, much more original, much more fun and MUCH BETTER!You like black humour? Sarcasm's also your thing? You also like americanized self-irony? Blood spilling humand body dismemberments can't make your stomach merry-go-round? Easy hint: Don't miss this masterpiece...!</fullReview>

With a second viewing (following a re-reading of the book which is one of my three all-time favorites), I was majorly disappointed in this film. I won't go into the more common complaints of the film (like, why no powered armor?). But there are a few points I would like to make. Why did they combine the characters of DuBois and Razceck(sp?) from the book? Why is Rico such an obnoxious and unlikable jerk? The movie could have been a lot better if it was done in a first-person narrative like the book and not make Rico out to be so annoying. The captain of the ROGER YOUNG was an idiot and Carl was a totally different character. I do like the addition of female MIs and the new types of bugs. However, Denise Richards' constant smiling annoyed the heck outta me. Casper Van Dien's performance left much to be desired. I did find the effects great, however, and all-in-all the story wasn't too off the mark and it was a lot more coherent than some other recent sci-fi films (i.e., the atrocious BATTLEFIELD EARTH).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One word, "Excessive"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since all movies short of excellent can be summarized in a word, Starship Troopers can be summed up as `Excessive'.That said, let me expand on why. I'm not a fan of gore and I often cringe when human lives are threatened and taken. However, the vast amount of severed limbs, the camera ever returning to those are they are being mangled, and... the overall fakeness of it all made it completely bearable. Unfortunately, the constant repetition of bloody severance of bodies was completely annoying. Well, excessive, rather.Now, if I could have picked another word to summarize this film, I would have chosen `Propaganda'.Starship Troopers is not a movie. I believe it's a parody of propaganda which just happens to have some elements of an action film. Sure the news-reel cutscenes are a clear mockery but there are many others as well. The young boy (who's hair style and blue eyes are straight from WWII Germany) and his quest for honor through the military could only be that of a work of propaganda. And, the annoyingly innocent looking super girl and her countless victories could only be crying out to all the commoners to fulfil their potential.But, as a parody of a military solicitation, it's half way decent. Holding excess in bad character execution (Rico's father, Dizzy, and sometimes Carl), fake plastic severed limbs and unnecessary nudity (and that same alien death flail over and over and over) aside, Starship Troopers provides spots of entertainment. Unfortunately, it's generally annoying until after the first half.Before viewing, take a few deep breaths like you did during the SAT's and try to enjoy the few shining moments Starship Troopers has to offer. Oh, and if you're like me, turn away as soon as you see a cow. Just do it, you'll thank me later.</fullReview>

This book contained ideas of soldiery and concepts that everyone in the military should, and usually does, have a grasp of. This book was so accurate that West Point cadets are required to read this as an assignment.

		<fullReview>On the surface, "Starship Troopers" is a slick homage to old-school sci fi monster movies and 1940's war movies, with enough sex and gore to satisfy modern audiences. It's a reasonably entertaining action movie. There has been much disagreement, however, about the deeper meaning of "Starship Troopers" (like most of Mr. Verhoeven's movies). If taken at face value, it plays like an ode to global fascism, so we can only hope that it was not intended to be taken literally. It does not, however, succeed as a satire.Verhoeven's concept of satire involves taking all the worst cliched excesses of a movie genre, throwing them on the screen, and raking in dough from the masses who take the movie seriously. This is deeply cynical, manipulative, and irresponsible. True satire distinguishes itself from its target by exaggerating its negative aspects, providing a clear message, winking at the audience with self-aware humor and causing us to laugh at the target of the satire. Apart from the hilarious phony war newsreels and some very obscure in-jokes, "Starship Troopers" plays it straight. The good guys win by sneering at death, and blowing up everything in sight. The movie upholds all the bad values that Verhoeven thinks he is satirizing.The clever trick is that the beginning and end of the movie make it seem that the whole thing might be a propaganda film for the movie's fictitious quasi-fascist global government. This is too clever. It is too subtle, and most people don't seem to get it. Unless you figure this out, the movie plays not as a satire of war propaganda, but as actual straight-faced war propaganda. Militaristic types and soap opera fans who see "Starship Troopers" take it as just another 100 minutes of sex and violence upholding their view of the world. Verhoeven is more than happy to take their money, I'm sure, but a movie with a message needs to sell its message to the audience, not merely reinforce everyone's existing views and turn a profit.Verhoeven's earlier films like "Robocop" managed to successfully mix over-the-top action with serious political statements. Now he just peddles trash like "Showgirls", "Basic Instinct" and "Starship Troopers" and tries to pass it off as art. I ain't buying it. This was a moderately enjoyable sleazy B-movie and nothing more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would the real Bug-Eyed-Monsters please step forward?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Warning*** - plot point discussed within.Superficially, a disturbingly pro-fascist movie that would no doubt appeal to those given to such backward sentiments. Personally I find it impossible to believe that this was the intention on the part of the film-makers (whose political leanings are unknown to me). I have not read the original Heinlein story, so have no idea how it relates. While there is a potential message to the movie, it is thankfully not rammed home with a sledgehammer. Instead you are left to yourself to put your mind in gear and think! With only one (brief)exception that I can recall (and even that was dismissive of the alternative position), the movie never doubts that we are the good guys (the "master species" if you prefer). How better to promote the questioning of that premise than to dress it up in the style with which we associate the horrendous "master race" ideology. Oh and let's make the "others" something we all tend to find repulsive: bugs (surely no one can object to vilifying them). They're not the type of enemy you are likely to identify with. But that's OK, we're not being encouraged to think that they are the good guys either. The real question posed is that is there any real difference between the two? Are we really any better than this repulsive, dangerous "other"? A subtle case in support of this is my opinion on the source of the asteroid that is used as an excuse for war. The explanation given in the film never quite felt right (the bugs pushed it toward the Earth; the how didn't make sense to me), something I previously took to be a weakness in the story. However, upon seeing the movie again recently, it occurred to me that this "explanation" was given in a propaganda broadcast. Truth had nothing to do with it, the political motives behind the scene are a different matter. I for one think that the asteroid was pushed by humans to set up the excuse for war (or at least was a natural event twisted to meet the political agenda)[Sure, this wasn't explicitly stated in the movie (any version I've seen anyway), but spoon feeding is for babies]. In short, the humans (government) have the same disregard for individuals (the inhabitants of Buenos Aires)as do the (brain) bugs (throw large numbers of cannon-fodder to overwhelm the humans).Would the real Bug-Eyed-Monsters please step forward?PS: Also makes for an entertaining action film, unless you're squeamish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, yeah, yeah, so the story is limp, the acting (ha!) is dreadfully crass &amp; cheesy, the young actors remain convinced they're in a TV commercial looking for the Big Chance and yet only offer whiter than white teeth and a good choice in hair gel.But to criticize this movie on an intellectual level is to miss the point completely. This is Paul Verhoeven territory: he is the McDona*ds of movie making, lacking in acquired taste, but cheap, good value &amp; fast on delivery!ST is basically a combination of all those 1950's cheap sci-fi movies coupled with similar styled pulp action comics. No new idea is given a chance here, instead its a kind of Who's Who of "guess what film that sequence was pinched from!"This film would appeal a great deal to the 90s Doom Generation. If you've played the computer game then this is just a film version to feast your hungry eyes over. The gore is of course way over the top and graphically explicit yet the censors didn't bat an eyelid - perhaps because they realize that it's all so fascile and tongue in cheek that the decapitations, brain sucking and God knows what else is just played for laughs.The acting is so cheesy I'm surprised the bugs weren't a field of mice instead of ugly aliens. Sometimes you really do feel for the bugs here, since they offer more charm than any of the failed TV soap rejects. Although having said that, the special effects are truly wonderful and uncompromising.I've always loved Mike Ironside and it's a shame he wasn't given enough to do here cus his acting abilities &amp; experience eclipsed everyone else on show here. But at least his appearance paid a few more household bills no doubt.If you liked RoboCop, Aliens &amp; violent computer games you're gonna love this!!***/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>stupid but attractive movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read a review of this film that claimed that it was full of subversive humor -- this shows the danger of contemporary criticism. You say something like this and then the auteur comes along and opens his mouth and blows you away. In this case, it was the commentary track on the DVD version of this movie, which shows that Verhoeven and Neumeier are so stupid that they can't understand the Heinlein novel on which this movie is based. Heinlein wasn't a profound author, but he always had something to say (at least in his pre-pornographic adult novels), and he must be spinning in his grave at what they did in this movie.Another thing that is very disappointing is that the novel had some of the coolest weapons around -- things that would have made the Terminator movies look like a gun control fanatics hug-in -- and instead they give the soldiers in this movie BB guns and football helmets. And Doogie Howser is in the movie, and he's as bad as you remember from TV.On the plus side, though, there are a lot of good-looking people in the cast, and you get to see most of them naked. They cut out the only scene with Denise Richards taking off any of her clothes, though, so you'll have to rent "Wild Things" (which is an incomparably better movie) for that. And as stupid as the plot and dialogue are, it's still fun to watch them shoot bugs.When you watch the movie, remember: "War makes fascists of us all". That's what the director and screenwriter say over and over and over again in the commentary, and it sounds just as moronic the 10th time you hear it as it does the first. Anyway, that was their point, so forget about the idea that there is anything intended that isn't patently heavy-handed in this movie. Maybe you should rent "Wild Things" instead, or "Congo".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good parody of fascism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tend to like Peter Veerhoven's movies (I even liked Showgirls) and I enjoyed this one. People who don't like or understand this film don't realize that it is a parody of fascism and that the humans are the actual villains. This is the first time I saw Denise Richards and I thought she was hot, but I eventually realized that she is a bimbo with no talent. The highlight of the film is seeing Doogie Howser in a Nazi SS uniform at the end,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't think it was possible to rip off every other war movie &amp; war cliche out there. What's worse? I didn't think people would buy into the BS that its a great movie because its been made a dozen times before in various settings. Yeah, the special effects were nice in places, needing help in others. Its unbalanced cross between being serious gore movie and satirical rip-off is its downfall. Downfalls: - The cast is drawn from people who were on TV, shouldn't even stay on TV because to put bluntly, cannot act.- The plot was lame. Very lame and unbelievable. The fact that it rips off so many other movies is disgusting and didn't score points or sympathy.- All bow down to the god of cliches.- Awkward pacing/directing. Inconsistencies. I could go on but now that I think about it, I'm not going to let this movie waste anymore of my time. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gory, thrilling fun. Lots of big ugly bugs and they are hands down, the greatest looking giant bugs in movie history. Also the best special effect ever of people getting bitten in half. Great crimson geysers! Story? Yeah, there is a real simple one right there on the surface: shiny, happy recruits join up, train hard, lose a battle, get a bit grimy, but still look like teen models. Its Klendathu 90210! Background story of a future earth united in a sort of vaguely happy fascism run by the military is quickly setup, but its ramifications are ignored. You have to listen to the audio commentary to even realize that the writer &amp; director dont think this is a desirable future! Gee, ya wouldn't know from watching it! Acting is mediocre, made even more so by endless old-war-movie cliche dialogue, which was probably ment to be a bit tongue-in-cheek but comes off as trite. Still, its exciting, quite funny at times and contains the absolute best space invasion scene ever filmed. Yes, ever. Rent it (but don't eat while you watch it!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STARSHIP TROOPERS works well on two levels: the plot, theme, and level of violence, nudity, etc., makes it one of the best gosh-wow sf films for 14 year olds since STAR WARS. For the film historian or politics major, though, it's also a great satire of military recruitment propaganda film from the World War I newsreel to the video-game presentation of Desert Storm, with good chunks of John Wayne and TRIUMPH OF THE WILL stirred into the mixture. It also has some great special effects, and the shower scene is sexier than all of SHOWGIRLS. Heinlein purists may hate it, but even they should see it at least twice.</fullReview>

Possibly the most visually stunning film ever, the alien bugs are the most believable xenomorphs ever portrayed, and represent a convincing xeno-society/xenobiology. Reminiscent of films like Aliens and Zulu, Starship Troopers is darkly stylish, though the performances are poor. A return to form for Verhoeven after Robocop. The ending is particularly satisfying as it resists the temptation to wrap things up too neatly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misunderstood Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this was a great film but a bit misunderstood. It wasn't meant to be serious but I thought it did have a serious point (however, I read the book and perceived the movie as recreation of some of the plot).Just like all Heinlein's novels, this one is full of action and violence (well, that's why we like it :) But the movie also presented a supposedly democratic society gone bad. The slogans of propaganda do sound ridiculous, but how do they differ from "UNCLE SAM WANTS YOU" ?? Noone would say that slogan is something to laugh about. The issue, I think, is that the movie portrays a society, supposedly democratic and based on freedom, that underneath is just a Nazi camp. What's the difference between killing 'bad people' or killing 'bad bugs' if the only reasons for killing them are: they are enemy, they are bad, and you have your orders? I think the underlying theme is that people sometimes do swallow these slogans which (as you can see in the movie) do sound ridiculous, if you substitute bugs instead of (communists, heretics, homosexuals, or take you pick of enemy number one). Or how ridiculous was the replacement of the admiral? When the attack on bugs fails, nobody questions policy; a bad admiral is to blame (obviously it was his fault) and a new one is appointed. A system that maintains the status quo and doesn't question its actions yet preaches the ideals of "good citizenship" in schools (maybe that remind you of your history class, who knows).It is a reminder that the slogan "it will never happen here" is not really reflective of the world. The movie shows how easy it is to hate; that noone will care (I mean, did you really feel bad for the bugs) if our newly selected enemy is ugly and doesn't think like you. They deserve to die just for that (what was the issue with the bugs after all)! Plus, the last propaganda clip is 'classified' however I somehow don't think what they were doing to the bug will pass the Geneva Convention! But who cares, it's not like the thing is human or deserves any rights. And mind control: I mean obviously the upper echelons used to do only the 'right' thing.It also, of course, portrays some of the hate associated with the cold war (the hate for communism, as the bugs are an idealistic portrait of individuals willing to die for their society without question. Obviously the movie can't do justice to many of the issues, well, at least not in a way Heinlein wanted.I think it's a good film, especially if you remember the book. A great action flick; not an Oscar winner by any means, but still a decent one.P.S And if you think I am full of crap, there is another good reason to see it: Denise Richards! ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dutch film director Paul Verhoeven did a great job on his first two American movies "Robocop" and "Total Recall", both sci-fi pictures. His next two movies were the sleazy sex dramas "Basic Instinct" and the infamous "Showgirls". But Verhoeven returned to sci-fi with "Starship Troopers", his best film to date. This is a sci-fi epic crossed with a war epic and the results are outstanding. "Starship Troopers" tells the story of a group of young high schoolers who become "citizens" by joining the army. Then find themselves engaging in a war against giant insects. The special effects in this movie are superb (which got a well deserved Oscar nomination) with not only the bugs but also the spaceships as well. "Starship Troopers" features a good cast of talented young actors which include Casper Van Dien as Rico, Dina Meyer as Flores, and Denise Richards (pre-World Is Not Enough) as Ibanez in the principal roles, with fine support from Neil Patrick Harris, Patrick Muldoon, Jake Busey, Clancy Brown, and Michael Ironside (look for a quick cameo by former "Golden Girl" Rue McClanahan). "Starship Troopers" is gory and violent, but it has plenty of humor in the mix as well (the futuristic ads are a hoot). This is the way a science fiction film should be made: exciting, funny, and witty.**** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An interesting piece of Hollywood schtick rescued from complete worthlessness by the talented direction of Paul Verhoeven and the (always excellent) Basil Poledouris soundtrack, as well as a good dose of satire (thankfully, "Starship Troopers" never takes itself seriously). Lacking even a single moment of suspense or originality (many bits and pieces have been borrowed verbatim from the Aliens, Star Wars and Star Trek movies), this movie somehow still manages to entertain, which says a lot for the director and the high production values involved. The CGE effects are pretty seamless, an accomplishment in any movie of this sort (the movement of the bugs reminded me very much of certain scenes from "Jurassic Park"). Despite being a total rehash of every other movie of its genre (outer space action/adventure - this is not worthy of the name "science fiction"), I enjoyed this movie and found it watchable more than once. What was pulled off here (given the screenplay, disjointed and illogical plot, and poor acting) is almost a miracle. Drop your brain off at the door, enjoy, pick it up again on your way out. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take Another Look!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this is my second review of "Starship Troopers." After reading a large number of other viewer's reviews, and actually taking some time to think seriously about the movie (NOTE - THIS MOVIE *NEVER* TAKES ITSELF SERIOUSLY), something happened. My serious look at this very un-serious film somehow reflected back upon itself, and I finally "got it." This movie is a humorous, satirical parody -- literally, a parody of EVERYTHING it presents. It's a parody of World War II propaganda films, a parody of high school (and relationships therein), a parody of every sci-fi and outer space flick since "Star Wars," a parody of Heinlein's novel (and maybe the man himself!), a parody of violence in the movies, a parody of technology, a parody of the military (American or otherwise), a parody of soap operas and soap opera stars, a parody of our hopeful (and hopeless) visions of the future, a parody of fascist societies... the list goes on and on. Literally *everything* presented in this movie is done so on the level of parody or satire.It's even a parody of itself, and ultimately of us -- Verhoeven is sitting back and laughing that we would go see his film, shelling out yet another (who knows how many millions) hoping to see "Star Wars" replayed yet again. How much longer can this genre last before we all "get it," and let Hollywood go on to bigger and better things?If Heinlein had any sense of humor whatsoever, he would be rolling around in his grave laughing his tail off, not in anger. And if WE have any sense of humor, maybe we can laugh at ourselves. How many times have we shelled out money to see movies like this, only to whine about how bad they are to our friends or on some message board? Do we really expect another *serious* "sci-fi outer space action film?" This genre is totally worn out, finished, kaput. George Lucas had better pray, because his plan to finish the "Star Wars" series is going to flop. There is nothing original that can be done anymore.I think I finally "get it" - and I'm revising my previous rating from 7/10 to 9/10. This movie is brilliant on the level of satirical parody, and it is also funny and entertaining. It invites us to take nothing about itself seriously, and even dares to invite us not to take *ourselves* seriously. How DARE YOU, Mr. Verhoeven! :-)</fullReview>

It's easy to see that Verhoeven has got quite a lot of experience in the action genre, because if it's something that Starship Troopers has it's definitely action. And really scary monsters (or 'bugs')! Yes, the computer animated monsters are actually very well made. The story is basically the classic 'good versus evil' theme, spiced up with the just as classic love story. Starship troopers isn't a film that tries to investigate how we are affected by war and our response to suffering, a la 'Full Metal Jacket'. No, this is pure entertainment with lots of blood, weapons, monsters as well as pretty girls (Denise Richards and Dina Meyer).</fullReview>

While the myopic average viewer may fail to see any qualities in Starship Troopers beyond those typical of the action/science-fiction genre, the film in fact, is an excellent war film. Starship Troopers is likely to attract disdain from both conservatives (for its social attitude) and liberals (for its political attitude). Perhaps both sides can learn something from this film if they approach it with an open mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is Verhoeven a satirist? This movie, like its predecessors Robocop and Total Recall, has elements of satire, but I think it fails because the director won't come off the fence - he's got a big budget to play with, and doesn't want to lose a big audience by testing their intelligence too much (which is a pretty cynical view of audiences but, hey, this is Hollywood). Verhoeven confines his obvious satire to the newsreels (the same technique he used in Robocop). These present the fascistic Federation in the same light as Fifties/Cold War portrayals of the US Government - and perhaps contain the idea that you should not trust what you see on film. But this is as far as his criticism goes. There is no character who puts any kind of forceful point of view against the war or its conduct. This is either very deep satire (in hiding to the point of being invisible) or a cop-out. I'm inclined to the latter view. But if you want to see a bug movie with the usual extras (poor cast, ludicrous script) then this should be high on your list</fullReview>

The boot camp looked like Disney land, compared to a few tents in the middle of a prairie. Going into battle against superior numbers with nothing more than automatic weapons and body armour that doesn't even cover the entire body is pretty ridiculous.I got to say that the tv show comes closer to my view of the book. They brought in the Skinnies, as well as the marauder suits, and full armour.Why couldn't they do a full battle suit movie like the book -- hand flamers, micro nukes from shoulder launchers, etc. That's the way it should have been done. I'd love to see the pod landings as the book described it.They also missed out too much of the psychological aspects and the character development -- boot camp, OCS, etc that the book spent more time on, than the actual battles.Oh well. As an action flick, it's great, but I want to see a full translation of the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is a deceptive and subtle film, and due to this it is extremely misunderstood. Helmed by Paul Verhoeven, the Dutch director responsible for such other balls-to-the-wall action sci-fi classics as Robocop and Total Recall, Starship Troopers is both an intelligent parody of American fears and a take no prisoners, blood and guts war movie.At first, it's easy to see how much in this movie has been changed from it's source material, the book by acclaimed science-fiction author Robert A. Heinlien. It seems to share only a handful of things with the mentioned novel: the title, the names of our hero and several other characters, and the main story arch of Earth going to war with a race of vicious, bug-like alien beasts. But if you look closer, you'll see that the movie is more successful in accomplishing the message of Heinlien's book than the book itself.The movie is set in the future, with no given time or date, and we see a society that is much more conditioned and under control than the world of today. Like most sci-fi Earths of the future, our planet is governed by a single body, a Terran Federation, and everyone on the world falls under their hand. Only military veterans are allowed to become citizens of the Federation, and only these veteran citizens are allowed to vote. Jail is no longer much of a consideration in this future; corporal punishment is the law. Don't worry about paying a 200 dollar fine for drunk driving: about ten lashes at the local whipping post will do the trick. All of this is presented to us by Verhoeven in ingenius propaganda shorts which intercut periodically throughout the movie, detailing every aspect of the world in an indirect and strangely effective manner.Our main story involves a young man named Johnny Rico, his girlfriend Carmen Ibanez, and his buddy Carl Jenkins. After graduated from high school, the three go into the service; Johnny joins the Mobile Infantry, a Marine-like troop of battle-hardened soldiers, Carmen signs up to become a pilot in the Galactic Navy, and Carl goes into Military Intelligence. All three of these characters are good-looking young kids, strapping and confidant, more like Beverly Hills 90210 cast members than rifle-toting grunts. But as we follow Rico through MI Boot Camp, and ride along with what he experiences, we see that these bleached-teeth young 'uns transform from naive, to scared, to blood-thirsty harbringers of destruction.And destruction comes in the form of an attack by a race of hideous insect beings hailing from the far-away world of Klendathu. Now Verhoeven has his chance to send our young friends, hungry for death, into the cold night of unblinking combat. The special effects in these battle sequences are nothing short of amazing, with fantastic CG renderings of looming Federation starships, vicious bug drones, and gigantic beasts which launch nuclear fire from their antennae. These scenes are gory, spectacular, and above all: wicked cool.Starship Troopers is a film which is more complex than meets the eye. The aw-shucks hopefullness of youth, representing mankind in all its glory, taking on and crushing their Godless opposition can't help but call to mind a time when America had such enemies to turn to as Communism and Facism, and the ability to say, "Our boys will take care of you." That idealistic era is a far cry from the United States of today. Our boys aren't fighting, because we have no bugs.I give this film a 9 out of 10, and recommend it to anyone with a love for great sci-fi and intelligent action films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is unique. Great special effects, wonderful action, a bit of humor and an echo of WWII movies. If it was John Wayne fighting the bugs, my parents would recognize it immediately (except maybe for the coed shower scene). A great rental and the DVD version is crisp with a solid soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Could just be me of course, but I didn't see any hidden meanings in Starship Troopers whatsoever. If it was intended to be a satire, I think that they could have chosen better actors, i.e. ones that can actually act?? Unfortunately, I think this is one of those films where they spent 3/4 of the budget on special effects and so had to kind of take whatever they could get actors wise. I guess it could just be that Denise Richards' chest doesn't exactly whip me up into a frenzy... However, the other people I saw it with thought it was gripping and interesting, so if you have an evening free its probably worth watching, just don't expect miracles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have a few minuses but a very good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that I really like that movie and my friends like it too. My reception of this movie can be described by quoting a local movie critic "Cineastes were running around greeting each other with an exclamation "What a movie!"".Then why many people don't like it? Many people think of this movie as of a sci-fi blockbuster. What Paul Verhoeven has made is not exactly sci-fi blockbuster, though it have many action scenes and the lovers of the genre will like it. Verhoeven made an example of "What a propaganda movie could be in some totalitarian future". And from this point the movie is perfect.So what's are the positive things? First what comes in mind is a TV broadcasts, which are showing to us how does this totalitarian future actually looks like. The best way to learn any society culture is to look at their TV broadcasts. It's nice to see that Verhoeven continues and evolves his Robocop feature.You say that acting was bad. Well, actors did played inexperienced some times. But this fits this movie perfectly. The characters are young, self confident and always in a good mood, their emotions are simple. Isn't this the way people should be in a totalitarian future?They know who's their foe is and that the first priority is to serve in army. So there is nothing strange about them seeing how their friends are dying and then smiling after getting promotion - that's the way people should act in a militaristic future.Main characters looks ideal, always have a perfect haircut and a hundred dollar smile. This is how positive characters must look in a propaganda film.Next thing is the plot. I haven't read a book and I can't say how different is the movie plot from the book. But the movie plot is great. It have many story lines, every scene have sense and there is nothing unnecessary. Some of the story lines are very like Soviet propaganda films (eg. three friends apart in the beginning of war and rejoin in the end).Film have many nice and well directed scenes, sometimes you should check what's going on at the back of frame to get a full picture. The picture is sunny and light, houses, nature and environment are all very nice. A ideal picture of a happy future.And of course! A special credits for a Dizzy vs. Rico sex scene, one of the best movie sex scenes I've seen. This pulling a T-shirt over eyes thing can go straight in to the cinematography annals.To conclude a positive things some words on special effects. I liked them not because they were outstanding and qualitative (that's a must have feature of any watchable movie with SFX) but because they were made smart. Arachnids are shown the way you would probably see them and they not doing anything they not suppose to (like people jumping from one building to another). Their interaction with environment is very good. So at some point you forgetting that you watching SFX and starting to believe it.The negative things. Unfortunately this movie have some. Some of the technical moments I don't like: A verbal countdown and a manual course calculating on a hi-tech spaceship. An asteroid flying from other side of the galaxy to us should fly on a VERY high speed, so you would probably not see it. If you did see it but was unable to send message to Earth 'cause of transmitter breakdown, then why nobody else seen it? And why you should send an infantry to fight arachnids when you can drop a bomb on a planet, as Ace was advising? But those are small minuses.Bigger minus is: Every time I watch this movie I get a feeling that something is missing between a moment when Carmen meets Zander on Roger Young and a moment when Rico gets a message from her where she says to him bye. Perhaps there is an explanation to this, I heard that some scenes were cut from the film during editing. Maybe an another version of a movie exists, different from the one I've seen. So Paul, if you ever gonna read this, please send me a note, okay? :)But even with that minuses I still think that the film is excellent. 10 out of 10 for originality. I have seen it for about ten times and I going to watch it and least the same number of times. So " Come on you apes, do you wanna live forever?!".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As has been said in other reviews, you can't take this movie seriously. It is full of terrible acting and cheesy one-liners. And hopefully it was intended to be like this. I really want to see a DVD with a director commentary. Anyhow, this is a very in-depth story of young people who sign up for the military of the future. It is total satire of military politics and World War II propaganda films. Even excessive gore(which should be expected from Paul Verehoven) is humorous in places. I say in-depth because the story follows the flawlessly beautiful plastic teenagers from high school graduation to military enlistment to boot camp and finally to war. Most sci/fi movies would drop a space ship of people on a planet with aliens and watch them all die. This is a smarter, funnier movie than I thought I was going to see. Fans of the Robert Heinlen book say it's really different from the book but as a stand alone movie it is very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the dumbest movie I've ever enjoyed. This movie reminds me of The Fifth Element in two ways. One, it's a good movie that you may not like when you first watch it. And two, the movie is better if not taken seriously.First, let me get the bad things out of the way. The biggest thing is that the acting was really bad. Casper Van Dien (Rico) is probably the worst actor in the entire picture. The plot itself is a little predictable and the quick way in which they are resolved is a little corny. (I also think that the Drill Sargent Zims becoming a private was a useless plotpoint, one you probably won't even catch.)But this movie is still very funny. It is a little bloody, but still enjoyable. The enemy "bugs" are very cool, and the battles scenes in the movie are some of the greatest futuristic battles I've seen. Most of the characters, although badly acted, are still pretty cool. (Especially the ones who survive for a longer time than the others)I'd say go out and rent it when you're in the mood to have some fun. If you're looking for a serious but entertaining sci-fi movie, go see Star Wars or the Matrix instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>subversive genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always appreciated Verhoven for his ability to make riveting, entertaining films that are also provocative social commentary. It is by his penchant for puting a well crafted subtext in genre pictures that appeal to the masses that he is truly subversive, reaching and effecting a large yet unsuspecting audience. Here with Starship Troopers he has made a brilliant parody of the government, the military, social class and society in general which is especially reflected in his representation of the media and technology. The fact that actual nazi propaganda films were used as a model for Starship's structure and look is yet another blaring example of this film's (and Verhoven's) subversive genius. The vision of an overly advanced technological future as well as the cliches of strong jawed heros and sexy heroines, love triangles and male rivalry that are typical soap opera fare are also used to maximum effect to mock modern society. (For another example of the latter check out the brilliant albeit campy b sci-fi pic "The Green Slime"). And what about the fact that this film is presented as a one sided propaganda but we are constantly bomabarded with horrific violence that might make one stop to think about why the bugs attacked to begin with. Lastly I must mention the great device of no opening credits which grab you and pull you in to this reversal of propaganda in disguise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is arguably one of the best science-fiction books ever written. This movie shares three things with the book: 1) the title; 2) the names of the characters; and 3) a battle between humans and aliens. The movie is a monstrous perversion of the book (I hope this doesn't count as a "spoiler"!) which omits the "powered armor" of the book, leaves out all the political philosophy, and turns the society from a quasi-libertarian one in to a fascistic one.There IS one good scene; look for a nude co-ed shower scene; it seems that THIS "Mobile Infantry" is co-ed and features a Joe Haldeman-style fascination with sex among the ranks. Nice T&amp;A. That's it; watch that scene and then return the movie.One thing I found rather odd; the book indicates that Johnny Rico is Filipino. The movie casts the blond-haired, blue-eyed Casper Van Dien in the role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers redefines war. In an ongoing struggle versus the "bugs," Jonny Rico saves the world and his hair does not move the entire movie. It seems to be glued in place . The movie revolves around killin bugs and...um...killing those damn bugs! The movie has many strange features to it like the "super guns" the main characters have, which can mow down rows of the creepy crawlers and the standard issue guns the regular grunts have, which have minimal effect on the insect populace. Our heroes live communist world which resembles a very possible future. They live in South America but they speak perfect English and no Spanish whatsoever. Most of the movie does not make sense or have a "plot," but a movie does not need that to be great. What make this movie great is its amazing amount of violence and occasional sex. The movie is dumb and so stupid its funny, but that is what makes it great. After you see it once you will want to run through your house screaming "C'mon you apes, do ya wanna live forever?!" and "Do you get me soldier?" Read the book, you just may learn something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing satire ... don't let it fool you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What happened to the time when nazis were nazis and commies were commies and you never had to concern yourself with any thought to their humanity? It is a thought that is both nostalgic and very real today. It is a dream for simple ideals. This movie is about these utopian American ideals. In short, I found this movie amazing (... but forget about any book that it is based upon). It is an action movie with great SFX that makes is easy to enjoy on the surface and easy to stereotype, but I feel there is a bit more underneath than it gets credit for. This movie is a satirical extrapolation. It extrapolates on 50's ideals of technology and the role of technology in people's lives. It extrapolates on the 90's unattainable dreams for perfect people and perfect relationships. (What an interesting cast, eh?) It extrapolates on WWII propaganda and the dream for a single-minded government all of its subjects trust. It extrapolates on the perfect democracy where men and women will voluntarily face what we would consider horrific dangers and face them with pride and confidence. A perfectly simple society in the sense that you always know what to expect and you always know who the enemy is.Don't let the obvious cliches and dumb lines fool you ... this movie breaks rules which cause movie buffs to either cringe or scratch their heads. Where other movies will show you how horrible the enemy is by focusing on the characters who are most afraid and who mentally crack (so that you, the viewer, can believe how horrible the enemy is, I suppose), in this movie the one's who crack are a minority who are tossed aside and ignored in a way. Where other movies peg specific characters as especially stupid, or ugly, or weak in order to show that the main characters are smart, beautiful, or strong; this movie instead bombards you with a whole cast who is depicted as smart, beautiful, strong ... and confident. Where other movies use gore to impress dark or graphic images upon the viewer's mind, this movie holds nothing back when it comes to gore but it does not affect the mind because these killing-machine bugs can only tear apart human bodies but they have no effect on the human spirit, pride, and ingenuity. (Gore is only a vehicle for action and SFX.) There are no elements of the dark and sinister here ... this movie is dominated by daylight, well lit rooms, and openness.In my opinion, this movie is all about utopian simplicity. Wouldn't it be great if our society could accept simple relationships with straightforward intentions? (Never turn down a good thing.) Wouldn't it be super if we were all beautiful and comfortable with ourselves? (Shower, anyone?) Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could trust our leaders to teach us the important things we need to know? ("Medic!!!") Wouldn't it be marvelous if we had a single impersonal enemy to unite the human race? ("Kill 'em all!")It is about the simplicity we crave. The real question is, is it fascism we crave too?</fullReview>

A movie housing a handful of young baywatch performers dancing to the BLUR song (WOOOHOOOO), and on top, a whole lot of explosions and lighting in the background. That is exactly what it was, but surprisingly the movie actually had a great feel about it. The manner in which it was presented was a first for me, and the casts (although not presenting oscar winning performances) combined to provide an energetic 2-hours. The storyline was simple but it had to be in order to make this movie work. I ended up watching it a second time and that I do not often do, so I guess it must be one of the better movies I have seen this year....for the pure energy it possessed. The special effects were quite awesome, the mutilated bodies looked very real. The ending wasn't overdone either (one would even say a little surprising). In a way I wish EPISODE-1 of Star wars was more like this movie, the characters meant something and the momentum the movie carried takes me back to the original Star wars trilogy.I call this the STAR WARS of the 90's. If that makes any sense.I expected less and got more and I guess that works in any movies favour, and something low hyped movies can take advantage of.

The visual effects are some of the best I've ever seen, and overall, it is just one cool movie.

		<fullReview>It has no time! Thats the genius about it. The director (or whoever decided this) is clever enough to set no time on the film, so we dont know if it is supposed to happen in 10 years or 200. After 50 years people will maybe watch this film and the time thing wont harm to the story. Havent you experienced watching a movie, lets say 2001, and you find it stupid because, lets face it: The year 2000 is right around the next corner and there is no one living on mars or the moon or whatever. Another big quality is that a lot of people die. Im not saying I want to see people die, bear with me here. Im meaning that its realistic in a way. A lot of the people introduced in the story die, which is statistically correct. If 1000 people die in a battle, some of the people you are fighting with must die. I also like the irony throughout the film (the cow and the murderer), and all the trivial things you dont notice until the 5th time you watch. All the actors do a good job, save one. Somehow I find the character played by Denise Richards (Carmen Ibanez) not realistic, and "Carmen" is a sentimental whimpering nausea, when she ought to be the exact opposite.Well, but thats just me i guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great sci-fi war film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. When I first saw the trailer I couldn't wait to see it. Sure, we must put aside our logic to enjoy it, however, it is not just a sci-fi B-movie gorefest. The movie is significant. It is very close to the films we made during WWII, that glorified war, and dehumanized the enemy (this time, they REALLY dehumanize the enemy!) I guess that the main point (what is said on the DVD director's commentary, anyway) is that war makes fascists out of everyone. It has many cliche's of the old films; the heroic, disillusioned young boy who learns to fight after he loses it all (BA destroyed, Pearl Harbor-like), the cowardly pencil-pushing General, the bullying drill sergeant, the red-neck recruit, the courageous soldier who dies gloriously in battle, and of course, the attitude towards the enemy--"Kill 'em all!"The special effects are awesome, and the production design is fantastic. Everything is very sleek and utopian looking, from the uniforms and starships, to Johnny Rico's home and school. The bugs are creative and scary looking.The movie's shortcomings... well, the obvious. Why are their guns so ineffective? Why didn't they just firebomb the bugs in the first place? What do the bugs eat? Forget about these questions. I think the real reason I liked the movie so much is because it appealed to the ten year old kid inside of me. If you know what you're getting into, you'll probably like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Put a grin on my face</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with The Fifth Element, the best sci-fi action film of 1997. Although the two are quite different, they do have a couple of things in common. I don't really see either as true sci-fi, basically as action films with sci-fi trappings, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Another similarity is that if neither of these films puts a big ol' grin on your face, you're taking life way too seriously. I liked Alien: Resurrection too, but I see it as being in a different category. More European directors should do sci-fi movies.For this film, Verhoeven re-teams with several people involved with the brilliant Reagan-era satire Robocop: writer Edward Neumeier, composer Basil Poledouris, director of photography Jost Vacano, and special effects supervisor Phil Tippett.Whereas The Fifth Element presents us with a really wild, colorful future out of a French comic book, Starship Troopers is set in a kind of futurized 1950s world. This film is basically a futuristic WWII or cavalry film with spaceships and giant bugs, and with definate nods to propoganda films, particularly those of Leni Riefenstahl. Some people might wonder why weapons technology in the future hasn't evolved that much from the 20th century, but I think that's appropriate to this film. The film is set in a gleefuly fascistic world, with beautiful young people with shiny white teeth going off to battle the godless bug (read: commie) hordes; and newsreels delivering the worst news in a snappy, entertaining matter. The story is only loosely based on the novel by Robert Heinlein (which I haven't read in ages), but I like what Verhoeven and Neumeier did with it. The sweeping battle scenes are sure to make any enthusiast of battlefield films drool, the feeling created in these scenes is very reminiscent of Zulu Dawn, with a small group of defenders being overrun by a massive horde.I find the film to be much smarter and more subversive than most people give it credit for. Of course, the fact that it's also fine entertainment doesn't hurt anything either.</fullReview>

This is absolutely one of the worst flicks I have ever seen, using the biggest, smelliest cliches ever put in movies!There was barely any plot, just holes big enough to lug asteroids through. But Perfect Teenage Beverley Hill billies taking on... GIANT INSECTS?? I hoped the characters would all be eaten by the giant cockroaches, they were that forgettable. The insects had far more C.G.I - created charisma than all the characters put together! Take for example the girl who flew that giant ship. She was severely miscast as a starship pilot, she was more suitable being a cheerleader. This whole flick reeked of one bad cliche after another. For example: Boot camp. Boot booted. Booted by the Bugs. Booted by the ex girlfriend (who bares her breasts for no significant reason what so ever). Boots.But scenes of human teen soldier grunts running around like headless chickens, firing those puny little guns at 20 foot tall cranes on multiple legs? And what about the ships above the planet? Clustered together like that and getting wasted by... insects? So much for our 'superior intelligence'!!! CONCLUSION: This movie relied heavily on (sigh) C.G.I and complete blood splattered gore. If these are the things you love to watch the most, then by all means, watch this!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know there's a debate over whether Paul Verhoeven is satirizing war films or endorsing the film's depiction of a fascist world order. In fact, the director has crafted a faithful, even rousing, adaptation of Robert Heinlein's novel and viewpoints. The only way mankind can survive such a ghastly demise, Heinlein argued, is with a citizenry that earns its rights by placing its life on the line. After all, the "bugs" know nothing about democracy. The film's failing is using a cast of fresh-faced neophytes who lack the weight needed to pull this off. Denise Richards is especially weak as the heroic fly-girl. Nonetheless, the battles scenes and special-effect arachnids are spectacular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS COMPLETES THE TRILOGY...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What started out with ROBOCOP in '87, continued with TOTAL RECALL in '90, culminates with STARSHIP TROOPERS in 1997. This completes the trilogy of Paul Verhoeven's visionary futuristic sci-fi epics which include extreme graphic violence and dazzling special FX. All three films seem to give a fantasy tale that is not only fiction but believable as reality of the future. STARSHIP TROOPERS gives us a new look at the future, what was once law-enforcement of the future &amp; vacations of the future is now the future under full-scale war. Like some kind of wacky cross between STAR WARS &amp; SAVING PRIVATE RYAN it will definitely keep you glued to the screen. The film uses a hilarious recruitment advertisement as its overall theme which is backed up by nonstop battles &amp; carnage.A great deal of unexpected twists and deaths will keep you guessing all the way through. Overall, its an intense, bloody, and unique look at war(the bugs are only a metaphor). A truly excellent piece of sci-fi cinema from one of our more unique directors, who along with Cronenberg &amp; Gilliam are the best pioneers of contemporary science fiction. In conclusion, if the gore turns you off don't turn off the movie, stick with it, there's a lot of other elements here such as drama, relationships, and above all: courage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After I'd finished watching this film I was stunned. I thought I was going to be treated to a special effects bonanza and nothing else, but I was never so happy to be wrong. And before everybody starts to shout, yes it is dependent upon the effects, but there is a lot more in there as well.From the outset of this film there is a certain amount of "tongue in cheek" about it. The film-makers have realised that they can't make the film to serious and as a result do something a bit different.They make fun of certain aspects of the film, especially the military of todays society and their particularly "gun ho" attitudes. The film makes you think about the social structures of todays society when it comes to war (you may not like to admit it to yourself but it does), and it mixes all of this in with subtle humour that keeps you amused throughout.The above block of text gives off the impression of a boring movie, but there is a lot of action. Oh yes, theres a whole load of action. There is never much time to dwell on what has just gone on because you have to pay attention to the next attack from the bugs etc. There is never a dull moment throughout the film, its great.Sadly though, there is your bog standard smelly lump of Hollywood cheese. The typical c****y romance lines are there and it kind of lets the film down a bit.This is not one of the greatest films that has ever been produced, but it is definately worth watching. You can switch off and relax, you don't have to study every single line that gets spoken, or feel as though you have to guess who done it and how, which is no bad thing from time to time.I think everyone who watches this movie will enjoy it, but if you don't then don't blame me.</fullReview>

The writers took a Hugo winning novel and turned it into an insipid, inconsistent and incoherent pile of drek. The actors were cardboard, the cast looked like rejects from 90210, and the special effects looked like a joint effort from Dave Cronenberg and Nickelodian.The best that can be said for the movie is that it was an *intentional* parody of the novel and the concepts of patriotism, courage and valor. I'm not surprised to hear that Ginny Heinlein sued to have her husband's name removed from the title and credits. A film that leaves a film - well deserving of the MST treatment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is an adaptation from Robert Heinlein's novel, Starship Troopers, but you wouldn't have noticed by the direction the movie had taken. I had heard that they enlisted the aid of a military specialist to authenticate the technical aspects of the movie. They probably didn't pay him enough. Starship Troopers is an incredibly stupid, horrid, and worthless movie. It doesn't even belong on cellulose, so great is its suckyness (I had to go into the Sick Boy dictionary to explain the horridness of this movie). While it was a satire of glamourized war films and such, it wasn't smart; a category in which most satires attempt to achieve. This movie was mostly visual eye-candy (Denise Williams, Dina Meyers and the bugs)Yes I've heard the arguments, and yes I've seen the movie. But how can anyone notice that this movie was a smart satire if all its attention was on the special effects? There was too much gore than necessary to relay the point or poke fun at war movies; there was unnecessary nudity (I like Dina Meyers although) which seemed to do nothing but excite the hormones of young teenage boys in the audience; and well, it seemed to weak to prove anything except that this movie needs work. And well I wonder if ole Robert wanted his story to be seen this way. I'll give it a few points though for trying to be a satire -but you couldn't pay me enough to think that it was a good movie (I may say it, but I won't believe it).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starship Troopers, the movie, a monstrous parody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1959, Robert Heinlein published a reminder of the responsibilities and duties of the citizen to the state. Heinlein always had the view that the highest achievements of the human mind were the twin concepts of 'loyalty' and 'duty', and that when those concepts fell into disrepute, the society so affected was doomed.Hence, Starship Troopers, a book still condemned for its warlike theme by people who completely miss Heinlein's point that a free state retains its freedom and strength only through the willingness of its citizens to exercise their duty.When I heard that Paul Verhoeven was going to make a film of the book, my initial reaction was of misgiving as his previous works had been long on special effects and short on just about everything else.Starship Troopers, the movie, confirmed my worst fears. Verhoeven took a story with a message and reduced it to the lowest possible common denominator, then fleshed out the skeletal remains with overpowering special effects, uniforms reminiscent of Nazi Germany, and a revolting gung-ho jingoism so common in American World War 2 movies. I kept expecting John Wayne or Audie Murphy to walk on.The original message - that of the duties of the citizen - barely received lip-service as the storyline progressed from one incompetently-managed battle to another on, or in orbit around, what looked at ground level to be the same desert world.Having been a reader of Heinlein for more than half my life, and having grasped some notion of how his mind worked, I can see why he refused to let any of his books be turned into films while he was alive. Starship Troopers, the movie, is a monstrous parody of the original; utterly lacking in imagination and with acting vile beyond belief. The beautiful young people in the lead cast showed with every word and action that they had graduated with honours from the Academy of American Soap Opera, class of Beverly Hills 90210.Perhaps I expected too much. Films adapted from books rarely accurately match the originals, but, with a little more effort, Verhoeven could have made a movie that was a credit to the original. Instead, he took the soft option.As I left the theatre, I was consoled by the hope that in five years time, this awful film would be as utterly forgotten as Independence Day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An astonishingly audacious dystopian-satire-meets-blockbuster from Verhoeven - after 'Robocop', you'd have thought he wouldn't be allowed to get away with it twice. It would appear to be a calculated and thoroughgoing demolition job on its source, Robert Heinlein's repugnant novel, yet, as in Robocop, the corrosive satire never gets in the way of testosterone-fuelled action and state of the art special effects. (The effects certainly showed up the relatively mediocre efforts of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace; in Troopers you only know the bugs and dismantled humans are computer graphics because they just have to be.)While you're watching the film it's safe to leave the brain in neutral and the heart in overdrive. Afterwards, you can reconstruct something of a backstory: human space colonisation has disturbed the environment of an arachnid species and brought on itself massive retribution (the game is given away in one of the tv broadcasts). Meanwhile, a military coup of sorts, allied with total government control of the media, has transformed America's sphere of influence into a politically stable but dictatorial oligarchy. Since Rico is repeatedly referred to as a 'rich kid', it's clear that economic inequities remain as strong as ever. Indeed, while the Mobile Infantry are regarded as a disposable resource, they are still far superior to civilians in that they have a prospect of citizenship if they happen not to get slaughtered. The mass of the population is entirely disenfranchised and disregarded. The film, taking its cue from the interactive TV broadcasts that frame it, chooses to disregard them too.More significantly still, American culture has become global culture: from Geneva to Buenos Aires, only North American voices exist. (Verhoeven, as a European in Hollywood, can hardly have meant this tribute to Hollywood's global domination innocently.) At every level of the film, powerful forces work towards the complete homogenization of human culture. The result of course is that apart from looks, humans and bugs have become virtually indistinguishable by the end of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick SFX, clever film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Verhoeven is clever. And so is Starship Troopers. It's a calculatingly concocted commercial movie that gives its audiences a choice of a number of reasons to love it.First for sheer brilliance of SFX, which are outstanding, though by the end of the film you're almost suffered SFX overkill. This will get the typical sci-fi teen's juices flowing though.Second for basic soap opera story line. There are no characters or characterisation, and little plot - what's there is comic strip stuff, but there's plastically pretty actors and actresses doing their thing.Finally to give the pseudo-intellectuals among us a reason to watch and explain why we enjoyed the film, there's the socio-political satire angle - get a grip, people. This is laid on with a trowel. It's not subtle, it's not clever, but yes yes yes of course it's there. The fascist state, the nature of propaganda, xenophobia, the futility of war - Verhoeven has been careful and clever enough to sprinkle them all in too.So the film's a surefire recipe for earning megabucks, and that's the sole reason it was created - no shame there, but don't for one second think it has anything genuine and meaningful to say. Just kick back and enjoy it on the most superficial level. I suppose the only people who won't like it are dyed in the wool members of the United Reformed Church of Heinlein - guys, get a life.

		<fullReview>There are three big problems with this movie; firstly that it's vaguely based on Heinlein's novel, enough that parts are recognizable, but changed so much that it can't help but alienate those who love the book. Secondly, that most people don't realise that it's a comedy, even though the acting, casting and dialog are so blatantly stupid that only an idiot could have made it as a serious movie (and for all his faults, Verhoven is certainly not an idiot). And finally, that most people seem to think it's SF.Starship Troopers is an immensely amusing satire on the "give me that joystick, war is cool!" Sega generation, and the modern media's absurdly fascist pro-government propaganda, from the Web-like 'click here to sign up and kill' enlistment ads to the good guys in uniforms obviously based on the Nazis. That so many people don't get it just goes to show how far down the fascist trail Western society has gone. The enemy is not the bugs, the enemy is us.The most subversive Hollywood movie since 'Natural Born Killers'; I love it.</fullReview>

Cleverly conceived, and well executed, the movie makes good (if also overdone) statements about fascism. Then of course it also justs kicks butt in an action sense, while also quoting great war movie cliches from cowboys-Indians to Vietnam, and making them seem untired again.

		<shortDescription>Absolutely brilliant parody of the propaganda film and Heinlen's fascist "utopia".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film surprised me by being one of the best films I had seen in a long time. Reading the reviews here, many people have obviously failed to notice that the movie wasn't serious. We have overly beautiful and incredibly cheesy actors bravely giving it to the numerous and intensely evil bug hordes. Exactly like in any propaganda movie you are likely to watch. The actors were absolutely perfect for their roles.In my opinion this was one of the cleverest movies I have seen in a while. All the more clever in that so many people have missed the not-so-subtle parody of war propaganda, and brilliant interpretation of Heinlen's utopic world which is nothing more than a complete fascist state.Not to mention the Special FX. And the cow, oh how amusing that was. Not to be missed in my opinion although be warned. If you are planning to see a faithful recreation of Heinlen's books you won't. You'll see something so so much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beeing a huge SF-fan, Starship Troopers provided all my need from a great motion picture. Superb special FX, nifty storyline and an OK casting. To get to the point. The film has all it takes to be one of the greatest among the SF-gengre motions pictures. And as we are still waiting (hoping) for Starship Trooper II (hoping) I highly recomend you to read the book. A lot of things is changed in the movie, but they got the right feel from the book. My 2 cent</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nineties Audience Doesn't Get It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Paul Verhoeven has gotten away with a great prank. And he meant to. Growing up in Nazi occupied "Fortress Europe," Verhoeven was impressed by the glittering uniforms of the Third Reich and their lackeys. Of course Verhoeven had an excuse. He was a child.Today in the nineties however, Verhoeven hasn't forgotten the naive allure of the fascist tunic. Using Robert Heinlein's, fifties era science fiction vehicle, "Starship Troopers," which on its own account is replete with fascist references, Verhoeven plays the modern audience for the idiots they are.I've read reviews by professionals who decry this film as pro-fascist dogma. Its no wonder. Modern day viewers only recognize fascism when it is pre-introduced with the obligatory, "fascism is bad" warning, followed by fascism's defeat and glowing oratory confirming its malevolence. DUH! When the dummies don't see these elements, they determine the film must be pro-fascist.The gist of the film was to provoke a little thought on what type of society we had become in order to defeat the bugs. This wasn't a B-Movie, "hey we kick ass" film. I get the meaning Paul. Its too bad the ideologically challenged audiences, do not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I can say about this movie is that is just perfect. I haven't watched the new star wars series yet, but I have never EVER seen such a perfect actor play, visual and sound effects, and best of all, plot. The scenes with the aliens and spacecraft were so good that you'd thought these were actually shot in real world, not done by computer. The action gets you from the beginning and keeps you glued to the seat just about to the end of the movie. It is so perfectly mixed with the love story in the movie and with the horror of war that it creates an increasingly real and catchy atmosphere. As the plot unfolds you couldn't say what will happen next and it was so thrilling. The actors - these beautiful girls and boys acted so good too. In many of the moments of the movie they were put in a desperate situation, where only quick response, hard fighting amd not losing hope saved their lives. You definitely should go to see this movie. Don't miss it!Rating: 10 of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I enjoyed it, but it's not like the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie purely as an action, special f/x and gore-fest. However, besides the title there are about 2 main things this movie has in common with the book "Starship Troopers" by Robert A. Heinlein: the names of some of the characters, and the fact that it's about a war with the Bugs.The book is primarily about the development of Johnnie Rico; the movie is mostly action. Obviously, to make an entertaining action movie, some of the character development must be traded for battle sequences, but regardless of this the movie fails to agree with the book on several major points. To point out all the discrepancies would take hours, but the glaring and unnecessary ones are:* In the book, the M.I. (Mobile Infantry) are serious ass-kickers with powered armor, they drop in capsules, and they usually lay waste to the bugs with few casualties. This is the aspect where the movie lacked most. In the movie, they're more like a bunch of sheep being led to the slaughter.* In the book, Carmen Ibanez is not Johnnie Rico's girlfriend (they're just friends), she's not the reason he joins the M.I., and there is also no competition for her affection. I think the idea behind her role in the film was that if you have someone as beautiful as Denise Richards to play Carmen Ibanez, you have to make her part in the story bigger. She also doesn't crash-land into bug territory at the end where she is saved by Rico, as in the movie. It would have been more true to the book to omit her part from the movie entirely.* In the book, Carl does join military intelligence, but for electronics, not game strategy. And he isn't telepathic, and doesn't give Rico any insight about how to rescue Carmen either; rather he is killed before being commissioned.* In the book, Dizzy Flores is a guy, not a beautiful woman pining for Rico's affection (I guess this would put a pretty big dent in Dina Meyer's part in the movie as well). In the book, nobody ever "has" Rico; the book has no sex at all. Wake up, Hollywood! The most that happens is that Carmen takes Johnnie on a single date while he is in O.C.S. The fact that Rico goes through O.C.S. to become an officer is completely omitted from the movie.* In the book, retired Colonel DuBois was Johnnie's teacher of History and Moral Philosophy, not Lt. Rasczak.* In the movie, both of Rico's parents are killed on Buenos Aires. In the book, Rico believes both of his parents are killed, but in fact only his mother is killed on Buenos Aires. His father actually joins the M.I. and is assigned to the "Roughnecks" where he reunites with Johnnie before he ultimately reunites with his son.I think this is a good movie for the action genre, but it could have followed the book much more closely without losing anything. Rather, I think it would have gained more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, that about sums it up. The acting in this film is not very good, but it's not the worst I've seen. Casper Van Dien is the one who has most problems with his role, Dina Meyer made an Ok job, but Denise Richards made a good job. I don't quite know what I like about her, but she's got something the others hasn't. The film itself is about the world in a distant future where our worst enemy is killer-bugs, and our best weapon a bunch of bugbashing forces. I mean, the scriptwriter must have smoked some grass when he wrote script. I like the idea of boys and girls showering together though, but I don't think that will happen. The news that comes up quite often is brilliant. really cool with this "Do you want to know more?" s**t always coming up in the end. As you probably have understood I don't think it's a good, but I do think it's an entertaining one. Actually I kinda liked it. A 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Verhoeven is a genius, and he loves to make blockbuster. In 1986, with Robocop, he offered to us a great critic of the American society. With Starship troopers, he did it again, with the same team (same composer, same screenwriter, same special effects crew,.....). And the movie is a great movie, a 2nd degree story with some Barbie and some G.I.Joe who made the war by obligation, not by ideology. A great moment of action, a great party of reflection.</fullReview>

When a friend told me to watch this, I expected a campy sci-fi flick, then I saw "A Paul Verhoeven film" and remembered the gory (and awesome) Robocop. This movie had bad acting, mindless action, gore, and cool special effects. I got more story than I bargained for, but a little more character development couldn't have hurt, as well as a better cast. The only character I liked was Jake Busey's, cause that guy kicks. And then there was babe Denise Richards (why wasn't she in the shower scene? Damn...) who may be a babe, but she can't act... Overall, this movie was what it pretended to be: FUN. If you try to see past that, you'll get lost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[Editors note: BEWARE, THIS COMMENT CONTAINS SPOILERS]OK I realise this is meant to be a satire of sorts but satires are supposed to be intelligent. This was one of the dumbest movies I've seen for years, unless it was a fiendishly clever p*ss take of the Beverly Hills 90210 fans in the audience.1. Near the beginning Carmen is flying her little spaceship at the limits of human skill *inside* a bigger ship, yet she's only a novice pilot. You'd have thought this would require at least some concentration yet all the actress can portray is a vacant grin.2. Why is the fleet always crammed together like sardines? So much so that they seem to crash into each other whenever something unexpected happens. This is outer space y'know. There's *lots* of room out there.3. The troopers spend ammo like popcorn seeming to never run out until the going gets *really* tough. Then someone says "Make every round count". Are you kidding me?4. Hollywood pretty boys and girls trying to convince us that they're tough hombres/hombre-esses and not airheads. No sale.5. Superior medicine seems to cure all at the beginning, but the captain asks to be killed near the end because his legs have been cut off. Hey what's the problem?6. Carmen's had her chest skewered by a bug. Not only does she remain conscious and alert. But when the bug withdraws its talon she just carries on as though nothing has happened. Hey babe, you've lost a lung and probably had your aorta pierced, but you've got more energy than *I* have.On the plus side, at least the film kept my attention and I watched it right to the end. The special effects were good, if repetitive. But why, oh why, use that cast? They were crap, Clancy Brown and Michael Ironside apart. They always give good value. You felt they were aware of the basic sillyness of the script. If only the same could be said for the younger cast members. They played it absolutely stony-faced straight. Dina Mayer and Jake Busey were not bad though. Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards should be fed to the brain bug. We might win then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to the theater one night to check this film out not knowing what to expect. Paul Verhoeven had made some pretty cool sci-fi pictures before and I wanted to see his latest one right away. When the movie started I was blown away, the film resembled Robocop in it's presentation, but this was not Robocop. This movie championed war, the whole of society in this film seems to be fascist. War to these people is the answer to everything. The film, like most of Verhoeven's work, doesn't hold back on the violence. The special effects are pretty amazing. Verhoeven has filled this film with attractive, young people. Most of the older people in the film are scarred or handicapped. This is a reflection of a war torn society, they may be young and beautiful when they go into the military, but eventually they are scarred and hollow portraits of their former selves. Verhoeven should stay away from erotic thrillers and stick to science fiction, his strength is there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gotta see it to believe it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER WARNING! Some of this goes into plot details and what happened in the movie.FOREWARNED!Never read the book. No doubt the film has little in common. It seems trendy to note the tacked on 'Nazi-like' regalia. I think it barely registers in the movie. Symbol's just a symbol, save to trendy movie critics, I guess. What I saw was basically a vehicle for assorted 90210 and Melrose Place stars/starlets to make their big movie debut, or pad the resume. That was coupled with a very ambitious group of f/x people, making the thing seem almost like two parallel movies, crammed into one.Dina Meyer, a 90210 type, who just got the new Secret Agent Man tv series, actually was compelling and interesting. But her role, like the rest, was poorly considered and mostly just cliched. Clancy Brown, psycho bad guy character actor from various other films, tried his best with career drill Sargeant, Zim. But the writing was phoned in, even if his performance wasn't. Same for the Michael Ironside character. Good actor. Bad dialog.It's when they get to the bug fights where we have infantry sent in with what seem to be glorified side arms, facing off against 12-14 foot tall, gigantic monster insects, every limb and both of their jaws shaped like a sharp steel spike, which they can flick out and impale a soldier in the blink of an eye, or use their jaws to snap him in half, and so on, and these soldiers, I guess to show bravery, run up within feet of these lightning quick killer monster insects and start firing, hoping the bug will fall down at least before they empty the entire clip. Gads! Give 'em Ninja swords and see if they wouldn't do better! Or else try a little body armor, some actual futuristic weaponry, and a touch of sensible battlefield maneuver . . but, hey.Really, what's going on is that the writer and director are desperate to even the odds. But they go to ridiculous extremes to do so. The soldiers have to be placed in harm's way, even in mortal danger. Gotta see bravery at work (Johnny riding the back of the gigantic 'tanker' beetle, dropping in a grenade - and how a big an underground tunnel did THAT monster need to 'sneak' up behind the soldiers?). You don't get that by doing the sensible thing - namely nuking the bugs not merely in the tunnels or nests, but out in the open clustered together, as well (which you see done only once in the movie). You don't get that by giving the soldiers ray guns, whatever. Cause it's just a 'bug hunt' otherwise, not so much riskier than any exterminator at work (which is basically how the movie sort of ends, even so - it's inevitable).It's the same for the giant 'artillery'. You've got these huge bugs, the size of a small mountain, and which shoot balls of blue plasma out their butts, basically, hard enough to reach escape velocity and travel into outer space. Apparently this has two uses. Accurately target federation troop carriers, hovering far above the planet, and cut them in half. And push asteroids not merely out of orbit, but on a perfect trajectory for earth, light years away (that's light years). It boggles . . I mean, if nothing else, what the HECK do those mountain sized bugs eat every day? especially on the barren, rocky planets that made up the sets. I'm thinking a forest a day. But where's the forest?Ulimately - why the big farting bugs? They're key. It's not just a routine and one-sided extermination, for one thing. But beyond 'bombaring' earth and staring the 'war', such 'artillery' lets the writer and director show casualities and wartime destruction. Cruisers bump into each other, obv. in way too tight a formation. Hundred, thousands, are lost as the space ships break up and blow up. Those returning to base are all shot up, as well, with gashes in the hull, fires on board, and so on. It looked like they were in a war, or something. If only someone were to remind the 'fleet' that it got shot up by big blue bug farts, which could have been trivially eliminated by preemptive air strike!Good film, though. You CAN find things you missed the first time, on repeat viewing. The woman who tries to desert, getting dragged off by a killer bug, and the battle fatigued general getting impaled by a wounded flying bug, as Gary Busey's son (and there's no mistaking him for anything else) gives sort of wry smile. Who's on who's side, anyway?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Take It All Too Seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read so much on the making of STARSHIP TROOPERS before it even came out and the makers I qoute the writer from a magazine "No, this is not a serious sf movie". He said that before it was released, not after. A point could be made if the makers had said it was not meant to be taken serious after it was released as being a last minute cover up for a failure to actually make a serious movie. However, since they said it before it was released before it was even finished, you can definitely take their word on it that it was not meant to be takens seriously. If you read the definition of the word "satire", you will see this movie is just that. It takes a fascist society, part of our society and culture and exaggerates it. If you look at those old propaganda commercials of the former Nazi Germany and compare them to the ones used here, you will that the ones used in this movie are taken even further with a light heartedness missing from the original nazi germany commercials. I remember that back in 1941, the germans had the option to put into action the Me 262 fighter jet, instead of the Me109 but instead Hitler went with the Me 109. If Germany had used the Me 262 instead, they could taken out most of our bombers before we would have been able to catch up with their technology. I feel this mistake the Germans made can be found in the movie. They have such elaborate space vessels that can travel at light speeds, weapons able to destroy the bug boulders but instead of just using this against the bugs, they send in ground troops. The germans as well as in any fascist society puts all of it emphasis on the military state and anyone who is not part of the military is looked down upon. That is taken to extreme in this film as well. Everyone who is not a civilian is gung ho about the war but it is all presented in the same manner Leslie Nielsen said funny lines with a straight, serious face to achieve a comical touch and the same is applied here. Now listen to a lot of people in our country, especially right-wingers and listen how they condone the death penality and seem to take much pleasure in actually watching a man be murdered by the state. In the movie, there is a internet commercial that announces you can watch a live execution on TV of a condemmed prisoner. I know so many right-wingers in this country would love that right on their Television screen. You notice we don't have that in our country but the movie takes the attitude of a lot of these right-wingers and takes it to the next level with a live television broadcast execution. We have something close but not yet, just the option to watch an execution. Then there is the bugs, who have no personality or any distinguished features, just a desire to kill anything in their way. Well during World War II the masses in our country thought Hitler and the germans, the Japanese ect were monsters with no personality. Our soldiers treated them like they were bugs and we thought they were just something equal to bugs, just ask the innocent women of those countries that our soldiers took pleasure in putting in trucks and well you know....don't need to mention it. Well, in this movie the soldiers do the exact same thing with the bugs and just want to kill them all without thinking twice about it. I feel the bugs are an exaggeration representing the attitude our country has taken towards its enemies in previous wars. Just examine the attitudes we had towards the communists during the 50s, 60s, 70s and even 80s. Shoot some of us still have those attitudes, that they were evil and monsters. President Reagan flat out called The Soviet Union "the evil empire". I rest my case. The characters in the movie don't even question the bugs motives, they just go and kill them. We did the same thing after the japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, we just wanted to go in and get them and we did. We bombed a lot of their children in Nagasaki and Hiroshima to kingdom come and a lot of us still don't think twice about it, especially the right wingers. The boot camp sequence is the best example in the movie, however, of its being a satire. The marine corps drill instructors have been known to punch and humiliate their recruits, for their own good no less and in the movie they go the extreme. They not only hit them but break their arms, throw knives at their hands and give them public lashings! Our military has never gone that far but it has come close, again the movie takes it to the next step. Of some historical note, Fascist Italy of World War II was started and controlled by veterans of World War I and other wars. They fought bravely and sweated it out. They then decided to create a country and they looked down on anyone who had not fought as soldiers, the same thing as well as in the book apply to this movie. However, the movie has the entire world taken over by former veterans of war. I highly recommend this film because of the satiralnature behind it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starship Super!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following a cast of unnaturally beautiful people from high school to intergalactic war, the whole film is presented like a hi-tech pathe newsreel - full of sparkling white teeth and perfect haircuts all fighting the good fight against the seemingly vicious and 'offensive' bugs. Couple this with the fact that the movie is wrapped around a TV like broadcast (a la Robocop) and you realise Paul Verhoeven is being a bit clever with his action movies again.For not only does Starship Troopers work very well as a sci-fi action movie, but if you spot it's satirical subtext early on you will find even more to enjoy beyond sexy people doing damage to sexy CG effects. Only once is it blatantly suggested that the bugs are acting in self-defence, and that man is the real monster here. This is kind of easy to miss, especially as it comes during a long lull in the movie - but later on only a moron could fail to notice the gestapo like costumes the military intelligence staff wear. The stars of the show are undoubtedly the Bugs themselves, and boy these guys are really impressive, their speed, their sheer overwhelming number, and lethal design make these the most obviously dangerous creatures since a man called Giger worked on a film called Alien. And it's when the battles twixt man and bug start the effects really get moving. Limbs fly across the screen, people are picked up and tossed around like rag dolls, it's all pretty gory stuff but you can't help be impressed how throwaway these elements are - in any other movie such splatter would be considered a major set piece. The ferocious Whiskey Outpost battle is just tremendously exciting as is Rico's ride on one of the larger bug brothers. Oh, and most of it's done in daylight too so you can pretty much see everything that's going on - no use of the dark to hide holes in the FX or as cheap suspense device here.As for the human cast, well they're mostly cardboard cutouts, albeit very pretty ones, but their uncomplicated nature fits in nicely with the films agenda - most fascists are pretty shallow anyway. Michael Ironside does a good turn as an extremely pragmatic 'been there, done that' Mobile Infantry officer, who is completely devoid of any humanity. Clancy Brown takes the stereotypical drill instructor role, who after beating the crap out of his recruits at least has the decency to call for medical assistance afterwards. Bog standard A-B acting from everyone else though - and I found Denise Richards intensely annoying here, she spends practically the entire movie with a stupid grin on her face.So there you go - 10 minutes too long, incredible effects, very gory, very exciting, great subtext, stupid face from Denise Richards. Go see the film, and then read the (even better) book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three layers of fun inside</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On first sight, it's just a simple brainless action flick with nice effects and (some breathtaking) animations.Brainless is the keyword to the second layer of fun here: try and find all the quotes and side blows to almost every movie or series with the slightest hint of fascism, from Soaps to ST Voyager. Starship Troopers takes those quotes and blows them up to a bizarre format, making a carpet of bubbles of the well-known clichs.Bubbles and soap are the keys to the third layer of fun: have a look at the actors, their filmography, and the screamingly funny way the characters develop, or rather, don't. Apart from Michael Ironside, who - nicely fitting the role - probably understood very well what was going on, most of the actors seem like they actually live it. Starting with the soaps they are used to, they go so plain with the story you'll have a hard time telling whether it is genius or stupidity which allows them to act this naturally.I think this is an incredibly funny movie. And it certainly has its artistical and political message which, like with most of Verhoevens works, often isn't seen because it is concealed by the warping mirror Verhoeven wants us to look into.It's about media, manipulation, and how war changes people at large. It's about fascism and racism and not lifting the index but the middle finger here. It's about its audience and it's poking fun right at you. Have fun.Now which of both depicted species were the mindless insects?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not for the special effects (it relied on it as the peg to keep you in) but the dialogue! It makes Akiva Goldsman's screenplays look like Steven Speilbergian works of art. The characters were obviously not too bright anyway, but couldn't they at least sound just a little older than middle school age? Not only was the dialogue a letdown, but also the film's patriotic sentiment. They can't just end it after all the bugs are destroyed with the credits and not show the entire cast jumping up like a bunch of primates hugging each other?The special effects were withstanding, the entire movie was not, and could use some touch up from Tom Servo, Crow, and Mike.</fullReview>

It was not a glorification of fascism or brutality, it was a call against both and shows how tight the line is between patriotism and fascism. Perhaps some of you criticizing the movie so harshly should compare its storyline to the not-so-long-ago McCarthy era: the bad are always on the other side, they eat children and we are the best and the brightest, what we do is only for a good cause. Just think about how the alien was tortured at the end...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out of all of the Sci-Fi war films this has to have the best special effects and some of the death scenes are great (particularly the flying bugs). Once it gets going, the film is a really good Sci-Fi action flick, however there some draw backs....... For half of the film you have to sit through a boring Beverly Hills 90210 style act which sees the crystal-clean characters go from high school to the Full Metal Jacket boot camp (not a pretty site, I can assure you!) I thought they'd put the wrong film on at the cinema, it appeared to have been mistaken with Clueless... Despite the disappointing start the film really got going and although it had a dodgy 'American Dream' style ending (sick bags on standby) this film really is worth seeing, honestly...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Starship Troopers" is aimed right at the junior high male set. I wouldn't have seen it, but I was taking my son &amp; his pal to the movies and, they chose this over "Eve's Bayou" and "Washington Square". Quel surprise! They loved it. What's not to love? It's got everything the male adolescent mind needs: space ships / giant, brain-sucking, limb-severing bugs / a coed shower scene / military training with live ammo / &amp;c. However, anyone over the age of 19 will notice that the 'acting' is done primarily by magazine-cover hunks and babes who flunked the screen test for 'Baywatch', and that the dialogue seems to be by the writers for that show. As a matter of fact the whole first half of the flick (i.e., prior to the attack on the bugs) might be called "Bay Watch goes Intergalactic"; instead of lifeguards we have space troops in training. This flick makes the average Schwarzenneger extravaganza look like "The English Patient" by comparison. So many reviewers are so taken with the post-modern, Neo-Nazi implications of the flick that they seem to overlook the fact that no one in it can act, and even if they could, the ridiculous dialogue can't be made to work. If you have a penchant for seeing giant insects blown up, or perhaps a campy interest in gong-show quality acting, by all means see it. Otherwise, skip this dog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not at all like the book, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that the original novel by Robert A. Heinlein is one of my favorite books. The original 1958 novel, Starship Troopers, is a classic of the genre, with great action, good plot, memorable characters, and enough political and technical ideas to satisfy any Poly-Sci or engineering enthusiast. The movie...has great action.Admittedly, a book that is really primarily about political theory and the philosophy of warfare does not make for a good Effects-laden sci-fi shoot-em-up, so I am willing to cut this movie some slack. The acting by the cast (mostly former Melrose Place or 90210 stars) is atrocious, the dialogue hokey, and the plot paper-thin. However, if what you are looking for is a lot of explosions, some good-looking people, and a lot of effects and gore, this is probably a good bet.On the other hand, when you look a little deeper, the film does improve in my estimation. Director Paul Verhoeven consciously was imitating WW2-era propaganda films like "They Were Expendable", and he does a creditable job of that. In Verhoeven's previous effort to make a special effects spectacular out of an idea-laden sci-fi book, "Total Recall", he also stuck only loosely to the book, but he actually came up with a better story. In the case of "Starship Troopers", he wasn't so lucky.Verhoeven grew up in Nazi-occupied Holland in WW2, so of course he tried to make a statement about Fascist military governments. What exactly that statement IS, however, is not very clear. One minute, we are seeing some of the "excesses" of the regime (voting rights limited to veterans, swift and harsh justice, a culture of violence), the next we are shown Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser, M.D.) in a Nazi-like uniform and told he is a good guy.My recommendation: Read the book. The movie is enjoyable, but the book is SO much better...</fullReview>

The monsters are gruesome and grisly, and most realistic. The copious number of body parts and amount of blood may shock, but they're integral to the story. Young and attractive actors. Makes you feel like this "future" war could--in many essential ways--resemble our own Civil War.Extra materials on the DVD release are informative and copious.

		<fullReview>Saw this one on video yesterday and well...I expected absolutely nothing (of course, you could have expected gore but really...the body parts were coming out of my TV-set...). But in a sense I was also pleasantly surprised.Someone commented that it is an anti-European movie instead of an anti-American movie because Nazism is Euro-based and in the US the amount of Nazis would fill up only 2 baseball teams...Get a clue buddy. You're just as shallow as the characters in Starship Troopers. There are Nazi's in the US, they're all around this planet. You strike me as one of the Independence day crowd.It's anti-everything that's got to do with propaganda, so-called 'war glory'. Not only Euro governments blurted out (and blurt out) the glory crap, the US did (does) as well. Just look at Saving Private Ryan and the intolerable Independence Day, which was a total waste of money.But I digress...the gore gets laughable, the characters look like they were on the wrong set (they thought it was Melrose place or something) and it parodied the WWII-propaganda style very well. Maybe the shallowness of the actors was one of the points Paul Verhoeven wanted to make. You figure out which point that is.Maybe people hate it coz now Verhoeven is making fun of some of American traits. He did it before in Soldier of Orange, but that one was a look into Holland's darker past.After a string of war idealizing (Ind. Day, Saving Private Ryan which was crap) and good ol' fashioned US-safeguarders-of-freedom-we-do-it-all-yawn-movies, this one is a nice change.More could have been made of it but hey...better luck next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I watched this movie for the first time I didn't really understand it. It took me several days to get the main idea. It's not actually a movie about dark future or of how bad nazi ideas are. It's about American 'silent majority' - people who spend hours watching Beverly Hills, who like stupid action movies, never read a book in years. This movie is a very sarcastic parody on all blockbusters. An ordinary person finds all he needs here: action, sledgehammer moralizing, soap opera love, contempt for aliens. It's just pushed to the limit where you realize - *mentally* we are ready to become members of a nazi state. Everything you see blossoming in the movie is being born today. First, 'black and white' thinking: we are good, they are bad even if you don't know a thing about them. We must be confident and strong.Second, political correctness - I always believed that political correctness will be logically complete when we don't have separate bathrooms for men and women, wash together in a shower and regard sex as a fun thing between 'buddies'. Third, total lack of spirituality and human emotions - we don't need it. All our life is based on things like career, fun, sports. Love is something of the third priority - given a choice to have a career or to stay with a person you love, we always choose the first option. Blood, death, pain - there's nothing wrong to show it but disgusting scenes are censored. This is a movie that made me look at myself differently and made me think who am I. Did I degrade enough to become a good citizen of the future world state?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrills, violence and gallows humour - Verhoeven at his best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film bears only a passing resemblance to the Heinlein novel on which it is based taking the militaristic society and war with the bugs as its themes, but leaving out the majority of the story (and not one BOUNCE is heard !). I don't know if Paul Verhoeven has read it, but the book which most closely resembles the tone of the film is 'The Forever War' by Joe Haldeman which was written as a Vietnam veterans response to the romanticised militaristic 'virtues' presented in Heinlein's novel. Unsurprisingly, Starship Troopers is reminiscent of both Robocop and Total Recall featuring many graphic scenes of violence mixed with a(n un)healthy dose of black humour. As in Robocop, much of the background is presented as snippets of news programs and this device allows Verhoeven the freedom to parody the far right politics and jingoism without involving his main protagonists. The action sequences and special effects are extremely well done though faint hearted viewers may find the levels of gore rather extreme. The acting is adequate and doesn't suffer from the lack of big names, at least the players seem to have fun in their roles. That said, the weakest point of the film is the reliance on poorly sketched archetypes rather than on characters. The love triangle sub-plot in particular is cliched and largely charmless.Taken as a whole, Starship Troopers is a grand old adventure story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film to think about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At last, sci-fi gave its best, thanks to a director who provided us with another great movie, Total Recall, leaving us with lots of things to think about. Starship Troopers is not a pop-corn movie, or at least is not just that. Sure, it has action and SFX like never before (and was WAY ahead of Titanic) but it is also an interesting criticism of facist society, where men and women are sent to be eaten by bugs, which they do not realise at first, but later in the scenario. What can be most appreciated, but was not at the time of its big screen release was that the actors were not chosen for their acting capacities, but only for their background. How fun and interesting to see Beverly Hills characters beeing ripped off by giant bugs! Ironside make a great leader, Rico keeps his hairstyle all the way (how does he do that with a helmet!), Denise Richards keeps smiling even when her shoulder is dislocated and close friends are decapitated! A must-see film, that must be seen with no prior thoughts, and with a lot of second degree</fullReview>

But then it developed very impressively, definitely not a film I'd recommend for kids! :) What really appealed to me, was the outrageous, all-out uncompromising humans-vs-aliens war scenes--I've never seen anything like it!--that contributes to a very "elevating" atmosphere throughout the movie. Generally, I am very disapproving of unnecessary/excessive violence in movies, but this is something very different.

It stays with the spirit, if not exactly, to the novel by Richard Heinlein. If you can allow yourself to get over the fact that all the main characters look as though they just left Beverly Hills 90210, you'll see some fascinating discussion of a fascist society. It is made fun of here and there, but for the most part, it's just left to fend for itself. This is a great film for those who like discussion after a film.

For one thing, we are allowed to see the characters grow, from naive high schoolers into warriors. The love interest has some pathos with the death of the Dina Meyer character. The director is intelligent enough to balance the war scenes with satirical looks at the propaganda that the folks at home are seeing while the war with the bugs is going on. My only negative comment: It was more than a little unbelievable that the Denise Richards character was able to not only walk but raise her left arm to put it around her friend's shoulder after having a 3-inch diameter bug claw shoved through the joint. But hey, it's only a movie! The Phantom Menace was all special effects, no dialogue, no feeling. Do you remember the scene in the first Star Wars movie, when the X-wing fighters peel off to attack the death star, with a stirring horn fanfare in the background? That still sends a chill down my spine, but I felt nothing in the Phantom Menace. Starship Troopers has plenty of chills and thrills!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cynical science fiction war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is based on the novel by Robert Heinlein which describes polemic a prosperous fascist future. The humans are united, there are no social, religious or racial differences. The energy problem is solved. A murderer is arrested, sentenced and executed in one day. There is no regime but a military oligarchy. The sole problem is some extraterrestrial bugs which were able to throw asteroids at Earth.Verhoeven took propaganda movies from the second World War and translated them into its primitive structure. He thought, the result of this would clearly reveal the cynical character of the film. This cynical character shows how primitive and bad fascist ideals are and how stupid people are who believe in them. It is as well the reason that the violent scenes you see somehow don't matter. You see these scenes, but you have the feeling that they are far away. I'm usually not interested in violent movies, but here I can make an exception because it shows what fascism really means and what you can expect if you join the army.But there's one problem. The significance and the message of a movie does not depend on the intention of the makers, it is decided by the majority of the audience. I suppose that some of the viewers think, admittedly unintentionally, that fascism is ok, but it isn't. So, it's a dangerous movie. But normally dangerous things are good and in my opinion Starship Troopers is a very good movie.Evaluation: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's wrong with Paul Verhoeven? His Hollywood made movies continue to get worse. Subtlety is not an American trait I'm sure. Even for a war/action movie this film has too much action in it. So much it becomes both laughable and annoying. Although I kinda liked the political 'criticism' in it (militarism, nationalism, gender mixing), I was glad I could read 'The end' of the screen. Probably very entertaining for today's video generation. Hopefully Paul's next film will be driven more by creativity than by money.What I still like about his work is that in all his films he doesn't show political correctness (two thumbs up!) and I don't think he cares a lot about morality either(third thumb up). Like he said in an interview: I don't do it for money, I don't do it for fame or recognition, I just want to make the films I wanna make.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basically a nonstop slaughter movie about young enlistees in the Mobile Infantry of a mysterious Federation. Battle sequences are some of the best in the business, as far as the sci-fi genre goes. A few holes in the plot, as far as military equipment is concerned, though the special effects make up for that deficiency. A bit too much gore, though appropriate, in places. Good acting from Caspar Van Dien and Denise Richards, great special effects and usually good script make Starship Troopers a good flick for anybody who likes future/war-type movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It takes place in a future where you have to go through some sort of government service in order to qualify for citizenship. The non-citizens (called "civilians," I think) live lives of incredible ease and luxury, however, while the citizens go through hexapod hell, so I'm not sure what point, if any, was being put across. Plus, the goverment service leading to citizenship is completely voluntary and you can drop out at will with no consequences except hurt pride.Anyway, the cartoonish nature of the scenario makes it clear that this world is no more real than Gotham City. The point of the celebrated co-ed shower, I think, is to reinforce one of the movie's themes, which is that women and men are absolutely equal. The most violent games have co-ed teams, the military is completely gender-blind, and so on. That was one point of the co-ed shower, anyway. The other was to shows lots of boobs 'n' butts, obviously. Something for everyone.The movie has a plot of sorts. It also had a two-dimensional but readily identifiable cast of characters. One game you can play with this cast is guessing which ones will be killed in action. Not too many surprises there.It is *exactly* like an old-fashioned cowboys-and-indians movie, or an old good-Brit-Colonialists-versus-bad-black-Africans movie, where one wave of the seemingly numberless bad guys rushes in as soon as you've filled the previous one with bullets. Only these are just insects, so nobody gets offended except the entomologists in the audience.The best thing about the movie is the relentlessly cheerful attitude that carries it along through all the carnage. If there's any message, it's that it isn't so bad to have your brains sucked out by a giant beetle grub, since you'll be idolized as a savior of the human race later on, and you were, after all, trying, just a tad obnoxiously, to win the heart of the hero's one true love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is film of two minds. One viewpoint, taken from the Robert Heinlein novel, is the glorification of the foot soldier. We see Johnny Rico, played by Casper Van Dien, leave a privileged life for a career in the military, not for any high ideals--not initially--but to follow his high school sweetheart. (There's a triangular romantic subplot many likened to Archie comic books in its simplicity.) By the film's conclusion, Rico, his parents and too many of his friends wiped out by the alien aggressors, sees immense value in being a soldier. The other viewpoint, as evidenced by a mocking tack in the film's TV commercial-like promo inserts and propaganda sound bites, presents a ugly fascist aspect--a benevolent world dictatorship, public floggings, and Nazi-like uniforms--that probably represents the true perspective of the screenwriter and director Paul Verhoeven, an uncomplimentary reaction to regimentation. This results in an unwieldy, ambivalent film, a film tugged in two opposing philosophic directions. It leaves the audience thinking the filmmakers tried to have their cake and eat it too. Starship Troopers attempts to be a rousing war movie while at the same suggesting the real enemy may ultimately be ourselves.</fullReview>

They're the best in the business and some of their best work shines here.In movies like this, there usually are problems with character development and dialog in movies like this. Even though there were SOME problems, it was written well enough to be a very entertaining movie. Instead of aliens with big heads, weird guns, and just happen to speak English, here's a movie that takes a mostly harmless species on Earth and turns it into a frightening, verbal-less, enemy.The only problem I had, which a lot of people seemed to have had, was the idea that you could take down these massive and bloodthirsty creatures with weak armor and machine guns. This is a sci-fi movie where energy weapons would've been much appreciated. I personally wished they had made tanks to storm the ground with. They would be heavily armed and big enough to take down even the most ferocious bug.Besides that, being the worst flaw, it really wasn't a bad movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Compared to a Star Wars film, this is episodic. The vignettes are a series of events in the life of a Brazilian youth who comes of age in the Mobile Infantry. As a fan of Heinlein, it is hard to realize that many of his best books translate well into screen, but only if you add a love interest. The amount of similarity to Heinlein is at 60% or better, as long as you include the military philosophy, which is a good portion of the book, and a generous portion of the movie.Lovely execution by the director, who really has a way with battle scenes and military ambiance. The lack of powered armor is, for a reader of the book, a real minus, as it forms a good portion of the book, but if they had powered armor, you would not have seen their faces, and the cost would have been higher. Excellent sound, nice acting, and lovely faces to follow. If you want a great DVD to play, the additional scenes and trailers, and other items, make the DVD worth the purchase.I would buy some popcorn and pop the DVD in the drive, and crank the stereo up!!B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one could have been good. Unlike "Robocop," however, Verhoeven is unable to offset the gratuitous violence with either sympathy, humor, or wit. "Starship Troopers" is supposed to be an ironic statement on the militaristic bent of our modern society. Irony has to have some subtlety to be really effective, and this movie is as subtle as a hammer blow to the head. Yes, the special effects are great -- anyone seen a big-budget motion picture lately that didn't have good effects? (If that's all its about, then "Asteroid" is an Oscar winner!) But you can't sympathize with any of the characters. The aliens are horrible, the humans are horrible. Take your choice. So you're left watching this one-dimensional movie that's so disgusting the irony is missed by those looking for it, and the violence is accepted (and applauded) by those missing the point. Do yourself a favor and grab a comic book -- at least your brain will get more out of it.</fullReview>

The very intense evoking of Nazis and fascism (and possibly general conservatism) in the future is meant to provoke more thought than the average viewer of this movie is prepared to give.As simple entertainment it is a match for the dimwitted 'Independence Day', except with more intense war imagery. I think every war movie cliche is there somewhere, and kudos to the clever futuristic D-Day invasion scenes. I thought of 'Saving Private Ryan' as I watched these scenes and noted the similar roles of the common soldier in grander plans. This is an almost schizophrenic movie but the odd mix of entertainment and social commentary works for the most part, however I am still not quite sure how afraid or repulsed I should be by the message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw "Starship Trooper", I loved it, but I did not realize that it was based on a masterful science fiction novel by Robert Heinlein. I liked the film for its unrelenting, 'cheezy' action and humor. I was so overwhelmed by the visuals and the laughter that I experienced, most of the films message drifted right on past me. Later on, at university, I was in an English course where Heinlein's "Starship Troopers" was one of the primary texts. By actually reading the book, I was able to develop a new understanding and appreciation for the film. The book is quite a bit different than the movie, but the film retains the novels important underlying themes. Director Paul Verhoeven has a good eye for this. He adapted Philip K. Dick's short story "We Can Remember It For You Wholesale" into the full scale movie "Total Recall", a wonderful and welcome addition to the genre of science fiction film.I have already mentioned that the film is funny and entertaining in its own right, but that aside, I would like to talk about it on the level of the novel which inspired it. It is important to uncover how the film complements the novel's themes and ideas."Starship Troopers" is a very good account of the making of a soldier. People, when they enter into the military, seem to lack a sense of individuality and have a desire and need to be part of a close-knit group. This is surely the case with out protagonist Rico (Casper Van Dien). What gives him his meaning in life is the psychologically well-oiled military machine to which he is attracted.Rico is the hero of the story, but yet most of his personal life is kept under wraps. We know that he loves Carmen (Denise Richards), but other than that, we know very little about his personal likes and dislikes. Throughout the story, he does not change, perhaps because he can not change. He remains static as a character symbolizing how 'nice' it is to be a soldier."Starship Troopers" depicts the human unit as being like machines. They are pitted against the Bugs, which in themselves are a representation of machines. Even though different anatomically, the Bugs represent an efficient organization which replaces immediately what it has lost, just as we would do in our own military. People are essentially fighting an enemy that is the same as us. The huge insects and monsters symbolize an opponent related to us, but they also represent a horror of the universe in that they are as unsympathetic, unrelenting and as pervasive as we are. If we think about this in terms of our own 'real' battles on earth (WW I and II, Vietnam, etc), I think this says quite a bit about us as humans. </fullReview>

However, if you just relax and get into the film, you'll have a good time. Some people like to consider the statements about society and war that the director is making. If you want to get all academic about this flick, fine, but I prefer to just enjoy all the guns, nukes, and flying body parts.</fullReview>

The way it tricks the viewer (well, except the pop-corn-munchers who gave "Independence Day" a ten) to cheer through the trappings of war movies just to get him face to face with the reality, the ugliness of war is disturbing and brilliant in that it gives the viewer a mirror image of the way he, too, can be tricked (Gotcha ! Could almost shout Verhoeven). The character are shallow and the love story pathetic ? But they are not CHARACTERS, they are ARCHETYPES, taken from any war/action movie anytime, a bit like the toys in Joe Dante's "Toy Soldiers" (whose only way of expression is military clichs). In fact, inside the movie, they are the brain-washed by-products of their fascistic society (See what they call "education" ?) Anyway, Verhoeven has acted as a true terrorist and destroyed the system from within. No doubt the Independence Day crowd hated it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taken for what it is, the movie works. I haven't read Heinlein's novel (yet), so I can't really compare it to the text. Without having set any expectations, I can safely say that I was never bored with this film. ILM's digital FX were excellent as usual; Tippett's set of arthropods, esp. the "brain bug" were well-crafted. As for the humans -- they all were pretty much confident in their roles, although I did like Dina Meyer's role as Dizzy Flores. Her aggressiveness reminded me of the females of James Cameron's films.Verhoeven, brushing himself off after "Showgirls", still gives us as much flesh (the shower scene, the sex scene) as blood (the battle scenes - 75% of the movie). He even returns to his "RoboCop" days with the news broadcasts (which are hilarious). It would've been nice if he touched more on the element of fascism in the movie, though.I found it interesting that there was little profanity in this film. War movies exhibit scenes of great tension and bedlam, and as such, you'd expect to see that reflected in the characters' language.My only real complaint is that at 129 minutes, it's probably about 15-20 minutes longer than it needs to be. Other than that, it's a decent film for it's given genre. Your enjoyment will really depend on your expectations.</fullReview>

Starting a war against bugs a million miles away IS stupid. Especially when you can zap their meteors without having to attack them... But these flaws are just minor in my opinion. This movie is still very well done with special effects. It has action scenes that are pretty unique. It has a sick sense of humour which reminds me of Robocop.

		<shortDescription>Futuristic fear propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After his recent flop, 'Showgirls', Paul Verhoeven proves that he's still an innovative director. In 'Starship Troopers' he abandons the erotica-genre completely, and succeeds in creating something completely unique. The entire film is directed as a twisted futuristic version of nazi propaganda, or of the communist-scare films Americans pumped out during the cold war. All the characters are square-jawed and handsome 90210'ers, and the feelings of pride and success are quelled to bittersweets by shots of the horrible and inhumane treatment of the POWs. By choosing an enemy that's unknown and traditionally considered dangerous, the film tricks us into accepting and even applauding the meaningless and sadistic scenes of violence, where essentially harmless aliens are being tortured and viciously murdered. I never got 'The wave'. I get 'Starship troopers'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action movie, bad screen adaptation of the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, it's not easy to answer the question whether "Starship Troopers" is a good movie or not.If you only want to see a good piece of action cinema, you should really go and watch it. The movie has an exciting plot which thrills you up to the end, it has blood and gore, lots of dead, beautiful girls and great deep-space starship scenes. The CG bugs are wonderful creations, looking as life-like as nine feet tall arachnids can look. There are even bug attacks with thousands of enemies in the same time at day-time - not hidden in the darkness so that you can enjoy these moments. But if you're hoping to see a perfect screen adaptation of Heinlein's novel - forget it. Verhoeven's movie has the same title, the same theme, but that's it. The film doesn't tell anything about the human's allies in the war against the bugs (the so-called "skinnies"), Flores (Dizzy) is a man in the novel (no love story, that's only a Hollywood must-be), and, what I regretted most, no trooper wears the battle suit which makes him fly and escape before dying a senseless death.Well, good movie or not: everyone must decide for himself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers does not have a thick plot. The characters are not deep. But what this movie does have makes up for both of its shortcomings. This movie is fun. It will make you gasp, and astound you with amazingly realistic creatures, and considerable gore. ( Yes, it is gratuitous.) But does every movie have to be motivated by plot, and characters? I think not. This is pure and simple, an enjoyable and entertaining movie. It is what it is. Just enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest Anti-War-Movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading the other comments, I seem to have experienced a somehow different movie. First, ST is in fact a Comedy, exaggerating everything you would expect from a splatter and/or war-movie. First it seems threatening, but soon it becomes ridiculous and I think that Verhoeven intended this. Then it's a very entertaining satire, especially for somebody who knows WW-2-outfits and because of the newsreel-scene in the beginning (I hope the original version can provide such an impressive voice as the German synchronisation featuring the legendary voice from "7th sense", a serial of 3-minute propagandas for security on roads during the 80s, by then very popular because of the shown crash-scenes.) Somebody in the audience asked if this movie based on the novel "Fatherland", describing a world after a German-won WW 2, but Verhoeven wanted to show something else, i.e. that war itself has won the world presented in ST. At last, ST is an anti-war-movie. How this idea came to my mind? Well, contrary to (the also excellent) Saving Private Ryan, which presents wars as cruelest possible experience, but sometimes necessary, the war in Starship Troopers is (to an intelligent viewer) absolutely pointless (Seen Armageddon? That's a simple way to get rid of Asteroids!). The sense of the whole military operations is hard to follow, the simple soldiers are presented by the director as almost brain- amputated, played by non-actors like Denise Richards (having apparently just two reasons to get casted, both situated on her chest) and Caspar van Diem; and Earth's elite is totally brutalized, moving towards a niveau of civilization near to the Bug's one.In the end, Starship Troopers, though many wouldn't believe it, is a movie to recommend even for sophisticated viewers - though they will probably take different impressions home than the popcorn munching "Cool! Guts! Cool! F F N!"-guy sitting next to you.</fullReview>

At first I thought this was gonna be a cartoonish kids movie because of the title - "Mommy, can I get a Starship Troopers Action Figure for Christmas?" And it took me about 20 minutes or so to get into the story. After I realized this was set in the 24th century, everything fell into place for me, and then the action began. And the fantastic special effects. And the not-so-subtle but still funny humor/parody. Even the love stor(ies) were interesting and not at all "flat" or boring - the quadrangle between "Diz," "Carmen" and the two male leads was interesting. I would recommend this movie to any Sci-Fi or gore-fest fan looking for lighter entertainment. It's light (but never boring).</fullReview>

Do these people need everything spelled out for them? Do they need a warning flashed up on the screen beforehand: "WARNING! THE FOLLOWING MOVIE IS IRONIC AND/OR SARCASTIC! STAND-BY FOR CHIMES THAT INDICATE HUMOROUS INTERLUDES."Someone said that to make a good parody you either get very good actors, and tell them it's a parody, or save some money, get budget actors, and don't tell them anything. You can tell the director here has used the money he saved on actors for special effects. Very canny.I can't wait for the sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one is hands down, the most visually stunning effort pulled off in a sci-fi movie, thanks to the minds of Sony. Bodies are blown to bits, bugs animate in fluidity and in mass hordes, meteors fly and rotate in outer space, et cetera. Among minor little details is the top of a huge ship nipped off by a huge asteroid. It has the richest looking colors captured on film. In other words, visual overkill!WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MORE?Being nitpicky over movies that are all show and no go, STARSHIP TROOPERS finally deserves more credit for some high-intensity action elements that rival a classic WW2 picture, and you can bet a wild number of young recruits who storm through alien territory getting sliced and amputated by these fierce creatures! Bloody well right! Some of the fighting scenes are a bit repetitive, but they are impressive enough to make your eyes glue to the TV screen. Try calling this a mass upgrade of Hollywood war films for a change!WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MORE?Enough of the rich, creamy taste for now. Some silly and disgusting things bothered me in viewing STARSHIP TROOPERS. Weird acting performances in the first hour are irritating, along with the excessive gore and nudity content. What needs to be understood is that sci-fi movies are meant to fascinate and entertain all types of viewers, and they include special effects. This is obviously where future science fiction is heading, but on the director's part, you'll have to live by the rules here. If it was toned down, this would've been better. Fortunately, things go uphill after the unwanted glitches and focuses more on the battleground.WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MORE?The public service announcements are a nice touch to STARSHIP TROOPERS, a movie set in the future where all forms of communication is evitable. Carmen survives a bug's blade cut through the shoulder. End credits are a record-breaking 10 minutes long. And of course, two hours of fun. It's more than a doorstop for your DVD player not just in visuals, but in solid entertainment, minus the disadvantages. Still, it's no American epic like STAR WARS and its appeal belongs to the younger crowd. STARSHIP TROOPERS looks as though it could have a sequel in the making, and maybe develop a stronger following for its own good. The fact that it may not overtake the new STAR WARS film coming up will be a huge question, though.WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MORE?Sorry, but it's time for me to go nighty-night!

		<fullReview>Killer arachnids threaten the entire human race in STARSHIP TROOPERS, a repetitive, ghastly tale adapted from Robert A. Heinlein's futuristic novel, but could just as easily have been last year's hit video game. Governed by a blithely homogenized police state, Earth responds by sending hundreds of thousands of young, pretty soldiers to die learning the harsh realities of intergalactic war.Director Paul Verhoeven cracks Orwellian jokes about fascism (sanitized news reports are comically propagandistic about mass carnage), but it's a witless, transparent facade. The submissive human soldiers-the good guys-all think alike, and are happier for it. (It makes them better warriors, and as they are slaughtered, they die happy, too.) Yes, Verhoeven wants his satirical jibes, but he wants his jingoistic heroism even more. As these grinning ciphers lunge enthusiastically into suicidal battle, we are meant to cheer their "courage" in the name of the state. Therefore, the movie essentially embraces mindless conformity. This obvious contradiction is damaging enough to make one realize that Verhoeven's satire and symbolism actually make the picture worse. If it was just another trashy, slam-bang actioner, it wouldn't offend so much.Moreover, Verhoeven tries to find the comedy of gore, directing the battle scenes as a form of pop-sadism. The extreme violence-heads lopped off and smashed in, torsos ripped into multiple parts-is staged and timed as wacky slapstick. There's a jeering pessimism somewhere in that, but Verhoeven ignores it.The action relies on childish gigantism rather than genuine tension or dread, and most of it is unremarkable. The massive amount of expensive computer effects have such a vise-like grip on the events that nothing seems unexpected or shocking. STARSHIP TROOPERS is like an expensive, cumbersome toy quickly sentenced to the shelf. It's too much trouble to actually play with, so it just sits there, accumulating dust.ERIC BELTMANN</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is a)an incredibly expensive gore-fest b)full of trite, contrived performances by no-name 90210 rejects and c)a camp-filled war satire that completes its purpose. Yes, Starship Troopers is all these things, and I loved it! Sure, it was campy and corny in some places, but I think Verhoeven actually intended for it to be that way. Bad performances, schlocky dialogue, and a non-existent plot were all apart of the director's homage to WWII war films and big, bad bug films of the 50s. However, the departure is in the production values. Incredible FX, including bloody dismembered bodies and CGI-rendered "arachnids", are just part of the fun. If you want a thought-provoking science fiction film, see 2001. If you want non-stop action and fun, see Star Wars. If you want something in between, see Starship Troopers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie shows and overused, pessimistic view of a fascist future of a dominant military cast and civilian serfs (which, in this case, seem happy). It's hard to imagine a more ludicrous plot. Why on Earth (or, shall I say, the universe) would these bugs care about attacking faraway humans? What do they eat in such an arid planet? How did they develop the technology to throw rocks across the galaxy and hit the Earth? Why couldn't earth just nuke'em? The special effects are great, but have no sense of scale: plasma balls launched by 30-foot bugs at a few miles per hour cut through a multi-story starship in orbit, and the pilot is unable to maneuver to avoid it. There are so many flaws in this movie, it wasn't worth my time seeing it. I can understand why there isn't a "goofs" section: it would be too long!</fullReview>

Whats left is a wonderful ironic movie about a not too far away fascist future with a world full of teens not even aware they are giving their lives for some pathetic lies which were obviously made up by some kind of ministry of information. Some people said the Special Effects are the movies Highlights. To me the earths TV News were. I never saw such a sarcastic way to hold up a mirror to a society. They are some of the most funniest and best scenes of this kind I ever saw. One second you laugh, the other the laugh sticks in your throat because of these so obvious brutalities the movies characters are looking at as perfectly normal. The movie left me with the hope that the Bugs will win the war. Better they do, than this fascist society full of cold-blooded people not even aware of what they are doing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To all the idiots out there who have accused this film of being pro nazi; get a f*****g clue. This film parodies fascist ideals and doctrines but unfortunately most viewers are too stupid to be in on the joke. The film makers present us with an enemy that's easy to hate and boo but also show us how human arrogance is the real cause of the war since it's basically our fault that a state of war exists between us and the bugs. As in that other Pual Verhoeven classic Robocop what seems to only be a hyper-violent and fx laden film is really a forum for condemnation of fascist and militaristic ideals. Great script, great direction and acting. Highly recommended. A 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We have always admired heroes of the Star Wars. But Luke's enemies haven't got a chance to present their view of the world. Star Troopers is an example of their propaganda movie, but it seems like the director, however impaired by censorship, manages to smuggle a message or two. Or maybe great artist just can not lie - even if his own political beliefs are quite dubious.Mankind is under some semi-Nazi, semi-Plato rule. At any rate the obsolete ideals of Freedom and democracy and respect for alien ways and habits, however bizarre and unappealing to out species they might seem, are well gone or are rather censored and silenced out. To some viewers though the very abundant fascist symbolics itself would set the framework of reference. To some it would be just "cool". For me Paul Verhoeven manages to do something difficult to believe - by the end of the movie I started to side with the Bugs.In fact, why would you side with ruthless 2-legged predators that are sending their youth to die at the other end of the Galaxy in a battle for domination of a rocky, deserted planet (or couple of them) of no apparent use for humanity? Very lame excuse, without any evidence behind it is that huge Bugs living there are somehow related to asteroids hitting Earth, hundreds of light years away. Looks like a pure propaganda and misinformation. Rulers of the Earth seem not to mind a couple of asteroids to actually hit the Earth, even though there is a defense system in place. After watching the movie I felt like: "The only good starship-trooper is a dead starship-trooper".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great SciFi film on second viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Verhoeven's Starship Troopers is far from perfect, but on second viewing this is one hell of a rockin' flick. I enjoyed it better the this time since the amazing special effects and highly-stylized mood were *less* of a surprise. The flow of the story, seamless and brilliantly-crafted effects, pace and look of the film really drew me in. The work's overall integrity helped me suspend belief and join the fantasy that we're space soldiers on a mission to exact revenge on giant, vicious bugs. Not everyone may like the style or politics, but they're so well presented that watching them unfold is a genuine thrill-ride.The Science Fiction would have been very different if they'd found a way to show Heinlein's armored power-suits. The resulting creature effects and battle scenes and perhaps the movie in general would have had a very different feel. This is probably the biggest letdown since the suits were central to the book. Yet the social issues, love interests, and gung-ho space adventure come through loud and clear. On the merits of clean flow, story and effects, this is one of the best movies yet made.</fullReview>

This seems to be the first film in eight years that he has done which follows along the lines of Robocop and Total Recall, both being excellent. This film is different as it brings WW2 style to it along with the vomit filled rubbish from Star Trek and basically rips it out of any serious Sci-Fi ever made. Despite the amusing bits, the hidden meanings and texts that you can read up on this film is really quite remarkable, an example being the fact that all officers are wearing Nazi uniforms and the "Brain" Bug looks like Winston Churchill seems to just say "what if?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sort of a cross between Star Wars and Gattaca, only with giant-size arachnids instead of imperial stormtroopers. Remember Luke's "parents" killed in the original Star Wars? Well, Verhoeven pays homage to that scene and others, but presents the clichs in such an innovative fashion that I found myself worried about the fates of the four primary characters. The high school antics and all the Neal Patrick Harris appearances are clearly played for laughs.The movie is really about two pairs of lovers (shades of Archie comics), but who really belongs with whom? This is the subplot between all the war campaigns against the bugs. It seems that Dizzy (my favorite) will win over our hero with her loyalty, spunk and dedication. Verhoeven, however, is having fun when he lets Rico fall instead for the voluptuous Denise Richards. Yes, size matters! The would-be lovers of Rico and Carmen eventually suffer very violent demises.Woven into the structure of the film are small tributes to such films as An Officer and a Gentleman, Braveheart and Aliens. It's a tour de force film from Verhoeven, with satire, sarcasm, philosophy (i.e., fascism), relentless action and eye-popping CGI mixed together. The incredible FX include the hordes of bugs and the realistic gore, especially the decapitations and severed limbs (perhaps inspired by Braveheart).All in all, a wonderful treat from Verhoeven. It can be enjoyed as a serious story or as a profoundly ironic film. In either case, it is a journey not to be missed. I give it 9 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

Like Robocop, "Troopers" presents an exaggerated view of what the future holds for humankind. As long as you don't read too deeply into the "plot", this is an entertaining movie with excellent special effects. The acting is mediocre, but the fast pacing and nearly constant action keep you on the edge of your seat. Make sure you see this film on a big screen with a good sound system.</fullReview>

I guess a majority of the people who have complaints about this movies are older and don't really get where the younger generation would like to see movies head. I'm 24 and I have put this movie in my Top 10 of All Time list. The effects were very impressive. The Arachnids were fast, scary, and out for human blood in every battle scene. The gore was heavy and the body-count high. And how can you deny that Carmen Ibanez? She was so hot! Sure there were some hokey lines ("The only good bug is a dead bug." "They sucked his brains out.") But all in all it was a good Sunday afternoon nothing to do movie to watch. I say lighten up people. Not every movie has to be The Piano. Let us have some fun at the theaters and quit being so critical about this movie. Hopefully there will be a sequel so I can see this one in the theaters.

Although I think a bit of full metal jacket should be added to top it off. The film for me was quite like a tongue-in-cheek comedy in a similar vein to a James Bond movie. This movie should not be taken seriously and I don't think there are any messages between the lines. Sure there are Nazi and dictatorial connotations there however it is just a sub plot for the main story (What story? Maybe absence makes the heart grow stronger). It's about time someone showed what a real bullet wound can do to the human body too. Huge chunks of flesh and giblets galore not small red patches of red paint.

That is what I was expecting when I rented it...After 2 hours, I realized that I had gotten sucked into a story with a great hook and characters you really care about. The opening, with the failed invasion of the insect planet sets the tone, then suddenly you're transported to a high school in Argentina, learning about these characters. This set-up is one of the reasons this film is so good..you really findyourself caring about the characters as time goes on..and you don't even realize it. So many movies of this type, with lots of FX, rely strictly on that and ignore characters. In this one, you find yourself caring for them very quickly... You hurt when Dizzy passes on, and feel yourself saddened when she tells Johnny that "its ok, because I got to have you"...Maybe a little corny, but effective.So many people no doubt were disappointed with this, as the film did blow 'em away at the box office, but with video, movie channels, PPV, and word of mouth maybe this movie will get a second chance, and maybe we'll see the continuing story of man's fight against the insect...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be brutally honest, "Starship Troopers" is a ludicrous movie. The dialogue is cheesy, the plot is weak, and the acting is non-existent. That said, I loved this movie. Most action movies made today are merely showcases for special effects. "ST" is no different; it just succeeds much better in the effects department. The computer-generated critters in this movie were incredible, and the vileness of them made them that much more menacing. The action sequences are stunning, albeit gruesome, so long as you can stomach severed heads, skewered bodies, and flying limbs. "ST" is not a movie for everyone. In fact, unless you're an adolescent boy or a twenty-something guy nostalgic for this type of movie, you won't get much out of this movie. "ST" requires that you ask no questions (such as why send troopers when ships and nukes work much better; how can bugs shoot enough energy out of their hindquarters to blow up a ship; etc) and simply immerse yourself in the action. I was able to numb my analytical nature for a while, and I enjoyed it. If you trust yourself to do the same, then give "ST" a go.</fullReview>

Of course, the most satisfying thing about this film (and the vastly underrated "Showgirls",) is that Verhoeven was able to get away with it. For those interested in seeing how Verhoeven's style came about, try finding his early Dutch efforts (Spetters, Katie's Passion, Turkish Delight.) Paul Verhoeven, a Jesuit scholar and former director of Dutch soap operas, claims that none of his early efforts were intended to be "art films", but they were regarded that way by most Americans, who think anything foreign is art. He is the only director I can think of who is able to place his own subversive ideology into the middle of a widely-seen Hollywood film without being censored.

The political satire was set up early when Michael Ironside's character was teaching a civics class in high school. He lectured the kids on our history and the "failure of democracy" and how the "Federalists took control through force, and force my friends is violence...violence has solved more issues than anything else in history. The opposite view that violence never solves anything is wishful thinking at it's worst." The news broadcasts were hilarious. They looked like WWII recruitment films both from the US and Nazi Germany. Our heroes dressed like Nazis and are itching to kill. A famous battle cry from the movie is "Come on you apes, you want to live forever?" The politics of the movie was what intrigued me the most. If you missed it, you probably didn't like the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the preview for this movie I thought "Dumb". I was really surpised I liked this movie. The movie starts out slow, but picks up. Some of the special effects will have you turning your head. Body count very high. You probably watch 300-400 people get stabbed, gutted, beheaded, de-limbed, ripped in half, and also "de-brained". I didn't like the use of the war movie informercials at first, but got used to them. I'll probably own a copy of this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only a good movies can be a dangerous movie. Starship troopers is in this way a perfect movie: Entertaining, funny, nice little jokes, good actor performance. I have never seen a film in which killing (bugs or humans) where photogrphed that aesthetic and artfull than in Starship troopers, but is this desireable?This is closely related to my deep concerns about the story. The original message from the Heinlein book gets lost in movie. Maybe this could lead to a dangours misunderstanding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this film I have had this warm feeling that all movies produced with the "humans vs outer threat" concept are not that "not intelligent" (like Armageddon,ID4 to mention a few).This movie is actually quite intelligent with the simple action plot and "friends staying together" theme which is the backbone of the story.The characters are well described during the film(especially Ricos lack of ability to decide things and coming up with ideas himself) and the entire story feels "right" in some strange way.It is also of value to mention that the actors do very well which first was surprising as most of them come from TV series in the Beverly Hills 90210 and Melrose Place category and who don't usually are the best of actors. The special effects are to good to be described but it is easy to think that the makers of the film had hired a thousands aliens to play in it as the computer animations are so stunning and only in a couple of times during film you can see that "hey that's not for real,it is just a computer animation".My final words has to be that even if you don't think that this is a movie you could like so please give it a chance and I i don't think you will be disappointed.

I know there were details left out of the movie, but I really don't think it's possible to get every detail from the book into a 2 hour movie. So I expected some things to be lost, but to hear lines and comments from the book on the screen was awesome! I would have liked to have seen the book's famous "powered armor" in action, but even with the special effect today would it have been possible to put thousands of people in what would be one man walking tanks and keep it so you could tell who's who?For any one that hated it I can only say read the book! maybe you'll understand it more. The reason the movie looked like a war propaganda film was because the book was basically trying to bring some credit to the common foot soldier. The last line in the end of the book says it all. "To the everlasting glory of the Infantry-" The movie's ending was very close to the books too, give and take a few details.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No plot, no character development, no realism....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>....But that's all pretty much intentional. This is, at first glance, the type of film in which you doom yourself to hating it by thinking even a tiny little bit. If you just sit back and take in the shooting, the gore, the explosions (no thinking now!)....then it's a good action flick. But wait! What's this? Satire? Uh oh--you made me think! The movie does present the viewer with some interesting, if thinly veiled, satirical comments on the future world presented to the audience. I especially enjoyed the scene where children are wrestling over an army rifle. But now that they've got you thinking, there's not really that much else to enjoy (unless your brain is still turned off). There is zero character development. The only reason anyone would care about whether Dina Meyer's or Denise Richards' characters got killed/hurt or not is because they're attractive. That's pretty much the only reason we're given to care about _anyone_ in this movie. "Oh, but he has nice teeth--he can't die!" When Dizz and Rico learn that their families have been killed, they don't really even exhibit any remorse. Perhaps that's another comment on this future society--people don't really know how to show sadness. But I think I'm giving the movie too much credit here.ST is quite effective in involving the audience with its adrenaline-pumped action scenes, and so the huge, gaping (gargantuan, mountain-sized, monstrous) holes in the story's plot (and I use the terms "story" and "plot" quite loosely here) often don't occur to us until after the movie's over. Hey, wait a sec. How do those bugs launch glowing stuff outta their butts into space? That's an interesting case of Darwinian evolution if I've ever seen one. You'd think they could come up with something more effective than those dinky guns the Troopers are given (perhaps the nukes they seem so reluctant to use) to combat the HORDES of bugs rushing towards them. But no. Shouldn't the thousands upon thousands of bugs leave at least ONE print in the sand? How exactly do they launch asteroids light years away, hitting their intended target exactly? How is it that Denise Richards is stabbed through the shoulder, and yet is up and moving, hugging friends, and flashing that Colgate smile of hers at the camera just a few minutes later, not even worried about bleeding to death? What do the bugs, on a planet that appears inhabited solely by the bugs themselves, eat? How can those guns of the Troopers in once scene be practically unable to injure a single bug, while in the next, the same gun cuts down 20 of the same? But this is not the movie one would go see to nit-pick. Unless you're too cynical to avoid it (like myself), just sit back and enjoy the violence. (Hey! No thinking! I saw that!)As for the bugs themselves and all the other technical wizardry it took to create such a flick--well, they're decent, but they could have been better. The bugs did look _kinda_ realistic, in that they appeared to inhabit an actual space along with the actors (again, another term I'll use loosely). But they still look too.....uh......what's the term? Too shiny. Too bright. Too....happy. Too much like they're computer generated (which, of course, they are). Maybe I'm just biased more towards the Alien/Aliens dark horror-ish sci-fi films, but Starship Troopers just seems to take out that all-important "mystery" of the alien creatures. There were slight hints of this in the scene where the flying bugs are first encountered, but it's significantly lacking elsewhere. Again, though--that's not really what this film is about (I don't think). It's not intended to scare, just to excite. And that it does do. The bugs are quick (not mentally, mind you), and the pace of the film carries the viewer along with its special effects quite well.So, overall--not a great movie. Film students will not be studying it in the future to determine how the great filmmakers do it. But it is what it sets out to be: a light-hearted, no-brain-required, gore-galore action flick (with some nudity thrown in for those who just can't do without it). It's a plus to note the satire with which the film is presented, and if you can ignore the holes in the story's logic, you will probably find yourself enjoying this movie. If you're looking for plot and realism, go rent L.A. Confidential. No, go rent L.A. Confidential anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No doubt, this is a guys movie. That's not to say your girlfriend won't like it too. Beneath the surface, this is a very intelligent film, with subtle nods to what our world can and might look like. This film has lots of action, a little nudity, love stories (Barely), space ships, guns, football, soldiers, and good old fashioned camaraderie. About the depth of this film and how it's actually a very intelligent viewing: SPOILER ALERT!!!For example, the nude shower scene. People say it was just added in to show some boobs and entertain an audience of men. Simply not true. This scene shows how in future world, one does not need to feel embarrassed about their body. Guy and girl can be in front of each other, nude, without any sexual emotions propping up. They had a job to do, got sweaty doing it, and needed to shower. So they did. They were even able to carry a group conversation while doing it, without sex coming up at all during the conversation. Also, subtle hints at a fascist, communistic type of future. For example, the license necessary to have a baby, the need to serve in the military in order to obtain citizenship, and even foreshadows our media and political banter of today's world, especially in the scene where two politics debate whether or not there really is a "smart bug" on live t.v. The propaganda ads that pop up all throughout the movie. The list could go on and on. END OF SPOILER, BELOW IS OVERALL RATING \/Overall, this is a fantastic movie in many different aspects. I hope you enjoy. I give it 9 out of 10 stars. (I'm biased because I'm a 90's kid and this is clearly a 90's movie, so consider this when reading my review.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Read The Book Too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Starship Troopers," as shown by the many reviews here, is a movie which is either greatly enjoyed or highly loathed by those who have seen it. The question of the difference rests on two matters, whether the movie is clever satire or not, and the larger question of whether a movie based on a book is obligated to stick to the book's ideas or not. For "Starship Troopers" the movie has very little in common at all with the 1959 Heinlein novel by that name. In the marketplace of ideas, words mean things or ideas have no meaning. Words mean things, and the authors' words in a book which carry a story, an idea, should be what we discuss when a major title by a famous author is the subject. In a perfect world, when people encounter the flashy, colorful, cartoonish and violent film "Starship Troopers," they would take that occasion to spring off to their library or Kindle to read the Heinlein novel of the same name, and then reflect on the differences between the book and the movie. Robert Anson Heinlein was born prior to World War One, and the mechanical engineer found his career as an officer in the U-S Navy cut short by a physical disability. He turned his writing skills, scientific knowledge and imagination to the field of science fiction beginning in the late 1930's, and until his death in 1988 he published a wealth of short stories, novellas and large novels. His output included the many stories of his Alternate History timeline, and controversial novels including "Stranger in a Strange Land," and one called "Starship Troopers." Fans of Heinlein would consider him as important or more important than Ayn Rand, as a voice against the corruption of collectivism and the enslavement of free men. He explored and shared his real life military and political experiences in a twice-released volume called "Expanded Universe" (which fans would highly recommend to anyone.) Like Rand, he is held aloft by those who love him, and those who admire while disagreeing with him; he is vilified by those who detest his ideas, and write him off as a jingoist, a simplistic scribbler of boy's tall tales, a hack. Like Rand, he uses his fiction as a platform for ideas and ideals, uniquely American, and the stories often are a pessimistic projection of how Man is likely to screw up a good thing. Look at the time when Heinlein wrote the book. He knew the WWII veterans we call "The Greatest Generation" today, he knew the Korean war veterans who gave their all for a war that ended in a stalemate. His book shows us a world where the future breakdown of society offers the chance for the greatest stakeholder in freedom, the veteran, to take charge of political leadership and policy as post- service veterans who attain the highest form of citizen franchise. Civilian non-citizens abound in that society, free to pursue riches and fame and personal fulfillment without the weight of political power and responsibility, presumably protecting those higher seats of power from the corruption they actually fall prey to. Until recently our own society required an honorable service record of those who run for Congress or the Presidency; the low voter turnout numbers in most elections today show that the majority of us are already happy to leave our policies and leadership in the hands of a small plurality of decision makers. So exactly HOW different is the Terra of "Starship Troopers" from the USA of today? Not very. Yet, the need to destroy the central ideas explored in the book have resulted in the bright, glib, "satirical" film of the same name. While the book would ask us to think rationally about many things, the movie would warn us away from the book by telling a different story, of a post-"Rollerball" world where the young and able-bodied are lured by marketing to take part in a hideous war to serve the Hitlerian Oligarchy. We are shocked by the visuals, urged to react emotionally, to never think about that world or its issues. Paul Verhoeven takes the anti-corporate vibe of "Robocop" and the sci-fi veneer of "Total Recall" to bring the look and feel of the science fiction genre and leave the viewer with the impression that another great science fiction "gotcha" has happened to the dumb capitalists and fascists again. Nothing of the sort has happened, though you wouldn't understand the full nature of the direct intellectual attack on Heinlein's ideas if you hadn't also read the book. If Heinlein HAD written this kind of story (and he was no stranger to satire) this probably would have been a vastly better movie. Its failure in Verhoeven's hands presumably would then have been no greater than Mike Nichols' failure to adequately capture "Catch 22." Since Heinlein had no connection whatsoever to the content of the movie "Starship Troopers," I have no way to judge it as satire or science fiction, it seems to fail miserably on both counts. If you REALLY want to see what Heinlein was telling us about Man in "Starship Troopers," see James Cameron's "Aliens" and watch the space marines travelling with Ripley to the xenomorph's planet. Heinlein could have written them. If you want to see anti- corporate satire consistent with Heinlein's ideas in "Starship Troopers," go see another Cameron film, "Avatar." But DO NOT see the movie "Starship Troopers." I find the value of this movie in its CGI work and some interesting aspects of Verhoeven's approach to production design. So it's a 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A parody of Hollywood action fascism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Verhoeven is an interesting guy. He can make an action movie that delivers as an action movie, he obviously understands what makes them pleasurable. But he can also lay out what makes them awful. In this film, he does both of those things at the same time.The strange thing here, the thing that's hard to come to terms with, is that the presence of the critique in the film allows him to turn the volume up on the ugly stuff. It's beyond what a lot of other movies do when they're made by directors who can't really admit to what's going on and how their movies function on an emotional level.I'm not sure how this movie ought to affect the way we think about other films like Basic Instinct and Total Recall. Are they earnest films made from the perspective of someone who thinks, "Wow, isn't this cool?" Are they similar to Starship Troopers, in that they contain subtle critiques of American pop culture, lobbed in at us from the outside, by a director who was punking Hollywood and the movie-going public? Or are they merely very accomplished works of cynical exploitation?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot In A Paragraph: In the future, Earth has become a spacefaring Federation. While colonizing new planets, humans have encountered an insectoid species known as the Arachnids or "Bugs", with their home being the distant world Klendathu. The bugs appear to be little more than killing machines, though there are suggestions that they were provoked by the intrusion of humans into their habitats. Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) his girlfriend Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) and best friend Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris) attend high school in Buenos Aires. Fellow student Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer) is in love with Rico, but he does not reciprocate. Enlist in Federation service after graduation. However it is not long before training is over and the real war begins. I really enjoyed this movie, though it is pretty much a boys own movie. It was visually impressive and even if the acting wasn't always up to scratch (Denise Richards, Patrick Muldoon and Jake Busey I'm talking to you) I really liked seeing two bad guys from the Highlander movies on screen again Clancy Brown (Kurgan from "Highlander")as Career Sgt Zim and Michael Ironside (Katana from "Highlander 2") as Lt. Jean Rasczak. Neil Patrick Harris is not given as much to do, as one would hope, but he is his usual brilliant self when he is on screen. And he is the most talented actor on display amongst the younger cast members.It has a slightly longer than needed running time, that could have defiantly used some trimming (The love story between Richards and Muldoon was a complete waste of screen time as (whilst they are an attractive pairing) neither could act that well, and neither character was that likable. Dina Meyer blows Denise Richards off the screen by comparison. I'm surprised I have seen so little of her since (outside of her role in the Saw franchise and D-Tox) while Richards went on to bigger things (and of course Charlie Sheen) in her career. I noticed a lot of the uniforms seem inspired by WW2 German military and the SS uniform to say the least. Whilst the flag of the Federation has a symbol that looks like the Imperial Eagle from WWII Germany.Overall this is a great guys movie, defo not not one to watch on a date though.</fullReview>

Starship Troopers is a very good Science-Fiction film with very good effects; although they're not the best, you've got to remember what year it was. The alien-bugs are somewhat awesome to see and they're so great; they're one of the things that make the film even better - they're so awesome. Johnny Rico is great; he's portrayed by Casper Van Dien, whom is great actor. The characters are pretty likable from their first appearance onwards.....and I really like Zander Barcalow and Ace Levy; they're my favourites in particular. I hate the fact that Zander dies though; he was so...."cool" and he was my favourite. Great directing, good acting, awesome happenings, alien-bugs, visuals and build ups; you'll not be disappointed with Starship Troopers. It really is a terrific Sci-Fi and it's one of the greatest 90s films. Overall rating: 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Feast for you Science Fiction Hard Cores</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, going for about two hours, is just so packed full of everything. The movie follows two people who join the star forces to go to war against a race of arachnids. They join to become citizens (for one of the ways to become a citizen in the federation is to spend a term in the armed forces, that is if you survive), but while they are there, Earth goes to war with the arachnids and their lives change. It focuses around three friends who still remain friends, but drift apart as one becomes a pilot, one an intelligence agent, and one a grunt, yet it is predictable as one can see that these three people remain the focus of the movie (or two as the intelligence officer disappears when they join the army, only appearing every so often to remind us that he is still around).The question is, is Starship Troopers a pro-war film or an anti-war film. There seems to be arguments that support both sides. First we will have a look at the pro-war aspect of the movie. Starship Troopers no doubts glorifies war. The whole thing about joining the army to become a citizen is a very pro-war sentiment. The idea is that if one is willing to risk their lives for their country then one is entitled to become a citizen of that country. The main characters have been described as being Captain and Miss America, while the iceman is Captain America's side kick. These main characters are the typical glorified Hollywood heroes who cannot die. Even though there are times where is seems likely they will die, they don't, they are the heroes. The supporting characters around them such as Diz and Micheal Ironside, die in horrific ways, but these two main characters, who see the action, remain alive throughout the movie. It has been commented that if this movie was an anti-war film then the main characters would have died in a pointless way that does not forward the war. The philosophy of the society is also very pro-war, it is right to fight for what you believe in, and that violence is the only way to solve problems. The trailer also opens with, "in every lifetime there is a cause that one should fight for." Supporting the anti-war sentiments is the pure reality of war that is shown in the movie. In Starship Troopers we see the camera pan across battlefields littered with dead bodies. These bodies are been hideously mauled and ripped to shreds. We watch limbs get ripped off by the hordes of critters that come swarming over the hills, and we see loved ones die in the arms of their lovers. This movie is extremely violent and very blatant, it is not one for those who cannot handle the sight of blood, or scenes of mass carnage. Another anti-war sentiment seems to be the nature of the news reports. It opens with a camera man on the front-line and we are watching troopers getting ripped to shreds by the arachnids. This is a very 20th century way of reporting on a war where the journalists are right in the thick of the action. This seems to be an attack against the war reporting is conducting this era.Yet all of this blood and gore seems to serve a purpose, and that is as anti-bug propaganda. This propaganda is hammed up in the scene where we see children squashing bugs and a voice over saying "and we should all do our bit for the war effort". This may seem really stupid but in both World War I and World War II Germans in Australia were detained because it was for the war effort. South Australia has a large German community in the Barossa Valley and Handorf, and they experienced a lot of prejudice during this era. Another anti-war sentiment is the way the humans probe the bugs and the bugs probe the humans. When the bugs do it we say, "yuck kill them", yet when we do it we say, "yay, we're probing the bugs!". This exposes our hypocritical nature when it comes to war. They even comment in the movie "they're just probing us as we are probing them," yet with us it is good and with them it is bad.I guess the most important point to consider is the director Paul Verhoeven. He is described as being a typical American Director which means that he gives us what we see and there is little in the way of thought behind the movie. I guess the possible statement that comes from this movie is, "war is good if you are fighting for what you believe in, but if you do this is the consequence."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They'll Keep Fighting, and They'll Win!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie worked on me the first time I saw it, just like a good propaganda movie should. Had there been a recruiting booth in the cinema, I'd have joined the Mobile Infantry. (I was 14, so hopefully they'd have rejected me). As the years passed and I became slightly smarter, I noticed the other ways "Starship Troopers" works.As a jingoistic wartime battle epic, it is pitch-perfect. The shallow characters engaged in their juvenile love triangle are straight out of a 1940's Warner Bros. movie -- except with the genders swapped. The hypotenuse of the triangle is killed off, and the surviving heroes realize that there are bigger, more important things than their measly little lives. Like those old films, "Starship Troopers" depicts heroes whose struggles and sacrifices contribute little or nothing to the big picture, but illustrate what the average citizen can hope to contribute to the great patriotic war. The ending -- "They'll keep fighting, and they'll win!" -- is quoted almost verbatim from the rousing finales of dozens of studio recruitment ads.Along the way little hints are dropped that not all is as it seems -- that we're being carefully conned into rooting for the wrong team. The very beginning of the movie tells us that the war with the bugs was started when Mormon extremists colonized a bug planet: the humans were the aggressors. We are assured that the bugs are mindless creatures, but we're never told how they've settled on so many planets. The asteroid that wipes out Buenos Aires is the icing on the cake: how did the bugs hurl that rock through space, and how did they manage to hit such a tiny target on a planet that's mostly water? Even the scenery throughout makes you scratch your head: why are we fighting over the Badlands and Hell's Half-Acre?In the end it's not at all subtle. It's subversive, but it wields its satire with a sledgehammer. War turns beautiful young people into mindless fascists, *just as it's doing to the audience*. Or maybe it really was too subtle: the terrific special effects, gory dismemberments, and gratuitous nudity must have numbed the audience to the movie's message -- they either loved it as a dumb popcorn adventure, or loathed it as a purveyor of precisely the sort of ideology it was attempting to savage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers by Paul Verhoeven4 StarsThe PlotStarship Troopers is a science fiction story about Boy (Johnny Rico) learning to be a man by joining the military where he must Fight and Die. His adventure the pseudo fascist social order known as the Terran Federation promotes the fact that if you want to be successful, or even accepted in this society, then you must be a citizen, and the only way to do that is to join the military. Johnny along with his best friend Carl Jenkins, and Girlfriend Carmen Ibanez, all enlist into the military together hoping that they will see each other again after their training is over with. But unfortunately fate has decided to throw something else at them. Actually it's an asteroid, lunched by the Bugs, a large force of intelligent warrior insects that have been spreading throughout the galaxy. A classic plot for a film, at first glance you would think that it's nothing special but by the time you get settled on what's going on something else will happen to cause more problems for the Protagonists. The plot of this movie is a bunch of expected curve balls that are thrown at you but they are impossible to doge, you know they are coming but you can't do anything to stop them. The movie also has several sub themes of romance, duty, disgrace, and betrayal with the most satisfying conclusion. Starship Troopers is an adventure to escape from reality and to watch the Bugs splatter, and not to mention that it was a book first.The Cinematography At first glance it's filmed as a serious dramatic science fiction film, but it's also a very comedic movie, with every scene very properly lit. The lighting is sometimes over lit, causing the film to be almost classic B movie era style, but without that, the film would be very run down and cheesy. The sets enhance the movie and fit the style and setting of the overall look of the film. A lot of the film has moments that are considered over the top but without those scenes the film would lose its flow and the comedic relief would be lost. The Acting The acting in Starship Troopers is over the top in most instances, such as instances where the actors don't act how a normal person would expect. The entire film had the essence of a horror film but also had a lot of comedic parts that the actors played well. Some of the main actors seen in this film are Casper Van Dien, Dina Meyer, Denise Richards, Jake Busey, Neil Patrick Harris. The Sound The sound in Starship Troopers is well edited, the music is added as a subtle back ground without it taking up much of the sound layer. The sound effects are at perfect volume without overplaying any scenes, and all vocals are clearly heard and not covered up at any points. Written by David Veerkamp and Matthew Case and edited by Malcolm Ray</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Welcome to the Mobile Infantry. The Federation's strac force. Earth is united not in some pipe dream democracy but in a Spartan state where the only citizens are the warriors given preference in reproduction.As the movie opens Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien), Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer), Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards)and Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris) are finishing up high school. Their teacher Jean Rasczak (Michael Ironside) preaches the value of citizenship in the militarized state. Although Johnny is under Raszack's spell, his primary reason for signing up is to follow his girl friend Carmen who wants to be a pilot. Dizzy the quarterback of the High School's indoor football team signs up to follow Johnny, one of the Ends on the team.Carl, a genius, gets sent to games and strategies. Carmen is tapped for pilot training; with low scores on aptitude tests, Johnny is sent for a rugged basic training in Mobile Infantry. After some contra-temps in training, Johnny nearly drops out but the enemy of the human race a species of bugs attacks earth and strikes Buenos Aires, Johnny's hometown. Johnny is out for revenge on the entire bug race.There are some brutal battles on the bug's home planet and at an outpost of the federation on Planet P before the MI captures the brain bug.The film came out in 1999 two years before the 9-11 attack on NYC. It is interesting to see where the writers correctly gauged the likely reaction and where they failed.The acting if not stellar is extremely well done. The story line of young people fumbling around with adult responsibilities is credible. The phony newsreels that carry the script along and bring out background material might bring a smile to people old enough to remember Movietone news in the Theatres.The film is highly recommended. The costuming is excellent with a decided tendency for a German look in the uniforms.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**MAY CONTAIN SERIOUS SPOILERS** Though filled with some pretty over-the-top cheese ball moments, this was actually a decent film. It was long, but didn't drag on. Instead, the length allowed for some serious character development and essential background information. After watching it I felt like I had seen an entire mini-series on television. You could tell that it came from another medium due to its intricate attention to detail and interwoven story lines.The violence is substantial and constant toward the end. Aside from the three main characters, no one is spared from mutilation. Every death is a bit heart wrenching as each character has concrete personality, albeit sometimes hollow and clichd.The Sci-Fi animation sequences, which dominate the movie, range from awesome to awkward, which is pretty typical for a 1997 film.Starship Troopers fell short in a number of ways though. First, it could have expanded on the theory of "smart bugs" and gotten a little more creative. Instead, we are just left to believe these gross giant insects simply get smart by sucking our brains out. Hmmmm... Also, the concept of citizenship through military service, which I understand is a key component of the book, was all but left out. Though mentioned from time-to-time, it's not paramount to the plot in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film kept reminding me of what we called in the army "John Waynes," posers who think they know what the military is like, but only know from the movies. The military aspects aren't believable in the slightest, but since that's already been covered by other reviewers, let me point to its most serious flaw.The movie's writer and director wanted it to be satire, and wound up making a campy two hours of cheap thrills, the kind that a teenager will watch the whole way through without a hint their is any kind of supposed message in it. In their desire to make a big blockbuster and lots of cash, they piled on the "thrilling action" "thrilling special effects" thrilling romance" "thrilling explosions and things blowing up REAL BIG OH MY!" If they really wanted this film to be satire, then they wouldn't have made a film about "How War Is Just So Doggone Fun!" IOW, they would actually make a film that undercuts their own supposed message.So enjoy it for what it is,a really high priced version of Plan Nine From Outer Space, so-bad-it'-fun-to-laugh-at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheesy fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that should not be as fun as it is. The script is weak, the acting is all around awful, the storyline is clichd (if intentionally so), and it's so over-the-top is ventures into self-parody (again, intentionally). Yet I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie...once I knew what it was trying to do.Three high school friends, Rico (Casper Van Dien), Carmen (Denise Richards) and Carl (Neil Patrick Harris) join the army after high school. Carl joins the special ops because he's a psychic, Carmen goes to flight school, and Rico ends up in the infantry because he's only following Carmen. Then war breaks out, and they all end up in this epic war against bugs who look like a walking pair of clamps."Starship Troopers" doesn't take itself seriously. That would be okay I felt that the actors were in on the joke. It's immediately obvious that the actors are taking this very seriously, and save for a Michael Ironside (as the teacher/captain) and Brenda Strong (as Carmen's flight instructor), none of them can act. Casper Van Dien is a pretty face, but he makes posers look good. Denise Richards isn't any better, but Neil Patrick Harris, who is no stranger to being funny (see him parody himself in "Harold and Kumar") is terrible in a dramatic role. But Patrick Muldoon is just AWFUL as Zander, Carmen's new interest. This is Jonathan Schaech in "The Forsaken" bad. The real surprise is Dina Meyer, Rico's best friend (and wannabe lover). Meyer is lively and energetic, and she's totally believable. We actually feel for her as she pines away at Rico, who is still head over heels for Carmen (this whole love triangle is strongly reminiscent of Betty and Veronica in the Archie comics).Still, I would be lying if I said I didn't get caught up in this whole thing. With more cheese than the dairy area at Wal-Mart, it's still kind of fun in a very silly way. That has to do with the skill of director Paul Verhoeven. The Dutch filmmaker knows how to tell a story, and that's what makes this movie enjoyable. He has a lot of fun parodying the futuristic fascist world that the story takes place in, although the first half hour (when we are introduced the the characters) is painful because they actually have to act.It's dumb, but it's a fun kind of dumb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The great misunderstanding of Starship Troopers is that it is anything but a naval-gazing frog in a well, a very amusing one at that. And the mistake is prevalent. Roger Ebert overdoes himself when he dedicates an entire paragraph to comparing it with Star Wars. James Berardinelli calls it "flawed, but fun." Yes it is fun, but when did this facetious overblown movie ever call upon itself to be taken with a straight face? Frankly, Starship Troopers is a terrible exercise in movie-making and it does not pretend to be otherwise. But here is a film that is among all things wholeheartedly enjoyable, something that can't be said for many films. Then again it does seem appalling that we take movies such as Star Wars too seriously, but that is another dreadful movie for another review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen "Starship Trooper" in a long time, but I may go back for a second look after reading some of the other comments here. The question on my mind is - is this a legitimately great, thought provoking film, or is it exploitive sci-fi schlock. My initial reaction years ago was that is was the latter, but maybe it is worth a second look.Admittedly, this is a notable movie in many regards. The violence alone, surpassing anything I have ever seen in any movie, assures it a place in movie history. Was the violence excessive and unnecessary? I think more to the point was whether or not the violence added to or detracted from the film as a work of art. Many great films have contained shocking episodes of violence (The Godfather, Catch 22, etc), so that doesn't necessarily disqualify it. However, in "Starship Trooper", the violence was senselessly crude and repetitive, and was about all I came away from the movie remembering. Was there a message about fascism I was also suppose to have absorbed as well? Yeah, well maybe it was "fascists are incredibly stupid" or something like that. Another notable aspect of this movie was the extent to which it insulted my intelligence. Here, it was as if I and everyone else in the audience was also assumed to be incredibly stupid as well.Anyway, so I don't think that if I were to see this movie again I would pick up a lot of important, subtle messages intended for the more literary minded. The messages, if any, were intended for a different crowd. In fact, I might also argue that the movie glorified fascism as much as it may have warned against it. But possibly I am wrong and really do need to see the movie again. Maybe the glorification of fascism was a subtle ploy to suck you in (or rather, suck in the fascistically minded) only to repel you later with the disgusting violence. I mean, after all, why make a truly intelligent movie for educated people who already KNOW that fascism sucks? Aim lower in other words, and appeal only to those who might be inclined to become one of Hitler's youth. Suck them in, then sock 'em with the violence later which will surely cause them to think twice about their future career plans, right? Was that the REAL idea behind this film? Well if THAT didn't work, there was still the sheer spectacle of it all which guaranteed that this gross-out movie would gross big at the box office. Maybe the filmmaker was just trying to cover all his bases. In other words, If you didn't get the big picture, you could still be entertained with all those endless and gory insect battles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the future, where High School Students are encouraged to become "Citizens" by joining the army and serving their country. But little what they know, they are in Combat with futuristic insects.Directed by Paul Verhoeven (Basic Instinct, Showgirls, Total Recall) made an thrilling, action-adventure, science-fiction fantasy. Which is based on a novel by Robert A. Heinlen (The Puppet Masters). This big budget epic was an box office disappointment back in 1997, despite good reviews by the critics. The action-sequences are surprisingly sharp and graphic. The young cast are likable with strong support by Clancy Brown and Michael Ironside. This satirical, futuristic World War 2 gone gung-ho is bold, plenty of energy and comic-book style action.The original DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. This DVD is a flip side disc. Side A is the movie with an optional commentary track by the director and screenwriter:Ed Neumeier (Robocop). Side B contains Deleted Scenes, Behind the Scenes footage, Original Theatrical Trailer and Screentests by the cast &amp; effects footage. This was one of the most underrated films of 1997. Although it went on to be a Cult Favorite over the years. Probably the most memorable (although strange) thing in the picture that the Good Guys are portrayed as Fascists. This is not for the Sequeamish. Followed by a brief animated series and two direct to DVD films. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An invisible satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I took a course in eighteenth century English lit several years ago, and one of the first pieces we studied was Daniel Defoe's pamphlet "The Shortest Way with the Dissenters", a satirical piece he had anonymously published. Defoe wrote in the voice of his opponents, denouncing his own group (the dissenters) and proscribing outlandish punishments and generally pushing for their extermination, while heaping considerable historically inaccurate praise on his foes. Yet as absurd as his suggestions were and as woefully misguided his praise was, the satire completely went unnoticed. His opponents who he had intended to satirize adopted the pamphlet and lauded it as a fresh look at the problem. His own political/religious group was horrified. Then, when it inevitably came out that he, an outspoken dissenter, had written the piece, the satire became all too evident and his flustered opponents had him pilloried and thrown in jail. Defoe had made the dire mistake of underestimating the potential for evil of those he was criticizing and thus his satire became invisible for those who were not looking for it. What has all this to do with Starship Troopers, you may ask? Well, as far as Robert Heinlein's novel goes, it has precious little relation, but then the same could be said for this film which, while preserving character names, locations, lines of dialogue, and plot points from the novel, it is no more an adaptation of Heinlein's novel than Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a true story. However, Paul Verhoeven, like Daniel Defoe before him, has crafted a work of satire that is largely invisible to most viewers, leading to a critical and commercial failure that more or less finished him in Hollywood. What is most troublesome is that not even those associated with the film, apart from Verhoeven and Neil Patrick Harris, seem to have any realization that what they are doing is satire. They go about their roles with the gravest sincerity. This leads to such great moments as when Michael Ironside intones with the utmost conviction and solemnity 'They sucked his brains out.' They're acting in a good old' fashioned war propaganda picture, much like Michael Bay's dubious Pearl Harbor, but the director was making another film altogether, the direct opposite in fact. Starship Troopers is at once an anti-propaganda film satire as well as an ongoing checklist of sci-fi and war movie clichs that over the course of the film escalate to an insane degree. Verhoeven was in some ways retreating to the safety of his first big North American success, Robocop, with its absurd ultra-violence, media criticism, and carefully concealed subversive satire. The trouble is, bringing us back to the example of Defoe, is that with the satire invisible, this is a troubling and unpleasant film that seems to target the lowest common denominator. There are many things to recommend about Starship Troopers. The special effects are shockingly well-done for the most part, including stunning cgi effects for the bugs which are still impressive today. Neil Patrick Harris does a slyly comic turn as Carl Jenkins, who unlike his character in the novel, has become a psychic SS agent, and there is a bizarre cameo by The Golden Girls' Rue McClanahan as a Dr. Strangelove-esquire biology teacher. The wide-eyed sincerity of the rest of the cast also makes for fascinating viewing, as if they were making their way through a forties b-picture with a plot line that seems like a high school drama club's adaptation of Heinlein's story. There are also a lot of things wrong with the movie. For starters, the lame costume design of the troopers, of which the less said the better. The alien effects, while often stunningly well-realized, are occasionally oddly cartoonish (the same can be said for the prevalent gore). Mostly, the storyline is a jumbled patchwork mess that takes huge leaps of logic and the characters are Styrofoam replicas of actual human beings ('More meat for the grinder', as their recruiting officer says). However, if one can entirely dissociate it from the novel after which it is vaguely patterned, and is fully aware of the director's intent (as opposed to the intent of all others involved), this is an intelligent film and both a funny and deeply disturbing satire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably one of the best non A-list action movies of the 90s. A colony of insect-like bugs launch an attack on a future Earth which is in a totalitarian militaristic state.The irony is of course that both sides are equally as vicious as the other - the bug race being an almost unstoppable force as per the humans who have an equally vast army and attitude themselves. This makes for an equally unstoppable force wanting to wipe out the alien bugs. The intelligent humans are sent off to military intelligence and/or commissioned as officers while the more athletic i.e. stupid, are used for the front line.Propaganda clips in the Earth media also add to the feel of an extreme right-wing state and the pressure for young people to join the fight against the bugs - you can't obtain full citizenship unless you enlist.Anyway all good action to boot.

		<shortDescription>Eye Candy, little more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In having watched this movie several times, the effects were stunning for their time.Too bad the movie script has little to do with Robert Heinlein's book.See, the movie is making a farce of both the book and of soldiery in general. Said farce is not, however, terribly well written. Verhoeven masterfully blends one visual effect into another... but missed the point of the novel completely, ignored the allegory so profound in the novel, and has openly mocked the novel... and the movie falls far short because the obvious mockery is neither funny nor effective.I don't mind the mixing of genders, but it really blows the point of homo-eroticism being part of the soldier's bond to other soldiers; straight from Sparta to the future. The setting of the novel is only bordering on fascism; the movie implies that democracy has fallen to fascism already; yet another disconnect.The lack of helmets is another failing. The MI are supposed to be fighting on inhospitable worlds, throwing tac-nukes; Verhoeven can't even keep that much in place.Despite all these flaws, I have seen the movie more than 5 times, and enjoy the eye-candy it provides. Sadly, that's all that it provides, as Verhoeven's agenda isn't even well put forth; I got that it was anti-soldier right off... but other than that, his attempted satire was a complete flop.</fullReview>

Underneath the surface you have a harsh criticism of a militaristic society that struggles to justify its existence by engaging in continuous warfare. The "would you like to know more" segments dole out war propaganda yet under analysis also spill out quiet truths. Some interesting facts revealed during the movie were that there was no need to attack the bugs at all, the bug planet was on the other side of the galaxy, and the "bug meteor" attacks couldn't be attributed to the bugs themselves. By the end of the movie you are given more propaganda snippets which contrast starkly to the reality that you learn during the movie, and you realize that humanity is doomed to defeat and destruction, and it was all avoidable.Interestingly, the movie ends on a high note, with patriotic fervor. Its like we weren't even losing the war...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly Verhoeven movie, horrible follow-up to his previous movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*1/2Starship Troopers is a big let-down from director Paul Verhoeven. It's not even a good science fiction movie, it's very silly most of the time. The movie doesn't open very masterfully, but it turns out even worse when it gets to the point that it intends. The story is about a society divided into two groups: citizens and civilians. In a futuristic world, citizens usually have more privileges than civilians. The very first scene of the movie describes perfectly what's the main difference between the two classes. So far so good. What does it take to be a citizen? You have to join the military forces.This is a perfect example of a movie which begins interesting (although you feel very unsafe about what's going to happen next) and self destructs completely later on. The characters (although I loved Clancy Brown!!) one more stupid than the other, go on a voyage to a military system where they'll begin training. When they hear of an alien threat that may destroy the planet Earth they go on war with the aliens. Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards look like two children on a mission to save the world, how fun!! It wasn't their performances, I guess, but their roles which dragged them down to kiss the floor. The aliens themselves are actually quite interesting. They're pretty huge bugs with deadly arms &amp; legs which will give the movie a little sample of gore. The special effects are also stunning! But the main problem here is the alien planet itself. It's just a simple desert with lightened skies and sand everywhere. Before watching this movie, I always thought its story was told on earth.Science fiction movies which explore other planets must be innovative. They must show us something completely different than everything else we once saw or learned in order to be believable as a place light-years of distance from where we are. If a science fiction movie can't deliver that, for me, it's just lack of good imagination. Starship Troopers can't decide whether it is a serious movie or a humorist one. Those commercials are just plain stupid, giving a funny mood to the movie, taking away its credits of being a masterpiece.Paul Verhoeven is a great director though. Working with him may be very fun, because he's a really crazy man on set. He directed some classics before like RoboCop, Total Recall and Basic Instinct. I haven't seen Showgirls yet, but since he won the award for worst director for that movie (at the Razzie Awards Ceremony), I don't surprise myself so much by knowing this movie was just so uncreative. His next movie, Hollow Man is another big let-down. Read my review about it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good space opera that is antiwar and also anti-pacifism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After scanning the comments on this film, I can't help but think that most reviewers missed the point. Yes, this film is antiwar. However, it is definitely not a spoof/satire/tongue-in-cheek! This is not a Naked Gun or even Dr. Strangelove. The antiwar message is presented from the perspective of the warrior, who sees and must live with the horror of war. The warrior's perspective is clear throughout this film, with references to duty, honor, country (planet?); unit pride; acceptance of responsibility; and acceptance of a dirty job that someone must do. Heinlein makes the point that citizenship should be something that is earned by those who know what it costs to defend freedom. This is clear early on in the movie when Rico defies his father to join up and defend the planet, while his non-citizen father thinks that it is better to just go on vacation.Several reviewers also suggested that this society of the future was fascist. Yet there is no reference to a police state, forcing people to join up, or even punishing wrong thinkers. In fact, the parents are openly against the whole thing and are never punished. Instead, they continue to live comfortable lives (at least for a while).Overall, this is a good space opera with a complex message. It is also a fair story about growing up and facing responsibility.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I vividly remember buying this on VHS when it came out and I really enjoyed it. However after years passed no one really shared my opinion. Maybe I was misguided? No it does in fact rock! Sure the acting is crap (besides Verhoeven regular Michael Ironside), and it's typical Verhoeven (sex!violence!boobs!guns!sex!boobs!), yet still i feel it's charm in the same way I feel about Robocop. I can't help but enjoy it. The effects are superb, it's tightly paced, not too demanding yet it does have war connotations underneath if you scratch the surface.There are some unintentionally funny moments, Rico's interview, and a bizarre funeral service.I think that many see this as a guilty pleasure, like 'Demolition Man' but i strongly recommend it as a good, solid piece of sci-fi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtle satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* Minor spoilers * A lot of people didn't 'get' Starship Troopers when it first came out 8 years ago. I, for one, dismissed it as a silly gore-fest when I saw it in the theaters, but now, watching it again, I see that it's much more than that: it's a very subtle satire. Maybe it's the effect of the times we live in now, but it seems so obvious to me now, I can't imagine how I missed it to begin with. Starship Troopers is, and always was, a jab at jingoistic flag-waving militarism, and more of a rebuttal than an adaptation of the original Heinlein work on which it's based.In the future word that Verhoven creates, people aren't citizens until they've served in the military, and perfect-looking soldiers are sent into hopeless battles to fight an enemy whom they don't even understand. Throughout the movie, we follow three different youths as they take divergent, but similar paths in service of the earth military fighting in the War against the Bugs. And at the end of the movie, when the space marines finally capture the 'brain bug', Neil Patrick Harris' character exclaims that "it's scared" to whooping shouts of joy from the assembled marines. It's this scene which best illustrates the dichotomy between the magnitude of their struggle and the meaninglessness of it all that gives the movie it's very subtle sense of irony amidst the over-the-top presentation. And it's this subtle jab which drives home the message of the movie that was missed by most of us the first time around - that, at the end, nothing has really changed, and the earthlings have basically become the same as the bugs whom they've fought so hard against.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did Verhoeven know his movie was satirical?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know people, I came on the IMDb just to write how unthoughtful this movie appeared to me, and then I find people here who try to convince me that this movie has several levels of comprehension. Yeah, probably there is a certain purpose to show the ugliness of a strict military founded society, but I don't know, to me It looks really badly developed. And that's the point. In someways a normal person heartily supports those dudes while they struggles with those horrorific things, You enjoy when they get to that "Brain", but then, when the final scripts like "... and THEY WILL WIN" come out, you remember that this movie was just satirical and you put yourself back to your intellectual position about the "several levels of comprehension" and the "satirical purpose". It's not working so.I will be really obvious writing this, and probably I still have a slight knowledge of It, but I think a model for a movie which tries to be really a blade in a sleepy culture, well that one for me It's "The Godfather".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The special effects in Starship Troopers will amaze you. Unfortunately, the acting will not. If this movie had been cast with a better lot of actors, it would easily merit a 10. Casper Van Dien plays Johnny Rico, a high school football star who joins the army to be close to his girlfriend, a godawful Denise Richards as Carmen Ibanez.This movie isn't terribly difficult to follow, and in these modern days of post-9/11 USA it's actually more relevant. However, the message it delivers clouded by the painfully bad acting. Denise Richards has no business in film - her timing is terrible, she delivers her lines like she's reading them off of her palm, and she shows all the emotion of a hooker turning a trick. Toss in Van Dien's wooden performance and this movie sinks like a turd. The only bright spot is the special effects, without which this movie would most surely sit on the bottom 100.See it if you're bored, rent it cheap, but don't expect it to be terrific.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Science Fiction and its really good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not many directors have the privilege of making a cult classic. Paul Verhoeven has directed two. First he directed the Razzie winning Showgirls and now he has directed a modern Science Fiction classic in Starship Troopers.But where does Starship Troopers' popularity come from? Is it because of brilliant actors? Or perhaps because of a brilliant intricate story? Well I'm going to have to throw you a big fat NO on both counts. The actors in the film are mediocre at best and the story is pretty much simplicity in its rawest form. The actors are, however, good enough that their roles seem real so I guess you can say that they play their roles of a lifetime. The story is as I said simple but that is not necessarily a bad thing because the effects are very convincing. Now I know that effects doesn't necessarily make a film good but in some cases it does and this just happens to be one of those rare occasions.Casper Van Dien who is probably best known for his guest appearance in Beverly Hills 90210 does his part without being offensively bad or brilliant. He is simply passable which is enough because the role doesn't crave a brilliant character actor. Dina Meyer, also a star of Beverly Hills 90210, is decent as well. These two have a love scene in the movie and I for one thought that their chemistry was very good which helps the viewer to sympathize with their love and situation. There is nothing worse than chemistry not working between lovers like in the otherwise good Troy where Orlando Bloom proves once again that he cannot act because the chemistry between him and co-star Diane Kruger is non-existent. The fact that two of the main characters have both been in Beverly Hills 90210 becomes charming rather than annoying because of their chemistry. Denise Richards still cannot act but at least she looks good which is pretty much what is demanded from her in this film so again it works. Jake Busey isn't a very good actor but he seems likable as the side-kick and best friend of the main character. Neil Patrick Harris is only in the film very briefly but he does a decent job in the scenes he is in. Clancy Brown repeats his character from The Shawshank Redemption except he has morals this time around and he steals every scene he is in. Michael Ironside is pretty good as the role model character because of his undeniable screen authority.As I said previously the story is simple and I also said that it wasn't a bad thing because it works. It doesn't seem unbelievable and it has no pretentious elements. It is all about the characters and how they change in extreme situations and as seen previously in my review they are all decent enough to make it work. You follow the characters all the way from High School, through boot camp training to heavy combat and it is very well done in terms of story telling and character development.The effects are what really makes the film good because the actors could have been the best in the world but without convincing effects it would have all fallen flat on its face but the effects were made by Phil Tippett the guy who did many of the effects for Jurassic Park (and who subsequently directed the disappointing second installment in the Starship Troopers series) and he does a wonderful job in bringing the bugs, spaceships and what have you to life. Even by today's standards (2005) the effects are believable.All in all a good film 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoughts on the REAL story of Starship Troopers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many folks have commented on the "antiwar" tone of the film, or the portrayal of the Federation as "Fascist"... That certainly seems how the director intended it to turn out. The CGI is excellent, the scenery breathtaking, and as a shoot-'em-up space opera, one of the best.BUT... and this is a BIG "BUT"; the novel as written by Heinlein in 1959 bears very little resemblance to the film "based" on it. Only the ideas of Bugs &amp; service = citizenship remain. Most of the scenes from Basic training are invented by the director, to reinforce the idea of a callous, brainless "cannon-fodder" military. in the novel, the "Bugs" are a technological, space-faring race, with star ships of their own. They dropped an H-bomb on Buenos Aires, and did not shoot goop out of their ovipositors! :) Much of the actual novel was concerned with what the role of a citizen should be to the State, and what responsibilities &amp; duties should exist (in both directions). Set in the aftermath of a long, painful global thermonuclear war, the characters in the novel are used to explain how citizenship is defined, and subplots deal with the growth of a callow teenager into a mature, responsible adult.Space battles &amp; combat are much less a part of the novel, but academic discussions would be dull &amp; boring on the screen... The growth and maturation of the lead character (Rico) are explored in depth. Note that at the time of the writing, integrating men &amp; women into combat units, and having female commanders of warships (star ships) was indeed quite new! Still not reality even today in 2005.I enjoyed the film, but was sad that what I felt were the major points Heinlein was trying to illuminate were completely excised, &amp; in some cases, overlaid with pseudo-Nazi fascism completely at odds with the thrust of the novel as he wrote it. But, then again, Tom Clancy gets his plots tinkered with in screen adaptation too! :) I'd highly recommend that folks who found the film interesting (from any viewpoint) look up the author (Robert A. Heinlein) on Wikipedia, &amp; perhaps check out some of his other books, plus the original novel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie feels very unrealistic in the beginning, as you see very fit 20 year old males &amp; females wanting to register in the Army.I personally felt : That's strange, usually people that go to the army are the ones that failed all the rest (studies...) or that are very poor and need to go to army to have their studies paid (like in Iraq at present 2004/2005 US army soldiers).After a while, you understand it's a very fascist society and people are manipulated by media. (like we all are today ... fortunately their are alternative medias and internet) Overall a great film, a lot of gore but supportable (it's war after all), great special effects, action and suspense.And the beautiful stars most of them die sliced in pieces ! Never seen else in other movies ! The atmosphere of the movie is quite unique. And the Second degree/satire of a fascist society is unique.

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is set in the 23rd Century, in the midst of a war between the Arachnids from Klendathu and the Terran Federation centered on Earth. It's a gory movie, a Bug-hunting movie, a movie worth watching several times. Though few and far between, some scenes seem a bit choppy, including the scene involving the loss of the Rodger Young. The special effects are amazing; the Arachnids scare some other people I know who have seen the movie as much as they seem to scare cap troopers. Sound quality could be no higher, and one scene involving the death of a Bug has a unique, humorous sound to it. Almost all the acting was on par with what I expected; Shujumi had possibly the worst execution of lines out of all of them. The scene where Dizzy dies (first time a movie has done this!) actually made me feel like I knew her. All in all, the movie is worth watching several times over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Garish and fast paced sci fi about large, lethal insects from another planet that threaten earth. Though it has a cartoonish quality to it that makes it difficult to take too seriously, it does present an interesting take on a future in which society has become a highly militarized meritocracy with equality among the races and sexes. The slogan "Service Guarantees Citizenship" draws in recruits in the all volunteer military to fight the growing threat posed by the bugs who can now think. The subplot in which the main characters, one young woman and her two suitors, all enlist is played out in the heat of battle as the bugs close in, and has a memorable scene with a so-called "brain bug". Beneath the gore lies a fairly thoughtful and intelligent picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ironies and satire of this are a little too well hidden at times and easy to miss, easily drowned out by the special effects and gore. Still, the director has diverged from the book, making jabs at both the facist society that the humans of the future society live in. It's a clever take on old 50's B-movies, as well as an alarming look at what human society has the potential to become. At times the acting is flat, and for much of the beginning it has the aura of a futuristic teen movie. It can be frustrating, that the film could be so much more than it is. Still, "Starship Troopers" is rewarding for those willing to watch it, as well as thought-provoking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Understanding Starship Troopers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has been a puzzle to many viewers. Washington Post claimed that it promoted fascism, many have agreed, while others insist that it's satire and an anti-war movie. I couldn't understand it either. While there are a few scenes involving news broadcasts that are clearly exaggerated, the rest of the movie portraits the protagonists--whether members of a quasi-SS or just Wehrmacht grunts with ideologically fanatical commanders--in a generally positive light, and you do root for them. These are not usually signs of satire.I had an epiphany after reading the transcripted DVD commentary by Paul Verhoeven and the script writer, Ed Neumeier--but especially after checking what work Neumeier had done before Starship Troopers. (Props to vanveen on the IMDb board for posting the commentary transcript.)Something was obviously wrong with Starship Troopers. A well-made satire doesn't leave half the audience suspecting that the movie makers are Nazis. (And I might as well mention that I'm European, so no silly "only Europeans understand satire" nonsense, please.)The solution to the Starship Troopers mystery lies in a UK comic magazine that had its heyday in the late 70's and throughout the 80's. It was, and still is, called 2000AD, and its most famous character is a futuristic cop named Judge Dredd.Judge Dredd (created by John Wagner) is satire, of a particular British, independent comics, kind. The stories about the icy judge-jury-and-executioner-in-one are an odd mix of action thrills and humorous over-the-top political commentary. It never intellectualizes its points, relying on hyperbole and comic effect to deliver its message. Whenever we are lulled into believing that Dredd is a role model, something outrageous happens to prove, again, that he is not one of the good guys. Here's a typical episode:Dredd is patrolling Mega-City One on his gigantic Lawmaker motorcycle. He spots a man dropping some chewing gum wrapping on the sidewalk. Dredd: Littering is an offense, citizen! That's two years in the iso-cube! Citizen: Two years! Come on, that's too harsh! Dredd: The Law makes no exceptions! Citizen: Sure... I bet you make an exception when it suits you! Dredd: Betting is illegal, six years!Before last year, the only thing--according to IMDb at least--that Ed Neumeier had written for moving pictures, apart from Starship Troopers, was RoboCop and various RoboCop-related things. This is not generally known, but RoboCop started its life as the first Judge Dredd movie. The script circulated in the business for years, until, because the script and the movie rights for the Judge Dredd character had somehow parted ways down the road, it evolved into RoboCop.When RoboCop says, "Come quietly, or there'll be trouble," that's Dredd talking, and RoboCop remains a much better Judge Dredd movie than Judge Dredd eventually became.Now, keeping the Dredd character and Mega-City One in memory, let's look at Starship Troopers again. There is the combination of unabashed action thrills with equally unabashed fascist references, that made so little sense to me. It's like a page out of 2000AD. The superficial ambiguity was a trademark of the British comic. Neumeier, consciously or not, is trying to tell a story in Judge Dredd style, where the heroes can be fascists, upholding fascist ideals, without us ever doubting the actual opinions of the writer. But for some reason it's not working.The reason is humor. Or rather, the lack of it. Whenever Dredd started to look too good, Wagner (and his co-writer Alan Grant) made us laugh at his ludicrous pomposity. He became a true parody, like The Dictator or Dr. Strangelove. Starship Troopers has no such moments, it keeps a straight face. When Col. Carl Jenkins of the quasi-SS delivers his SS lines, there is a hint of criticism on Rico's face, but he is ultimately convinced. Jenkins never looks like a parody of anything. The same is true for Michael Ironside's agitator-turned-teacher-turned-lieutenant. From the DVD commentary there is no question that Verhoeven and Neumeier intended Starship Troopers to be critical of war and violence, and not promotional of it. But they didn't manage to pull it off, because they chose, more or less consciously, an obscure format that works well in underground comics but not so well in Hollywood productions--and they lacked the sense of absurd humor that it absolutely requires. The result was not a powerful statement against fascism, but a confused, huh?It's probably also worth noting that Heinlein, who wrote the original novel, would probably not have supported Verhoeven and Neumeier's version of his story. He was no fascist, to be sure, but he wasn't exactly a liberal either, having Ayn Rand, with her extreme libertarianism, as one of his idols. Where the book seems ambiguous, it's more likely because it reflects the author's ideas quite well.</fullReview>

The special effects are not the only mind-blowing, but they are among some of the best special effects I have ever seen. In addition to the special effects looking great, the cinematography looks great as well. Jost Vacano, who is the cinematographer on all of Paul Verhoeven's movies, did a wonderful job with the look of the picture. It's one of the finer (and better) looking films of the late 1990s.

		<shortDescription>Another great film by Paul Verhoeven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Verhoeven has a knack for making entertaining films that involve sex, violence and action(not always the first, but the two last mentioned he always manages to deliver). Those three things, of course, do not make a great movie. He just somehow always finds a way to incorporate them into his movies, which are usually great. This is a science fiction action film, with social commentary and obvious stabs at America in general(but mainly the politics and their seeming obsession with solving any conflict by violent means). You'll see the typical narrow-minded(American) individuals who dehumanize(yes, I realize that they *are* aliens, but still) the enemy in every possibly way, you'll see propaganda, there's even a scene where a member of a debate refuses to even think the thought of the enemy actually being intelligent beings. As an action film, it reminded me a little of RoboCop, but nearly everything was on a much larger scale. There are several epic battle scenes in this movie, and they are very well-made. The action scenes are all intense, and capture war conditions pretty good. The special effects are also very well-made, and add to the intensity by giving us a chance to see some very gruesome deaths and alien/futuristic weaponry. The film also has several camera pans and angles mainly used to show human death and misery. I think that was a good way to show how pointless and grotesque war really is. The plot is very good, and moves along at a great pace; I wasn't really bored at any point in the film, and I've seen it four or five times now. The acting is mostly just below standard, but sometimes it drops several notches and goes to being ludicrous, and actually making the viewer snicker or laugh at what would have been a serious scene, had it not been painfully overacted. The characters all seemed fairly well-written and credible, though a few of them were stereotypes. The film also does have its share of clichs, but none of them ruin the movie. I haven't read the book this film was based on, but I doubt that it could present the social commentary much better, or done a much better job of mocking the general ignorance usually involved with war and the likes. If it does, I might just have to find it and read it sometime. I recommend this to fans of Verhoeven's other films, especially fans of RoboCop. If you're into social commentary and/or sci-fi action, you'll probably like it, too. 8/10</fullReview>

The wall-to-wall stupidity is complemented by atrocious special effects, crappy sets and a plot that is mostly an alpha genetics diagram. The movie Gods have declared - Anything with super-simp Denise Richards is not capable of carrying a message. The thing is a silly tease to be consumed without thought by it's target audience, none of which are over twenty-two, much like it's cast of characters. Robocop managed to make a point about media culture while mocking it. In the end the smiling, photogenic, culturally interchangeable proto-Nazi teens of Buenos Aires are still the big winners. The world is just one big popularity contest, just like high school. If you're buff, you're a winner. Denise Richards is a vapid Barbie doll.

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is a very underestimate cult film that shows our present world in the future. Like the US in Iraq the army in this movie against the bugs is a simular story. It is A sciencefiction world but not as far as you think. See and believe these wargames. Especially the TV broadcasts between the fights are simular in CNN, ABC. Very sad but funny that it is so recognizable. Think... See... Hear... Believe...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Live" from the front</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an observational movie about the nature of totalitarianism and militarism, hidden in a disguise of fantastic special effects and pretty youngsters. The theme of the movie is an analysis of the Warrior State, which is the same from the Angoni and Zulu nations to the British Empire. To quote sociologist William Blau, "internal success depends on external success". In order to be a successful citizen, to be allowed to vote, to stand for office, to marry, you must be successful as a warrior, a soldier. You must fight and win, in order to live, attain wealth, marry and study. The excessive militarism, the uniforms, the pretty and wooden young people, the propaganda infomercials from "embedded" FedNet reporters that are passing for news are just icing on the cake. If they remind you of Hitlerjunge Quex, Triumph Of The Will, Battleship Potemkin, or even current news networks, it's intended to.If anyone is in doubt that Verhoeven himself has nazi sympathies, they should see his Soldier Of Orange - but he certainly has a good time examining why these ideologies hold attractions for naive youths.Highly recommended, but keep your thinking cap on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most misunderstood movie of the 90's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starship Troopers by Dutch director Paul Verhoeven is probably one of the most misunderstood movies of the 90's. This highly satirical, sci-fi actioneer deals about a group of teens from Buenos Aires who join the army when earth is threatened by giant alien insects. The movie follows their adventures from bootcamp into battle.On the surface the movie might come across as shallow. Some even find the fascist undertones of the movie offensive. These people clearly didn't get the satirical aspects of the movie. Like in RoboCop, Verhoeven uses commercial breaks between acts to give us glimpses of this fascist future society while at the same time ridiculing it. It also shows us the folly of war as we see thousand of troopers fighting a ground battle with insects far more powerful than them. It's stupid, but then again war is inherently stupid as this movie clearly demonstrates.But for those who don't notice or care for these satirical messages, a superbly made action movie remains. The special effects in this movie are superb featuring huge space battles with enormous aircraft carriers and ground battles with hundreds of bugs. Effects on this scale had never been seen before in a movie and to this day these scenes remain impressive and jaw-dropping. The score by Basil Poledouris is bombastic and suits the movie perfectly. And say what you like about Paul Verhoeven but the man knows how to direct a movie, especially one filled with special effects. He did a great job.Starship Troopers one of my favorite movies of all time and I highly recommend it. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Has anyone here considered just how implausible the basic premise of this movie actually is? The bugs on the Klendathu home world are knocking asteroids out of orbit and sending them hurtling light years away to impact on planet Earth. Hmmm, those rocks would have to have been traveling for thousands of years to reach Earth. That would require them to accurately calculate the position of Earth and the solar system in the heavens, thousands of years in advance, shoot a few off, and then, um, wait. And wait. And wait some more....(millennia passes...) Perhaps these bugs just don't have anything better to do than wait a couple of thousand years to start an interstellar war. Other than that, if you don't think too hard(preferably not at all), then this is a fairly enjoyable action movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was this movie supposed to suck?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm still trying to figure this out. The bugs were pretty horribly done, particularly the brain bug. There is obviously no way it could move without CGI. And the shots with the huge armies of bugs were ludicrous.Don't get me started on the dialogue. This movie features some of the worst I've seen in any movie ever. The action is overly violent, as if they realized they'd need something to distract the audience from the rest of the movie. The same goes for the gratuitous nudity.Still, I did like Neil Patrick Harris's character and the news services they cut to.I'd say don't spend any money on this movie. Get someone else to rent it, or download it from somewhere. It's a good Saturday night B-movie and a pizza type film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kick-Bug Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT BMOC Johnny Rico and his friends go their separate ways after joining different branches of the military and fight in the war against the alien bugs from the planet Klendathu attacking Earth. The human military forces packs formidable weaponry against hordes of truck-sized Arachnids armed with their own slicing-and-dicing implements, and monstrous beetles who spew soldier-cooking lava out one end and eject starship-destroying loads of nuclear waste from the other. The battle scenes are exciting and bloody and both sides inflict terrible casualties on their enemies, with Rico's love life and gung-ho companions making up the subplots. I was attracted to this movie for the awesome special effects and battle scenes, and for the director, Paul Verhoeven, whose past films promised great action and in-your-face violence. This one delivers on all counts. Like the director's "Robocop" this one has a lot of backstory going on behind the plot. This society of the future is quite finely crafted. The fascist almost neo-Nazi government promotes citizenship by filling the ranks of the military, using the war against the bugs as the rallying cry. The film hints that the military establishment wants the war and keeps it escalating. Michael Ironside is a progressive teacher of young adults who urges free thought, as well as a scarred war veteran happily taking up a robotic arm and a rifle to join in the conflict. With so many good-looking people in the cast---Van Dien and Denise Richards in particular could be built by Mattel---I would say that in this future world genetic manipulation has become the norm. The combat scenes deliver and then some. Bodies both human and insectoid are hacked, blasted, and burned. When an Arachnid goes to work on a platoon of soldiers (or on a sacrificed cow), blood and limbs literally fly in all directions. Also in true Verhoeven fashion we get to see a bit of enticing T&amp;A, and the males in the cast are not let off the hook. The performances are all first-rate for the material, Ironside and Clancy Brown as a fierce drill instructor in particular. These characters are not relaxed: they all live hard, play hard, and fight like Comanches, to coin a phrase from another movie. Maybe we could see a sequel employing the gigantic robot-armor war machines from Heinlein's novel. I'd love a continuation of this over-the-top sci-fi action flick, but only with Verhoeven in charge---I'd hate to see what a less talented craftsman would do with this set-up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aggressive plot carries excessive and realistic gore-fest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wonderful, seriously campy, fast-paced action flick! Great effects and a creative plot! Excellent direction!I love this story, and this film. It has been rated (though I honestly can not remember by whom, at this writing) as the most graphic movie ever made for the amount of gore and bloodshed contained therein. When I am feeling aggressive, or feel the need to BE aggressive, this movie definitely helps set that mood within me.But there is much more to this production than aggression, blood, gore and violence (though there is an extreme amount of violence). The plot is quite absorbing. While the acting quality does leave a bit to be desired at times, the plot and the action more than make up for it. You can't help but notice it, but the point becomes moot as the story progresses and the bloodshed commences. Set in a futuristic world, and adapted from Robert A. Heinlein's book of the same title, this production presents you with a World War 2-type environment, with characters of the same caliber. It definitely demonstrates much more than your average slasher-style violence and gore. It is so much more graphic than any slasher flick could ever be. Definitely NOT for young audiences. If you like sci-fi/action, or just lots of action and gore, this is the movie for you. This one was billed the goriest movie ever made!It rates a 9.8/10 for the gore factor, from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

His Mobile Infantry (like my puritanical high school ca. 1960 that did not admit to the existence of a second gender) was MEN ONLY. And the film suggested that maybe--just maybe--the humans were not the good guys in the war. Heinlein would not have approved the script in this form, and I'm genuinely surprised that his executors and trustees did.The screenwriters destroyed the possibility of a sequel by killing off Johnny's father at the beginning of the film. In the novel he survived the bombing of Buenos Aires (he was out of town on business) and had a part to play at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a shame that Robert Heinlein's book was rewritten for and by the Politically Correct. So many inconsistencies, so little space to expound. Rue McClanahan as the "Biology Teacher"? Sorry, it was Lt.Col. Jean V. Dubois, M.I. Retired, as the History and Moral Philosophy instructor (Heinlein never gave Lt. Rasczak's first name). Dizzy Flores was male "he died on the way up" This could go on ad infinitum, but I won't. READ THE BOOK, PEOPLE, before you write your screenplays! If that sounds a bit harsh, I apologize to our gentle readers, but literary license sometimes goes too far. Like I said in my summary: Great special and CG effects. Terrible adaptation of a story. Some might consider these comments spiteful. They're not, just venting frustration at Hollywood's lack of pride and concern for the author's work.</fullReview>

There are silly propaganda clips and SS-style uniforms, as well as good-looking lead characters who get all the glory. The movie has a lot of gore and shows attrition among the troopers of course.The movie strays from the book's theme about personal sacrifice and proving oneself as a follower before becoming a leader. Heinlein's book is NOT about fascism though, and I can see why most Heinlein fans dislike this movie.I recommend reading the novel because it's so much deeper (and better) than this movie. Even the computer-animated series, which Verhoeven helped produce, is better.</fullReview>

And in my opinion whenever the video box has the phrase "Great Special Effects" I'm leery. If the best thing you can say about a movie is that the special effects are good then it can't be a very good movie, dazzling special effects or not.

		<shortDescription>spectacle?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone on here seems to point to the film as a strong anti-war film and a satire, some going so far as to say the film is portraying the aliens as the good guys. Others say this film wasn't clear enough, or that issues weren't explored properly. Both of these show peoples need to be hand led through life with the good guys and the bad guys pointed out to them, even those (if not especially those) who act and talk as though they know better. I thought the nicest thing about the film was that it didn't spoon feed me morality like I'm some sort of infant incapable of making up my own mind. (spoilers alert) when Rico goes off to join the infantry we see a crippled soldier at the desk, this seems a pretty obvious and unsubtly omen of what is in store for him and other recruits. That said and done, Ricos home gets blown up, as does the place his parents plan to take him on holiday (zegema beach), suggesting if he hadn't joined he would have died. My point here is that the film often doesn't have a clear message, more than a bit like life. It is mentioned that the bugs have been angered by intrusions into their territory, yet they suck peoples brains out. Again, unlike some people on here, I fail to see that this shows the bugs as innocent or the victims, it simply shows a situation, and that seems to have become a sin these days. I for one, am sick of being moralised to. Life doesn't always fit nicely into political or moral stories and I'd rather every film in the world didn't either. Even the propaganda we saw throughout the film wasn't neccersarily an anti-war message, instead just an honest admission of the existance of propaganda (any country at war uses it, especially some futuristic fascist super-state that doesn't make war with the bugs a bad idea per se). The fact that various elements of this film contradict themselves and that we never really find out whats true and what isn't allowed the film to be enjoyed for what it was, a film about a war between the right wing future of humanity and an insect intelligence. I think its important to point out I'm not trying to over analyse this film, there is some satire in it, and it has a strong visual theme (very clean cut, very bronzed youth) but it is an action film. This brings me onto my next point, Someone said "spectacle over substance" which is as far as i can see a variation of "style over substance", a phrase commonly used by those who think that saying things like that will add merit to their opinions. It doesn't. Films are not books, they are a visual medium. I'm not denying that intelligent films with plots and good scripts and acting should be made, or indeed that they are better films (than fluffy action films), I think they are. That said, I like to see hollywood take advantage of a visual medium with some nice scenes(and no I don't just mean special effects as such, just action scenes). Speaking of the special effects, I thought the arachnid warriors were utterly convincing, the flying bugs less so, the tanker (beetle) bugs even less so, the brain bug was only convincing close up and the artillery bugs were rather blatantly not there. I don't really see whats wrong with stop motion, I dont hate CGI but it does tend to make things really......"shiny" for want of a better word. Basically, I'm not trying to make this film out to be wonderful, but I think its moral ambiguity was what made some people hate it and the reason I loved it, I can make up my own mind,and that goes for both conventional gung-ho all american values as well as modern PC stuff (and no, I'm not right wing). Far better this way then the "the bugs may have big teeth and breathe fire, but they're nice guys deep down and your just prejudiced" message that some people would have liked to have been in there.</fullReview>

It seems like Verhoeven is right in his satire beyond what i expected... this is so symptomatic in fact...So, *SPOILERS* - of course the extensive use of fascist (or even nazi) emblems is done on purpose, - of course the only good character (Flores, who is also the only student opposing the teacher M.Ironside in the classroom) has to meet a cruel death, - of course it is the human the aggressor, and not the bugs, - of course buenos aires looks like L.A. and people play football there,- of course the world's capital is Geneva (ever heard of Societe Des Nations, later to become United Nations ?) and the parliament hall looks like Hitler's reichstag, - of course all we know about planet earth is through silly media cnn-like cuts, since all we talk about here is a military fascist society whose values are uniformization of its people, and the destruction of anything different.This is a true B-Movie style gem, with a fierce satire of contemporary US society, with on top of the cake the amazing special-effects-cherry. i give it a 9/10.</fullReview>

Personally, I felt the characters spent too much time "in training," and the film dragged at times.I found the bugs themselves to be very convincing, and can only say at least there were no cockroachs! Although there were some very big beetles to deal with. Even better was the ending. There being no clear cut answers just popping up out of nowhere.All in all... I would have to say the absolute best part of Starship Troopers was Dina {Dizzy Flores} Meyer. It was great seeing her in action. Also having seen Ms. Meyer's guest appearance on "the Outer Limits" {Free Spirit}, I am very much looking forward to her appearance as Barbara Gordon in "Birds of Prey" this fall. Unlike the recent Reign of Fire I saw, I would recommend Starship Troopers to anyone.</fullReview>

Te cheesy acting and the awful lines are there on purpose. Verhoeven wanted to make a soapopera in space. So he casted actors from alot of tv-shows. Casper Van Dien and gorgeous, sexy Dina Meyer both appeared in Beverly Hills 90210. If you compare this movie to the other flicks, Verhoeven has done, you know that he can do better with casting and make people act better. But it works here. The fact that that theyre fighting giant bugs alone, means not to take it seriously and peoples comments like "the only good bug is a dead bug" and the scene where kids are crushing bugs, cheered on by adults is very ironic. I cant believe you people cant see that. And not all the actors are bad. Casper Van Dien makes Mark Hamills performance in Star Wars look like and academy award performance. But Diana Meyers is a good actress, far better than Denise Richards, whom I hate even more every time I see this film. Michael Ironside and Clancy Brown are both excellent and the general that they find on planet P is also very funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aside from the obvious Nazi symbolism there are lots of interesting parallels to 1930s Germany even before the main characters join the federal service. We can see that violence and domination is endemic in the system through education and sport and that the populace is completely under the thrall of state propaganda.Any doubt whether this is just a dumb movie or a satire is dispelled with some great scenes such as the finale of Doogie Howser reading the bugs mind then declaring "it's scared" which prompts a victorious cheer from the crowd and the handling of humanitarian values - "my mother told me that violence never solves any problem"- being dismissed outright and condescendingly by Ironside.I thought Van Dien and Meyer put in good performances with appropriate levels of cheese added.And the gore shots were cool too (especially the decapitating winged bugs!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is supposed to be silly, it is supposed to be campy. Verhoeven is invoking the ridiculousness of the Capra recruitment films. Post World War II Argentina was a haven for escaped Nazi war criminals. Rico and his friends are the descendants of that heritage: blond-haired blue eyed aryans now faced with the choice of national service in a society that obviously rewards the working class over the merchant class, much like the perverted version of socialism propagated by the Nazi Party. These Ken and Barbie soap stars engaged in graphic action is exactly what those films of the forties were based on: gorgeous American boys fighting the Hun.The reason there is no ending is because like all the films of era, the war was not over yet, the end of the movie drops all subtlety and picks up the flag with the flying text and the super rifles. If all else eludes you, watch the Fox News Channel/CNN style "Would You Like To Know More Than YouCould Ever Possibly Need To Know Just So You Can Feel Like An Informed And Empowered Member Of Society" ads that break up the narrative. Soldiers passing out bullets and letting kids play with their rifles in an Idyllic public park, the capture, trial and execution of a criminal that takes all of 8 hours and the little bits of important tactical information provided by the jack booted "Military Scientist" telling you to aim for the nerve stem. The biggest giveaway for me is the casting of the sweet, innocent Doogie Howser, MD as the leather trenchcoat wearing SS Obherst. Paul Verhoeven and Ed Neumeier knew exactly what they were doing in this movie and they pulled it off perfectly. Buy it on DVD and listen to the commentary, brilliant.</fullReview>

Sure it is filled with all the elements that you want in a summer popcorn flick but in the end, you find that you are rooting for the bad guys. Here is a quick rundown of my interpretation. Earth is a Nazi State. Bugs are Jews (or whatever ethnic/national group you choose).Earth invaded the Bugs' planet and they are simply fighting back. The movie we are watching is a Nazi propaganda film designed to accomplish the same as Nazi (and american and japanese) propoganda films of the 30s and 40s, portray the enemy as soulless monsters. By presenting the enemy literally as monsters, Verhoeven manages to convince the audience to fall for the same propaganda tricks that worked 60 years ago. It isn't until the final shot, when they depict the brain bug being tortured, electrocuted, that this is all completely clear. I know a lot of people see this as simply a movie filled with gore and cool fx but to me it is unprecedented in its ability to manipulate the audience for a lesson in fascism. I could go on and on but every element of this film serves the purpose of the satire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite Gory, but good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be one of the most goriest films I have ever seen in my life. People get sliced open, decapitated, halved, burnt, limbs off and all sorts of sick stuff. The movie itself is pretty cool. The whole recruiting process was very interesting. The battles between humans and bugs are very interesting, but that's when all the gore kicks in. Casper van Dien, Denise Richards, Dina Meyers, Jake Busey, Seth Gilliam, and the rest of the cast was cool. Their characters were cool enough and I liked them a lot.Overall the movie and plot story is very good and the acting was good. The only thing that stopped me was the gore. I literally threw up. Rating 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>superior action film with a hidden message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to mention the two things I thought to be not so good or even questionable. First, the idea of using biting commercials to introduce the audience to the tune of the movie has been used in the RoboCops before. So, this appeared a little outworn. Second, the anti-military message is kind of hidden behind the catching support story. If you don't pay attention to a few short key dialogues, you might get the impression of this film being a glorifying war hero movie. But if this and a lot of gore is no problem for you, this film is one the most outstanding SciFi movies out there! I love to rewatch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mankind vs. giant bugs from outer space? Superiority, despite lack of knowledge of the enemy? Invincible suddenly becomes vincible in the face of danger? Does citizenship really offer everything that it p</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of "Starship Troopers" is that it's set sometime in the future. The world has almost become a completely fascist military society in which everybody is trying to become a "citizen" of the Federation. I think the message that the Federation is trying to get across to everyone is "if you're not a citizen, you're not even a human being." I actually think that is a lower form of brainwashing by the government. Little do the people who are new in the Federation know, is that an interstellar war is about to break out between humans and an alien race of insects that live on a not too distant planet. I agree with several previous comments about this movie making fun of American patriotic war movies. Being an American myself, I know I should probably disagree with all of this, but I don't because it's true but only to an extent. "Starship Troopers" seems to me, to mirror what happened after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The bugs in this movie destroying a major Earth city reflects the Japanese bombing Pearl Harbor. After either event, people in both situations were becoming very eager to enlist in the armed forces to fight and get revenge for what the enemy had done to their beautiful communities. This also brings me to another point. Referring to the movie, how much did we really know about the bugs? Why is it, that we would go to a foreign planet and fight an alien species that we hardly know anything about? This says something about the military's role in these kind of situations. This tells us about the importance of military intelligence in a war-time situation. This is something that Ridley Scott's "Black Hawk Down" will (hopefully) teach us about before sending our boys to a foreign land. Another point I would like to bring to light, is the "invincible" attitude that the soldiers in the movie had towards the bugs. It amazed me that Sergeant Zim(Clancy Brown) was able to give the recruits this image and then on the battlefield some soldiers went nuts and got themselves killed or chickened out at the last minute and got themselves killed. It was not surprising though that the soldiers were easily overwhelmed by the monstrous bugs and that their large numbers were brought down drastically from 100,000+ to probably no more than 20,000 in one hour. Of course, after the fiasco with first wave assault against the bugs, we got smarter and began to learn more about them and then learned the presence of a "brain bug" somewhere on the planet. Almost like the Queen Alien from "Aliens".I think that it is best to watch this movie with an open mind since everybody here seems to either love or hate this movie. I loved "Starship Troopers" and it is Paul Verhoeven's third best film, with "Total Recall" being number two and "RoboCop" being number one. Rating: 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me break the news to all you people who just didn't "get it" (sorry for this over-used expression). Starship Troopers IS a satire! Yep, honestly! I mean, Verhoeven himself stated so on the filmmaker's commentary audio track of the DVD. One might argue against the artistic value of this satire, but not that is actually is one. So all of you who are disappointed that Verhoeven didn't make a movie faithful to the novel, let me tell you one thing: you're either a Heinlein fan or a closet fascist (which is all the same to me). Come on, how could any director with his senses intact have directed the film without making it a parody of it's blatantly totalitarian and fascistic literary version? The "actors" can't act (with exception of Michael Ironside)? Duh, well Verhoeven wanted it to look like Buenos Aires 90210, that's why. Plot holes concerning the bugs' ability to wage war? That's exactly the point, because who - apart from the cheesy, jingoistic news-reels - tells us that the bugs actually ever attacked Earth? "In order for Earth to survive, Klendathu must be destroyed", and then the graphic shows us that Klendathu is at the other side of the galaxy, millions of light-years away...yeah, right. And the entire rest: Nazi uniforms, televised executions, needing a license to get a baby, having to serve in order to vote, the stylized Nazi eagle as symbol of the Federal Service, the glorification of violence in classroom, kids playing with assault guns, the machismo and militarism, Doogie Howser as an SS officer...anyone who actually took this movie seriously must be severely mentally and/or morally impaired!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the future youngsters are encouraged to pursue their dreams by becoming 'citizens' and completing a term of federal service. The story chronicles a group of high school kids who enlist in the Federation, then find themselves fighting in a full-scale war against a planet of alien bugs. The bugs are much more formidable enemies then they appear to be however, and Earth's soldiers must band together to ensure that the human race remains the dominant species now and always. An inventive, energetic, episodic, often funny mix of war and science fiction with high-tech action sequences, violent battle scenes, and clever, satirical ideas about the nature of war and humans. Deliberately unsettling at times, but a lot of fun. ***</fullReview>

"Starship Troopers" is an extremely cynical movie, movie goers are not used to this radical approach. Probably that's why the film is underrated by many who have seen it.

		<shortDescription>I'm from Buenos Aires and I say Kill'em ALL !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think a lot of people don't understand that this movie uses a lot of revolutionary propaganda techniques brought forth by Leni Riefenstahl in Triumph of the Will. This was a WWII piece that helped Hitler maintain favor of his people despite the long and terrible fighting. Some of these are, for instance, large assemblies of troops in formation, military speeches given before large audiences, and icons/flags waving before the camera. The reason that Triumph of the Will was so popular was that it showed a reunited Germany after the disappointing defeat at the Treaty of Versailles (WWI) and the shame of a nation that ensued. This movie (among many others) brought together the Germans against the rest of the world, joined together in a 'Thousand Year Reich'. In Starship Troopers this timeline is subtly referenced. For instance, you can see that even before the bug meteor many of the older citizens have the scars of war (Rasczak, the anatomy teacher, and the paper-pusher at the enlistment station) - this sort of earlier war would conceivably fuel the fire to 'Destroy the Arachnid threat' whatever the consequences. These techniques help to anger the viewer towards the unfeeling, merciless enemy who threatens civilization.It's a different type of film that appeals to a lot of people who don't appreciate it for what it's worth. I'm glad that this futuristic tale of space cowboys and killer aliens was done by the director of RoboCop and Total Recall, because anyone else would have settled for inferior special effects. This is definitely is definitely Paul Verhoeven's best work in recent years because it employs all the best CGI special effects for all the blood thirsty groundlings, but it pays homage to great a European director whose work affected his life. Imagine growing up during WWII in the Netherlands - he was born in 1938 in Amsterdam.</fullReview>

You can hate it because you're not smart enough to understand it or hate it because you're too smart to understand it.

It show the power of propaganda movies. Well if some people have a problem with a movie that doesn't state clear positions. 99% of films they see the bad are really evil and the good guys are almost saints. Just listen to the mood of the sound that is used when a bad guy/girl appears. Well Starship Troopers tries to make the "bad" guys likable. And the "victims" aren't portrayed as helpless to make it easier for the viewer to pick sides.Criticizing Paul Verhoeven for the movies he made in the US is easy. But you must understand that America isn't a place where you can make the movie you want and he stated that he hasn't made a movie the way he wanted since he came to the US. Well he can either make these movies or do nothing at all. Starship Troopers is probably the movie where he had some degree of freedom. Americans are so quick to judge a movie as bad if it contains to much gore and sex while they seem to like it more than others. I'm not bothered with this it isn't something that makes a movie nor does it break it.</fullReview>

I think it was extremely entertaining as well as funny. The effects were great (okay, giant bugs cutting people in half!) and the storyline was relatively well done.Even though the story of love between working class dude Johnny Rico (the delish Casper Van Dien from Sleepy Hollow) and smart girl Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards from Wild THings and The World is Not Enough) is cliche, it satisfies the romantic requirement needed in almost every movie these days. Darn good supporting performances from Dina Meyers as Dizzy Flores and our fave Doc Junior, Neil Patric Harris as Carl.I strongly recommend this film. It contains elements of humour, as well as great special effects and fantastic action sequences. The perfect balance for a movie these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent sci-fi war film with an absolutely awful ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the first hour, Starship Troopers is just amazing. The film is set up extremely well, the story is very well-told, and the military training scenes in particular are especially effective in communicating the situation of the human race as it is portrayed in the film. However, the film had what I like to call a "hit by a truck" ending. There didn't seem to be enough of a conclusion reached, the film just kind of stopped. This could mean that the film studio simply ran out of money, or that they are just leaving room for a sequel, but either way, it is just too abrupt.Besides that, it seems that the film as a whole (and especially the first three quarters of it) draws more from Orson Scott Card's classic science fiction war novel "Ender's Game" than it does from Robert Heinlein's novel on which the film is supposedly based. True, the characters aren't children, as they are in Ender's Game, but their activities are virtually identical.Starship Troopers is definitely worth watching; the special effects are spectacular, the war scenes are amazing but also incredibly graphic, and even the relatively modest futuristic atmosphere is more convincing than the usual flying cars and alien-looking clothes (as in Back To The Future II). The film could stand a few improvements in acting and scripting, but as a whole it is a relatively satisfying science fiction film that, despite its disappointments, I definitely recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read Robert Anson Heileins novel, and though not a great novel, its story is intelligent and realistic - a la Heinlein. Its terrifying to see its adaptation to the big screen - a.k.a. Starship Troopers The Movie. Experiencing this movie is not far from experiencing first hand a horror situation. This movie is one of the most ridiculous pieces of...junk ever made in Hollywood. Special effects apart, this is one example more of the Verhoeven type movie.  This dutch director, apart from the cold and realistic Robocop and the infamous movie starring Sharon Stone and M.Douglas, has no big credits on his behalf. His stories are weak, silly, the way he tries to portray the future is pure trash, a bad satire, a bad joke. This man has no grasp for science-fiction, no grasp for social tendencies and scientific rules. Ok, the aracnides are fantastic, the special effects are great, but what about the story? What about characters and character? Is this dutch director expecting us to believe a story where its characters, after knowing they have just lost their families, smile when they know they are to be reinstated in the Army? Or smile when they are promoted, right after seeing so many of their colleagues die horribly? Or are we to expect and believe that our society has the tendency to decay so much as to watch an execution, LIVE, in a holoscreen?  And the worst is that Heinleins novel is entirely different from this trash. The social criticism and speculation imbedded in it were simply laid to waste. Who does mr. Verhoeven think he is when he (or his screenwriter) distort a novel and a story by an all-time master of science-fiction? I mean, why was there a need to distort the real Starship Troopers? Do they think they can outbest a master and a genius like Heinlein? The actors chosen for this movie suffered a great setback in their careers - at least the young ones. Michael Ironside is the best thing in the entire movie - well, he and the Aracnides. The other actors' acting range from ridiculous to simply silly. They just played the way they told - or knew, I suppose. If I knew beforehand, I would have avoided this movie like the plague. Its awful, a true nightmare. AVOID IT IN VIDEO, AVOID IT THE WAY YOU CAN. AND HOPE THAT THIS DIRECTOR NEVER DIRECTS AGAIN OR CHANGES THE WAY HE DOES IT.</fullReview>

Not only does it possess some very clever satire on fascism and society's need to have an enemy, but it also scores big laughs by being so over the top and absurd. The violence was not horrifying, as some have claimed, because it was so graphic that it became a joke. No one sitting in the theater when I saw it understood that having arms and legs and torsos flying around during all the battle scenes, along with the overdramatic music in the background, could only have been put there to get a laugh. And the finale, where they capture the brain bug (which, naturally, is shaped like a giant brain, I mean, what's funnier than that?) by throwing a giant net over it had me laughing so hard I was unable to see straight.

What I got to see was one of the best Ati-Warmovies of all time(nearly comparable to Apocalypse Now).Ok some blame the movie for its violence but strangely those people who blame ST for the violence say nothing when Spielberg uses it in his Propaganda-Movie "Saving Private Ryan"(cmon not all germans were Nazis in WW 2)."Saving" was much more violent and strangely you felt sorry for the bleeding GIs but wanted to cheer everytime a german got killed.Not in ST. Actually you feel sorry for the Brain in the end. In ST the audience finds out more and more throughout the movie that the bugs reacted in Self-Defence and were not responsible for the war.(Check out the Audiocommentary on the DVD!)This movie was made for 3 kinds of people:1.Intellectual : They realized that the Fed-Net spots were nothing but "copies" of CNN spots shown during the Gulf War(which leads us back to the Propaganda by the medias used nowadays).Youve got to realize that the US more and more has become a fascist Nation(anti-Islam, anti-Black, anti-Jews).Thats something this movie showes: The perfect World in ST can only exist as long as there is an enemy(like in the US:"fighting Irak is boring lets go get some Jugoslawians")2.Gorehounds: They got to see violence, guts, people melting and so on... OK let them have fun as long as they get the bitter tone of the film.....3.People who think that everything in this world is Perfect: Often those people are the ones who underrate movies like this one or they just dont want to hear the critique on their homecountry.I liked this movie a lot because the filmmakers tried not to abuse my Intelligence like "ID 4" did. This is not a movie you forget when you leave the theatres....well as long as you are a "Number one kind of guy/girl."Speaking for me I am a mixture of 1 and 2 (yes I love Action-Flicks and even more if they have an intelligent tone).</fullReview>

Effects: scenes of guys firing weapons weren't even matched to the damage the bugs were taking. Space shots were well-done, and the fractured starships looked incredible. Direction: reasonably good. Verhoeven, of course, takes the gore and violence to an extreme. Great scenes of humans getting ripped apart by the bugs, though, and a very amusing training accident. Credibility: near zero. The combat fortification sets looked really cheesy. Why, after centuries of accumulated military knowledge, are we sending in lighly armored ground troops, with basically inadequate weapons, and NO constant close-air support? Or how about the lack of space-borne pre-assault bombardments? Although I am quite capable of "just enjoying" a popcorn film such as this, when a film just outright does things for no logical reason, or insults my intelligence (a la Armageddon), I CAN'T get any fun out of it. It's a ham-fisted satire of fascism and the military mindset. It should have been either a gritty space-war film, or a more clever, more subtle piece of military mockery. Not this jumbled mess.</fullReview>

Hard to believe. The amount of Nazis and Fascists in America would fill a couple of softball teams. Europe is the birthplace of Nazism, Fascism and Communism--not to mention two World Wars. There is an old saying, "The dark night of fascism is always falling in America, but lands only in Europe." If Verhoeven intends this to be anti-American, he utterly missed the mark. Obviously he doesn't understand the country, which is typical of foreigners. If the movie is anything, it is anti-European.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave it a 4, but only because of the special effects. If not, it's more like a 2 or a 1. This movie was built for teens, and it doesn't make any apologies for it either! Sorry, but the story is weak, and when I view a Sci-Fi film, I like it to be believable which this is far from.If you admire GORE, this move takes the cake. Enjoy the blood, guts, and holes in the heads!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kill dem Bugs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok. I saw this movie 'illegally' in the theatre with a good friend of mine that was over 18, so I was able to sneak into the theatre with him. When it first started, I thought 'Oh great. Another poppy ass movie with high school preps moving on to being college preps.' I was greatly contradicted. As soon as the scene with the giant bug disection, I decided to give this movie a chance, rather than walking out, going home, spankin and goin to bed.I think this movie is more leaned to the male viewers. It had everything a guy could want in a movie: war, death and sex. What more can your typical male want? I think that it didn't deserve the R rating, but a PG-13 or PG was more in order. Titanic had 1500 people freezing and drowning in the middle of the North Atlantic, plus it had some rather nice tittie scenes of Kate Winslet (drool :P~~) but it only got a PG-13. That just shows how people deserve to watch some giant insects getting their asses blown off by preppy teenagers, with a seemlessly endless supply of ammo. Go see the damn movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprisingly Good Movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My expectations before viewing 'Starship Troopers' were not that high. I expected the usual no-plot action movie which takes itself far too seriously in its bid to emulate Star Wars. However, upon actually viewing the film, I found it not only to be a great, not to mention gory action movie, but also hilariously funny too. After a brief introduction which outlines the 25th century scenario and the relationships between the three main characters as they graduate high school,and join and train for the military in bids to become 'citizens' (so they have rights to vote etc.), the film cuts between the main action (mainly fighting, but with the added extra of some surprisingly good interaction between fairly well developed characters) and a 'computer information system', which the film uses as a method to inform the viewer on some of the more important background information. The film portrays itself as all out action, but I also found some of the scenes remarkably satirically amusing, which is probably intentional. It is also surprising deep, as the soldiers quickly learn that the alien 'arachnids' outclass them not only physically, not mentally as well, which reminds us that man may not rule the roost forever. Overall, then, I strongly recommend Starship Troopers. It has enough gratuitous violence to please the action fans, but has enough besides this to entertain most.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've heard anything in advance about Starship Troopers, you at least know not to expect taut drama or even a decent adaption of Robert Heinlein 's novel.I cannot figure out if this is one of the worst or best movies I've ever seen. There's no doubt it's all tongue in cheek, but I think there was purposeful casting of actors with limited ranges; it painted an interesting picture of the future.Some of the bug-related gore was fantastic. I think this puts horror movies to shame. The scare/disgust factor in this film is such a better movie value than the tired thrills of Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer. I haven't squirmed this much in my seat since I almost walked out of Mimic last year. (Perhaps I have a serious aversion to bugs.)This movie really excited me. I don't think I've seen anything like it. I really didn't care for Basic Instinct and hated Total Recall. But this is movie Schlock as it's supposed to be. This is the movie that Godzilla could have been.Doogie Howser was disappointing. I would have liked a more suitable actor in that role, but again, they might have been saying something about the limited role of real emotions in the future.Also, I do advocate just relaxing your reality when it comes to ST.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film full of comic gags and funny moments, but without leaving out a great dose of realism in the scenes. The effects are really sensational, and contribute to the atmosphere of fantasy the film wants to spread. In my opinion it follows the line of Mars Attacks! but with better results. It stands all the time on the thin line between Comedy and serious Science Fiction and never goes off from it. The unidimensional and young characters are a perfect choice for this kind of production. Verhoeven really knows how to get us into his world, and I really like it !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Verhoeven has decided that movies about societies scantily clad (Showgirls) are not his forte. And rightly so has gone back to excessively violent SCI-FI/action films. After watching showgirls 5 to 26 times its refreshing (ahem).Starship Trooper's concept, alien bugs that hurl meteors at us is so far beyond reasonable thought to try for realism. So Thankfully it doesn't even bother. Visual sight gags and dish water weak plot keep pace nicely with the excessive violence creating a nice comic book feel. It almost allows us to be fooled into thinking that we are watching art. All this being said it takes a predictable Hollywood approach and focuses on the fun that can be had with special effects, heaving bosoms and the loading politically correct bad guys with as much lead as they like with out the possibility of getting some random minority rights group ticked. Its an enjoyable film (if you are a guy) and definitely worth a look on DVD if you some how managed to miss it until now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A futuristic film tinged with a very satirical tone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually, I needed a few minutes to understand that Starship Troopers mocks different other films. The plot happens centuries after our times ; we immediately observe a new world, divided between humans and huge monsters, called arachnids. One can understand quickly that it answers to lots of theories, some of them were even the subject of other sci- fi films, like "Aliens" (1976 and 1986).I consider this film to be visionary : in 1985, they already developed a complex scenario with huge bogs, trying to attack Earth, but also military bases on other planets. Because it is a whole ironic theory : humans would be in war against kind of aliens. It has something of a propaganda, that makes sometimes laugh. It remembered me totalitarian countries doing propaganda, like Nazis. The sentence : "Do you want to know more ?" becomes awkward all over the film, because of its repetition and aggressive tone.It is also an answer to technological progress ideas : there are issues about an eventual world only composed of robots, and a presence of human life beyond Earth. Aside from the bloody side of humans being killed, the film could please to a child : it is plenty of robots, and spatial ships... But the story definitely does not have to be taken seriously. Even the soundtrack is exaggerated; it is very emphasized throughout the film, through a very patriotic and heroic tone.I made a comparison between the Federation, which refers, in the film, to the single united government of Earth, and the United States. Aside from this huge war, this world seems to be an utopia, where everyone can decide of his future life and meet wonderful people. There is a huge propaganda led by authorities ; for instance, at the end of the film, the TV broadcasts the capturing of the "Brain" of the bogs. This broadcasting does not cease calling viewers to join the Fleet if they want to be heroes like the ones from the film. There is a real brainwash, the same way as the US did to defend their imperialism during the Cold war.Nevertheless, as a conclusion, I found that the main actors : Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards and Neil Patrick Harris interfered well in their respective roles of the perfect lovers and students who sacrifice their relationship for the benefit of their career.I think that it is overall a great success, when you understand the hidden critical realized by Paul Verhoeven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoy, but save us from your "deep thoughts" It's not much more than an action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Opposed to the one who thinks this is a subtle film, you have to be completely clueless to not get the "point". This is as subtle as having an elephant stomping through your living room. Doubt me, then check the scene about 20 minutes in with the ex-soldier "Infrantry made me the man I am." If you don't get it, you probably are too stupid to read this. The one thing this movie and the goofs reviewing it exposes is that people really fail to understand fascism. The thing you most fail to understand is it's practically the same as those wonderful socialist nations. Can't see any difference between the two theories in reality, just like this movie. Finally, feel free to enjoy the movie, it's not bad, but for all you giggling in glee thinking this an attack on US Imperialism and the stupidity of it, I've got to think you're as stupid as the military in this movie. Things like this, and the "intellectual" reviews are really simplistic and incapable of anything but superficial thought. This movie is not subtle, not nuanced, not deep (presents only 1 view and fails to consider any other arguments), and not anything more than Robocop Goes to War. But, hey, I liked both movies. I'll buy that for a dollar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absurd Verhoeven satire and lots of dismemberment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps a casting director's idea of a joke to put the up and coming talents of Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards, Jake Busey and Dina Meyer, who was hilariously awful in her big screen debut 2 years earlier in Johnny Mnemonic, into a Verhoeven film - who was coming off the infamous Showgirls. These 30 year old high school students have the kind of vacant look on their faces and stilted dialogue readings, that being thrown into a fascist satire of sorts never derails the film from their awful acting. That Starship Troopers exists at all, let alone in its full gory, demented glory, is that Sony went through numerous short lived regime changes and execs at Columbia were largely unaware of the film - until Verhoeven delivered his extremely expensive and absurd gorefest to the new regime. It tanked worldwide, wasn't kindly received by critics and has now lived a long and prosperous life in various iterations of home video. Despite the B movie premise of intergalactic bugs who are at war with humanity, it's the satirical take of 'lets all go to war and die' as Verhoeven puts it, that keeps this from ever becoming schlock - which it most certainly would be in lesser hands. The film goes on for far too long, especially the first act, which back in 1997 was ridiculed as Melrose Place in Space, but once the second act kicks into gear, it's a relentless onslaught of mayhem and quirky Verhoeven trademarks. There's dual gender shower scenes, bloodletting by the gallon, a brainbug that was designed to be an ungodly mix of an anus and vagina and fascistic art and set design. A battle sequence inspired from Zulu is a highlight. The visual effects hold up remarkably well and Starship Troopers is still one hell of a time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a full review, rather a counter to those that say that this movie is an excellent parody of fascism.To talk about fascism is to talk about the past in a convenient historical way which means we don't have to deal with these concepts in the present.Sorry guys, Robocop and Starship Troopers follow the same narrative at different points in the future of the USA. Both films are squarely aimed warnings at only one country. There are no non-US values or cultures presented in either movie so I don't understand how this is perceived as a broad jab against the dark side of WW2 politics.It's a searing jab at the potential for the US based on its current trajectory.I watched this film when it came out, at the time the media segments seemed outright ludicrous. Now they seem like Fox or CNN is today.The flag waving, monitored, ill-informed people full of righteous anger are sending their children to die in wars they are entirely unprepared for and do not understand. Do we have to go back to WW2 to identify a country like that?It's a good warning. Forget fascism and apply it to now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is a great Science Fiction movie. It is based on a book by Robert A. Heinlein. In the future, mankind is exploring the universe and encroach upon the territory of alien bugs and war begins. The insects are only responding to a threat of their territory and are trying to fight off the invaders. The clever use of insects as the aliens makes this film stand apart from other space movies.The cast is great. It is made up of great actors, many of who at the time were relatively unknown including Casper Van Dien, Dina Meyer, Jake Busey and Denise Richards, mixed with established stars like Clancy Brown, Neil Patrick Harris and Michael Ironside, taking minor roles. The star of the movie is hard to choose between Dina Meyer, Casper Van Dien (both of who suffered injuries while making this, Casper broke a rib and Dina suffered a concussion) and the bugs! However I am going to have to say the bugs are the stars. The use of real and CGI in this film is great. The bugs are a formidable foe and a very creative one. They are numerous and relentless. Cleverly the use of different species of bugs makes for some great surprises.The battles are epic and bloody. This is not a film for the squeamish, every battle is like a futuristic opening scene to Saving Private Ryan. People die in horrific ways, bodies and limbs are ripped apart and even main characters don't always survive, something I always appreciate in a film as it keeps the viewer guessing.But it is not all about war, there is a good amount of comedy and even romance in this movie. It is a great film and in the category of action Sci-Fi one of the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it's funny. i've loved this movie since it first came out and have collected all the DVD's, but i still haven't got around to reading Heinlein's classic sci-fi novel about military despotism. i've got to stop watching so many movies and read more.this year the original 'Troopers' movie will be thirteen years old. and as far as i'm concerned still one of the best and most enigmatic of all sci-fi fantasies. i'm not a big sci-fi channel fan or anything,i mostly prefer my sci-fi to be very realistic like '2001' or even Duncan Jones's 'Moon'. most of the sci-fi offerings are mostly silly and far fetched, so i don't always relate to all the preposterous, weird, notions they conjure up. i don't necessarily find 'Troopers' movies realistic, but i find them to be a little more thought provoking than usual sci-fi junk.the 'troopers' movies have always been brave, daring, and mean, tough films. also very intelligent in their examination of a society that has dispensed with democracy and fallen to military despotism. they are also sort of an enigma since they don't condemn or glorify war. they just present the ideas behind it all and let the viewer decide.i'm not saying you have to spend your time thinking about the whole thing. the 'Trooper' films make for great entertainment and are great fantasy fun. they create a world of such phantasm that is both scary, thrilling, and somewhat intimidating. i'm afraid of bugs, so looking at all those bugs all over the place always sends my mind reeling and still gives me the heebie-jeebies.the Fx are also still timely and wondrous to look at. not to mention some of the most imaginative i've seen to this day.i love the writing of Ed Neumeier and the FX of the incredible Phil Tippett, both of whom collaborated on the sequels. i don't know much about Verhoeven's skill as a director. i haven't revisited the 'Robo' flicks for a very long time. all i know is his direction here is classically skilled and almost perfect. but then, whadda i know. i actually liked 'Showgirls' and found it entertaining, so don't ask me i guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A War Movie. With future Nazis, aliens, and tactical nukes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Summary: Johnny Rico, a citizen of the militaristic and fascist Federation, joins the military because his girlfriend Carmen does. Soldiers are needed because of a war with alien Bugs. After a lot of filler, they land on the home planet of the Bugs and from then it's a war movie. As the story progresses, new and more powerful Bugs appear, and they take forever to die, and then someone kills them. The End. So why is this a good movie?Well, the disturbing thing about this movie(this was intentional) is that while the humans are Nazi-ish and brainwashed by propaganda, they're just normal people. They are not evil, it's their society that is. You care about the characters. At the end, they discover that at least some of the Bugs can feel emotion. "It's afraid!" "YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYY!!!" So in the end, this is a movie about war and its effect on people. In this case, they are Nazis. You root for them, and you feel sorry for them. Kind of like how I cheered for the humans in Avatar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Science Fiction As Propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Starship Troopers" qualifies as just the kind of flashy, trashy, creature-in-space nonsense that you would expect from the crassly commercial Dutch director Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven is the same guy who cranked out "RoboCop," "Total Recall," "Basic Instincts," and "Showgirls." Elements from all those movies appear in "Starship Troopers." If you were hoping that "Starship Troopers" was going to be a new kind of "Star Wars," get ready for a galactic letdown. Although set in a sexually liberated society that worships fascism with existentialism as a way of life, "Starship Troopers" bristles with clichs from those old democratic Hollywood movies making the rounds in American Movie Classics. A huge part of "Starship Troopers" is its metaphorical impact. The movie appropriates virtually everything from the sci-fi, horror, western and war movies of yesteryear. The bug villains can be seen as either Apache Indians on the warpath or Japanese soldiers. The film winks at its own sarcastic racism. The humans revile the bugs with the language that our white ancestors used to revile both the Native Americans and Japanese soldiers. At times, this handsomely produced hyper-kinetic space opera ridicules World War II era propaganda movies when it is not out to out blast the last epic movie. Despite its fabulous, state-of-the-art, CGI special effects, "Starship Troopers" is really just a live-action video game. Indeed, both dazzling to look at and exciting to watch, this Verhoeven film is as phony as a hologram. The chief problem that the filmmakers struggle with is unloading all the exposition. Like "Dune," "Starship Troopers" has to tell its audience a lot of material about its futuristic society and its villains before the plot can launch. In the society of the future, you have got to join the military to obtain the right to vote. Only citizens can vote. You can only become a citizen when you have served a hitch in the military. Once again, despite its future setting, the military dresses in regalia that borrows much from the defunct Nazi storm troopers crossed with U.S. Desert Storm soldiers. "Starship Troopers" is like one of those parallel universe "Star Trek" episodes where everything is turned inside out.Meanwhile, instead of using light sabers, these warriors tote supercharged M-16 assault rifles that never run out of ammunition. You would think that a future world would have developed a more deadly weapon than a machine gun. Rich kid Johnny Rico (Casper Van Diem of "90210") joins up to stay in close proximity to his sexy high school sweetheart Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards of "The World Is Not Enough"). He enlists in the Mobile Infantry or the Marines, while she suits up as an officer who flies space liners. The parents of our protagonist try to warn him about chasing girls like Ibanez, but he refuses to listen until the day that Ibanez dumps him. He loses a Marine during a combat training exercise and is about to wash out when the bugs from the other side of the universe come a-calling. Allegedly, the Edward Neumeier screenplay is based on the legendary Robert Heinlein science fiction epic. Friends of mine who know the book backwards, forwards, and sideways claim that its resemblance to the film is marginal. "Starship Troopers" resembles vintage Hollywood war movies, such as "Sands of Iwo Jima" and "Battle Cry," where the guys graduate from boot camp to combat. The biggest difference here is that both the guys and the gals endure the rigors of basic training. Not only does the liberal fascist military admit babes to the battlefield, but it also lets them shower with the guys. Basically, after an introduction to the grisly arachnids, "Starship Troopers" recycles all of those familiar war movie clichs. Casper Van Diem favors a young John Wayne, and the casting deliberately exploits his resemblance, especially when he delivers the famous "saddle up" line that Wayne relied on in "Sands of Iwo Jima." One of the biggest liabilities of "Starship Troopers" is its no-name cast. You identify with the heroes instead of the actors portraying them. In "Star Wars," the no-name cast worked because the characters were special, but the "Starship Troopers" characters constitute a generic bunch of streamlined stereotypes. The last Verhoeven movie "Showgirls" infuriated everybody with its casual nudity and lurid subject matter. "Starship Troopers" succeeds in reverse. Verhoeven loosens tons of glitzy realism, vicious bugs that eviscerate humans, buckets of blood &amp; gore, and nominal sex in the form of a video game. Moreover, he shoots "Starship Troopers" with a tongue-in-cheek question: Would You Like to Know More? The underlying comparison between this sci-fi movie and the recent wars in the Middle East is unmistakable. Nevertheless, this far-out but formulaic sci-fi adventure is nothing special, but it makes for lowbrow entertainment.</fullReview>

The depiction of the aliens is done very well, and their hostility is described as just their natural state which I think works. Great battle scenes that are unique and unlike any other film about combat I have ever seen. I think comparisons to war movies like The Longest Day are completely ridiculous. Really a must see for SF fans. Gory in places, but it is important to this film to describe what little value human life has to such an enemy, and to an extent, what little value human life has to the future governments of Earth.

		<fullReview>Although Ed Neumeier's script relies a little too much on contrivance and coincidence to be wholly satisfying, Starship Troopers still manages to be a thoroughly enjoyable piece of comic-book escapism, whilst at the same time successfully satirising fascism and the futility of war, once again proving that no-one does ballsy, big-budget sci-fi with subversive undertones quite like director Paul Verhoeven.An outrageously violent adaptation of Robert A. Heinlein's book (of the same name) Starship Troopers presents a future where the Earth's population is divided into two groups: civilians and citizens. In order to attain citizen status, which affords a person certain perks not available to civilians, one must 'do their bit for society'; for teenager Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien), this means joining the military for a tour of duty against the nasty insect-like aliens that have been launching attacks on Earth from across the vast expanses of space.Packed with gung-ho action, outrageous gore, and CGI effects that still look great today, Verhoeven's film is a magnificent, non-stop barrage of bloody conflict?both in space and on the surface of inhospitable, bug-infested planets?that effortlessly drives home the horror of war, whoever (or whatever) the enemy and wherever the battleground.Verhoeven's naive troopers are a likable bunch of characters, but the director doesn't spare his viewers any of the gory details when it comes to them being hacked to pieces by the vicious scuttling aliens: limbs are scattered in all directions, heads are effortlessly removed by flying creatures, soldiers are burnt alive by massive fire-spewing tank bugs, and brains get sucked out of their victim's skulls.As well as offering excellent satire, superb direction, stomach-churning gore, and stunning special effects, Starship Troopers also features pitch-perfect performances from its impressive cast (which includes Bond-girl Denise Richards, toothy Jake Busey, Clancy 'The Kurgan' Brown, feisty hottie Dina Meyer, Neil Patrick Harris, and the always brilliant Michael Ironside), plus a magnificent rousing score from Basil Poledouris.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You want interplanetary war? Well, here it is!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike other science fiction movies with complicated and pretentious plots and subplots, this movie presents a simple, straightforward story about interplanetary war, with the emphasis on war. Two planets fighting it out. Two species vying for galactic supremacy. Humans vs. the non-humans. It doesn't get more direct than that. It's war and the earth is mobilized for action and action there is as those who answer the call of duty earn the highest honors and the admiration of all they protect. What makes this movie even more interesting is that the enemy is completely unlike the humans yet have the capacity to inflict great harm. There's no room for compromise. No room for negotiations. The two species cannot communicate with each other. There is no commonality between them. No third-party is going to negotiate a truce because there is no basis for discussion. Star Wars depicts war; this movie depicts a far more primeval scenario that sweeps away all the sentimental muck, leaving a much more compelling depiction of warfare, with no-holds-barred as the humans are out to pacify and even exterminate a life-form so foreign as to completely repulse the humans. For those with an aversion to insects, this movie may cause discomfort; for those who harbor a hatred for those six-legged denizens, this movie will provide the catharsis that will bring relief and joy as the humans systematically and mercilessly eradicate a menace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still much underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an unprecedented act of aggression, a long-time yet obscure Enemy razes your hometown to the ground, killing your family and hundreds of thousands others. The Enemy is uncivilized, powerful and obviously malign. Do you really have a choice but to escalate the conflict into a full-blown war in defense of our values and way of life?Maybe you do.The whole movie is of course a propaganda film, aiming to guide the audience into a belief that the 'utopian' (well, hardly) society is right to fight the bugs, and that it is wrong not to participate in this fight (ring any bells?). This is fully in line with Verhoeven's longstanding fascination with (military) propaganda: one of his first cinematic efforts was a film celebrating the Dutch Royal Marine Corps. It is therefore not so strange (but slightly disappointing nonetheless) that at the time of the movie's release many movie critics lambasted the movie precisely because of its seemingly unabashed celebration of fascism/Nazism.However, if the viewer takes a step back, removes the spin from the facts and 'figures things out for one's self' (to quote Ironside's character in the movie), instead of letting himself be sucked into the unfolding drama, he would for example notice that it is not so clear at all that the bugs are the real Enemy, as the news media would like us believe. What is, for example, the role in all this of the Mormon sect alluded to in a news snippet? If you drop the assumption that the bugs are the aggressors, what then motivates the actions of the government of the Federation (an outright militaristic global regime)? Why are we really fighting this savage war?Starship Troopers' ultra-violence doesn't romanticize war - quite the contrary - but the relentless propaganda and resulting hysteria seem to justify it. Whether or not you agree with this 'justification' is up to you, but Verhoeven makes it abundantly clear where he stands.This is more than just a great pro/anti-war movie however, as a browse through the many excellent IMDb reviews will testify. Verhoeven inserts many of his favorite themes here, satirizing contemporary (American) culture/society, questioning the moral superiority of the 'good guys', etc.And even if you really just want to view ST as nothing more than a '90210 in space bug-shooting gore fest', well, it aims to please?A subversive, prescient piece of Hollywood (!) film-making.10/10 ** Multiple viewings required! **PS: judging by the number of disgruntled Heinlein fans, if you love the book, stay away from the film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know those movies that you watch and you love them because they're so bad? Yes Ladies and Gentlemen, this is the greatest ironic movie ever created.What does it take for a movie to satisfy my ironic humor tastes? Well, the movie has to have memorable characters. Starship troopers easily delivers on this with casper van dien and many others that will have you snickering. My second requirement is that it has to have a memorable story and Starship troopers easily delivers with Planet P and the Fascist government. The third and final requirement is that there has to be a great villain or enemy in the movie and the bugs are amazing. They swarm and chop peoples heads off and wreak havoc on the forces of Earth.I highly recommend Starship Troopers, the gore comes as often as the laughter in this amazingly satisfying film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my view there is nothing sadder than a science fiction film that fails to find its audience. Starship Troopers is a noted departure from most space action and adventure flicks because of its underlying message which criticizes fascist ideals, even if it does so in a rather over-the-top manner.Paul Verhoeven always brings an element of comedy into his sci-fi escapades which makes films like RoboCop interesting even if they at first glance seem stupid and overtly violent. What I feel is most sad about Starship Troopers is the new lengths it took special-effects and was still ignored.The movie does have its weaknesses and I've always felt that the ending wasn't quite on par with the rest of the film. The gritty and dark under-current of this action-escapade is what makes it stand out and anyone who thinks they know what serious science fiction is about needs to watch this film before they can truly claim any knowledge in the field.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You kill bugs good!"A few notes about the book this film is based on "Starship Troopers", has been accused by some in the sci-fi community of being a fascist manifesto of militarism, and praised by others like the "US military" who have it on thei...(read more) r official reading lists of the navy, the marines, and the army, as well as at four out of the nations five military academies(thank you wiki), not to mention actual funded attempts to emulate the technology and combat strategy of the Mobile Infantry, all volunteer army, specific high tech weapons, exo-armor, etc.That being said the movie itself is one long propahganda commericial for the mobile infantry in their war against "the bugs". It's ads and info spots serving as comic timers, in between the explosions and limb removals. The satire get's lost in the run of the mill dialogue (but suprissingly long if inconsequential character development). Still a fun, gory, balls to the wall, action satire, and a strangely oddly important artifact of American culture. Anti-war films generally don't work because "action argues for itself", but Starship Troopers does mock it's celebratory slaughter (which perhaps the book took seriously, or perhaps not), by immersing itself so heavily in B-Movie shlock,it's almost impossible to imagine anyone taking this seriously. But the satire is really a loose excuse for me being a sucker for the kind of mindless violence than one is only really free to express when...squashing insects...a small violence we all do, often, without even considering it as a life, just a pest, a problem, or as these characters would say "the only good bug is a dead bug". Big special effects, but mocks itself inplaces, where "300" screamed "This is Sparta" in loinclothes, while referring to the Atheneans as (pacificst) "Boy lovers and philosophers". So take it with a grain of salt. WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MORE?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have written reviews of STARSHIP TROOPERS under two other names here, and the only thing I want to comment on under my latest name is the incredible use of CGI throughout this amazing film. Truth be told, STARSHIP TROOPERS is almost nothing but CGI with some live but cardboard-like actors hanging about, led by the always-wooden Denise Richards and Casper Van Dien. The viewer is never once made to believe he is watching anything other than an interstellar war, and in this way the film is right up there with the very first STAR WARS film, which successfully created a universe all its own. Verhoven and his production people have us believing what we are seeing at every turn, giant killer bugs included. I simply cannot imagine what this film must have cost to make, but the fact is STARSHIP TROOPERS uses CGI more effectively and believably than any film in the history of CGI-era films. I am not sure it can ever be topped, nor should it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like this film a great deal, and I love Heinlen's book. This is something of a conundrum, given that the film, based on the book, adopts an entirely contradictory political point of view.But there's nothing to say that both points of view don't have some validity, and that it can be a good thing to listen to both and then make your own mind up.And it is, in my mind, a good thing to have literary works (by which I mean both the book and the film) which work on the twin levels of a) flash bang wallop entertainment and b) food for thought.Dropping down to a superficial level, the CGI bugs are great (in fact all the effects are extremely good), Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards are both somewhat vapid, Clancy Brown never really convinces me that he's the same Zim as in the book, and Michael Ironside is fine. I didn't understand the need for Dina Meyer's fixation on the Rico character (I had no problem with Dizzy Flores changing sex from being male in the book) and oh how I wish they'd had the powered armour of the book - running around with machine guns in an era of interplanetary travel (and against a foe consisting of teeming hundreds of thousands of individuals each of which required multiple shots to disable) was just plain stupid.But good fun, and thought provoking.</fullReview>

Heinlein wasn't writing a story about 'Yankee Imperialism', he survived the Battle of Tarawa and wrote about the inflexibility of the military.

		<shortDescription>Everything a Sci-Fi film could need</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is one of those rare movies that you know is rubbish but you just can't help watching over and over again because it is enjoyable, which is essentially the whole purpose of watching a film. The plot is fairly basic, which is good as films like this risk becoming boring or too complicated if they try to be too intelligent. This being said however, the film weaves in a bit of political satire and romance as well as the core component of 'man vs alien-bug war'.The film itself is well made and like Robocop, features news updates during the film to keep the viewer up to date with the Trooper universe. Two sequences worth pointing out would have to be the Klendathu drop and the siege at the outpost, which as far as action sequences go are near the top of my list with the likes of the beach assault scene from Apocalypse Now.Despite the B-Movie cast, the actors really help add to the film, even if their acting is a bit wooden at times. The two actors who stand out in their performances are Clancy Brown and Michael Ironside who help to keep the feeling that the film is more than just a B-Movie.If the acting or plot doesn't convince you then the CGI should. For a film made in 1997, the special effects are something not to be sneered at. I've seen plenty of more modern films where the CGI was nothing compared to that of the film.To top it all up is the kick-ass score that was composed by the legendary Basil Poledouris, which is in my opinion one of the best pieces of music ever to accompany a film. This is ideally a traditional Verhoeven sci-fi film. Like Robocop and Total Recall, it features graphic violence and partial nudity, which although one may find unnecessary, it makes it a perfect choice for a Friday night in. Any Verhoeven or sci-fi fan would be stupid not to give Starship Troopers a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When "Starship Troopers" came out, one of my friends told me that it bore little relation to the novel on which it was based: the novel had a plot, the movie was an excuse to show naked women. But one of my mom's friends said that although the movie did lapse into a video game, it had sort of an interesting story. When we finally saw the movie a few months later, we found it fairly interesting. You see, more than simply a silly action/sci-fi flick (but make no mistake about it, those two are certainly a factor), the movie pokes fun at 1950s sci-fi flicks, what with all the "Know your enemy! Do your part!" stuff. I'm actually not surprised that Paul Verhoeven made a good movie with this one, given how well he did with "Soldier of Orange" and "Robocop".So yes, the movie rips at militarism and jingoism (the essential elements of fascism), while also finding time to show the sorts of things that easily appeal to teenage boys: pumped up action and naked babes. Casper Van Dien, Dina Meyer, Denise Richards, Jake Busey and Michael Ironside have plenty to be proud of in this movie. Worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Ford could have made half this movie, and wouldn't have approved. Sergei Eisenstein could have made the whole thing, and gotten the joke; but he wouldn't have made it because he believed in the cause. It took a cynic to make this movie. It took a victim of Nazi assimilation to make this movie.Paul Verhoeven gives us a more traditional war story than even that late-model distillation of clichs, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN; and yet while directing us toward jingoism and testosterone, he lifts the curtain on the wizard of group conscience. This movie and ROBOCOP, another Ed Neumeier collaboration, are as much about the power of propaganda as they are about their prurient elements. We glimpse the larger social pressures that lead to war and to greater evils such as conformity and personal subjugation to the movement - fine enough sentiments in wartime, but, we are reminded, it's not giant spiders from outer space who are taking away our liberties. It's just Putin, Cheney, Pfizer and other human-like enemies, using the media to market values to the people.And we like it that way. This is the cynical and unhappy moral of the story.

		<fullReview>There are some things worth liking about this film. It is quite funny at points and its social commentary---while a little muddled (this is, in part, because of the nature of its "source" material but more on that later)---it does deserve to be heard. However, it should not call itself "Starship Troopers". This film is very different from Heinlein's novel and---to the extent that it is similar---is a parody of it. I believe it is wrong to call something an adaptation of another thing when it is, in fact, a parody of that thing. Indeed, the film started off as an unrelated project called "Bug Hunt." Heinlein's novel was used as a way to sell the project.Would a person take All Quiet on the Western Front and turn it into a Catch-22 style comedy? If a person were to do so, he ought to have the decency to change the title. Heinlein's novel seriously considers the idea---and the downsides---of a liberal Republic with a highly limited franchise and using this background to ask an even more important question, What is worth fighting for? A novel written as well as Heinlein's is and asks a question of such seriousness does not deserve to be ridiculed directly: At least give it the dignity of keeping its name.I posted elsewhere about why I believe the political parody in this film is incoherent. However, I will briefly mention that characterizing this society as fascist makes no sense; a fascist society would not use commercials to get people to enlist. It would draft them. There are other details that show further how little sense Verhoven's parody makes, but I will comment on them later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the future the greatest threat to humanity is a race of huge bugs on the other side of the galaxy. These are intelligently led bugs that can send meteors toward Earth with deadly accuracy. What do we need to do? Why, blow the sick bastards to hell of course!It is precisely that naive tone that turns people off from this film. I know, because it turned me off. I initially saw it when it first came out and when I was too young to understand the idea of satire. The first satire I really got was "Dr Strangelove" which I viewed years later. The essence of war is the same here - it is bloody friggin' ridiculous in every sense of those words. Director Paul Verhoeven has an unusual understanding (from the American point of view) of fascist propaganda since he himself lived through it as a boy so his presentation of it here really requires a mature mind to grasp. Yes, on one level this movie is a relentless gore-fest with unrealistically cute leads and an uber-right wing agenda. But that's the point. This film never steps back and says it's kidding, nor did the ads present the film as "Director Paul Verhoeven presents a new satire on fascism." It just threw you into the fray. Verhoeven's previous films, especially "RoboCop" were similar in that manner. Huge evil corporations that hunger for power and vilify to the fullest their enemies and even kill them (OPC from 'RoboCop') well here we have a government doing the same thing. The enemies are literally disgusting nasty bugs, not because that is realistic, but because that is was propaganda makes enemies of the state out to be. Hitler openly announced that the Jews, Poles, Gypsies and other ethnic groups aren't really human and should be killed or serve the Aryan ideal that he imagined. They were the bugs that are shown here.I was never a gore-hound and I'll admit that even the game 'Doom' scared me when I first played it (shhh you didn't just read that!) so I thought this movie was just more luridly violent shite. As irony would have it, it is, but to show you how ridiculous it all is. This film is best with two consecutive viewings an evening apart. First watch it and enjoy or cringe at the crazy violence. Then when you watch it again, be critical, and you won't be distracted since you know where the nasty parts are. Take note of how Verhoeven inserts TV ads, posters, images of the alien home planets, and even the dialog. They are not shown in completion, but just enough to show the ridiculous gist of each one. With the worldwide US led war on terror (with the enemy in caves! coincidence?) the biting joke here is all the more relevant as we try to rid the world of "extremists" and "the enemies of democracy," and... well you know what I mean. 8/10Rated R for intense violence and carnage</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best sci-fi movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is one of my absolute favorite sci-fi movies ever, and I also consider it vastly, vastly underrated. I'm writing this comment because I have just read the original Heinlein novel. In this connection, I also watched the movie again (for the umpteenth time). I enjoyed the book, but mostly because of how I could relate it to the film. Of course, the film takes it in a totally different direction, but I was surprised by how many details from the book are included in the film (the brain-bug, for instance, though it doesn't suck people's brains out in the book). Lots of stuff in the film, including some dialog, actually comes straight from the novel, and except for the overall angle, I think the film is actually a very valid adaptation of the book.Let's face it: some things in the book just don't work. There are no real love interests in the book (Rico does join up to impress Carmen, but he never has a relationship with her, or any other girl). There's no proper plot. The whole point of the book is to show the military training and endorse a social system of insane militarism. I don't know if Heinlein was serious in espousing such a system, but those Heinlein fans who like the book and dislike the movie seem to think so. If true, the novel is actually a Utopian novel, describing Heinlein's personal perfect society. A military dictatorship where you are only allowed to vote if you have gone through rigorous military service - a sure way for the system to make sure the few voters are indoctrinated to vote for leaders that will maintain that system! Heinlein reveals a view of human nature that is incredibly cynical, and says that only an iron fist society which keeps the barbaric human propensities sharply in check can possibly result in something resembling civilization. Humans must be coerced into believing in something bigger than themselves, and any "softer" society like for instance what we have today is ridiculously naive and doomed to failure. Well, we'll see about that.Also, in the book there is a sharp separation between the sexes. Although the best pilots are women, a spaceship is divided into two parts, a male and female, and (except for some top officers) they aren't allowed to mix. In fact, there are armed guards at the doors between the sections! This is crazy.I think Verhoeven's movie is brilliant. I think he made all the right choices in the adaptation of the novel, and the movie is *incredibly* enjoyable to me. Enormously funny, enormously satirical, enormously cool, enormously good-looking; in short, an enormous success. It is a movie whose star will rise to ever higher levels as time goes by. Of that I have no doubt.</fullReview>

But you have to thank Hollywood for giving the green light for this movie. The action is top notch and so are the actors. People should also take this movie very serious because you are introduced to the ugly face of war. War is only a last resort, and it should be fought with your brains.

		<fullReview>A lot has already been said about Starship Troopers. The movie relies too heavily on special effects. The movie only supports B-actors. The story has already been done. It has even been called 90210 in space. Even though a lot of critics didn't like Paul Verhoeven's sci-fi movie, the movie was a hit. Even though this happens all the time, I do believe that a lot of critics were wrong about this movie? I think this is a great movie. I love the setting, the giant bugs, the impossibly handsome cast and the impossible odds. This is the kind of movie that makes you wonder why you never joined the army? Even though you know it's never going to be like that, you still hope it would be. Well, at least that's what I was thinking.The war statements, the war recruitments, the plot outline or even the selection of the cast in this movie are a bit over the top, but the same thing can be said about Dr. Strangelove. Don't worry I'm not comparing this movie with Kubrick's masterpiece, I'm just pointing out that Dr. Strangelove also has a (support) cast with over the top "caricatures" that a movie like this really needs. They feel right for this movie.About the political statement the movie tries to make, I do believe that war makes fascists of us all. The military planners in this movie called for a swift and direct strike at the enemy. Of course everything goes to hell. Misinformation, bad planning, manipulation of the public, a poor understanding of the enemy and underestimation of enemy forces turns the quick strike in to a long and bloody operation that does more harm than good to the heroic good guys. With the capture of the Brain Bug, the war has just begun. Does this sound familiar? I know it's pretty easy to make this comparison now but this movie can be compared to a lot of modern western wars. The movie tries to make a point (with an exclamation mark) but also tries to make it with a big nod.If you want to see an entertaining action flick with hot chicks and cool dudes battling legions of bugs against impossible odds, than this is the movie for you. If you want to see a nice parody on modern warfare and the western civilization that supports it, than this is also the movie for you. Just decide for yourself what you want this movie to be.I gave this movie a rating of 10 stars not because I think this is the best movie ever (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest holds that title), but because of the entertainment value of this movie. I've seen this movie a dozen times and it still keeps me entertained till the end.In short: Everybody should own the DVD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart and satirical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people tend to get hung up on the gore in this movie. This is fully understandable, as it's very action-packed and filled to the brim of exploding bugs and body parts flying. But once you go beyond that, you realize Verhoeven has turned Heinlein's interesting book to a smart, clever and scrutinizing satire of America and heroism in general.The plot is simple: Alien bugs attack Earth. MI, Mobile Infantry, is sent on D-day-like suicide missions to eliminate the bugs. The effects in this movie are really cool, with bugs looking and moving very realistic, and with gorgeous space fights. It's strange this movie got made in 1997... the effects of today are not as good.The characters are all morons, but that's the way it's supposed to be. The actors are nothing special, except Ironside, who get's a pretty big role as a change.There are lots of questions in this movie, about democracy, military, and sovereignty towards the unknown. It's just hidden under a fun, flesh-filled and awesomely cool action movie. Dig a bit and you'll see all kinds of interesting topics.Don't miss this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most cringe-making, awful films I have ever seen, only slightly redeemed by its very weak attempts to be tongue in cheek occasionally. Eminently suitable for you if you are a half brain-dead early teenager with a high entertainment deficit.Denise Richards almost never stops grinning and is repulsive in that over-American, Farrah Fawcett Majors way. The males are forced to play stereotyped roles, with interplays of aggression and dominance. No-one is a baddie except the aliens. The worst alien is CGImation representing the last accepted bastion of prejudice - a fat thingy that is OK to hate or ridicule. The only remotely interesting thing for me was that it inspired me to google the word "hooyah" that was also used in the decent film Scent of a Woman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The F/X were awesome considering the date of it's release, but starship troopers completely missed the mark. The Book is about a somewhat oppressive future government, and i guess the movie shows this through the propaganda and uber violence. But where this movie warns against fascism the Book talked about the potential utopia of the post Democratic government, where we have somehow created a perfect filter for our government, and only the truly civic oriented people can participate. So if you want a brainless shoot em up watch this movie you will probably have a great time. But if you want political satire your better off watching a Kubrick film or reading Swift.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original novel was filled with great political commentary and thought-provoking characters.The movie turns that into "bugs bad; kill". For action, the movie's okay, but you won't feel any need to rewatch it. It's like watching a Sci-Fi Channel Original - nothing's there. There's nothing hidden underneath the CGI except the director's blank thoughts.BTW a couple people said this was a satire and/or attack against Naziism. Actually, it's neither for or against. It's filmed as a virtual clone of Hitler's "Triumph of the Will". I have no idea why the director chose that as his model. Maybe he thought it would be "cool" to mimic Hitler's propaganda films? It's not clear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It isn't every day that you see a studio let $100 million be spent on a film guaranteed to get an R-rating. Terminator 2&amp;3, Troy and Gladiator are perhaps the only other films I can name that also match those characteristics. Starship Troopers was not a success at the box office, but it has done well in the DVD market over the years. It is a very good film with something for everyone, but it may be too gory for some viewers.Our story centers on a futuristic society here on Earth who is at war with a species of giant insects on a distant planet. Our main characters are mostly young people who grew up in Buenos Aries, where apparently the English language and mostly white people will come to dominate the landscape one day. The society in which they live seems to have two classes of people. Citizens and Civilians. The citizens are people who have served in the military or in the government. We are led to believe that citizens are the upper class, but our main character comes from a civilian family and they seem to have a huge house, so it might not be such a bad thing to be a civilian, either. You do have to be a citizen to go into politics or things like that, though.To impress his sweetie, our hero Johnny Rico enlists with her into military service. Too bad for him, because he only qualifies for the infantry, where life is tough and likely short in times of war. She is sent to flight school, and another of their friends qualifies for military intelligence. After an accident in training where one of his squad is killed, Rico plans to quit the military and go back home. However, he has no home to return to. The bugs have somehow sent a huge asteroid to earth and it obliterates... you guessed it... Buenos Aries. Now Rico decides to stay in the military to help wipe out these bugs. The rest of the film has a number of exciting battles and gory special effects to keep your interest.Starship Troopers is a cut above most sci/fi films. Not only does it look fantastic, but it has some deeper philosophical motives. There is more to it than just the battles between humans and insects. We get an in-depth look at this militaristic and in some ways fascist society. The basic training footage is exceptional, and the story is narrated by a series of helpful newsreel type snippets that are always asking... "would you like to know more?" I always did.Much has been made of the fascist nature of the society and the Aryan-looking cast. It didn't really bother me because Verhoeven's direction always keeps you focusing on the battles and the f/x. I'm betting the political issues of this film were a little more prevalent at the screenplay level, and glossed over more during filming. One thing that this film's satirizing of fascism keeps tripping over is the nature of the enemy they are facing. We've all been raised to despise fascism, but when it's humans vs bugs, you can't help but root for the humans even if they are fascists. Perhaps if their enemies looked more human like in Enemy Mine, it would have been harder to cheer for the Federation. But by the time this film was over, I was cheering right along with their propaganda films. I saw the film as a shoot'em up more that a satire.The fact that this film didn't make a profit at the box office guaranteed that a good sequel would not have been made. I've not seen part 2, but I've heard it isn't good. I would definitely recommend Starship Troopers to anyone, though. It works on many levels, and it's sure to be a cult favorite for years to come.One more thing about Denise Richards. The woman is too attractive to be anything more than a model. She looks so good that you can't even pay attention to what she's saying. As an actress, she'll always struggle, I'm afraid. Charlie Sheen must be the most picky man on Earth. I wonder what the problem was. Does she grind her teeth at night or something??? 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Because in comparison this is a bad cartoon, while the novel has been in continuous print for as long as I have been alive.I have yet to see (and I went through 75 or more) even one IMDb user's comment on this "movie" catch that it bears less resemblance to the book than did Kubrick's "The Shining". To paraphrase Robert A. Heinlein -- author of the book -- this is a classic case of a screenwriter and a director "peeing in it until they like the flavor better."For a truly lucid and cuttingly accurate assessment of this alleged film, read Spider Robinson's essay "Recutting the Crown Jewels", first published in the Toronto Globe and Mail 11/97, and reprinted recently in his collection "The Crazy Years" (BenBella Books).Key quote from Spider's piece: "During the first week (of release) nearly 3 million people bought a ticket; doubtless its makers were pleased. But they COULD have sold at least another TEN million tickets."Want to learn more? See above; repeat as necessary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is so over the top in it's deadpan satire that it almost works as a comedy. I mean that in a good way. not only are the actors beautiful (most were culled from soap operas) but they have been directed to act completely one note. I assume that because NO ensemble could be this uniformly bad without being told to be so. but that's part of the fun. And Verohoven let's us in on the joke with his fascist "enlist" commercials that pop every so often. There are so many Nazi references i can't even mention them all, but a few that stick out are Neil Patrick Harris' black trench get-up and the violin one character plays for entertainment. the fx are top notch, but again this is part of the joke as ---SPOILER---they only come after over an hour of stultifyingly poor line readings and blatant fascist symbolism. But that I think is the point. Humans and giant insect are so very much alike in their societal organizations. We are both basically fascist. At least in this future. Would you like to know more?

		<shortDescription>Dutch thinking in American Satire (some spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I think this movie is great, and just keeps getting better. Chiefly 'cause even though it started out as an exaggerated copy of American Society, American Society seems to be copying more and more from this film.So yeah, I'm one of those guys who likes the political satire aspect of Troopers. And when I look among 'my kind' on this site, one thing strikes me; they tend to be Dutch, just like me. Why is it that the satire in this film is so dramatically misunderstood by US viewers, or, at best, vaguely grasped?I guess it must have something to do with Verhoevens' Dutch origins. The main theme of the movie (at least the satirical part) seems to me pointing out, one by one, What exactly he thinks is wrong with US society, according to his Good Old Dutch values, which are surprisingly mainstream and even old-fashioned by the way.The main idea in the film is revealed by Michael Ironside's one-liner: "Figure things out yourself, it's the only real freedom you've got". Incidentally this stands diametrically opposed to the main line in dutch post-war thinking: Learn from your past. The prominence of this thought has it's roots in Dutch war-trauma, and it's pretty much like the fascination with the origins of fascism that German artists tend to sport.The thought that not learning from the past is the only freedom you've got is not only wrong to a Dutch audience, it's scary. To them, not learning from your past equals a smooth asphalted highway straight to fascist hell. Of course, this different view makes the satire stand out to them like a basalt monolith, rather than the 'pea under the mattress' that American viewers tend to sense.I'll give you another example. In the first scene, Rico's bad test results are shown to a cheering audience of peers by his gloating girlfriend. In the US, where students are still ranked, this might be 'not very nice' (pea in the mattress). To a Dutchman, who tends to adhere to modesty and soberness, this is a blatant example of 'typically American competitive thinking', painting an image of American youths reminiscent of the Hitler Jugend. Giant stinging monolith in other words. And there are many more examples throughout the film.Of course, what I just called 'Dutch thinking' isn't alien at all to Americans. Yet the ideas proposed in Troopers are Absolutely alien to the Dutch. While even the most reactionary Dutchman can't get away with Trooper ideology, to an American it's just 'right wing thinking'. This complete estrangement of the Dutch with these ideas makes the satire stand out more, and therefor makes it funny. To an American, it's just too ambivalent.But do I agree with this Dutch thinking? Well, probably I do, but one has to note that it's not very Relevant anymore. The basic idea was expressed as far back as the fifties (not only here, by the way, but in the States as well), so it IS kinda corny. What then attracts me to this movie? Well, probably the idea that in some US town, let's call it "Fyfe F***ing Alabama", in Bill Hicks' terms, some people are actually giving reactions to it like: "Yeah!, Le's Kill 'em Bugs!".</fullReview>

On the one hand by modern standarts this society as a collectivist should be repulsive, but if we look at the whole perspecive, this might be just the best for conquering space. The movie is also very moving by showing some true standarts of partiotism - young men and women ready and willing to die for the good of the society. Actors do a perfect job - as for me, this is the best part ever done by Casper van Dien and Dina Meyer. Well, Richards acting is also good, not equeal, but sure beats "The wild things". Anyway the movie is perfect, just a MUST WATCH! 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Neither discernibly based on the Robert Heinlein book of the same title, nor effective military or science fiction, Verhoven's Starship Troopers utterly fails to capture either the substance, or feel of the controversial book. Instead, the film offers only neatly-packaged issues and mindless stereotyping painted with a cartoonish brush.Rather than try to address any of the issues brought up in the book (notably the meanings of civil service, franchise rights, and the definition of citizenship), the film attempts to be anti-military satire. However, the desperately poor portrayal of military training and action detract from any effective anti-military effect. In particular, he sterile production values remove any semblance of reality from the film. Ridiculous enough to be farcical, the humor lacks the energy of farce and is tongue-in-cheek without wit or irony.Lacking the science to be science fiction, the grit to be military, or the wit to be anti-war, Verhoven's Starship Troopers uses cartoon gore and Nazi-era uniforms to show us, nothing.</fullReview>

I wouldn't have expected them to stick exactly to the novel, but the fact that they would take a thought provoking novel and "adapt" it into such annoying drivel boggles my mind.

		<fullReview>The novel "Starship Troopers", while not Robert Heinlein's best, still had enough elements to be the basis for a great movie . . . and possibly a great sci-fi franchise. Well, too bad Paul Verhoeven didn't read the book, because this piece of rancid garbage is one of the worst excuses for a big-budget sci-fi extravaganza ever made.The actors couldn't act their way out of a wet paper bag. All they manage to do is look good, and to pleasantly spout trite, vacant, rah-rah dialogue.and are impossibly beautiful. Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards might as well be store-front mannequins, because that's how well they act and that's how much you care about them in the film. You actually root for the bugs to kill all the humans after awhile, because that's how unlikeable all the characters are. Only Michael Ironside manages to make any sort of positive impact, but it's not nearly enough to save the awful dialogue spouted by every other witless character.The movie also makes no logical sense at all. The story seems to have been cribbed straight from a Western (Troopers are cowboys, big evil bugs are Indians), except the situation doesn't work in a sci-fi setting. Put it this way -- if you're landing on an alien planet, does it really make sense to land on the opposite side of a mountain from an alien base, so your soldiers can be bushwhacked by aliens while crossing over the mountain to get to the base? Why not simply land next to the base in the first place? For that matter, why land at all? Why not just hit the base with tactical nukes from outer space? There's at least a good half-dozen situations like that throughout "Starship Troopers"; yes, the movie is science FICTION, but there's enough plot holes in this movie to drive a fleet of Mack trucks through them.The effects and battle scenes? Phenomenal. It's just not enough to save a stupid movie with stupid characters and slow, plodding, stupid direction. Read the book, but don't watch the movie. "Starship Troopers" = Waste of Time.

		<fullReview>This film is terrible. Awful. The fact that good people spent a year or more of their life on this film only to have it wasted on this dreck, its just very sad.Starship Troopers by Robert Heinlein is one of the classic novels of Science Fiction. It's half a utopia novel (set in a "utopian" society of Heinlein's invention) and half a war novel. Well worth reading and thinking about. Plus, it is quite exciting in places.The movie, by contrast, completely misses the point of Heinlein book (or was deliberately twisted). Heinlein's well thought out philosophy is thrown out the window after 5 minutes.All we have left is two hours of battle. And the battle scenes TOTALLY MISS the point of Heinlein's novel. In the novel, the Starship Troopers are near gods, they fly and jump around in powered armor that gives them 10 times human strength, the armor protects them from all conventional weapons, and they are able to fire nuclear missiles at their targets. Starship Troopers ARE the ultimate combat machines: as fast as a plane, as small as a man, as tough as a tank.But in this movie, the Starship Troopers are just like soldiers from the Second World War. They are not even as well equipped as modern Spec Ops forces. They are routinely ripped to shreds by the evil "spiders" who are bigger, faster, and more dangerous than the troopers. This is NOTHING like the novel. The movie is extremely gross as the humans soldiers are chewed up, ripped apart, have their brains sucked out, etc. etc. all a most disgusting fashion. Nothing is left to the viewer's imagination. Bottom line: this film is NOT worth watching. Read the novel, ignore the film.All right, the special effects shots of the fleets in outer space are kind of cool. Not worth seeing the film for but credit where credit is due. And, it must be admitted that the lead actor (and actresses) are good looking. Still not worth watching the film for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the WORST film I have seen all year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't remember a film that has disappointed me the way this one did. I had high hopes for the film, given the opening video clips (much like Robocop). Unfortunately, once the action moved back to the central characters, the film fell apart. Not one single thing made any sense. I didn't believe in the motivations of a single one of them. It got to the point where I was looking forward to seeing them die, just so that I knew the film would be over soon.The special effects are good, but that is only a small portion of a film's make up. The rest of this mindless piece of drivel shows just how stupid and gullible Hollywood thinks we really are.Sorry to say, oh wise Hollywood wizards, some of us like a film that doesn't require us to shut off our brains at the door.You want good sci-fi, go rent Robocop again and see what Paul Verhoeven can do with a GOOD script. Or better still, watch Total Recall and see what he can do with a simply mediocre one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you think this film is shallow, you're watching it in a shallow way. It works on at least two levels at one and the same time; it's both an extravagantly gory, nasty action horror sci-fi flick, and a critique on modern American gung-ho attitudes to the rest of the world. The whole world has been federalized into a Nazi-style Union, with unmistakable Orwellian overtones; the world is divided into Citizens, who can vote, have children, get good jobs, etc., and non-citizens. At the suggestion that the bugs are attacking only in defence, having been interfered with by the Federation too many times, and that a 'live and let live' policy would save the most lives, the protagonists respond aggressively and not particularly intelligently. I won't go on; there's material for a whole thesis here... but think on - Nazi Germany and military America - are there parallels? The extremity of the suggestion is cleverly camouflaged by the macho action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheesy fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a futuristic world, Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) and Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) and a select few college kids decide to become citizens in order to try to destroy a colony of bugs that are located on a planet far away.Anyone who is familiar with Paul Verhoeven will pretty much get what they expect here - there is lots of gore, a high body count, lots of gun fire and a bit of satire thrown in. All these elements are great and work well to make the film lots of fun and highly enjoyable. Before I continue on with the praise, I feel I need to draw your attention to some weaker aspects of the film....The start of the film was pretty cheesy; I wouldn't go as far as saying it was bad or boring, but it did feel a little pretentious and icky. As mentioned once the film gets going it is lots of fun, but the cut scenes between Richards and her commanding officer (sorry can't remember his name) were particularly dull and seemed to have only really been included to set up a crappy 'love interest' sub plot which was not only uninteresting and unwarranted, but also never went anywhere rendering a lot of their scenes pointless. Whilst I'm focusing on negatives, I think that the kindest way to describe Denise Richards acting would be to call it 'limited' - although she is easy on the eye which almost makes her poor acting forgivable.Back to the praise, if a mobile infantry spending 90 minutes battling a bunch of giant creatures sounds like your cup of tea then you'll certainly enjoy this film. Once the first 30 minutes are out of the way then there is never really a dull moment. Aside from Denise Richards, the acting performances are generally good with Clancy Brown being a notable highlight. This being a Verhoeven film will ultimately mean that it won't be for everyone and those that are squeamish are advised to approach this with caution. This is far from Verhoeven's best work (Robocop and Total Recall are both definitely superior to this film), but as mentioned it's enjoyable cheesy fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant Social Satire Masked as a Hollywood Sci-Fi Action Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, regard the one-dimensional, overly patriotic protagonists in the film. There is nothing that the government can do wrong, and all the soldiers portrayed in the film are not citizens of earth; rather, citizenship has been revoked as a basic human right and transformed into a privilege that must be earned. However, there is no criticism of this amongst the film's characters. In fact, they also buy into the notion that it must be earned.Secondly, regard the equally one-dimensional antagonists in the film, known as bugs. They are as evil as the soldiers are good, showing no remorse for the enemy, as well as little compassion for anything else. Their only concern is the killing off of humans, and this is done in a most sadistic fashion.Thirdly, no gray, moral quandaries are explored. No alternatives are posed, no history leading to the current events is presented. It's kill or be killed. The good can do little wrong, and the evil in the film is absolute.Finally, regard the audience watching the film. Is this just your typical American teenager looking to watch a cool sci-fi action film? Or is this really a slick propaganda piece meant to be watched by the non-citizen of Earth? Therein lies the brilliance of Verhoeven's film. It's the type of film that could only be created by the Hollywood machine, a self-reflective criticism of an industry that has typically produced films that were so biased, they could be considered propaganda. Starship Troopers has only aged better with time, especially after American misadventures in Iraq and Afghanistan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie and book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm giving this ten out of ten, and I think the 'why' will be complicated, because if the collected opinions of this review board are any indication, my opinion will make no sense.I saw this for the first time as a teenager soon after its release on video. I thought it was fun and exciting and hilarious in the way it cheesed on the propaganda. I still hold this opinion, basically, although if I hadn't read the book, I'd probably have given the movie maybe a seven or eight.But I did read the book, while in Iraq. My appreciation for it has only grown in the years since, and that's quite a thing because I really loved it when I read it. It's on the Marine Corps recommended reading list (I'm Army, and just got to it by word of mouth. I didn't associate it with the movie for a while in any way).After exposure to the book, the satire of the movie goes from being hilariously overblown upon an ignorant viewing, to something much more relevant ideologically. The book's perspective on merit, values, respect and entitlement do not lend themselves to the medium of film except in the most emotionally dense way possible, so it's no surprise that the movie didn't touch on this stuff. In loyalty to its idea, Verhoeven does no justice to Heinlein, who's other works include such culturally seditious classics as The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and Stranger in a Strange Land, and ST the movie paints with a simpleminded brush that can't be seen as a criticism of Heinlein's views on lack of sophistication alone. But where Verhoeven does do justice to the book is in the simple fact that he uses an engaging story to present a point of view without compromise, just like Heinlein did. And it is a liberal point of view, complete with the opinion that conflicts of interest all have their root in misunderstanding, complete with an inherently evil establishment of power, complete with the apotheosis of victimhood and empathy, shown here by being mostly devoid in the society as presented. This movie compares interestingly to RoboCop, another piece of Verhoeven brilliance with an uncompromising worldview.ST is not subtle satire: It's so bombastically blunt that it takes an incredibly low level of intelligence to take the film on its face and anyone who does so is the perfect argument for why Heinlein thought limiting voting rights might be a good idea. It's just right THERE, Nazi Melrose Space for the viewing free of anything remotely resembling a need for critical thought in order to criticize. It has Doogie Howser in an SS trenchcoat, for Christ's sake. You can just look at the thing and tell aesthetically that it's ridiculous. Verhoeven is not stupid and did this on purpose, and had to do so, because he had to know that any more subtle criticism of militaristic government would be lost on most viewers. And yet, still, people take it seriously as military propaganda.One more part of the book thoroughly ignored was Heinlein's take on the future between the year he was writing and the unstated year of the book. It was the late fifties when he wrote ST, not long after the birth of rock and roll and the explosion of teen-oriented pop culture. His take was that increasingly poor parenting and excessively soft perspectives on authority would create a world where juvenile delinquency was rampant. He should have added one more thing to round out this picture and become a prophet: An all-encompassing dumbing-down of culture. Look at politics, look at ideology, look at the fate of religion, look at consumerism in all its glory. The book has a limited readership by nature. It's a book, and we don't read much. The movie made the mistake of being too sophisticated for its audience. That doesn't mean that it's terribly sophisticated, just too much so for American moviegoers. But it reaches a unique sort of perfection for anyone approaching with an active mind and a sense of humor. There's absolutely nothing wrong with enjoying it with your brain turned off, so long as you remember to turn it back on.</fullReview>

ST3 - Marauder had plenty of potential but couldn't cut it like the first still better than the second. The rest see for yourself but Starship Troopers still touches what I believe movie goers like myself would call home. "this is for you new people. I only have one rule. Everyone fights, no one quits.

		<fullReview>Maybe I didn't pay attention, but I was always under the impression that this movie was standard sci-fi gorefest fare, like the Alien sequels. So I was quite surprised to find an ironic gem like this, where the heroes are die-hard, in-your-face fascists.A special moment is where the hero's squeeze gets ripped to pieces by bugs and he uses her funeral to hold an berpatriotic pep-talk, his eyes alight with brainwashed zeal. Minutes later, he's happily snogging the Hitlermdchen-trollop that dumped him earlier for a college boy with officer prospects.It wouldn't work if it wasn't for Verhoeven managing to get us to sympathise with these naive young Nazis. Verhoeven is laying it on a bit thick - he could've reined in the irony a bit and had a real masterpiece, but all the actors are doing a splendid job, obviously having tons of fun.The website inserts work well, despite being of rather simplistic design to contemporary eyes.</fullReview>

The real gems in this movie are the action scenes and the aliens themselves. The battle scenes capture a sense of epic scale ( the siege on the outpost will instantly make you think of Zulu ). Through the course of the human-arachnid war we see the relationships of the soldiers develop into brotherhood and how they all end up staying close together through the conflict. Rico's ( Casper Van Dein) courage and skills as a leader develop which is unique in a film like this. An excellent film and a must see !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It clearly shows that they spent more in special effects and hired TV actors to meet the budget, in this case it was a very good choice. It's surprisingly realistic for it's time, a good blend of props and computer graphics. The director Paul Verhoeven and bunch of the designer crew also did Robocop, so you can see where attention to realism comes from. I think the action and gore is just right, makes the movie a lot less pretentious. It's fast and cuts to the chase. It's certainly not a Oscar winning type movie, but it's one of my all time favorites for a simple reason... it's fun to watch. It's overall even, good characters, adventure, action, humor, horror and a bit of drama. It's just one of those lovable all in one movies. The actors don't really stand out from each other, it's a good thing. This movie is actually a high point for many of the actors in worldwide cinema. They must have had a lot of fun acting in this movie because the confidence shows on screen. The message in the storyline is drawn from the origin of fascism in early 1900's, the idea of combining a community into a single identity under leadership in order to become a strong war machine. In result, individuals become insignificant. Like in the classic song by Pink Floyd "Another brick in the wall". There's a downside to this movie though, it sort of disgraces the book it's based on with the same title written by Robert A. Heinlein. I recommend reading the book or seeing the movie, I don't recommend doing both. Read the book if you are more of a visionary, see the movie if you just want to see a fun action movie. I also recommend skipping the sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Transgression of it's original counterpart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an imaginary dialog referred by H. Kahnwailer, Pablo Picasso explained to Delacroix: "You took a Rubens and the result was a Delacroix. In the same way, I think of you and do something completely different."Well here, Paul Verhoeven didn't only do something absolutely different but also killed Heinlein and ripped apart savagely his novel. How can Heinlein resist such an adaptation of his novel with such a film contradicting nearly every point of the book and satirizing the main themes? For all that the novel was criticized for, the film makes account and delivers an everlasting stream of satire with caricature-like characters who evolve strictly in a military sense and horrible merciless insects supposed to be "the bad ones" (the racism theme Heinlein was so much critized for and so many reviewers don't seem to understand and who makes them miss the whole point of the story). Once in a while the films produces a sort of Nazi-propaganda video which seems to have an answer to all the character's (and therefore spectator's) questions with quotes such as "Why we fight?" which doesn't state the real reasons why humans are at war with bugs or death sentences broadcasting and military service propaganda with a subtle "do you want to know more?". War makes a fascist of each one of us, and even if it seems wrong, it seems to be our undeniable nature.I don't dislike Heinlein more than any other author and take his novel as the result of the period he lived in and as the war veteran he was, even if he never was engaged in any battle. The Forever War was a result of another generation marked by Vietnam. More in accordance with the latter Verhoeven show us an up-to-date view of war and propaganda and how the particular and cunning views of a few can imprison us all in an utopian society. What makes a true piece of art is the different views it can have and this is what makes, both the novel and the film, critized nearly in the same way, so great. So read the book, then watch the film, or vice versa, don't pay attention to what I said and write your own thoughts and get involved in this fabulous argument.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State."-Joseph GoebbelsHermann Goering said that if you want to start a war, you only need to tell the people that they are under attack. The masses will join in the cause and pacifists and dissidents are deemed to be "unpatriotic". It is of course helpful if an important building burns down ,or better yet explodes, to get the masses mobilized. When you have a mighty army and a militaristic culture, then all you need is a flash-point to start a war.Early on in Starship Troopers such a flash-point happens. A giant meteor hits civilian population and the media decides that "bugs" have started a war. Constant media coverage,imbedded journalists and largely compliant public thirsts for war. Continuous war mongering and fear mongering will keep the people in check. Talking heads and intellectuals are outraged that the government hasn't attacked the bugs already. Attack Klendethu now! Starship Troopers is The Fascists wet dream: Scores of dumb masses willing to die for their abusive masters. For homeland!Then you have these youngsters who are bunch of backstabbing, selfish morons. The State teaches them, feeds them with propaganda and guides the to admire militarism.These young people are willing to fight for freedom and kill for vengeance. They never question the state. State is always right.And they all look sexy. You practically want them to have sex and produce many wonderful children for the State. Mengele couldn't do it better. Even when the war starts and limbs get blown apart, bones broken and when death becomes a reality, these soldiers of the homeland never ask questions. Billions of miles away from home, turned into bug-food and these people don't ask questions. "If only we had planned this war better"I am amazed that Verhoven got this movie made.I am amazed how he sold this movie as a sci-fi , coming of age adventure to the masses and Hollywood. Beneath the very shiny surface, lies a sharp critique of modern militarism.</fullReview>

There are thousands of better SF or war films to chose from, so avoid Starship Troopers if you value your time.

		<shortDescription>When satire becomes an action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>General comments.Starship Troopers is an action movie. It was supposed to be a war commentary adaption, but instead they tried to make a satire, and it ended up an action movie. While the humour is all there, the themes exaggerated and over done tongue in check, it ended up an action film. While the critics were polarised and some found it hard to enjoy the film as it turned out a satire morphed action movie rather than the serious war commentary it originally was. Some find it great because of this though.acting.Sure, Casper Van Dien may not be the greatest actor, but he's not as bad as everyone thinks, he's at least mediocre. The other actors make up for it with their own. and either way, it's an action film really. You're insane if you're complaining about the acting.story.The film was supposed to be kind of high class, but they twisted around and it suits the simple idea of man versus bugs. Because of this, it's limbs galore, bodies flying all over the place and gun-ho ho ho. The film came out as a 15, so it's no surprise that the audience it's aimed at loves it since it's such a tongue in cheek gore action film.Reception.There's the crowd that's disappointed in the adaption which should have been more war commentary and less war action. Unfortunately, you get what you get, and the film isn't without it's flaws. The bad acting isn't too bad as I stated, and the plot doesn't take a brain to follow. Then again, it's a wonderful tongue in cheek action film, with satirist themes.Art Design The designs in the film are brilliant, sure the film had a high budget. But they still produced 1000 fiberglass helmets and hundreds of realistic armour and futuristic guns (even if the guns don't have iron sights, it just adds to the themes of the film)To top it all off the film is glossed over in a good soundtrack and good dialogue. Admittably not great dialogue, but good dialogue.I give it 7 out of ten for being entertaining, but still flawed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad ass! Dark social satire meets high octane sci-fi action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Playing out like a mix of twisted social commentary and balls out war movie with the cast of Dawsons Creek as soldiers, Starship Troopers is a film that rewards repeated viewings. All too often, it is unfairly dismissed as a knuckle-headed action flick when in actuality, there is a hefty dose of intelligence, wit and humour lurking beneath the spilled blood, giant insects and shoulder-wielded nuclear missile launchers.Set in a near future, militaristic society, Starship Troopers adopts a similar vein to Paul Verhoeven's previous action classic Robocop. It follows the exploits of Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien), Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer), Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) and Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris), four school-friends who join the military after graduation and find themselves entering a chaotic world of insane violence as Earth goes to war with a race of giant insects. Their friendships are tested to the limit and as friends and allies drop like flies all around them, Earth's fortunes against this unstoppable arachnid menace seem bleak...To dismiss Starship Troopers as a single minded slug-fest however would be a massive mistake. Subversive from the start, the screen is bombarded with Robocop-style news reports on the war with the bugs featuring children stomping on cockroaches and truckers spouting "only good bug" rhetoric while thousands of the world's youth are marched off to die screaming. The heroes we are supposed to cheer on are all made into meaningless numbers, victims of a culture-wide brainwashing where war makes fascists of us all. Considering this came out in 1997, a full five years before the onset of the War On Terror and the questionable motives behind America's current "peace through strategic bombing" campaign, it possesses a remarkable degree of foresight.The cast meanwhile are not remarkable per se, but nonetheless, ideally suit their roles. Casper Van Dien's square-jawed ubermensch Rico is the sort of soldier who could have walked straight off a propaganda campaign. Handsome, white-teethed and sporting abs you could grate cheese on, he is an Aryan poster boy made flesh and his super-soldier behaviour is just the sort of thing the folks at home want to hear about in the newspapers. Denise Richards meanwhile works like his female counterpart; owning an award winning smile and curves a slinky could travel down, she is similarly built for recruitment posters: Join the Navy son! You might get immolated, but you'll also get to bone Denise Richards! All of which makes it sound as though Starship Troopers is more po-faced than a black metal festival but the opposite is true; this is a film rife with humour. Dark humour granted, but humour nonetheless, carried by cheesy grins and meaningless slogans that mask the Right-Wing polemic that has taken over the world. Furthermore, the action sequences are an absolute blast, filled with exploding space ships, giant rampaging insects and so much blood and guts it'd make a slaughterhouse worker queasy.This is a film that has been cruelly overlooked, but just like the director's Cyborg cop movie, each successive viewing reveals another layer you might not have noticed before. It might be set in a futuristic world of intergalactic travel where man is engaged in a vast war with an alien race, but nevertheless this is one of the most astute criticisms of military oriented society ever made. Anyone who's a fan of black comedy and eighties action movies will love this but fun as it may be to just crack open the six pack and invite your friends over, try watching it sober and alone, it's well worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Incredibly Bad Its Funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the acting, lines, and scenes were just a little bit better, than this movie would be one of the worst of all time, but, since it completely sucks in every department, it has to be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The acting is incredibly bad, the lines are terrible, the props are horrible, possibly the worst sex-scene in history, the storyline is ridiculous, just about every single part of this movie is a catastrophic failure, and that is why I love it. One has to ask themselves when watching this movie "Why? Who could seriously make a movie this bad?". Hopefully, the directors realized how bad the movie was and just went with it. The whole concept is just stupid. Just incredibly stupid. If you want a laugh, definitely go and get this movie, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick, anti-Fascist, anti-war parody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quick summary: hilariously good-looking people. Never have the cast of Beverly Hills 90210 looked so good. Brilliant special effects - they barely look dated even today. Superb music. Solid directing. The film hangs together very, very well.OK. This film is a parody, first of all. It - incredibly, although satirically - depicts a functional, working fascist society, which is divided into "civilians" and "citizens". It also depicts this society as an aggressive one - invading an alien species' territory, then fully going to war against it when it retaliates.It depicts the media as a major agent in this regard: there are few options as to what to watch, and the first is the "Federal" channel.It's also very brutal. This is an anti-war film, and also a film with aliens in. It has people ripped apart, although the parody remains (at one point, "Mormon extremists" are massacred in an output). It's tongue-in-cheek to the death.It's important to remember this though: the humans are the aggressors here. They started the fight. However the barrage of media spin, drill-sergeant conditioning and comradely banter creates the impression the humans are the good guys. The attitude of all of the characters reflects this; they believe that they are retaliating, when they are actually the initiators. The film gives some insight into how an invading country's citizens (in the general sense of the word!) can be convinced that what they are doing is right.Also we get to see a huge fire-breathing alien get blown up from the inside. Awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To look at this objectively, I'll need to use two perspective to better view this film.Those who have never read the book This is a solid kill 'em all while your buddies get hacked to pieces film. The effects are great, the non-action sequences are funny. Not a very intelligent film, however. This is one you'll want to turn your brain off for.Those who haveEdward Neumeier and Paul Verhoeven raped Heinlein's classic sociological essays in novel form. Lets go down the list: *In the book, the government was a representative republic with a military service obligation for full citizen's status. This term was only two years, a third of the time our enlistee's are obligated to complete, and could opt out at any time, the only penalty is that they cannot try again. There is nothing fascist about it. *Only approximately 1 in 50 bugs were actually the dangerous warriors armed with an energy weapon. There were no giant tank bugs. There were no little tiny ones. It was workers/warriors, brains, and queens. *MI personnel used powered armor. In fact, the effectiveness of this armor was great enough that a single squad spread out over several miles could burn a city with minimum civilian casualties, intentionally. (In show of force to convince the "skinnies" to join their side of the war} *There were no women allowed in MI. This is for the same main reason the modern army does not allow women in combat arms: except in unusual cases, women are not as strong as men. However, nearly all pilots were women due to better tolerances for acceleration and change in direction. The movie was schlock that only borrowed names. Rico, for example, was actually from the Philippines, and only his mother was killed while on vacation to Buenos Aires.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And odd film, is Starship Troopers. As I watch it, I always wonder what the real point is. Is it trying to show how pathetic we are? Is it to show that as the human race, we will conquer all? Is it a subtle nod at WWII, showing us as the Nazi party? I seriously don't know; I like to believe this movie is much smarter than it looks and feels, but still to this day, I don't know how to feel about it.I enjoy it, to say the least. It's one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen; once I watch it, I could watch it again straight after. Surely that signifies a very enjoyable film, no? However, once it's over, my mind switches to discovery mode. I want to know what the movie is about and what it's truly saying. The media and news reels within the film remind me of the WWI and WWII propaganda, and the whole movie seems too bubbly and "go get 'em" to truly say "this isn't a serious movie, and it doesn't mean anything." Surely the director is trying to say something with Starship Troopers. I find the acting to be rather terrible, but I still can't help but feel it was all done on purpose! The SFX and music are top-notch; the best special effects I've seen for 1997! The script is full of cheesy one-liners, and in a way, is pretty bad; but this again, seems so right. Maybe the director has directed a bad film, and everybody is looking into it a bit much, but I doubt it. I know a bad film when I see it, and Starship Troopers isn't one.I suggest you watch it; you'll either love it or hate it. The whole ride is exciting and philosophical, two things that don't often mix well. I really hope there's something deep and clever I'm missing with Starship Troopers, as in the end I don't want to find out that it was just suppose to be a big, funny, comedy bloodbath. I always feel kind of weird once I've seen it; I just wish I knew what it was really about... or do I? 5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers, Kinda sounds like a kids film doesn't it, Well it's not! It's a pretty cool Sci/Fi Action movie, where Earth is at war with Giant Alien Bugs from across the Galaxy. Casper Van Dien takes the lead with support from Denise Richards, Dina Meyer, Jake Busey and many others.There is no Character depth, really basic plot, and a pretty Cheesy Script, so why is it that the characters are likable, the plot is good to watch and the script works? Put simply, it had to be done this way, take an idea like this too seriously and you'll achieve nothing. Starship Troopers sets out to be exactly what it is, All Action, great effects and fun to watch.If your after a movie that is just pure escapism, with some great violence, action and of course big Bugs, you won't find a better movie than this one.B-Movie Style, without the B-Movie Flaws 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best 'B' movie ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Verhoeven has made another classic film with 'Starship Troopers'. It is inspired and provocative. Shamelessly entertaining!From a technical point of view the film is perfect. The visual effects are excellent. I am sure that the use of models helped to achieve this perfection. To rely solely on computer-generated effects is a mistake that many directors fall for. Paul is too intelligent for that!The political ideas within this film are dealt with carefully. Humour pervades each set piece and heightens the message. Some moments are beautifully played; 'They sucked his brain out!' being just one.The alien bugs are also beautifully designed. I think these are some of the best aliens ever brought to life on the screen. Who can forget the anal barrage bugs? Wonderful.The war scenes are directed with a masterly hand. The troop landings are especially realistic and exciting.Again Paul Verhoeven surrounds his production with a wonderful cast. The use of unknown actors always helps the audience to make no reference to other projects and so have a clear mind while watching the drama unfold. Michael Ironside again lights up the screen.This is truly the best 'B' movie ever made. I don't think this work will ever date, as the care and perfectionism of the crew has made this a film that future generations will enjoy again and again for decades to come.( Read my comments on 'Total Recall' at njmollo )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only a man like Paul Verhoeven can make of a movie with such a stupid and unbelievable story such a masterpiece that "Starship Troopers" is. Along with "Mars Attacks!" this is the most misunderstood masterpiece.The movie is made as a kind of B-movie with a stupid story and cheesy dialogue's and some at times laughable bad B-actors. All of did was done on purpose. The movie is one big misunderstood satire on American society, just like Verhoeven did before with "RoboCop". The movie is filled with a subtle but brilliant fascist undertone and I'm not only talking about the army costumes and flags or the prop agenda like commercial brakes but also how the people behave. I truly pity those who don't understand the satire, for they can never truly see "Starship Troopers" as the masterpiece that it is.The movie is filled with some trademark Verhoeven gory scene's in which heads and other limbs are literally flying around. The use of the violence and gore like in all Verhoeven movies is nothing short of brilliant and is never overused. There are some impressive intense battle sequence's like you have never seen before.The special effect are wonderful (can I say best ever?), especially considered that the movie was made in 1997 when the special effects were not as good as now days. Not only the bugs look good and realistic but also the spaceships and the action is brilliant.Basil Poledouris his musical score is superb and one of his best ever. Just like "Starship Troopers", Poledouris is underrated and criminally underused and appreciated in Hollywood.A truly brilliant movie that made me realize something; Paul Verhoeven is a genius!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the most amazing movie that I've seen in that year (1997). I first saw it the first week that it came out and thought it was too long. I then saw it again a couple of weeks later and thought it was PERFECT. About 2 years after the movie came out I got a copy of the book and read it. I read the book in about a week and could not put it down. The book is absolutely phenomonal. I was upset at the movie for everything they did. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;SPOILERS&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; First, in the book the Lieutenant is dead already, whereas in the movie he is still alive. Also ALL of the characters mentioned in the book are men, but there are women in the movie ( so not to look sexist I suppose.) The book is told from the first person perspective of Johnny Rico, but the movie is not. It's a really, really bad thing to compare the movie to the book. Please, if you've never seen this movie, but have read the book, don't look at this as an adaptation. It will anger you to the end of sanity. This movie is completely and totally well done, albeit the acting COULD have been better. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has not read the book, but if you have read the book, don;t take this movie seriously, please. 5/5 (worth purchasing)</fullReview>

Those who do not have strong stomachs will realize the violence is more than they anticipated as well. Unnecessarily gruesome at times, but exciting and smart all the same.

		<fullReview>Hands off Starship Troopers! It's one of my favorite movies (9/10), and each time I watch it I am more impressed by the fine workmanship that went into it. For example, in response to a student saying that people are given citizenship and the right to vote as a reward for military service, Radcheck exclaims, "No! Something given has no value!" Radcheck's words make no sense whatsoever, and yet he pounds out each word like it is a fundamental truth. It is fascist propaganda, and the director intends you to think about how similar today's Earth is to this film. Yes, the film is silly, and so is our world today. Watch "Battle Line" on the History channel, or the black and white filler stuff at the end of A&amp;E Classroom, or "Victory at Sea" on PBS, and then watch Starship Troopers again... you won't be saying you don't get it. For extra credit, watch a live speech by the President of the United States to see some current parallels. Work makes you free.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe that somewhere out there in Hollywood, some studio executive actually believed that awful idea for a movie would make anything but an awful movie. This film is so bad that I can't even think of something worse to compare it to. Sure, it's violent, but even that didn't save it because the violence didn't affect me at all. If you're some human and you think that it's a good idea to run up to a 20 foot bug that needs to be shot a million times with a high-powered machine gun before it even begins to be injured, then you deserved to get eaten. I was actually cheering for the bugs to eat the stupid humans. My other major problem is that at one point in the film, Neil Patrick Harris (TVs Doogie Howser) was standing right next to a bug and the bug didn't eat him. The bug had the perfect opportunity and it blew it. I was there, yelling in the theater "Bug! Eat Doogie Howser", but it didn't. That alone might have almost began to salvage this otherwise cinematic exercise in absurdity, but it didn't happen. I could've made a better movie with a video camera from 1982 and a couple of sock puppets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I had never read the book (which is one of my all time favorites) then I would have thought that this film was mediocre at best. However, having read the book I really hated this movie. This is another case of some director or writer putting their own spin on a great novel, and turning it into a total disaster. The whole idea behind the Mobile Infantry was small, highly trained units in powered armour and making "drops" from outer space. I wonder if they had a military advisor on the set or if so, were they ignored, what happened to air (space) bombardment, artillery, engineers, reconaissaince, ARMOUR? Perhaps the director beleives that in the future we will forget all the lessons of war and go back to mass human wave assaults.I know this is the 90's (whatever that is supposed to mean) but there were no women in the M.I.!!, and those pretty boys (and girls) they have in the lead roles are just not beleivable.When these directors and writers make a film from a good novel, I really wish they would stick to the storyline in the novel.

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is quite possibly the worst adaptation ever made. If Verhoeven felt that this movie was necessary, a very poor decision, couldn't he have least given it a different title instead of making us think that we might see an adaptation worthy of the novel. Perhaps the worst thing about this movie is the way that Verhoeven so badly misread the original text. To be honest, I am not sure that he had ever seen the original text or he would have made a different, better movie. I had high hopes for this movie since Starship Troopers is one of the few Heinlein novels amenable to an adaptation to the screen. Unfortunately what I got was this puerile and juvenile piece of cinematic trash. Even the special effects, which aren't as good as I had heard, do not make this movie worthwhile. Avoid this one like the plague.</fullReview>

It is IRONIC. It is a spoof on American nationalistic cinema. The entire film is an exercise in self-consciousness, every aspect of the film is taken into account. The choice of actors (all "beautiful" and bland at the same time), the music, the choice of shots in the battle scenes and especially the dialogue. The characters spit cliche after cliche and the entire plot is utterly generic and fantastically banal. The Humans (Read America) destroys the bugs (read de-humanised enemy nation ie. the U.S.S.R, Iraq, the Middle East in general). I love the parrallel between the Intelligence officers and the Gestapo.The film is fantastic and I'm blown away that so many people missed the point so completely.

They achieve the ultimate accolade...they die for their 'Country' (Federation) and get a hero's funeral.Where else does that happen (exceptpossibly in today's Afghanistan)?Yes there is some corny acting and flabby humour but this is ALL part of the satire being played out.A GREAT movie which IMHO will be regarded as minor masterpiece of it's time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Satire?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is now 10 years old ... I've always admired the film since first seeing it in the theatre upon its release in '97. I should mention, standard sci-fi is not my genre of choice, though I'll certainly watch sci-fi movies if they've an interesting idea to offer. In any case, I recently got a hold of a Starship Trooper DVD and have been revisiting the film. I've come to the conclusion that the film not only holds up well (indeed, it seems almost prophetic as I watch it now after that eight year debacle called the Bush administration) it is also a remarkably witty piece with a powerfully satirical, highly critical subtext on the themes of militancy and fascism that ring ever more true and clear now. The film's critical perspective of film history, specifically the propaganda films of World War II which the film takes as its touchstone, provides a sly and clever commentary, if not deconstruction, of cinematic tradition that it rises above. It also, needless to say, succeeds wonderfully as an inventive action film, made with technical care and attention to detail, including the cheesy dialogue (The only good bug is a dead bug) and its B-list casting. Starship Troopers is an intentional simulation of an assembly line B-film, though the sensibility behind it, pure tongue-in-cheek, is anything but that of a B-film. An argument can be made it is, yes, a masterpiece, and worthy of canon status and certainly archival preservation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie almost ten years ago for the first time. Being then still twelve I(shouldn't have seen it then)was just fascinate by the special effect, taken by the action and gore, and started adoring Denise Richards.After that I have seen it again many times,discovered the films of Paul Verhoven and the books of Robert A. Heinlein. Today it's a different movie to me.Verhovens film, dubbed fascists at its release, is the exact opposite. It is an anti-war, anti- state, anti- military and anti-fascistic hell ride. For the movie it works great, but because of that it departs for the far more brilliant novel it is based on. The movie is basically divided in 3 parts. It starts as a unimpressive futuristic high school flick. We meet the poster boy Johnny Rico (Casper van Dien) his perfect girlfriend Carmen(Denise Richards), and their friends Carl(Neil Patrick Harris) and Dizzy(Dina Mayer). Carmen and Carl go to join the army, and Johnny taggers along because of Carmen. Carmen gets Starfleet, Carl intelligence and Johnny becomes "fresh meet for the grinder" and goes to join the mobile infantry. Then the movie turns into a far more compelling, Full Metal Jacket-like boot camp movie. We meet Johnny s instructor sergeant Zim(played brilliantly by Clancy Brown), a bunch of recruits and Dizzy again. Carmen dumps Johnny via space-mail, and he causes a death of another recruit and wants to quit the army. In the moment Johnny starts walking down Washout lane the Bugs attack Earth. Johnny gets back into the uniform, and with that the movie becomes in my mind one of the best war films made in the last twenty years. Of course there is the issue of alien bugs, with an agenda to destroy the human race with shooting asteroids for the opposite cornet of the Milky Way galaxy. The problem with the plot is that you mustn't take it seriously, if you take it you will be shocked, if you don't you will be laughing the entire movie. Eventually the bugs kick the hell out the humans at first, but as the movie progresses so those human race, at least the scientists, not the members of the mobile infantry who almost all get ripped apart by the bugs. The cast of "poster boys" and "model girls" works really great. Casper became my hero at twelve, too bad he continued his career in straight to video messes like "Dracula 3000". Denise Richard succeeded looking great and acting better the she has done since. Dina Meyer proved to be a reliable and great action girl. For me the supporting cast steals the show Jake Busey as Ace, Clancy Brown, and above all Michael Ironside as Lt Rasczak. Verhoves direction is intense, and the movie filled with false commercials and news turns out to be a profound critic of todays western society. lLM-s and Phil Tippett's special effects still stand today and a beautiful score by Basil Poledouris is just compelling. All in all a great entertainment, social commentary and a must see movie, although it lacks the greatness and depth of Heinlein's masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"We're In It For the Species"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starship Troopers has become one of my favorite science fiction films because of the uncompromising way it looks at pure unadulterated evil.Make no mistake about it, the evolved arachnids are unadulterated evil and they are that because they view the rest of the galaxy as a feeding ground. There's no co-existing with them, understanding them, or dialoging with them. It's humans or arachnids, it's that simple. The society that evolved to meet the challenge understands that perfectly well. As Neil Patrick Harris so admirably put it, he's in the military for the survival of the species.Evil is a hard concept for the civilized mind to wrap itself around and those that do understand it, a lot of times tend to be monotheist in their religion and can't communicate it to nonbelievers because they wrap evil in a discussion of why their particular faith is the only method to combat evil. A better question to ask about the futuristic society of Starship Troopers is to ask is does the fascist society that evolved on earth the only way to combat the arachnids. The concept of citizen and civilian is an interesting one that the film brings out. One serves in society and gains the franchise to become a citizen by going in some kind of national service. We're a lot closer to that than one might think. Look at voting in the USA. We are so balkanized with one party districts that it is close to impossible to unseat and incumbent. The voter participation in general elections is low enough, but party primaries where the issues are really decided have a minuscule participation. All of the resources of the body politic are geared towards getting these 'prime' voters out and for your particular candidate. In a very real sense they are the elite citizens in our system.I do like the fact that their seems to be a complete equality of the sexes, no one has any hangups about people's sexuality and their ability to do a job.I liked the performances of the young people of this new world a lot. I'm surprised that Casper Van Dien's career didn't rocket off after this film and his appearance as Tarzan. This looks like it will be his career role.I liked Dina Meyer best however as Diz who is carrying a statue of liberty size torch for Casper. Casper was brave, but he certainly was a little dense in this film.It's probably a good thing that it took almost 40 years after Robert Heinlein wrote the novel for this to get to the screen. This could never have been done back in the day. The computer generated special effects are awesome.Starship Troopers for all the faults in the society that has evolved is about nothing less than a future greatest generation who rose to meet a challenge of pure evil and saved mankind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is brilliantly subversive, and was rather poorly received by critics and audience alike. Why? Many just missed the boat...er starship. It flew right over their heads.Some disliked it because it was unsubtle - from stage like overacting to bright primary colors in set design - this was not a morally, visually grey film like the 'Alien' series - nor was it meant to be.Many people disliked it because it was a perversion of Heinlein's classic novel. This is true, though, arguably a straight adaptation would neither have been possible, nor watchable. And the essential theme of the book is preserved.And still others disliked it because it was mismarketed as a SF action film ala "Aliens", which it clearly is *not*.But, I think the reason it failed to connect with mass audiences is the less obvious fact that it makes fun of them - and people just don't like being made fun of. It is a scathing (and sadly prescient) indictment of how easily the general public can (and often has) been (mis)lead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers Is one of my all time favorite Science Fiction films and I've been hoping for a sequel.I am 58 years old and started watching Science Fiction in the 50's with classics like War of the Worlds, Earth v. Flying Saucers, etc and I still enjoy the old ones. Starship Troopers has all the elements needed to be a successful and popular film: (1) admirable and realistic characters (2) good v. evil (3) heroes who are flesh and blood and not supermen (4) humor which isn't always intentional and (5) some of the greatest special effects I've seen in years.The evil arachnids were the best spider-monsters I've ever seen.As far as the film having a Fascist quality, I say bull. I'd like to live in a society where (1) college was free (2) military veterans were highly respected and received more rights (3) military and civilian leaders admitted their mistakes and were forced to step down and (4) where a woman could become the top leader.As far as I'm concerned, this film had no flaws. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people seem to miss the point of the film. It took the background story of the eponymous book and ran with it. The director even admitted in the commentary of the DVD that he never really read the book until the film was finished and that he DIDN'T even like the book.The film is an interesting attempt at critical depiction of human violent and fascist tendencies in face of inter race/species conflicts. It's more close to an anti-war satire remotely in the vein of Kubrick's classic: "Dr. Strangelove, or How I learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb". I said "remotely" because this film doesn't even pretend to be subtle/clever/sophisticated in its humors. It's so B-movie'ishly in your face and over the top, which is why I'm puzzled that so many reviewers didn't get it. Sigh. Technically the film/DVD is superb. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

Towards the end, the dialogue becomes so bad that I would like to think that this picture was a joke, but unfortunately I cannnot, due to the millions of dollars spent on this project. Somone, somewhere, obviously thought enough of this picture to create and release it.

The boot camp was right out of Waffen SS (German special forces in WW2), they really did train that brutally hard, and worse, sicking starving dobermans on soldiers armed with knives to teach them to fight with everything they had for survival. A knife in the hand is tame in comparison.They INTENTIONALLY used very pretty no-name stars, and then chopped them up into pieces in gory scenes, to amplify the shock value.I mean COME ON, Doogie Houser as a Nazi Gestapo styled intelligence officer? How sick is that? That is frikken BRILLIANT!!! The capital, Buenos Aries, was chosen because that's where all the Nazis ran to after world war II! The movie openly mocks modern propaganda and militarism in our society and media, comparing us to the coming disaster in Germany in the 1930's. The soldiers themselves are modelled after the US in Vietnam, with weapons that shoot a bazillion bullets but do jack squat. The aliens come at them in hordes of 'bug waves' reminiscent of the wars in Vietnam and Korea.The reason for all this Nazi symbolism is a direct commentary on the original author of the novel Starship Troopers, Robert A. Heinlen, who many believed held very fascist and racist views on society and controlling your population.Other gems: The music is top notch.The propaganda commercials are HILARIOUS, and so on the mark.The spaceships are the BEST ships ever designed in an movie, they really looked and functioned as I would expect near future ships to look and work, really felt like they were flying them, no stupid starship enterprise here! This movie was brilliantly written and executed, and I am so depressed by the millions of idiotic movie goers who had no idea what they were being shown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an uncompromising satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beauty of rewatching films (8 years for this one) lies in picking up on certain things you have overlooked on your first viewing. Well, in the case of Starship Troopers I would recommend every single one who saw it and thought it was "merely a bug shoot-em-up in space", to give it another run. This is a misunderstood classic; Paul Verhoeven's hour. And I don't know whether it's truly a good or a bad thing that the people deeply misunderstood what Verhoeven was trying to say. Maybe that only proves Verhoeven's little "Would You Like to Know More?" inserts as evidence of massive brainwash that occurs in the media (in the film) and in modern day world. This is an uncompromising satire of American imperialism and a vision of a future that's becoming more real each day, not in the sense of conquering planets but countries. I simply love Verhoeven's detail-orientedness. Such small details as a whole colonization of Buenos Aires by Americans, to metaphors which include bugs as the "enemy". What about those uniforms that Jenkins wears towards the third act which uncannily resemble a Gestapo officer? Yes folks, this not only touches on imperialism, but contains major fascist overtones; full allegiance to the state (I swear allegiance to the flag... ring a bell?) This is a misunderstood masterpiece, and its' core genius lies in the fact that it's masked so well as a "brainless", violent, shoot-em-up bug film in space.BIG Kudos to you Mr. Verhoeven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's good reasons why the late author's family sued to have his name removed from the title. Those who comment that the film is a parody prove the point. The novel was serious social commentary, NOT a parody. The characters sure weren't the jackbooted thugs of the film. Military tactics made a lot more sense and the humans' weapons system were as advanced as you'd expect that far in the future. And the core concept of the novel - the Mobile Infantry's power armour - was ignored for reasons which really don't stand up. Verhoeven is a hack and the only thing which might have salvaged part of this fiasco is if he'd resisted using the title as a marketing ploy. This would have helped avoid the painful comparisons between a fine, memorable novel, and a laughable shoot-em-up nonsense fest.</fullReview>

"It is a subversive send up of fascism, the most brilliant since Dr. Stragelove." Well folks, I'm here to let the cat out of the bag. No it isn't. Starship Troopers is not subversive. Starship Troopers is not satire. Starship Troopers is just stupid. For all its smirking, in-on-its-own-joke faux camp and oh-so-ironic stabs at social commentary, Starship Troopers is nothing more than a schlocky sci-fi shoot 'em up aimed at adolescents (clearly demonstrating that the filmmakers knew all along that their 'subversive' film was a steaming turd) and directed with all the ham handed prurience which we've all come to know and hate from Paul Verhoeven (whose chief claim to fame is Showgirls, the movie which ensured that no one would ever be curious enough to see an NC-17 film again).That's not to say that 'satire' and 'subversion' aren't attempted, just that they fail miserably (and how could they not with Verhoeven at the helm, not to mention a cast of 'stars' headed by the likes of Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards?). Any satirical effect is lost in the stunning lack of context. So there might be a fascist society some time, for some reason at some point in the future, and it might not be pleasant? How interesting. Now get back to machinegunning four story beetles.The moral of this story? In the future, Marines will take co-ed showers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is horrendous. Gee, could the writer be trying to parallel the human race in this movie with America today? The propaganda and even uniforms are reminiscent of Nazi Germany, but we know exactly who the writer is bashing. This is proved when the TV reporter explains (subtly worded as an argument) that the only reason these bugs are attacking is because humans invaded their land.Hmm...that doesn't sound at all like the far-left's argument about modern terrorism, does it? Now, I am not sticking up for American foreign policy at all with this review; I am only saying this movie is way over the top. One perfect example was the children smashing little bugs on the sidewalk. That was bad enough, but then we see the mother cackling like a lunatic next to them.Combine that with Johnny's outburst after the reporter makes his comment above about humans invading their land. Instead of combating his argument, Johnny comes over and says (paraphrasing): I am from Buenos Aires, and I say kill them all! What that scene is clearly meant to show is that humans in this film, like Americans today, are just too stupid to see the "whole picture." He clearly knows nothing outside of his little city in a vast universe (he even mentions earlier how he's never seen the universe). This is EXACTLY how elitists across the world portray Americans, that is to say, ignorant of everything but what's right in front of them.I'll stick with reality.</fullReview>

I have never seen so many smiles and meaningless moments in the face of grave danger. How Paul Verhoven continues to be able to make films is beyond me. Robo Cop was a great film. Maybe someone ghost directed it for him or maybe he was hungrier then, but his work as of late has been horrible. I've seen better student films.

Where do I start? If you haven't seen this, I can sum it up for you with this: The cat that played Doogie Howser trys to play a bad-a**. That's just for starters. Let's move on to Casper van Diem and Denise Richards. Who you say? Exactly. They haven't been seen since, except for Richards on hubby Charlie Sheen's "Two men and a fat kid" sitcom, or whatever it is. But let's be fair here. They have no script to work with. Whatsoever. Verhoeven took a very symbolic, subtle, yet tragic novel, which explores the human nature, and turns it into another Robocop movie. Sorry, Paul. The public is just not buying it anymore. Take your stupid tongue out of your cheek, and try to make a dramatic film that doesn't rely on cheap "attempted" gaffes. I had the pleasure of watching this in a theater (3/4 empty, first tip-off) years ago and, the best lines came from the patrons. Yes, we were hoping beyond all hope, that all the so called "good guys", were impaled, eaten, chopped up, and discarded, along with every reel of this film. I read somewhere that Verhoeven is considered on the "outs" in H-Wood circles, which is what he deserves. An enthusiastic "0" out of 10. If you want a true rail against fascism, get a copy of Salo, and then pick up your jaw off the floor. If you want a case of sour stomach, watch this excrement, and then bash your head of your coffee table repeatedly for wasting an hour and a half of your life.</fullReview>

I didn't like the violence of the solders against each other in training (ie: beating Johnny Rico in public, knife through another soldier's hand) and the telepath (Neil Patrick Harris) seemed kind of Evil at the end. After buying the "Special Edition DVD" the other day and watching the special features, I realized that I wasn't SUPPOSE to be okay with what was going on! This movie was a commentary on human history and behavior and how Facism can really be strict and dark. I never picked up on that before. And according to the commentary A LOT of people didn't pick up on that. The author of the story was trying to make a point. I have seen this movie in a new and better light.

		<fullReview>This comment contains major SPOILERS.I have read and heard the most diverse comments on this movie, including "trash with bad acting and script", "good popcorn movie", and "tries to be smart but fails".What these comments had in common is that in my opinion they all missed the point completely.First of all, the casting of soap stars, the at times wooden acting, the lurid presentation... all this is totally intentional and it requires considerable skill from cast and crew to pull off in this way. Maybe they weren't skilled enough though because some viewers apparently still thought that they were watching substandard quality? While Starship Troopers can certainly be enjoyed only for the effects (cool CGI spaceships and trademark Verhoeven OTT gore) I think that maybe it shouldn't because that would mean ignoring its important message.As for those who were able to acknowledge that the film has in fact message and meaning but complained about it trying to constantly hammer home a point - yes, this is partly true, but I found it most intriguing how the picture works on much more subtle levels as well.An example: Basically the viewer realizes during the first few minutes of the movie that it is set in a weird kind of fascist utopia. It is not made hard for the viewer to disagree with this world order. Just think of all the blatantly jingoistic propaganda in the "TV ads" the story is interspersed with.So you watch for almost 2 hours, constantly thinking "why are they fighting this pointless war"....... and then the bugs kill Diz.OK, this is highly subjective, but at that point I kind of started to hate those bugs myself. Why Diz?? You just don't want her to die at this time in the movie.Anyway, _very_ shortly afterwards the militaristic organization that because of my emotional involvement I was now half-willing to accept as a necessary means to an end shows itself from its worst side: Colonel "Doogie Howser" Jenkins enters the room dressed like a Gestapo officer and talks about "mere numbers", not interested in the loss of his friends. Seeing what this initially likable character has developed into was just spooky! And finally, the end sequence with the capturing of the "brain bug". I just felt sorry for the poor thing and was disgusted by the cheering humans.But after Diz's death 10 minutes earlier I had been manipulated into wanting to cheer _with them_! Despite everything I had seen up to then!So watching in disgust as the brain bug was subjected to various bizarre methods of "examination" AND knowing that I had almost crossed the line of allying with its sick torturers I just felt.... weak and guilty.ST's odd mixture between SFX-rich space flick and cynical satire on 1940's war propaganda movies might be awkward in places. But it demonstrates how people can be manipulated to align themselves with ideas they don't originally agree with - by doing exactly that with the viewer! This I find quite remarkable and the strong anti-fascist message that is the result kind of makes this a serious film.For me this is one of Verhoeven's best, second only to Total Recall, and a solid 8/10.(No, I haven't seen his Dutch films.)</fullReview>

A constant reminder that xenophobia and allegiance lead to fascism, Verhoeven's use of a newsreel-style interface to lead the viewer through the film immerses the audience in playful propaganda. Dazzling special effects make the citizens' fight to destroy the Bugs a visual feast of destruction and mayhem. While we are constantly shown that submitting ourselves to the State Ideological Apparatus involves a loss of control over our mind and bodies (which in the film leads to dismemberment, disembowelment, and disfiguration) the message is presented under an ironic and self-reflexive veil of pure entertainment that is irresistible.

Sort of like the same fashion as RoboCop and Verhoevens other films. It has very massive ships, awesome battle sequences and the bugs look just amazing. And realistic too. In fact, the whole movie has a realistic look to it. The actors play their roles quite well, and Paul Verhoevens directing was just outstanding. His best movie since RoboCop. If you liked his other movies, I would definitely recommend this one. Starship Troopers is a fun roller-coaster ride of a sci-fi action movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remarkable film. As many have pointed out, an excellent satire.I want to respond to criticisms point by point.Shallow, mindless crappy formulaic Hollywood action-flick? ... actually I'm not even going to bother responding to this one.Weak Science Fiction? Verhoeven uses science-fiction as a method for projecting current social trends into extremes. It's a form of reductio ad absurdum. "See what happens if this ideology takes over". Those who believe that "real" science fiction is only hard science fiction (i.e. effectively fiction about science) are completely disregarding much of the potential of the genre. Furthermore - I firmly believe that the scientific "mistakes" are entirely intentional. The film is full of absurdities (e.g. the bugs are considered to have intentionally launched an asteroid from the other side of the galaxy to hit Earth. The mathematical genius required to calculate such a launch, not to mention the faster than light travel, clearly imply very high intelligence, yet the bugs are still considered unintelligent). There are many such examples - resolving these problems, whilst not always impossible (in this case, e.g., maybe the rulers knew the bugs were intelligent and actually meant for the initial invasion to be a disaster for propaganda reasons - maintaining social cohesion of the "federation" must be a difficult task - having a truly feared and despised enemy is an effective force for controlling one's people, etc.), is missing the point I think. This is a truly post-modern film, and consciously so. The vehicle is "the standard American action movie". I think considering it a mere parody of the genre is too limited. Verhoeven is using the genre not just to mock it but because this kind of film derives and culminates directly from the kind of ideological premises he is criticising.Fails to copy the book? Yes - yes it does. Is that a problem? I mean, if you like the book, fine - but did you really go to see the film because you were too lazy to read the book again? Verhoeven's adaptation of the book is a "cover", if you like - and like any self-respecting artist, he is bringing to the work being covered his own perspective. Consider the Sex Pistols' 'God save the queen', or 'I did it my way'. Those are valid covers (ok 'God save the queen' perhaps doesn't exactly qualify as a cover, but it also refers to what it is criticising by sharing its title with its target). The Cohen brothers' adaptation of 'No country for old men' is also a valid cover - you don't have to be critical of the original for your version to be valid - but you do have to make the song your own. The Heinlein is chosen for the same reasons as Verhoeven chose the standard Hollywood action movie: they exemplify the ideology that he despises, that he is warning us against. It's not surprising, of course, that the people who watched the film because they loved the book found the film unappealing: the ideology of the book is satirised and condemned, much of the content is ignored (because irrelevant to the point being made), etc. Imagine the reaction of a British royalist who bought "God Save the Queen" having looked no further than the title.The acting sucks? Well of course it does - frankly, if Verhoeven had hired the best actors/actresses in the world to perform these roles, he would have had to brief them to act just as VanDien and Richards do, and I doubt they would have done it as convincingly as the real thing. In a sense, Verhoeven is like Ken Loach ? he has people play themselves. The roles are of and by clich wooden pretty soap actors and actresses. No depth of character may be allowed to slip out. The whole film is staged to perfection to be a standard Hollywood action/teen highschool movie.Those who complain that the characters aren't likable and that therefore they didn't like the movie may have a point, in a twisted sort of way. I think it was Verhoeven's intention to make the characters likable at the surface level: at the level of the action-flick, we root for them. If having characters to root for is a primary concern when watching a film, then you're probably not looking for much in the way of depth of artistry - so if you didn't like the characters it would imply that Verhoeven failed. Personally I disagree: I think that at the immersion level we do root for the heroes - particularly VanDien. Richards' character is superficially ambiguous and at the immersion level we are meant to mistrust her. The simplistic techniques used to bring about these shallow characterisations are deliberately so. The utopian culmination of the ideology Verhoeven rejects would be a world in which these stereotypical ideal cut-out characters were real. Inversely, if this formulaic hollywoodian image of the world were real, we would drift inexorably towards the dominance of such ideology.It's a bad satire? I'd really need you to give some examples of good satire - and I'd still not be satisfied. There are numerous ways to satirise - but the classic approach (exemplified by Swift in his 'Modest Proposal' I think)is to produce a work which mirrors the style of the people you are criticising whilst exaggerating their content sufficiently subtly that a naive reader/viewer could mistake it for the real thing. This is exactly the case for Starship Troopers. He is satirising bad movies, right-wing ideology and propaganda and has been accused of making a bad movie that is propaganda for right-wing ideology. (I laugh at these sorts of critics as I laugh at the people who condemned Swift's 'Modest Proposal', or the Bonsai Kitten website. Fools, but thanks for your unwitting support).</fullReview>

However, I am not interested in messages, I am an apolitical watcher and honestly, I cannot detect generally (I don't want it anyway), but I don't object to such sub-texts, it might be true. Fascism, militarism, anti-militarism, media, army criticism, it seems that everything is here. Starship Troopers is fun, fun and fun. Years years ago, I read it, a critic says where is entertainment, tell me? Arms and legs are disintegrated. He is right, but of course not this side of the matter is fun. The first half of the movie is interesting, but it is like the introduction, you see nothing yet. The design of the bugs and clash scenes are great (and unique) thanks to Paul Verhoeven. May be you don't emphasize the soldiers, but you care about them, you worry about them one each and you feel like you are there. When one of them is killed, you bother, you cheer, when one of them is saved. And as for adrenalin, excitement, you fasten on the screen while hundreds of bullets are spent, because it is extremely hard to get through. One bug is destroyed, but then starting all over again. I am sure that we won't see such movies in the future. Probably, this is because of Verhoeven's talent. The best bug designs so far are in this movie. In the second half, almost non stop action, except for action freaks, it might be excessive for some people, it is that great. I love it. My favorite scene is the sequence that they come to the station, this sequence deserves to be put in the cinema anthology. Each time, I am astonished when thousands of bugs appear and attack. As a note, the sound editing is brilliant in this part. Verhoeven may be criticizes militarism, but it does not mean that he does not care about action, just the opposite. By the way, there are two weapons in front of the station that look like tank gun, the most heavy armament of the soldiers. May be, this will make some people angry, but I liked these weapons. I am not interested in guns at all, I have not any kind of weapon and it won't, I just love gunfight scenes. I believe that even if he criticizes somethings above all, he cares about action, entertainment. When the soldiers hold their guns to the bugs, he zooms! He made this movie as it should be. In terms of style and content both including the atmosphere, the second half recalls computer games. I don't play computer usually and I haven't played its computer game yet, but I took a look at the game, so not so important, but this is a plus. The dead bodies are pretty hard-to-look-at, but it seems that set designers made great effort. There are many kind of bugs, the design of the bugs are well designed as I said, so interesting. Starship Troopers is not the best science fiction movie ever made, but the best action / science fiction after The Terminator 2. Lastly, I did not like Cameron's Aliens, it was a big disappointment after Alien. However, people love Aliens which is also according to them one of the best action movies, but the rating of Starship Troopers is one of the most bothersome ratings in IMDb history! It was pretty slow paced (may be after such movies, it seems) and the most important there was no gunfight, no battle between the team and the aliens. And aliens were passive? Cameron says that he created a war atmosphere in space. No, this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't examined in detail ALL the reviews, but in general, although they've got it right in terms of the message carried by the film, it seems that no one has yet made any reference to the pernicious effect of propaganda that the film sets out to illustrate so effectively and that's woven into every single frame of this great film.It's all too easy to get the audience on-side with the good guys and to make them sneer at the madmen of war as in Strangelove. What's really great about this film, and what makes it quite unique, is how it manages to get the vast majority of the audience on side the fascists (in fact, I'd suggest we're here talking out and out Nazism rather than plain old fashioned Fascism - the clues are all there) without the audience even realising down which road they're being gently coaxed along. This film illustrates the power of propaganda over people more effectively than any film made by Leni Riefenstahl.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film in a theater back when it came out in '97 and saw it as being a clever and thought-provoking satire/social commentary. I recently watched it again and found 'Starship Troopers' to be so chillingly prescient that I cannot get it out of my mind. While it functions (well, I might add) on a superficial level as an exciting action/scifi romp, this movie leaves you with plenty to think over.The basic premise is that after being 'attacked' by a so-called an inferior civilization, all governmental functions, media, information, and public life on Earth become subordinate to the military. Of course, an early bit of dialog suggests that those in power assumed their authority in some kind of coup prior to the alien war. Moreover, the film frames the alleged attack so that a reasonable person would rightly question who the real aggressor is. Finally, the film suggests that Earth's treatment of enemy prisoners amounts to behavior that Americans once would have labeled torture.If we aren't currently living in a government that is deliberately patterning itself after 'Starship Troopers', then we might as well be. The fact that this film came out 4 years before the false flag operation of September 2001 amazes me beyond words. I would recommend this film be mandatory viewing for every high school and undergrad student in the U.S. before too many of our younger generation forgets what life was like before the bloodless coup of 2000.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While panned by most critics.....who listens to them anyway, Starship Troopers is a war movie that shows better what happens in war than most other war movies. Of course the film is set in space and the "enemy" is one what can all get behind, bugs. The film gets off to a semi-slow start but ratchets up that action to a near non-stop pace! This film is not for the little ones, there is lots of gore. As far as gore goes it is a tour-de- force! The special effects such as the space scenes. the bugs, the animatronic bugs and the gore are top notch. Especially notable are the space shooting bugs, the flamethrower bugs and the RPG nukes the troopers use. Casper Van Dien, Jake Buesy and Dina Myers all turn in great performances. If you are planning to work in the special effects industry this film should be considered required viewing. This film gives you plenty to think about on many levels and while not following the book closely it rises above to make its own statement. This film is in my top 20 list and nearly makes it into the top 10!Watch it several times if you can...with so much going on you will see something new with each viewing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The irony of Starship Troopers is that its craftmanship, special effects, and poetic violence are so beguiling that the larger message of the dangers of an overweening state have been largely missed. If you don't believe me then listen the commentary by Verhoeven and Neumeier. They aimed at producing a propaganda film of the future, one that would demonstrate the vacuity of fascism by the film's own over-the-top attempts to manipulate a docile population into accepting violent solutions to all problems and by the use of media to manufacture consensus. In the wake of the latest Gulf War, the film resonates well with the direction the U.S. is taking. Verhoeven himself lived through the Nazi occupation in Holland and is a passionate critic of right-wing state authority.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally entertaining and re-watchable satire!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Paul Verhoeven, STARSHIP TROOPERS (1997) is an anomaly of a film, but one of my favorites from the 1990s. It shouldn't be as good as it is. But it really is GOOD! Lacking the character depth or sophistication of Verhoeven's earlier sci-fi classics "Robocop" and "Total Recall", I actually think that this movie is Verhoeven's most FUN movie! The characters are secondary. The real star is the satire, and this movie is mired in it!A by-the-numbers rah rah tale that follows bright-eyed, well- meaning, optimistic youth Johnny Rico (well-played by engaging newcomer Casper Van Dien) from high school to boot camp to war (mobile infantry), this movie has a timeless appeal that frankly very few movies of it's type can enjoy. It has a lot of action, humor, and believe it or not, drama and heart. Similar to "Robocop" and "Total Recall", this movie is very satirical and makes not-so-subtle references to it's subject matter, in this case...WAR! The characters are sounding boards to showcase both sides of war sentiments (mostly the pro side). But "Troopers" still follows the trajectory of it's more polished predecessors in that it is a simple linear tale of the main character who must fight to attain his own individuality, in this case the young inexperienced boy who goes to war and becomes a man in the process discovering who he is and what he was born to do. By the end of the movie, Johnny Rico is a lean, mean, fighting machine and a strong leader.The future angle is a major reason I still love this movie to this day. This movie has a futuristic look that that is visually appealing to me, mainly because Verhoeven smartly avoids the pitfalls of most movies by not focusing so much on the technology itself and presents a feasible representation of what the future could be. Also, he does give the characters just enough personality and the dialogue, while simple, contains a lot of humor and bite. And the futuristic spaceship and mutant bug effects still look eye-popping and convincing, especially given when the movie came out. The sets and costumes kind of remind me of "Star Trek (the original series)" at times, and that is one of my favorite shows of all time!I also liked how the movie tweaks the usual "girl waiting back at home" and instead opts to have her be part of the action. Johnny's girl Carmen (played by the beautiful Denise Richards) also joins the service, but ends up as a flight officer and eventually dumps Rico to go career. Waiting in the wings for Johnny is Dizzy (played with confidence and energy by the gorgeous Dina Meyer), who enlists herself and gets assigned to Rico's marine platoon in order to stay close to him. Carmen is Rico's ideal girl who doesn't appreciate him enough, while Dizzy is the heart-of-gold woman who stands by him and brings out the best in him. I much prefer Johnny-Dizzy to Johnny-Carmen! Another big bonus for me with this movie is a supporting cast, which includes a pair of legendary screen baddies who are part of the good guys in this one! Yet they get to retain their tough guy attributes playing hardened, war-savvy soldiers. Clancy Brown (famous as the baddie in both "Highlander" and "The Shawshank Redemption") plays Rico and Dizzy's tough-as-nails drill instructor and Michael Ironside (as the right-hand bad guy from Verhoeven's future tale "Total Recall") plays their disabled former high school teacher who returns to service as their company commander when they must go into battle. I also enjoyed the work of Rico and Dizzy's fellow boot camp marines played by Jake Busey, Blake Lindsley, Eric Bruskotter, Anthony Ruivivar.One main criticism of this movie is that it's too campy. But I think that misses the point. Honestly, I've seen way worse: "Troopers" came out the same year as "Batman and Robin" (Now THAT was a totally campy movie!). The actors might not be the best in the world, but I still think they did a great job selling themselves in their respective roles. Even the "serious" moments don't drag the movie down for me, and I found much of it to be involving and well played, like Carmen's breakup video to Johnny, the drill instructor and company commander tearing up Johnny's separation papers, and pretty much all the Johnny-Dizzy moments as they are a couple worth rooting for! Meyer especially was convincing in relaying Dizzy's deep feelings for Johnny. In summary, STARSHIP TROOPERS is a fun, fast-paced adventure story with an old-fashioned appeal that makes it worth watching...and re- watching!</fullReview>

The don't buy the message and don't believe for a minute that one man can win against the powers that be. Paul Verhoeven doesn't believe Heinlein's Ideals and it shows. Heinlein never saw this future as a fascist society as many people who saw the film seem to think. This was a proposal for an Ideal society based on his interpretation of American Ideals. Voting is much less important than innate civil rights. Only those who give up their freedom through Civil service can vote. The entire philosophical aspect is there but weak and this severely handicaps the film. The casting was very television-B movie and the costumes were awful. The whole Robo-cop feel was transposed onto the film. It would have required someone that actually had a feel for Heinlein to sell the underlying Ideas. Even the military camaraderie was botched. In Aliens the military felt much closer to Heinlein and Cameron or Ridley Scott would have done a much better job. There went a chance to make a really powerful film. God help us when they decide to do "Strangers in a Strange Land"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This, to say the least, was a complete and total disappointment. Heinlein's novel--which this movie was supposedly based on--is one of Heinlein's best. Like many of his other books, including "Have Spacesuit, Will Travel," "Starship Jones," "The Rolling Stones," it is a coming-of-age novel; it's the story of Juan Rico, a high school kid who decides to join the military as soon as he turns 18. As the novel progresses, we get to watch the character grow and change as he confronts the horrors of combat as well as personal catastrophes: the loss of close friends, the death of his mother.In addition, though, this novel is also about the human race. Once again, as in some of Heinlein's other books, this is also a work of political philosophy. In this case, it's how the human race developed a truly rational moral philosophy, how society changed as a result, and how that philosophy affects the lives of the people living in that time. It also addresses the question of how the human race will fight and ultimately win its first war against a truly alien enemey.The movie completely ruined all this. It turned this book into yet another special-effects festival, with lots of blood, gore, and death, following a bunch of future teenagers having the same kind of fun killing bugs as they would at a high school football game.I have no doubt that the author will find a way to come back and haunt the producers, writers, and director of this drek fest for the rest of their natural lives.</fullReview>

Just thinking about this movie is lowering my IQ. In fact, they ought to distribute "suicide pills" with this movie so the sensation of a thoroughly crushed soul and trampled spirit doesn't have to last any longer than it has to.The only thing worse than seeing this movie is thinking about it for an extended period of time, so I'm afraid I've got to cut this review short.

The only thing it has going for it is that the effects were good - if you like watching bugs and humans blowing up for approx. 1 &amp; 1/2 hours. I went to see this movie, as it was touted "the Star Wars for the 90s". It cannot be compared to Star Wars in any way, except for the fact that things are happening in space. This is not a movie suitable for any normal human, though it does appeal to the same crowd that plays "Postal", "Quake", and others of this genre of gory game. However,it was even too much for some friends of mine that DO play these games. The story was promising, but I was severely let down by the sacrifice of story to fit gratuitous blood/gore/violence in - no one needs to see any more of that than is already in the world.

		<shortDescription>A Perversion of Heinlein's Novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is beyond wretched. It had the potential to be no more than a B-Grade Sci-fi monster movie with classy special effects, but for some reason Verhoeven decided he had to make it into a twisted version of Heinlein's excellent novel.Those who have seen the movie but not read the book may be shocked to learn that what Heinlein actually wrote was a story about a fundamentally noble human culture and the moral justifications for war against an implacable enemy. There was none of Verhoeven's pseudo-Nazi fascism and grade-school quality propaganda in Heinlein's version.Film adaptations of books inevitably leave something of the book behind, but Verhoeven has managed to raise this to a truly dreadful art in Starship Troopers. Virtually nothing of the book remains except some of the character names, and even most of those have been switched around (for example in the book Lieutenant Raczak was never a school teacher -- that man's name was DuBois -- and Pvt Flores was male!). Worst of all, though, is Verhoeven's twisted version of Heinlein's philosophy: Verhoeven has literally turned the moral center of the novel completely backwards, then tacked Heinlein's name on it as though it were a legitimate portrayal of what Heinlein was really saying. Using a man's name to legitimize what is no more than a parody of his work is simply wrong.Bottom line: It's a bad movie, made for rotten reasons, out of an otherwise great piece of literature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are two scenes in this movie that felt like they had some integrity - the prom scene, and Neil Patrick Harris' scene at home with Casper Van Dien and the ferret. The projection of a clean, good looking Archie at Riverdale High in the 22nd Century (in Buenos Aires) was kind of fun to watch. The rest of the film is pure idiocy. That doesn't mean it can't be enjoyed as such, it just means it's idiocy.The computer effects with the bugs are superb. No argument. The problem is just about everything else, especially the human characters. They never do anything that looks or remotely feels like they are preparing for a war. The sets look cheap, and the basic training compound, especially the basic training exercises, looks like a superstars competition from ABC in the 70's mixed with some beefed up version of summer camp. Once the troopers get into combat they are hopelessly underequipped. If your enemies are soldier bugs that try to chop you up with their pincers, wouldn't it be a good idea to be in a TANK? Or wear personal ARMOR? If you _have to hit_ the nerve casing in order to kill a bug wouldn't RPG's and ROCKET LAUNCHERS seem to make more sense than a submachine gun? One squad of the colonial marines from James Cameron's Aliens would have wasted every bug on Klendathu and been back home in time for breakfast.Did anyone notice that Klendathu was on the other side of the galaxy when they showed the location of the bug planet? That's what, about 75 THOUSAND LIGHT YEARS away from Sol? Did anyone notice that the bugs attack Earth from this distance by HURLING ROCKS at us? 75 thousand light years they hurled the rock? If they hurled it at the speed of light it would have taken 75 thousand years to get Earth and need to have passed through the core of the galaxy. Now that's what I call aiming! Denise Richard's ship almost got whacked because it almost ran into the rock? What was it, a stealth rock? You may not realize it, but space is kind of a big place. Like REALLY BIG. Trying to convince me that the Rodger Young barely escaped a near miss with a rock that scrapes off the communications pod... well, if you are going to try to tell me they hurled a rock thousands of light years, I suppose you can't expect me to quibble that on the way it might 'scrape' the Rodger Young.A lot of people have written about the fascist undertone of the society which was played up very strongly in the novel but actually only touched on in the film. I guess the concern about the totalitarian state displayed negated people's concern over the fact that we were fighting bugs that were hurling rocks and chopping at us with their pincers. I say we send in the cast of Excalibur on their horses next time! Armored knights with magic swords chopping bugs! Or heck, why not from the Monty Python version! Those French soldiers and their cow catapults would have finished the bugs in no time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fantastically subversive film. Definitely the pinnacle of Verhoeven's career. You are never sure whether he exalts or damns the jingoistic fascism so very accurately represented in this movie... Oh heck, he does present it in a seductive way.. but that is precisely the answer to the question why young folk do have this need to "join up" in order to butcher and get butchered - the siren song of blood and soil. War as a concept is fun - it is exciting, glorious and it gives us meaning: the good and the bad guys! However its other face is the lowest level of physical and moral Hell - "It is afraid.".. brilliant.Hats off to Verhoeven. He manages to be painfully critical and yet respectful to foibles of human nature at the very same time. If you want to know what made Hitlerjugend or any other army (bulk of which is invariably composed of men too young to know any better) tick then see this movie. The beauty of the inhumane beast that is war is almost too painful to watch - the innocence and beauty of youth made scintillating by the utter inhuman annihilation of it... and that is just on one level of this masterful satire.Many critics point out that the message is not clear enough for a satire but if Verhoeven stooped to portraying this fascist society in an overtly negative light without any redeeming qualities then it would have become exactly a bland and unconvincing tool of propaganda that he so relentlessly attacks in this film. Many satires fall flat on their face because they present their subject in an overly negative light. What is most disturbing in ST is that we actually do root for the "good guys" and understand why this society became what it is... it makes us understand the lure of militarism on a visceral level and a lot of people used to black/white thinking may find this unbearable. The movie is not trying to sell you its viewpoint or a "message".. beneath its intentionally carnivalesque shoot-em-up exterior it is coldly analytical to the level of being painful - which explains the high incidence hysterical laughter i noticed in the audience reacting to its many over the top moments, both in terms of gore and story.Verhoeven at his very, very best.</fullReview>

Lots of people have not understand Starship Troopers, they thought it was a dumb action flick full of corny dialogues and stupid characters. Well this is real! But what most people have not understood is that all this is intentional. This is not an action sci-fi movie it's a satire of the society at the time of war. Verhoven is criticizing the army and their ridiculous habits, the propaganda and especially the media in some of the funniest scenes ever showing the news on a computer (`Would you like to know more?'). This is Verhoven's real aim so you have to watch Starship Troopers more like if you are watching Mars Attacks than if you are watching Independence Day! You see! In the meantime watching this film is big great fun too! You will laugh at the sitcom-like characters, you will be thrilled by the spectacular action sequences, you will be astonished by the mind-blowing special effects (Like in most Verhoven's films) and you will be shocked by the violence of the war scenes (More cruel than Saving Private Ryan). Starship Troopers is a very clever and funny satire and even more than that: a big entertaining movie like you've never seen before.**** out of ****</fullReview>

The only positive remark is: at least it wasn't longer. Too bad I can't go lower than 1 on the rating scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I got the point of the movie...but it still sucked to me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notice I said it sucked to me. I am not going to bash people for liking this movie, but don't bash me for hating it. This movie is a thinly disguised anti-war movie that mocks patriotism and such. This movie is set in the future and the society has become more of a Nazi type government. Forget trying to analyze it, the science is quite bad so forget it. You will just hurt your head, thinking how it is impossible to fly the distances portrayed in this movie. In this movie they want you to join the military, and apparently you have to be a supermodel to join. Come on people, there aren't this many good-looking people at a college, most people are average looking, but you have to suspend your disbelief. The reason I hate this movie is that I can't stand the characters, they are all annoying and you almost crave for them to die, but then whom do you pull for? The bugs? They have no personality. So here and there lies the problem, the director purposely made this movie this way, you are supposed to hate the characters, I think I read where this was supposed to be what if the lead couple in the movie Grease became Nazis and fought a war in space. So right of the bat this is going to turn off a lot of people whether they get it or not. Many who enjoyed the movie didn't get it, but just like the violence and action, but I wasn't even overly impressed with the action. The movie is supposed to be satire, but it wasn't funny enough or witty enough for me. It played like a satire that took itself to seriously for its own good. Don't however; dismiss the movie based on my review. Many like it so give it a look see and write a review here. Many people like its antiwar messages and think it is a great play on things, others just like the action so as bad as I thought it was you may find something to like about it. I just hope I never live in a future where guys and gals can shower together and act like it is no big deal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brief synopsis of how I saw the plot is probably more descriptive than any other narrative I can write.Some people go to a "boot camp" to learn to be marines (er, Mobile Infantry). Some guy dies.An asteroid hits South America. Apparrently it was launched from a planet that we don't like. Since we don't like them, we send some marines to beat them up.Some bugs fart and blow up the fleet of space ships we sent. The marines, with stunninging ineffective weapons (except for their "nukes", which they hardly use for some reason), get beaten severely, and they retreat.We send the marines out again to an outlying planet, where they get beat up again. During this beating, we discover that some breed of bug sucks the brains out of people. Odd, that a radio operator in a VERY SMALL ROOM is the first victim. Why do I mention the size of the room? Read on.So, we get attacked, and the love interest gets captured. Some bugs run in to the room, and then leave. Then, a HUGE "brain bug" (that's what they call it, really) comes in, sucks the brain out of one guy, and gets wounded by the love interest. The hero comes in and rescues the love interest from the bugs with strangely effective weapons (same weapon as before, just more powerful now). As they leave, we learn that someone else captured the brain bug.Doogie Howser does the Vulcan mind-meld with the brain bug, announcing it's afraid of them.End of movie.The gore in ths film is pointless. About all we learn about the characters is that they're horny. All we learn about the bugs is they're tough. The high point of the film is the Robocop-esque news reports.I saw this film on a free weekend of Showtime, and I figure I paid too much. They should pay me to watch this kind of stinker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's the Heinlein?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The box in which the video came said "based on the novel by Robert Heinlein". Fortunately, Oregon has a basic Statute of Frauds, and the video store refunded my rental price. The movie "Starship Troopers" lacks the book's character development, plot, motivation, terrene form of government, time line, character interaction, and literary merit. Instead of a government run by responsible veterans "simply because it works", the movie proffers an out -of-control fascist regime. This brain-sucking obliterates Juan Rico's personal development; that very maturation process is the cornerstone of the book. His rise as a responsible human being, culminating in his passage through the rigors of officer's training, is simply impossible within the context (I can't call two threads a "fabric") of this movie. So, let's start from scratch -- assume that the Heinlein hook wasn't on the box. "Starship Troopers" still has no discernable character development and little discernible plot. There is simply nothing on the emotional or intellectual planes to get me personally involved with the movie. The special effects are excellent, but I can get equal impact from a fireworks display on the 4th of July. However, this does not make a watchable movie, any more than a pyrotechnical display and a naked assistant make a great magician. When I come to see prestidigitation, I'm hardly satisfied with the distractions. I'm disappointed that Hollywood can't seem to recognize a good story even when it bites them. "Dune" was overdone, underacted, and missed the mark somewhat. "Enemy Mine" was a forgettable hack job. "Starship Troopers" is a waste of good pyrotechnics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply just awful. This is one movie that I walked out of and didn't bother to finish watching in the theater. I did finish watching at a later date, and I was even more disgusted. Robert A. Heinlein is turning over in his grave at such a high rate, he can power the entire United States if they hooked a generator to him. Minor points in the movie do reference the book such as the attack on Buenos Airies, and the names of some of the characters. Paul Verhoven himself said that he never finished the book, he probably never passed basic training in the book. I'm not asking for a complete faithful rendition of the book, that would be too much to ask of Hollywood, however I do ask that they get it somewhat close. For those that complain that the book is boring and difficult to read, all I can say is have patience, and work through it. You will be greatly rewarded with a much better story, and a minor appreciation of the genius that was Robert A. Heinlein.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a satire, folks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**I have seen this movie three times, once at the theater and two times on the small screen. I must say that when I saw it at the theater I really didn't get that it was a satire, I thought it was just another action science fiction of which I think I was rather spoiled with at the time of its release. Is it just me, or did they make more sci-fi's in the late '90s compared to now? Whichever way around, I also do believe you need multiple viewings in order to understand what kind of message this film is trying to communicate. To me it becomes more clear for every viewing. Not only do all the military people wear clothes that look like Nazi-uniforms or with upside-down Nazi-insignias on them, they are also all grey or black. It's like they are robots, without emotions - at least some of them. Carmen Ibanez for example, the only real human emotion she shows proof of is when she throws up from disgust in dissection class. In this perspective it's just good that she doesn't show much acting talent, I bet she has been directed to be like that.I'm not the first one here who has noticed, but the movie also has become topical in a quite chilling manner after the 9-11 incident. The asteroid that hits Buenos Aires can by what effect it has in the film easily be seen as an allegory to the planes flying into WTC, and the resulting "war on terrorism" in Afghanistan and now Iraq (Klendathu and Planet P anyone?). After three viewings I believe the claim that the asteroid was sent by the bugs is nothing more than propaganda from the Federation in order for them to have their war machine up and running. How the hell would the bugs send an asteroid across the whole galaxy like that without any technology whatsoever? And the brain bug they capture in the end can be viewed as a representation of Saddam Hussein. When and if they capture him he will certainly be afraid. My rating: 10/10.</fullReview>

But it ended up a very poor tribute to a great author.The one saving grace of the film is the special effects. I must admit that I was impressed by them. But the insipid soap opera plotlines and horrible acting ultimately ruined the film for me.

		<shortDescription>Skip The First Hour And You Have A Fun Action Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "bug" scenes - the giant alien creatures - were outstanding and made this film really watchable. Unfortunately, we had to wade through the first hour of this 130-minute to get to those great action scenes, and had to endure a bunch of young, immature and extremely annoying characters and actors.Look what you have: Casper VanDien, Dina Meyer, Denise Richards, Jake Busey.....oh, man, what a bunch of snotty, young and stupid actors. They all have chips on their shoulders and the dialog between them is so stupid, it could only be a Paul Verhoeven-directed film. No surprise there! Verhoeven's films seem to be on the sleazy side, to say the least.Along the way, you can expect to hear his atheist heavy-handedness, and this movie is no exception. There is a cheap shot at Mormons; a plug or two for evolution and the customary unrealistic PC baloney of tough women who slug men and take charge!! Puh-leeze, this is so sickening.Fortunately, the second half saves this from being a total waste of time with some fantastic futuristic action scenes that are jaw-dropping at times. It's hard to imagine this film is about 10 years old already but the excellent special-effects still make it fun. Just skip the first hour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read Heinlein's book a long time ago (check the print date), and the movie was nothing like the book! Verhoeven obviously has an ax to grind. I don't mind that somebody has a different mindset than mine - but if you try to make a movie out of a book, then you should follow the premise and the spirit of the book! According to the reported comments of the idiot Verhoeven, he never even read the entire book - because he got "bored and depressed"! Poor baby! How in the world can one make a film out of a book, if one has not even read it!!!!! The book contained very thoughtful social comments, whether or not one agreed with them. If a movie is represented as being a film of a book, or "based" (that's a copout!) on a book, then the producers, writers, directors, etc. have an intellectual obligation to come as close to the story as possible (within the constraints of cinematic time and space). If one does not like the story, create your own - but do NOT call it as being "based" on the book!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film failed in its half-hearted attempts to tackle the topics that Heinlein so skillfully broached in the original novel. Where the film's future world society is bleak and oppressive, the book's society is hopeful and prosperous. Purpose behind the actions of each character, indeed both species in the war, is lost in the director's quest for a blockbuster shoot'em up. Heinlein at least suggests the possibility that humans attempted to settle a bug world, however this is lost in the xenophobic frenzy that this movie is.The movie isn't half of what it could have been had it followed the book more closely without a loss of any of the director's all too important action sequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly appalling fare; unlikeable and tedious...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure I was particularly disappointed by Starship Troopers; my expectations were low; they were fulfilled, with a sense of familiar resignation. This picture showcases so many of the problems inherent in modern Hollywood cinema: there are no stars, charisma, interest or charm; just an empty posturing, cynically set to confirm the prejudices of much of the modern cinema audiences, in order to cash in at the box-office. This is a truly unimaginative effort; any chance of some intelligent treatment of some reasonable ideas (I suspect all originating from Heinlein's novel) is scorned by Verhoeven. It doesn't even work on an "undemanding romp" level, and indeed, frequently bores. I am not easily impressed by the special effects, as they are showcased in this picture; they easily date, and thus basing a film around them seems unwise; let's hope this film will be forgotten in a few decades time.Basing a film around special effects is one thing; basing a picture around the highly questionable political ideology of fascism is quite another. It is not satire; as at every turn, the audience is meant to warm to these characters who strive to further their "Federation"'s cause. The values and "characters" are at no time questioned; there is no Winston Smith figure, just a nightmarishly bland world; there were many points where I laughed at these characters where I'm pretty sure it wasn't intended. It is a politically naive and one-sided view, with the use of such a faceless enemy a typical ploy to avoid any questions about the morality of war. The espousal of a militaristic rightist ideology often seems ridiculously overt and remains unquestioned at any point, really. The acting is universally of a mediocre standard; nobody acquits themselves with any subtlety; it's often one-dimensional. That Sergeant Zim, a cliched dillution of R. Lee Ermey's turn in "Full Metal Jacket", is maybe the most compelling character frankly says it all. Denise Richards shows as little acting talent here as the rest, relying on beauty and vacuous posing, devoid of any gravitas. The tone varies between that of a mediocre soap opera and a mindless patriotic action picture; thus, there is no innovation, interest here; barring perhaps the frankly absurd sight of one of the cadets leaping about, shrilly playing a futuristic violin...! Maybe, in conclusion, this film fails to entertain as it intends, because of the extent to which it wastes time on the bland and the facile. Crucially, I didn't feel remotely interested for one moment, in the supposed humans so sketchily depicted in this politically questionable film. Rating:- 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How did this crap get made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a shame the producers didn't realize exactly how sorry this rendition of Starship Troopers would be. Verhoeven was allowed to take a controversial yet well written and extremely popular science fiction story from one of America's better and long gone writers and defile it like the Romans poisoning an enemy well. How was he allowed to use not just one but two studios monies to fund his sabotage is just beyond me and so tragic. Many argue that those upset over the departures from the novel versus the movie are mere nitpicking made by scifi geeks with no ambition other than worhiping at the feet of authors that wouldn't give them the time of day. Maybe, but ya know what, can a movie that departs so far from the literary source it is supposed to be an adaptation of really deserve to be called an adaptation? To use its name? In my opinon no. Its like they read a paragraph from each chapter, stole the names of the characters (and changed some) and took the underlying premise and left Verhoeven to his own devices. Eliminating the power armor and other advanced weapons aside, the true story of Johnny Rico was never touched in this movie and Neumier (sp?) should have left the script titled "Bug Hunt" and kept his hands off the Starship Troopers name because he obviously took the original work with a grain of salt, so why did the think he could do much better? For those that would like to see a more truthful adaptation of this world and word of Heinlein with out the egregious and grandiosly innappropriate transformations of Verhoeven, then you really should check out "Roughnecks Starship Troopers Chronicles" which is out on a series of DVDs. Here the pretense of making a fascist statement where there really is none is dispensed with. The characters are feeling enties that though patriotic are still conflicted in this time of war and to prove it doesn't take itself too seriously, some of the propaganda is kept in. I am still puzzled as to how this was released as a bonafide Starship Troopers, saddend moreso by those that fail to see how disingenuine it is but hopeful that perhaps there will be more who will treat this story with the respect and forethought it deserves.</fullReview>

Starship Troopers is one of my favourite novels by my all-time favourite Author, Robert A. Heinlein. This movie has only a passing resemblance to it. The Power Armour suits that were central to the book are missing in the movie because, AFAIK "we couldn't make it look right." The bugs in the movie are basically mindless insects, while in the book they are an advanced, intelligent, technological race that uses space ships, weapons and explosives. Why the difference? Because Verhoven "couldn't imagine a bug with a gun." Did he even read the book? If you liked the book, don't bother with the movie. If you haven't read the book, please do so; find out what you've missed, what this movie *could* have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Potential never realized</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had fantastic potential. Anybody can tell you that this was based on a book written by Robert Heinlein. In truth, however, all Verhoeven got right was that the main character was named Juan "Johnnie" Rico, and the enemy was the Bugs. To give this more context, let me add that the book was originally published in 1959. Keep this in mind. The story was written before Vietnam, only six years after the Korean Conflict had drawn to a close...only four years after the publishing of "The Return of the King". Remember that when you read all the commentary here about how this movie is a "Social Commentary". That is all Verhoeven, not Heinlien. According to the DVD commentary, Paul Verhoeven never finished reading the novel, claiming he read through the first few chapters and became both 'bored and depressed', the movie's message is "War makes fascists of us all", and that he sees the movie as a satire of American militarism. Great background research there Paul... The overall theme of the book is that social responsibility requires individual sacrifice. It is the only science fiction novel on the reading list at three of the four United States military academies. The novel was filled with life lessons and examples of the importance of civic duty. More importantly though, it had a REALLY cool element that would have translated very well on film. POWER ARMOR!!!! The book spends loads of time explaining the power armor that made the "infantry" the "Mobile Infantry". Soldiers didn't ride down in boats, they were shot from tubes in capsules (hence the term "cap trooper"), and their suits looked like a kind of giant mechanical gorilla. Rather than utilize one of the best ideas in the history of science-fiction warfare, Verhoven decided to create "Space 90210" and add in his own sophomoric commentary on soldiering and society. Pretty boys and girls in shower scenes might bring in the high-school money, but it certainly doesn't make a good movie. If you enjoyed this, I strongly recommend that you read the book. You'll know immediately why those of us who did were very disappointed. Fantastic potential, never even close to becoming realized.</fullReview>

In the movie, The director has his own agenda. This is fine, if you are creative enough to tell your own story, but if you are going to steal someone elses, tell it the way it was intended.The movie on it's own wasn't really that bad.

They take a very minor character (Dizzy), changes the gender (him to her) and elevates her to an important character. Other characters are greatly cut back on or eliminated all together (Johnny's dad appears later in the book, and the History and Moral Philosophy teacher is changed to being Lt. Razack). Massive parts (Johnny going to officer academy), are cut. Also, the armament of the troopers is greatly diminished (from Power Armor with very big guns and a hand flamer to utterly useless armor and basically a SAW with a Shotgun on the bottom).

		<shortDescription>They Butchered the Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure how many of you have read Starship Troopers the book before reading it, but I'd like to point out a few things. First of all, there is a huge problem with this movie's interpretation (as usual with movies based on books). The dictionary defines fascism as "a totalitarian political system led by a single dictator who allows no opposition, promoting an aggressive nationalism and often racism." Am I the only one seeing a bit of a conflict? There was a democratic system in place which was most certainly not lead by "a single dictator". Furthermore there wasn't any racism mentioned at all in the books, indeed if you hadn't noted Sergeant Zim was most obviously of Asian descent (see his last name), as was Shujumi and quite a few others. Juan Rico himself wasn't of a descent himself that would be defined as "Arian". This movie on the other hand seems to have portrayed everybody as the typical "Arian" person. Furthermore there was a blatant disregard for human life in the ways of the M.I. The M.I. never leaves its own people behind. This is stressed throughout the book, it is continuously repeated that fighting spirit is valued and that even if one M.I. soldier is left behind they will come back for him. This is quite contrary to what is shown in the movie with random killing and ignorance of losses. There also seemed to be a few training scenes where lives were completely wasted for no apparent reason whatsoever. If you will once again flip your books to the page where Robert A. Heinlein describes the search for the two young men gone missing in the Rockies during training you'll realize that this is beyond stupid. Finally the scene where John tries to resign is quite ridiculous. It is stated numerous times that any Mobile Infantry soldier can leave whenever he likes. In fact any army member was allowed to resign under virtually any conditions unless they happened to be in the middle of a drop or some other such forbidding position. The people were furthermore most certainly not coerced into joining the army. If any of you will go back to the scene (in the book) where John is being recruited, you will realize that they were indeed discouraged and were told not to join by the recruiting officer. This makes the entire idea of the advertisements about doing one's duty quite ridiculous. Overall, I was severely disappointed when I had seen how this movie had butchered the book. If you had read it first and are thinking of watching the movie, I recommend you save yourself a good deal of mental anguish and don't watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead;The federation has declared war on acting. Never before and likely never again will you see an ensemble of adolescent atavists who surprise you when they can put two syllables together. Van Dien and Richards the one two punch of the worst actors of their entire genders. The film plays like The Young And The Restless: The Federation Years. Yes, Doogie Howser is the intellectual; the term is quite relative here. Please, no more close ups on his face. When Michael Ironside and Clancy Brown seem like great actors, you are in real trouble. Could I ask a science question? They can fold space and these are their weapons? The giant grasshoppers appear to absorb about one hundred rounds before going down. I know, Doogie demonstrated how to kill one with a couple shots; apparently, no one got the memo or more likely nobody could read. See, if these are your weapons, do you think standing toe to toe with the grasshoppers and killing say three out of ten thousand might not be the best military strategy. Yes, Rico you kill bugs good for a brainless moron. Hey, maybe draw them out in the open and bomb the crap out of them? This is allowing the retarded assumption that every other part of our science would have advanced except our weapons.Look, when a philosopher is giving you strategic battle advice, you know how bad the screenplay is. Anything beats standing out in the open, like a dumb S, and taking heavy causalities while killing a handful of millions of them. How about manning a wall? Gee, could we get some air support here? They are all piled out in the open? The dialog is at the fourth grade level with lines that will make anyone with more than five neurons firing wince. The acting puts the C in crappy. Yes, that brain bug, take it from me, will not need a very big brain to outwit you acne covered retards. If this is earth's best, time to make out that will. When they are not pumping 1000 rounds into a single, giant grasshopper who appears to be iron plated; they are jumping each other's bones in the who is the biggest skank contest? Like we give a crap? This movie has to be seen to be believed. The great effects heighten the stupidity. These great space ships and they are fighting with our weapons? Even given these weapons, anybody with a brain, that leaves the whole cast out, would have devised a slightly better way to engage the bugs then standing on a wall or out in the open and firing one clip per bug. I love when the brain bug sucks that idiot's brain out; you didn't see it spit it back out. Trust me, bug boy, you do not want that one. It is broken. The jingoistic, fascistic Nazi crap gets really old, really fast. Did Goebbels make this movie? Stop with the third grade nationalism, coming out of Van Dien's Rico, it evoked the justifiable laughter it warranted in my theater. Actually, it goes with the characters perfectly. These are just the useful idiots Lenin was speaking about. You see why Nietzsche described nationalism as a form of mental retardation. Please, Rico stop with the citizen crap; those uniforms were just missing the skull and crossbones to complete the effect. What an ugly, stupid, badly acted pile of steaming dog poop.</fullReview>

Nothing here makes any sense at all. Space bugs? Are you kidding me? Bugs hurling asteroids towards Earth, from another solar system? How? Where is this system? Are you aware of the distances? How can a bunch of bugs do it anyway? They can't even leave the surface of their home planet. And what do these billions of giant bugs eat on a planet that doesn't seem to have any form of vegetation or indigenous life, aside from the bugs? Why do humans fight them with WWI military tactics? Why would you have infantry on the ground when you can nuke them from the sky? Of course,people will say that this is not the point, that the film is tongue-in-cheek satire and that it's supposed to be seemingly senseless violence, in order to convey its message about a special kind of mentality that this future society fosters. OK, fine. But do they think this message is particularly clever? I don't. I did not see a single interesting idea in the whole film. There is nothing about human nature one gets to learn that one does not already know. There is no reflexive exploration here that is worth mentioning. Frankly, I think the film works better as a senseless action film, and as such it still fails colossally. The characters are irritating, the action pointless, and the tone is deeply unpleasant - and not in a good way, like 'Aliens', for instance.I hated this film from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is to Heinlein what film of I Robot is to Asimov</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Tweens" who thirst more for bright colored if shallow action/battle scenes and the occasional (you should pardon the expression) flashes of skin in their sci-fi rather than actual battles of wits and ideas should have a bright shallow good time at Paul Verhoeven's attempt to make Robert A. Heinlein's juvenile page-turner into a 90's genre action satire.STARSHIP TROOPERS was one of Heinlein's few pieces of speculative fiction in which he let his 1920's naval officer persona (a promising engineering career was cut short by medical problems - TB? - more than a decade before Pearl Harbor) with its predictably pre-fascist presumptions creep through his usually more disciplined analytical facilities. The "red scare" years of the 1950's and the wave of early xenophobic science fiction that it engendered spawned the novel but couldn't make it filmable, at least then, but the more cynical (not to mention sexually open) 1990's made the idea of treating it as an enormous satire seem tempting. The only problem being the utter uncertainty what it was the film maker was attempting to satirize; Reagan era "might makes right" national policy? Overzealous military apologists, recruiters and trainers? It's difficult to tell from the film director Verhoeven made if he was satirizing or promoting these ideas, which may have limited the film's commercial success. It's pretty clear that in his original novel, Heinlein was promoting them.Perhaps Verhoeven was aiming at the then recent wave of Jean-Claude Van Damme exploitation films. Pretty boy Casper Van Dien as the high school football hero incompetent in any other role who miraculously becomes a successful military leader bears more than a passing resemblance to Van Damme's 1992 UNIVERSAL SOLDIER...right down to the requisitely kinky stripped-to-the-waist flogging scene. That really may be the only way this big budget CGI extravaganza makes sense. The ridiculously imposed "happy ending" certainly doesn't. The film might have been a bit more believable had it been told from the "Bugs'" perspective (as presented, can anyone really believe they could be defeated short of an inter-galactic "Raid" commercial?).Whatever its other virtues, STARSHIP troopers provided an interesting training ground for Neil Patrick Harris, the best actor in the cast, giving a performance as the "smart" classmate who winds up in a command position in military intelligence indistinguishable from that he would give years later in TV's "How I Met Your Mother." All this lack of respect for Heinlien's novel and the film Verhoeven came up with notwithstanding, anyone not familiar with the later science fiction novels of the Nebula and Grand Master Award winning author should not be put off by this "one swallow" anymore than viewers of the spectacularly unfaithful film of Isaac Asimov's definitive "I Robot" compendium should be put off from that master's robot novels and short stories. The films simply are not representative. As Heinlein got older and he was less and less constricted by the right wing ethos he had grown up in - and his earliest publishers demanded - he posited some of the most challenging and forward thinking ideas of the science fiction and social universe, unburdened with the sexism, mindless racism and imperialism which one would have expected from a retired 1920's naval officer.Even in its worst shallows, this brightly filmed, excruciatingly silly STARSHIP TROOPERS has hints of the challenges Heinlein would later toss up for readers. It makes one wish a first tier director would tackle some of the writer's later, greater works.Hints of Heinlein's lack of sexism were at least honored by director Verhoeven in his insisting on a universe where men and women serve and shower together in a military which accepts that disciplined soldiers seeing each other naked will not automatically result in their raping each other. Viewers familiar with Heinlein's work (especially his "Time Enough For Love" and "Friday") may be amused that this film of STARSHIP TROOPERS, in order to create some "romantic interests," has transmuted one or two of the characters in Heinlein's all male cast into women. The entirely straight but imminently rational Heinlein might not have bothered to make the sex-change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than a Sci Fi movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many reviewers have indicated that the film has multiple levels and loving it but many just hating it as a poor standard Sci Fi film. However as mentioned the film has many layers to it and the deeper you go the better it becomes. At first it just seems to be a bog standard teen high school movie with the "teenagers" all actually being in their mid to late 20s. It's like High School Musical with no music but retaining the typical teenage angst. We're told at the start that Democracy has failed and it appears to be have replaced with a worldwide military dictatorship. The war with the bugs is introduced and the theme of human superiority rears its head. Underestimating the enemy is a general theme which harks back to the Vietnam wars, French and US, but once the mistake is realised then it's assumed that better weaponry and inherently superior human intellect will prevail and the human race will be dominant which echoes the Nazi philosophy about racial purity and genetic superiority. A negotiated settlement is put forward by the more enlightened but is dismissed as offensive. The ending is left open-ended as Verhoeven anticipated a sequel or at least hoped for one with an increased budget. Hence the continued Nationalistic rhetoric and the emphasis on better weapons with the lack of people to use them meaning that kids are now enlisting. The parallel with the use of children as soldiers in some wars is obvious but here is all part of doing your bit! As a pure Sci Fi movie it's poor apart from the special effects with average acting and a seemingly average script which appears superficial. But with the underlying themes it makes it an outstanding anti-war film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of those movies I first saw in theater many years ago and watching it again reminds me why it has a cult movie following. It takes top marks for a science fiction film, and then for all the other elements all bundled in one. The way the movie is presented is really different, feels like a live comic with the cut sequences of scenes and dialogs. It can get gory with the military action and the bugs can leave you feeling squeamish. However,A great casting, timeless romantic story, military action, comedy, satire, special effects and life in general.Anyone who sees this film hopefully will see it for all those themes that make this movie stand out and not just as another sci-fi film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humans versus the arachnids--who will win at the end?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, for Johnny Rico, after graduating from a high school from Buenos Aires (his hometown), joining up with the Federal Service to fight against bugs from the planets making up a fictional system called Klendathu, was not going to be a cakewalk for him. First, he goes through boot-camp facing Drill Sergeant Zim, and even through the tough training, he gets quickly enamoured by recruit trainee, Dizzy Flores, a tough, rugged military lady who can fight like a man. Johnny then makes it up the ranks as squad leader, and had dreams that his second love interest, pilot trainee Carmen Ibanez (not knowing yet about Rico's love for Dizzy) informs Johnny that she is going to have a full-time career in the Federal Service fleet, wanting to be a fleet ship commander. Then, everything is stripped when during a live-fire exercise, he accidentally kills teammate Breckenridge, gets flogged 10 stripes with his demotion to private, and decides to leave the boot camp area. But then, word spreads out that a bug meteor from Klendathu impacted Buenos Aires into a fiery holocaust with millions of people dead. Johnny decides to re-instate himself as a private to fight in the war, even with strong resistance from Sergeant Zim. Fleet battle station Ticonderoga is the main action point for the first offensive against the Klendathu planet, or Big K. The fleet flotilla does make a massive assault despite bug batteries firing plasma. But then, the arachnid soldiers on the planet were ready for the Fleet soldiers, with over 100,000 casualties for the Fleet after the 1st attack.Sky Marshal Dienes resigns after the failure of that 1st offensive and a replacement sky marshal sets up the 2nd attack. The Zegema Beach attack is a much better success as the Fleet fighter planes bomb the arachnids dead on the ground, and then the MI (mobile infantry) comes in to kill off the remaining arachnids, including a tanker bug.A major then informs Johnny that a distress call on Planet P is serious, breaking their rest break during his love scene with Dizzy. On P itself, Johnny's rank is raised to sergeant as the Mobile platoon finds Port Joe Smith, abandoned with bloody baths of dead soldiers. They find General Owen locked up in the port's command post, take him out, and realizing that an arachnid ambush is coming, the platoon makes a counterattack that would soon fail, but a rescue ship saves their day.Regrettably, Dizzy is badly wounded by a rogue arachnid as the platoon retreats on the rescue ship, and later dies, making Johnny swallow his pride.Now, the last offensive in the flick focuses on getting back to Planet P to capture a brain bug that may be responsible for the failed Klendathu offensive. Well, fortunately, even though the Fleet offensive sustains heavy losses and Carmen and his pilot instructor escape from an escape pod from the Jolly Roger command ship that gets destroyed by bug plasma, right into Bug City, they could not escape one arachnid, but Johnny finally rescues the two out of the way. The brain bug is finally caught, but it was a close call for Carmen and Johnny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing to rate!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really had a problem rating this film. I was not sure was it good or bad. In the end I decided it was good. Paul Verhoven shows us how the war can be confusing and how government can exploit patriotic feelings by sending their men and women to combat. May be he saw wars in Iraq and Afghanistan coming, Bosnia and Kosovo were wars at the time, and it was obvious that the USA will be engaged in protracted conflicts in middle Asia.When I first saw the movie I was confused, but as the time passed I think it is excellent. Just as the wine ripes, so does some films, this one is like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci-fi B movie awesomeness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bugs! Bugs! Is usually what your internet dweeb Brandon shouts every time he sees a spider. Hola that's right I am back again for another review. If you get that quote then you love this cheesy sci-fi action, war movie as much as I do. This is a cult classic if I have ever seen one and too my surprise that this movie is in fact based off a book. This I never knew because apparently the book promotes fascism and a military style of world. Where the movie doesn't promote it but shows sort of what the world would be like if we did do such a thing. I just have to say one thing if you haven't seen the sequels and you thought this movie was fun, just forget about them because those sequels are terrible, I watched the third one and wow was that bad on so many levels they did not progress well.In case you don't know this movie is about a bunch of dudes that look like they walked right off the set from Aliens in a intergalactic war with a bug race known as Arachnids. These things very from the generic drones to big a** fire breathing monsters of beetles. The movie follows two character Jonny Rico who is this marine who kills the ever loving s*** out of some bugs and Carmen Ibanez who was Rico's ex who is a pilot and that's all she does. There are a couple of things that bug me, yeah I just made that pun. The first thing is in the beginning the aliens are hard to kill it takes almost three of them to take the bastard out. Towards the end of the movie they are dying from a bullet or two. It was very inconsistent in the terms of the plot and such. I also have to point out they "nuke" the bug holes and I have to say call it something else guys. I know I am looking for logic in a Sci-fi movie but if that is a nuke you aren't going to be only 50 yards away from the hole and be OK. It is Sci-fi make up a name for it then I won't question it. Honestly I've just seen this movie too many times I am reading way too into this film. It has a generic plot but I have to say damn they are not afraid to kill anybody off in this film. I won't say who but they cut there cast almost down to a hand full of people so be prepared.This movie for being a B Sci-fi film has some pretty damn good special effects. The Arachnids look pretty well done they don't look as CG as you'd expect. Unlike in the third movie where they look like someone did them on a lap top these are very professional looking. I also have to say the practical gore is just the best and this movie has gore. They aren't afraid to rip a guys face off right in front of the camera there is no shaky cam or cut away to hide what is happening.This movie was directed by Paul Verhoeven who directed two of my favorite 80's movies Total Recall and Robocop. What drives me nuts is most directors if the movie is based off a book will read the book. Not this guy he didn't like the book and made a movie anyways which I think he lucked out that this became a cult classic. I am curious what movie we would've seen if he read the book entirely. Normally I mention the screen writer because they are a lot of what happens in this movie but damn I don't know the lines in this film were bad. When I said it was cheesy this is cheesy, it also doesn't help the only good actor in the movie is everyone's favorite Michael Ironside. This guy is awesome in the movie; while the main character Jonny Rico ( Casper Van Dien) was way over acting. This guy is a big, big straight to DVD, or straight to cable actor and it shows. He over acted the s*** out of his role but I'll hand it to him being it was a B movie the guy was perfectly cast for this film.Overall in the end of the day if you are a film snob and you hate campy fun films then stay the hell away from this. If you are that guy or girl who loves Sci-fi and loves gore and that's all you need in a movie then pick this s*** up it is so worth watching. I have a weird love for this film I am one of its supporters I have to give it a B-. I give it such a high righting for a B movie because you have to see it and if you do and like it you'll want to own it as well.go to bloodyscreen.weebly.com for more reviews sucka.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realistic creature effects but has no charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Paul Verhoeven is known for making some real dark satirical films that not only are new and different, but also leave a memorable impression. But like all human beings, there's always the possibility of messing up. This film in particular is not one of his greatest films. Somehow I just couldn't latch on to the characters that were involved with the plot. There was no charm with these actors.Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) wants to join the Starship Troopers so he can become a citizen for his planet. And in this world, it is the only way one can become a citizen. The same goes for the characters of Dina Meyer, Denise Richards, Jake Busey, and Neil Patrick Harris. That's fine and all that they have a main goal but the way they're persuaded to do it is another story. The new Earth is much weirder than you would expect.Each time the audience is placed in front of a screen, they are blasted with infomercials that deal with becoming a citizen by joining the Starship Troopers. Not to mention, even when the screen is speaking of death and showing the deaths to the public, the narrator still sounds happy. What is this? Are the authorities seriously trying to pull the wool over their eyes? Why does this seem like a dictatorship? Plus, these actors' characters follow these instructions like drones. Like it's no big deal that they're sacrificing their lives for the sake of the federation.The point of joining the military is to defend Earth of a "Bug" invasion. These bug creatures are really not what you would think of as a bug on earth but they are cool looking. They look like giant camouflage colored toothpick creatures that hunt in giant packs. There are a few other different bug aliens but the majority of them look all the same. And like any Verhoeven movie, the film displays the most atrocious gory death scenes. The ground was almost as wet as the floor in Dead Alive (1992); I couldn't believe the scenes I saw.Besides this though I could not find anything else to enjoy about it. The characters had no personalities and the acting was bland. It's not to say it wasn't good acting because they were obviously following the script but it wasn't fun; everyone acted the same. Basil Poledouris who made several scores to Verhoeven's movies didn't seem to really put anything into this one either. Nothing was fun with it either. That disappointed me too. Just the creature effects and bloodshed were the only standouts.For a science fiction film, it definitely gives the audience the creatures they want. However the acting, music and storyboard are so weird and bland that the "bugs" will be the only thing worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A VERY bad story that owes NOTHING to the Original Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert A. Heinlein wrote "Starship Troopers" in 1959. It has NEVER been out of print. He adamantly refused to sell the rights to Hollywood, unless they would give him complete creative control over any movie made. It was NEVER sold in his lifetime, because no one would do that.His widow, when old, sick and with early Alzheimers, sold the rights to this book. She was conned into doing so. This awful movie is the result, and it is so far divorced from what Heinlein wrote that there is little comparison. If Heinlein was alive, he would demand that his name be removed for these "films".The producers turned this into a sex romp, totally lost the meaning of the story, and they screwed up Juan (NOT John) Rico from the moment he set foot to enlist.In the book, he decides to enlist because his friends are doing it. He decides in basic training to continue, when he receives a letter from his old High School Instructor, who he learns was a Lt. Colonel in the Mobile Infantry, Retired, that congratulates him on "making it over the Hump" (and anyone that has ever gone though basic training/boot camp knows what that "hump" is).Jaun does NOT get a battlefield commission, he decides to go "Career" and goes to Officer's Training School (which ONLY career enlisted can go to, after they have served in combat). That's where he meets Carmen again, and he is envied by his fellow students AND by the faculty when they see her. there is no "Dear John Letter".While on a training mission, he is assigned as a "3rd Lieutenant" with a platoon under him The Platoon Sergeant is his old basic training sergeant, Sergeant Zim. Juan Rico is the one that captured the brain bug, after Sergeant ZIM got it cornered, so the "bugs" couldn't attack him. Juan is badly wounded in the process, ends up in the hospital for a while, and then back to Officers Training.At the end of the book, he has gone back to the Roughnecks, and his father, who was NOT in Buenos Aires when it was bombed, has enlisted himself and has become his platoon sergeant.By the way, in the Mobile Infantry, everyone from the lowest Private the the highest general, fights. The Chaplain is just one of the men from the ranks. The cook is another guy from the ranks. There are no non-fighting jobs, EVERYBODY fights.The entire concept of the book is based on the premise that no one should have the right to vote, that has not served their country. The liberals hated this book when it was first published back in 1959, and they still hate it. The very concept that anyone should have to earn the right to vote just makes them ill.This movie has elements of the book, woven around what is essentially a T &amp; A action flick.It's a shame that his widow ever sold those rights, because Robert Heinlein knew that Hollywood would make an abortion of his book if given the opportunity. Sadly, that is exactly what they did.I first read that book in 1960, while in the US Army. I have reread it many times since. the message of the book is one that would greatly strengthen our country, but it will continue to be ignored.This sad excuse for a movie will certainly not help.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Does anybody else see some incredible similarities between this film and if the Third Reich had achieved it's goal? A seemingly global federation apparently expanding across several continents where over 300,000 soldiers can die in a single invasion. In this case, the invasion is another planet filled with inferior "bugs" that are completely underestimated as an enemy. Federal propaganda is filled with censored online video depicting only what it wants the people to see, unless it is what the Federation wants the people to see. The uniforms have characteristics of Nazi officers. Simply view historical footage of Nazi officers and you can notice similarities.Students are taught the differences between a citizen and a civilian. Citizens have all of the rights while civilians are treated as minorities because a civilian (undefined) does not have the courage to protect the Federation with their life. Insubordination is punished with either death or lashes.At the same time, German life during the 1930's is shown. Life is abundant and thriving under Nazi rule with few people publicly showing any kind of resistance. Of course, this is not shown probably because of budget problems or deleted scenes.In the end, the Federation is portrayed as showing it's domination of the galaxy through a force of willing men and women (yes women in a GLOBAL federation) ready to sacrifice their lives for its survival.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starship Troopers exhibits director Paul Verhoeven's signature flashes of mordant wit, satire, and strong violence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is a rather weak film from director Paul Verhoeven. The special effects are, for the most part, impressive. The giant insects are well-designed and look realistic. The acting and the plot, however, take a backseat to the action. Not a single actor delivers a commendable performance. Everything about the film seems mechanical, including Verhoeven's direction. The first half of the film is about John Rico's life before he joins the infantry, and the second half is mostly one shootout after another.As an action picture Starship Troopers works. It's entertaining if you watch it once. There's even some of that good old wicked Verhoeven humour. But that's about all there is to it. There's nothing to take away from this film. It's not a typical Hollywood product, but by the end it sure seemed like one. By the way, when the brain bug was captured I thought of Osama Bin Laden. The film's satire seems more relevant after 9/11.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Misunderstood Film Of The 1990's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few films have polarised opinion quite like Starship Troopers. Some see it as a generic Hollywood Sci-Fi/Action film, a poorly acted and weakly scripted conversion of a popular, if controversial book. Others view as some sort of subtle satire on the US Military with some fascist overtones. I personally feel it's a mixture of both, and is without doubt Paul Verhoevens finest film (yes, even better than Total Recall). When I watch Starship Troopers, I get the feeling, more than with any other film, that the Studio Executive who green-lit it for a budget around $100,000,000, didn't know quite what he was getting himself into.The film tells the story of several young, impressionable students, who are members of a futuristic global society, drawn into a massive inter-planetary conflict in the 25th Century, against a species of giant insects known simply as 'the bugs' or 'the arachnids'.What you have here is a film that can be enjoyed purely as mindless popcorn entertainment, a piece of action-packed, blood-soaked, interstellar mayhem. This is achieved through the sheer scale of the battle scenes and the vast set-pieces. Every time I see the initial Klendathu drop-scene in this film, played out to Basil Pouledaris' epic score, it sends a shiver down my spine. The CGI in this movie is truly outstanding. Indeed, the effects still look impressive now, 12 years on. The aforementioned drop scene and the bug siege later in the film are both awesome to behold.You get the impression that a great deal of the money put into this film went on effects, and this also would help explain the group of B-list actors and actresses assembled to star in this movie. The only names who could really be considered 'familiar' are the excellent Michael Ironside, playing Lieutenant Radzcak, and the rather attractive Denise Richards (at the height of her fame). I often excused the sub-par acting, for the reason given above, but since watching the film a number of times, I now have an entirely different theory. The very reason this cast was selected is because they are 'adequate'. Take Casper Van Dien, appearing in his first, and to date, last true big-budget production. Van Dien is not a great actor. The scenes in which he speaks at times made me wince (partly because of the lines he is given), but you can't argue he is perfect as Johnny Rico, Squad Leader. He is a good looking guy. The same is true of Dina Meyer, she isn't a bad actress, but she is a beautiful woman. The same is true of all the other minor characters. They are not representative of the sort of diversity you would find if the Earth was ever to engage in an interstellar war. They are all young, very good looking, and intensely idealistic. If this were to occur for real, you would have poor people, ugly people, and convicted people. There is a scene where Rico, Carmen, and his best friend Carl are enrolling in the Military and they are speaking to a Veteran, who explains; "Mobile infantry made me what I am today," before revealing he is missing an arm and both legs. Johnny Rico gives him an almost dismissive look, and this attitude is prevailant throughout the film. As yet more and more, able young people are mercilessly slaughtered by the bugs, they still carry on signing up believing it is for the greater good, when really the government is simply using them.The entire movie is really like a propaganda film for the military, complete with mindless media reels (a Verhoeven trademark, used in Robocop). Its ability to illustrate the impact media can have on a population during war is chilling. The bugs are completely demonised by the State News Network. Viewed only as the vicious, inherently evil creatures that they are, the more important point of the conflict is completely overlooked. This is the that the only reason the bugs sent the meteor to Buenos Aeries in the first place is because of human encroachment on their land. The attack was far from unprovoked. The film shows the central characters starting out as high-school graduates and finishing with them as experts in their respective fields, with the exception of Dizzy, who is killed. There is no reflection whatsoever and just the illogical, and empty conclusion that; 'They'll keep fighting...and they'll win. This is the point I realised that the film is really just a satire and perhaps even a parody on the nature of war itself.I wonder how many people watching this film cheered in cinemas as the bugs were mown down, when the reality is that the humans depicted in this movie are an equally ugly species, if not more so. At the end of the film, when the bug leader; the brain bug, is captured, and Rico's friend Carl is sent to translate the sounds it is making and tell the others what it is feeling, he answers with two simple words; 'It's afraid.' They celebrate in its terror. The same terror they felt in Klendathu. This is the real message behind Starship Troopers; nobody wins in war, everybody loses, but it will inevitably carry on all the same. This is a film that celebrates war, but dryly mocks and criticises it in equal measure. You can enjoy the relentless violence, beheadings, severed limbs and other grisly moments (the scene where the brain bug literally sucks Xanders brain out is one of grimmest I have ever seen.), all the while realising its not quite as far-fetched as you might think, and when you look at the real-life conflicts that have taken place since the film was released, you could even argue it's a little ahead of its time. Too criticise the dialogue or acting in this film is to miss the point entirely. For an action movie, its clichd, its generic, but its quite simply one of the very best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good For Entertainment, but Not Really an Appealing War Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starship Troopers I would say is a pretty appealing Sci-Fi action film during the 90's since you can't really compare them to the present Sci-Fi films with all the more advanced CG graphics and special effects. But since this is a "war" film about humans fighting against bugs, it is indeed challenging in a way that you got these two different races from different worlds fighting each other. So it is very unlike those historical war films that we saw before about Vietnam war, and World War II. Those kinds of films are more easier for people to relate with because of the human emotions, there's the drama or a look into the human psyche when people are killing each other. But its difficult to see that in Starship troopers because all we ever see is just the actions in battle. The perspective was pretty much focused on the humans of course, while the bugs are just being portrayed as totally villainous. Which for me, it's pretty narrow, as it appears to be like you know, "We humans must slaughter them all since they attacked us.." this would be OK if this film is to be watched or enjoyed under the light of purely entertainment, because to me this film only portrays the human side. As I watched this film, I kept on asking myself, "What good are the humans? We have our own pathetic weaknesses too, but in the end, we as humans still enjoy the outcome of the wars when we blow our enemies into bloody pieces." There's a lot of blood and ore in this film, but never really show the professional maneuvers of the military. I do not feel it is real because I do not feel being part of the combat. I've seen older war films that has done a greater job than this one, because in those war films its just never about the guns and the shouting, and all the blood. You actually get to experience the psychological horror or shock coming from the actors, but in this film, you don't really see that. All we see is the joy of blowing the bugs into pieces and killing them. We don't see the actual emotional experiences of how war might have any effects on the character's mental state. Maybe just little bit at the beginning when Rico discovers how terrifying the bugs are, but their encounter with the bugs are always the same. The same kind of tension, the same kind of challenge, and there's really nothing new other than the flying and giant new monsters. I do not feel like being in a battle field because the humans are just running all over the places and shooting the bugs in bundles. I would enjoy it more to see the humans actually are attempting to accomplish certain orders on the battle field under the command of somebody. I like the drama, and the girl who played Carmen, she's gorgeous and it really makes me to dislike early on because of her character and I really wanted to see her to be with Rico again, but somehow it didn't really work that powerful. It becomes like I really don't care anymore about them because I don't really see a lot of conflict between them. I really wanted more out of them. Maybe all this is little too much for this film, and maybe its because I've seen some of the war films already that were pretty much better than this one. So this could be biased. Overall I think its alright...for just purely entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Arachnids" and humans are at war, and "Johnny Rico" (Casper Vab Dein) has decided to join the military to fight the "bugs." Even though his parents, especially his father (Christopher Curry), object it and order him to go on vacation. He refuses, and joins the military.He joins his beautiful girlfriend (Denise Richards), in military training. However, after taking an exam, he is assigned to Mobile Infantry, while she is assigned to Flight School. He is also joined by his best friend (Neil Patrick Harris, and his female football team mate, "Dizzy" (Dina Meyers), who tries to make him forget "Carmen" (Richards).Now, after not being the best soldier-in-training and making a huge mistake resulting in the death of a fellow soldier, "Rico" decides to stick with the service as things begins to heat up in the war.This movie reminds me a little of the "RoboCop" films with the fiction television broadcasts and TV commercials in the start of the movie. It then goes to straight out action movie.One thing you will notice immediately is the special effects. They are perfect if you ask me. The starships look very realistic, and the "Arachnids" are amazing.The "Bugs", as they are nicknamed for obvious reasons, look incredibly realistic. Their skin and movements really make them look like the real thing. And they are perfectly blended into the scenes. In fact, the special effects still hold up about 11 years later.I thought the cast was really good. Even when the lines were a little poor. Many had really good chemistry together, especially the main performers. But, I think Harris was trying too hard to act "military" when he rejoins the story near the end.Another thing you can't help but notice is the costumes. I can see many of the outfits in the battlefield. However, Richards looked horrible in what I think was a dress uniform she wore in one scene. The jacket looked too big on her, which was by design in the shoulders. Even the hat looked horrible on her.There is a lot of action in this movie. Lots of explosions and gun play. However, despite the "Bugs" being explained in the movie as intelligent creatures, I just did not see any intelligence in their attacks, if any. To me, the "Arachnids" appeared to be defending their homeworld from invaders that had no reason for their attack.I don't think that the movie did a clear explanation as to why the "Arachnids" are attacking the humans. It felt to me that the audience was left to assume the reason for their attack.I also found some weak character development in this movie. We get people who are introduced to the audience, but their relationships with main characters are not really explored. We do get how they are connected with the main players, but we get no depth into their relationships.One thing that parents of young children should be aware of is that this movie is pretty violent. If your child is of an age that can not understand that the "Arachnids" are not real, then you probably might not want to have them see this movie. Also, some of the things seen are pretty graphic, and should not be viewed by really young children due to how graphic some things are.For some reason, the majority of the blood comes from the "Arachnids." You will see some major injuries, but the amount of blood that pours out is not as much as you would expect -- especially when an artery is sliced.This movie is not for people who don't like gore, even though this is pretty mild. I also would not allow younger kids to watch this one.Despite the minor problems, I would put this in your top three selections to rent if your first one is unavailable. Or check it on On Demand like I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A first rate bloody b-movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a distant future the human race is in a defensive military frenzy to defeat an insect alien race, and military service guarantees citizenship. We meet a few kids just out of school who decide to join the military. We meet Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien), who is trying to win over his girlfriend Carmen (Denise Richards) who also joins the military. We also meet his best friend Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris). Once in military training the friends seem to have no idea what they're up against. Johnny is sent along with his troops to fight the wide-scale war against the giant alien insects on the planet Klendathu, bent on conquering and destroying the human race. Hell bent on winning the war against these disgusting bugs, all three friends continue to fight. But as mangled bodies fly, and the bugs seem to get smarter, the humans have to start finding new ways to defeat their foes. And that may mean finding the leading "Brain" of this insect race, something beyond what anyone could imagine.Starship Troopers is a modern classic. It's action packed, gung-ho, gruesome, flashy, and definitely one of the most exciting action movies of the 1990s. There are so many awesome things in this movie that it's hard for me, and many other fans of this cult classic, to name them all. The special effects on the bugs are really well done, and the same goes to all the rest of the action. All of the different bugs looked very cool, and were constantly a menacing enemy. However I don't exactly understand how this race of giant alien insects could ever take over the human race. Sure if there were colonies of these bugs, like the ones on Klendathu, that got to Earth they could surely dominate us. But how are the bugs technically a big threat when they're on their own planet? How are they ever going to get all the way to Earth to destroy the humans without any technology? Maybe I'm just thinking way too far into it. This is an action/sci-fi movie after all. And there were far more things I enjoyed about this b-movie rather than disliked.Now let's talk about the acting and the story, you know...the secondary parts of the movie. Casper Van Dien gives a good lead performance, actually it's probably his best performance if you count some of the crappy movies he did after this. Cough* Shark Attack *Cough. Denise Richards and Dina Meyer are both good as the two girls in a love triangle with Johnny Rico. There's almost always a little sappy romance thrown in b-movies, and some actress has to show her boobs. This is a Paul Verhoeven film after all, let's not forget that. In my opinion the best three performances here come from Neil Patrick Harris, Jake Busey, and Michael Ironside. Jake Busey kicks butt and takes names, Michael Ironside gives a particularly strong performance. And Neil Patrick Harris, well, Neil Patrick Harris is just awesome in all his movies and shows. People are starting to notice him even more nowadays by casting him in the Harold and Kumar series. For an action movie the performances were pretty good in Starship Troopers.The alien insects were awesome, the action was cool, the performances were dead on, and the basic story just worked. Starship Troopers is a really good action movie that has it's share of shooting, blood, gore, brain-eating, and severed body parts that only make it more memorable. One thing I also forgot to mention is all the hilarious propaganda used in the story. Propaganda encouraging people, even little kids, to join the army and die a painful death in order to protect the human race. This shows that a movie doesn't have to take itself so seriously all the time, it just has to be fun. That's exactly what Starship Troopers is. I give it a 4.5 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid space military adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is a loose adaptation of Robert A. Heinlein's Hugo Award winning science fiction novel. The film mainly uses science as a background to a more direct military/action story. When an alien race known as the Arachnids attack the Earth (through the peculiar method of shooting an asteroid), the Earth retaliates by launching an invasion at the Arachnids' planet. The film focuses on the character of Johnny Rico, an infantry soldier that climbs the ranks while killing the aliens. A fascist and militant government is obviously the target of satire, but to what extent is unclear. No wonder the film was controversial upon release.The acting is decent but often cheesy. Same goes for the dialog. The standards are reminiscent of older "B movies". For all their flaws, the characters are actually pretty likable. It is disappointing to see Rico transformed into a senseless killing machine (much in the shadow of his former school teacher), but that is an important part of the movie. The special effects are good, but largely inaccurate as far as science goes. I must admit, the arachnid design is excellent. Most of the ideas are pure fiction, but work out anyway.Starship Troopers is not as much a science fiction film as a futuristic military film. It was enjoyable to watch despite numerous technical flaws. The underlying message is intriguing, even if you disagree with it. If you are a fan of loose science fiction (like Star Wars), futuristic or action films, then this one is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The cast for this movie comprises mostly 25 to 30 year olds playing graduating high school seniors. Set far into the future, you become a "Citizen" by volunteering to fight for your Earth. For those who are qualified for the job of pilot, they end up flying large and small space ships.The Earth (and perhaps other worlds) are being threatened by a planet far away with one giant, brainy bug masterminding their attacks. Helping are the gazillions of giant bugs that swarm and attack the enemy, spear them, cut off their legs, and in general are not very nice to be around.As the movie begins we see news of an attack via projectiles from space, and all of Buenos Aires, where many of the students are from, is destroyed. This of course provides much of the motivation for them to hunt down the smart bug and stop the attacks.I bought the DVD because it is the Superbit version, and was in the $4 bargain bin at Wally World. I had been curious about the movie, and this was my impetus. The acting, mostly by TV actors, is passable but not very convincing. The stars are mostly very nice to look at, especially the cute pilot played by Denise Richards. For the girls, Casper Van Dien is handsome as Johnny Rico, not smart enough to be a pilot, but the story is largely about his development as an infantry man who by the end turns out to be a great leader. Jake Busey is good as Private Ace Levy and Neil Patrick Harris as Colonel Carl Jenkins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that would make you want to be a team player. The movie has a great idea awesome looking armor good insect effects and story. If you want a movie with gore and action this is your movie most definitely the best in science fiction movies. You cant judge the movie to be a nerdy movie in the future not like star trek or star wars no. This movie is about killing bugs that are twice the size of humans and rip us to pieces. This movie shows us how they trained and how thousands die per hour. Very excellent let me ex plane. Starship Troopers you can say the battles are more bloody then the war movies. This movie shows us what the military might be like in like 100yrs or so. Why a teenager wants to become a citizen and defend earth and kill those who appose us like Insects. Shows us how they sacrificed themselves to save there buds. The battles would be like from Black Hawk Down. The soundtrack is great for this war future film. The directing was great the acting was great. The film is a good action film because the overrun and outnumbered have very low survival chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is certainly a good film. There's plenty of action, sometimes darkly humorous, and fantastic special effects. The battleships, bugs and battle scenes look really great, and very seldom can you tell they are just computer graphics. The storyline is good, not just focusing on the war - I always enjoy war films that include basic training in (Full Metal Jacket, Jarhead etc.), and it also has tales of romance and friendship, which break up all the gory violence nicely. The gore in itself is actually very good, showing how brutal the troopers' battle is. BUT, after watching 5 million different people get ripped in half, their brains sucked out and bashed to bits, it does get just a little repetitive. Really I think Verhoeven could have cut some parts of the battle scenes out as the violence does get a little tiresome. It is a good film though, which I thoroughly enjoyed.</fullReview>

Also like to state now i have nothing against the USA, Americans or anything American. But, this film is just too American.Its meant to be in the future, the world is run by a single government which is based on the American system (a sky Marshall instead of a president). To move things about, they put the seat of government in Geneva and base the film in Buenos Aires. They are about as Swiss or Argentinian as the England Cricket Team are. This is fooling no one. Bung them in Southb America, make a few names sound Spanish and hey no-one will realise we have cast the entire film out of Americans, set the whole thing as if its an American government and, oo, have an all American cast.

		<shortDescription>Johnny Rico a Filipino???!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I loved the movie... I also read the book, quite different, not to say a completely different breed, and I loved it too! But this post is a correction to that of John Thompson, from St Louis Mo. Heinlein makes the character Johnny Rico be from Buenos Aires, Argentina (which happens to be where I live, hey!), that's in the book, that's on the film. Rico is not from, nor does he ever come close to, the Phillipines, like you say. When the bug asteroid hits Buenos Aires on the movie, there's a TV report that shows where it is located, to the south of south America. No, it is never said, neither on the book nor on the film, that Buenos Aires is in Argentina, but just looking at the map should be enough. And so, being Johnny Rico an Argentinian, a country that has had a lot of European immigration, he may very well look like Casper Van Dien.Of course there are mistakes on the film! I won't say there aren't, but that wasn't one of them. Let me tell you where the mistake is in that part, if you watch the film, the part where they show Rico's house, you'll notice it is placed on a hilly, desert-like area, whereas Buenos Aires is located in the middle of a huge fertile plain! But well, I can't pretend Hollywood to know my geography... or can I? Best Regards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is one of those rare films, that is substantially more than the sum of its parts. The shame is, that most don't see past the enjoyable gloss, and see it as simply a mindless action movie.So what sets it apart? For one, it contains the biting satire, grim humour and violence of Paul Verhoeven and Edward Neumeier's previous science fiction collaboration, Robocop. Starship Troopers can be seen on one level as a tale of lost innocence, and coming of age. On another, it is a satire, based around the idea of a somewhat controlling alternative form of government, that frighteningly works. (To simply call it fascist, is an easy dismissal, and misses the point, I believe) It is nothing extreme or outlandish, except in the left wing world of Hollywood, where script writer Neumeier was vilified somewhat for adapting it from Heinlein's novel. It is simply a thought provoking tale, dressed up with the fun of action and adventure.In many ways it is a shame that the film veered so much from the original novel, yet it does succeed amazingly well in its own right. It is perhaps better to simply view them both as differing takes on similar issues.Starship Troopers isn't for everyone. You have to enjoy over-the-top violent action, and dark humour. If you can, there is a lot to gain from watching Starship Troopers, with far more depth than you would otherwise expect beneath the surface.To top it all off, it would be criminal not to mention the outstanding special effects, most especially Phil Tippet's work on the Bugs themselves. You will rarely see such convincing scenes of destruction in space, and war against an alien foe. Unlike many films, the effects are done selectively and cleverly, so that almost nothing will date in Starship Troopers, unlike many of its contemporaries, or even far more recent films.Starship Troopers is a fantastic ride if you just want straight action adventure. On top of that, if you take it tongue-in-cheek, you'll often find yourself coming back for more.They'll keep fighting! And they'll win!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first watched "Starship Troopers" at the local flea-pit cinema, on a cold and wet day in January, I was left feeling disappointed. Maybe it was the audience I watched it with (the noisy, chatting, seat kicking type!) or perhaps I just wasn't in the mood. Having just viewed this film again, nearly 9 years later, my opinion has changed quite considerably. Verhoeven's film is an excellent satire on fascism whilst being, at the same time, a superb, grand-scale, sci-fi bug movie.With an impossibly good-looking cast, some great talent, a fun script, effective soundtrack and capable direction, "Starship Troopers" is a genuinely entertaining ride. The CGI effects look fresh and surprisingly real even today and the film has an epic feel to it, particularly in the carnage-strewn battle scenes.The delectable Denise Richards has a beauty that is unique...she's like a walking, talking manga character complete with big eyes, pouting lips and pneumatic walk. To describe Ms Richards as stunning is an understatement. Heaven must be missing an angel! But that's enough about Denise Richards. The other stars all perform admirably in this movie and there's a great atmosphere captured on film. You're left with the feeling that everybody had a blast working on this project.It's not a "Robocop" or "Total Recall" but this is a Verhoeven classic, nonetheless.Spectacular, funny and great bubblegum for the eyes.

		<shortDescription>A Guilty Pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot of Robert A Heinlein's original book that never made it into Ed Neumeier's screenplay for "Starship Troopers", but that doesn't make it a bad movie. The idea of human soldiers battling giant insects had "Waiting for CGI" written all over it, so Heinlein's Cold War-era novel had to sit around for many years before it went into production.The plot is a basic "Pretty Young Things V. Space Monsters" affair enlivened with a sprinkle of socio-political comment. Director Paul Verhoeven uses the same news-clip technique that he used in "RoboCop" to give us background information in the style of public announcements. In tone, these public information elements of the movie hark back to Heinlein's era and the time when people believed everything that they were told by their governments. Verhoeven uses these scenes to make points about intolerance and political control, but they don't get in the way of the action. The cast do a good job with what they're given and while there are no outstanding performances, there are no particularly weak ones either. The story trots along at a good pace and the action scenes are still jaw-dropping almost a decade after the movie's original theatrical release.I'm not normally a fan of CGI-heavy productions but "ST" is a rare exception. Paul Verhoeven understands sci-fi and has done a lot of work with model effects before, so he manages to integrate the real actors with massive puppets and CGI monsters pretty convincingly. Verhoeven does gore very well too, so the action scenes are extremely bloody in places. It's easy to enjoy "ST" as a Big Dumb Action Movie, although there is a slightly unsettling subtext as well. Everything from the production design (check out the uniforms) to the style of the public information broadcasts contain references to the totalitarian regimes that dominated the Twentieth Century. Despite what was left out, I don't think that Robert A Heinlein would complain too much about this impressive adaptation of his book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grab a can of Raid and enjoy the stinging special effects. A movie for all ages. Teenagers. Adults. Anyone who might have a fragment of imagination. Loosely based on a Robert Heinlein novel (the original title was apt), "Bug Hunt." Warning! Crazy character development up ahead: the snarlingly evil drill instructor enjoys a cathartic experience; the reckless hot-shot pilot with no good common sense is female; the fun-loving joker--he also plays the violin--performs heroically in several battles after losing his rank; and the leading man is stripped of his command, thinks about quitting, and finally redeems himself by piggy-backing and killing a flame throwing spider with a bad temper. Whew! But the human race may be doomed by the vast number of the enemy's ranks. The super intelligent arachnids lob massive asteroids at the Earth's defenses. Violence is everywhere. But there is a revealing co-ed shower scene. Always a plus. And no one discusses sex. Strange. Could there be drugs involved in this diverse society. Same for racism. Gone. Never mentioned. So never trust an insect. They bite. And they will suck out your brain matter, too. In the long run, I don't think it's very wise to think so much when you're fighting giant bugs. Check this thought at the door with the pretty co-ed starship trooper on duty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paul Verhoeven tweaks America---Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Robocop Verhoeven took on the military industrial complex, in Starship Troopers he takes on the military-political complex. Mistakenly criticized in 1997 as being 'pro fascist-pro military' by critics, if it was being made today, it might not get studio support because of its 'anti-war' stance. It follows the classic propaganda themes of war films (good looking people fight, the hero does brave things and gets promoted, the hero's friend is killed and there's a moving speech, etc.) and thus reviewers could be emotionally tricked into believing it's a pro-war film, but it's a subtle satire of those films.A cast of *very* attractive then unknowns appear as recruits and officers in a violent / gory / blood war film that may have more wound realism in it than just about any war movie ever made. When I saw this movie a woman in the theater actually went into hysterics in the big battle scene when a half a man's body flies towards the camera and 'hits' the screen. Verhoeven, who survived WWII in Holland and reports seeing bodies in the streets after air raids, put his visual memories to good use. There are no 'nice' wounds here.Remember when you watch it, it's a *social satire*. Don't take it any more seriously than you would "Top Secret" (where the satire is broader).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The book of Starship Troopers was written a long time ago by Robert A Heinlein. Its a great tale of epic battles and one young mans crusade through the military ranks. The film shares many similarities, but has jettisoned the 'skinnies', a race of subhumans who are also at war with humanity. The film focuses on the war between humanity and the bugs, a race of spider like creatures living many miles away. Because of this streamlining, the film is a modern classic. Cut into two parts (training and fighting) Starship Troopers deserved much more than the feeble US gross it achieved.Starring a bunch of relative unknowns, this is a bombastic action epic that batters the senses with fantastic images of war torn landscapes and huge warships. Casper Van Dien is Johnnie Rico, the square jawed hero, Denise Richards his beautiful girlfriend Carmen who wants to be a pilot, Dina Meyer the girl with the huge crush on Johnnie and Doggie Howser the hilarious scientist with the even more hilarious quavering eyebrows. Michael Ironside is the metallic armed teacher cum warrior who watches over Rico at the beginning and then end of the movie. And there is also a dashing young pilot who wants to steal Carmens heart.....Yes thats right, Starship Troopers copies the Titanic method of plonking a love story onto the back of the epic storyline. However, Rico and Carmens romance is short lived as they part ways, so it doesn't put a dampener on the film.Rico and his buddies are put through a rigorous training regime by the improbably named Clancy Brown. Training involves showering in a giant unisex shower, having your hand stapled to a wall by a knife and being shot by cardboard laser firing soldiers. Rico causes the death of a fellow pupil, threatens to walk out, yadda yadda yadda. Carmen is off learning how to fly her giant spaceship while Doggie Howser feeds a cow to one of the bugs. This first half of the film is great fun as it builds up the characters. None of them are especially great at acting, and Casper Van Diens jaw does seem to do most of the acting in his scenes. However, its when the evil bugs destroy Buenos Airies that things get nasty.Yes thats right- Buenos Airies. One element from the book that didn't need to be kept. None of the people in the film speak Argentinian yet when that city is destroyed everybody gets angry and goes off to war.The first battle scene is spectacular. The giant spaceships hover in space being pummelled by giant bursts of sticky blue emissions that appear to be coming out of some giant bugs bum-holes. Dropships take the troops down to the planet, and then the troops meet the bugs (but not until they have fired miniature nuclear weapons at targets no less than a hundred meters away). The humans get slaughtered by 'superior tactics' which translates as the bugs simply having more legs than us humans. The humans reply by invading the exterior planets of the bugs solar system, and an incredible last stand style battle in an abandoned fortress is the highlight of the film. Giant tank bugs fire well, fire at the fortress while millions of bugs charge towards the fortress and then STAND STILL. Up above flying green bugs manage to decapitate half of the infantry while Johnnie Rico single handedly kills the bugs, fixes the radio system, pulls half of his commanding officer out of the mouth of a tank bug, causes the death of Dina Meyers character and shoots one of the flying bugs in such a way that it crashes into the admiral of the fortress.....yes this is a film that doesn't take itself too seriously, and its all the better for it. Other noteworthy things to mention follow- Jake Busey plays Ace, a character who seems to always have his eyes shut to a squint. Rico jumps on the back of a tank bug and defies gravity by being able to stand on it without support, fire into the bugs back, drop a grenade into the bug, jump off and survive without barely a scratch. All of this takes place while the bug is moving at around fifty miles an hour. Doggie Howser catches a gigantic brain bug, the captain of Carmens ship is cut in half BY A DOOR, a man has his brain sucked out of his head by a bug with a straw.....Starship Troopers contains some of the best special effects ever devised. The spaceships are perfectly realised and the bugs are lifelike. The shot of hundreds of bugs converging on the abandoned fortress is mesmerising, as is Casper Van Diens jaw. There is humour, with a cameraman taping one of the battles and then being ripped apart. An Asian officer attempts to beat the entire bug army on his own, Michael Ironside loses his legs. Its all fun, as is the movie.One thing is never really explained. WHY are we fighting the bugs? The bugs planet is able to shoot giant asteroids towards Earth because of its 'gravity well.' What does this have to do with the bugs? When the humans invade the infamous Planet P, they capture a brain bug to find out why the bugs fight. They fight because we have declared war on them! A minor gripe yes, but surely something could have been done about our motives for this war.A great film with fantastic effects. its just a shame that it wasn't a bigger hit, and that it inspired the mediocre sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great SciFi movie ..worth a watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have purchased this DVD for quite sometimes ago..and I watched this Sci-Fi Human vs. Bugs movie when it was first released in cinema...I have rewatched it again today on my 100 inches digital front projection movie screen. The main story line...about in a not to remote future, the insects from a planet named Klendutcha evolved to a such high level that they could challenge and destroy human civilization. As a results, Rico(Van Diem), Carmen(Dennis), Dizzy(Meyer) and another several guys were recruited to annihilate the insects threat!The side-line include a very well made military camp training and the triangle love between our sagas!!!Amazingly, it was still as good as before...although it was a movie made about 10 years ago...several neat points about this movie I like to share with you all that which hardly seen in other Sci-fi... 1. The triangle love between Rico, Dizzy and Carmen..although this is not a love drama, but some sweet moment and efforts been made into that. That deserve some credit!!How sweet ! 2. The CGI and many of the bugs(which are constantly jumping around ) really look real and amazing. 3. Many and many body counts and many more heavy machine gun fires....I gather not many Sci-Fi has that now adays...for those who enjoy seeing machine gun firing...here you go! 4. Overall the set-up seemed to be quite well made...not like other cheap Sci-Fi...with many nice spaceship...many well equipped soldiers and the training camp was cool as well... 5. The flow of the movie is superbly smooth....nothing to slow down..nothing unnecessary... Finally...I am glad that I pull out that DVD to test on my new movie projector..it truly worth a watch(for those who haven't) and rewatch again (for those hard stalwart Fans of Starshp Trooper!) PS: It is a great sadness that the sequel of this big time Sci-Fi is far below acceptable standard...they should invest more to make a nicer one or just don't make that "Hero of Federation"... Thanks...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give the most credit toward the writers. It must take a brilliant nd intelligent mind to come up with a futuristic world like this. If you like extremely entertaining sci-fi films, then you have to look into this one. Put a bunch of no-name but very promising actors with underground talent and give them a very decent and interesting storyline and you got a masterpiece. This plot sure does give you a lot of what-ifs. This is an all around excellent movie. I mean the writers came up with the most vicious creatures in the galaxy, a fictional space army and give them a brutal war against each other. A lot of credit has to go to the special effects, nothing looks fake at all, and thats especially good for 1997. This movie is already good, but after you watch the sequel (horrible) it makes it look even better.The story starts out as a normal futuristic high school guy with a nice high school sweetheart when things change in an instant and they are suddenly driven towards the army and battle gigantic limb-picking brain-licking creatures. Enough with the spoilers, just go and buy it, its a very interesting tale to watch. A work of art, enough said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entertaining and deep at the same time: Just like the main characters look "hollow" by the first glimpse, that's only the surface. Under the surface they are just normal human beings.Verhoeven is a genius. From "Turkish Delight" to this, all of his films (that I've seen) have been good and interesting, and on top of that every one of them is different from each other. I don't particularly like neither science fiction or war movies: This is both, but I like it. That tells something of Verhoeven's talent.The whole package is perfect (serves the purpose): The music, visuals, editing... I have to mention the casting separately: It's brilliant.I remember seeing this as a teenager, right when it came out in -97. Then it felt more twisted and "sick" (in a good way) than now. Now it's just, well... Reality.</fullReview>

I'm not even sure if it is supposed to be funny...like total recall (another film by the director). But who cares its great. The music is great and fits in perfectly, the acting isn't too brilliant, but that actually makes the film better, adding to its comedy. The computer graphics are great for the time, and this film will have you quoting every corny yet brilliant line. This film had me waiting for a sequel, to see how the sager would continue, how disappointed was I though (see review of starship troopers 2). One final tip, if you buy this movie DO NOT buy the box-set of this and starship troopers 2!!! i mean it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mind-blowing sci-fi satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not often that a mega-budget Hollywood blockbuster gets everything right. It's so rare I can't even recall another from the last twenty years. "Starship Troppers", based on the plodding but fascinating Robert Heinlein novel, is that rare exception, a totally engaging, entertaining, mind-blowing sci-fi spectacle that is also sharp, biting satire. It attacks American Imperialism while delivering nasty, gory, technically amazing set pieces featuring the slaughter of American soldiers by giant bugs. Yes, bugs! "Robocop" was director Paul Verhoeven's previous triumph, then, after "Total Recall", it seemed that he had lost his edge. Not so, of course, because "Troopers" manages to blend so many disparate ingredients so beautifully, it's mind-boggling how successful it it. The casting, though criticized by some, is perfect, and the black, vicious humor (with Verhoeven's trademark TV commercial parodies) is a great counterpoint to the grisly violence. The score by Basil Poledouris perfectly captures the jingoistic spirit of the satire and adds immense gravity to the complex, eye-popping action scenes. The film is a masterpiece. Not surprisingly, it bombed at the box office.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers (1997) Prepare for battle. In the future, Earth is terrorized by an arachnid planet who's past times include hurdling asteroids towards major Earth cities. Fresh out of high school, friends Johnny (Casper Van Dien), Dizzy, Carmen (Denise Richards), and Carl (Neil Patrick Harris) decide to skip college and join the armed forces to fight the bugs. The plot is kind of weak, but that's not the important part of this movie. The important parts are the action, the characters, and the overall feel of the movie. The heroes are white, Christian, clean-cut Americans and the enemies evil vile, bugs. The news talks of the Earthlings being valiant soldiers, fighting against the evil aliens, when in reality the Earthlings landed on their planet first, conquering it violently. The action is amazing. Two hours straight of watching army trainers abusing noobs, giant arachnids rip off limbs, giant arachnids getting their limbs ripped off... it's pretty cool. Starship Troopers is a purposely over-joyous, over-zealous movie. It satires the join-the-army movies and commercials perfectly. I'm doing my part, says one soldier. I'm doing my part, says another. And I'm doing mine! says an overly-enthusiastic kid in an army helmet. Laughs ensue. The world of Starship Troopers is a purely militaristic world. In order to get citizenship, you must join the army. The school children are taught how good it is to fight in the army, and it sticks with them. My mother always told me that violence doesn't solve anything. Really? I wonder what the city founders of Hiroshima would have to say about that. They wouldn't say anything. Hiroshima was destroyed. Correct. Violence has resolved more conflicts than anything else. Unlike most war movies that start out like this, there is no change in views throughout this movie. The characters don't learn war is Hell. They learn it's Heaven. Fun to watch for the satire, fun to watch for the entertainment. Fun for all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Morder-day Satire at its Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Granted, I am a huge Heinlein fan, and at first I was incredibly disappointed with the lack of continuity with the novel, but as I've gotten older, and more jaded mind you, this film really makes a lot of sense. (I was just a lowly freshman in high school when it first came out...so the satire didn't make sense).Satire is a powerful tool (see Jonathan Swift), and when used properly, can comment on anything and everything, and all at the same time. Starship Troopers does that perfectly well, with the pro/anti-war movements, politics, the military, teenage angst, and overall, the impact that propaganda has on us too (its in all the little blurbs that interrupt the film). Verhoeven is truly a master at portraying satire, while Ed Nuemier writes it perfectly, with a great blending of action, sex, and a bit of suspense. Basil Poledouris' score, with the massive amounts of bass (oh how I love THX sound) and marches are what top this off. The marches are fantastic, and the subtle references to satire (see the last propaganda scene in the movie and you'll understand completely) top off this flick. Enjoyable, fun, and a downright riot are what describe Starship Troopers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Film and Great Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Borrowing heavily from better science fiction and action films this movie is actually a lot of fun....the acting is sometimes spotty and there aren't any real "A" list type stars or performances but the cast pulls together for the most part and that's kind of the point as its a movie about the group or the team. Casper Van Dien is basically a younger Emilio Estevez - and OK. Doogie's back with a smaller supporting role. Jake Busey actually is one of the better acts along with Dina Meyer. Patrick Muldoon and Denise Richards are definitely attractive and healthy looking but a bit back seat to some of the other performances. Then you have Michael Ironside and Clancy Brown for some big-guns support. So you have the most well known actors in light supporting roles - what they're best. So while there isn't any real strong performances there certainly is a cohesive feeling. The effects are actually pretty well done too, and the storyline with sort of the 40's type newsreels was campy and cheesy but intended so. Its a movie that knows not to take itself too seriously, but makes an effort to give a real show - and several excellent one-liners. The end product is great fun and definitely cheesy with some very good effects and great looking actors who, well try their best. Worth watching or owning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Futuristic War Film, Would You Like To Know More?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all the Sci-Fi's of the 90's, this one would have to be the boldest. While there were many films at the time like this one, Starship Troopers took a different direction. While many films (including the pathetic Starship Troopers 2) jump straight into the story so we have to learn about the characters as the story goes along, this one takes about 45 minutes to an hour to get into the action, allowing us to learn about each character.The film is set in the future and follows a group of friends who join the army, which is pretty simple. One of the friends, Rico (Casper Van Dien) has a lot of potential, but during a live fire exercise, one of his team-mates is killed after Rico orders him to remove his helmet. Since it was his fault, Rico is punished and decides to come back home. Unfortunately, his home town (and family) are destroyed by an asteroid, which was "sent" by a race of giant alien bugs. Rico, with nowhere else to go, reenlists and , with his buddies, is sent off to war against the bugs on their home world.The film is fun, gory and very entertaining, with OK acting and great SFX. One interesting thing about the film are the advertisements and spots that pop up every so often such as asking people to "Join the fight against the bug!" and to "Learn your Foe!", each one ending with the phrase "Would you like to know more?".Starship Troopers is a great film to watch on one of those lazy Saturdays, or if you have your geeky friends over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get Out The Raid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After directing the horrifyingly bad "Showgirls," Paul Verhoeven returned to science fiction with "Starship Troopers," which has some very interesting undertones throughout the film.Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien)is determined to go into the military in order to become a citizen. His father is dead set against it, saying that he's doing it for a girl. Considering that the girl is Denise Richards (As Carmen Ibanez), you can sort of understand why Johnny's father isn't too pleased. However, Johnny is dead set to going ahead of his quest rather than going to college and remaining a civilian.Things don't go his way as he goes through training: his girl dumps him to go career as a pilot, his actions during an obstacle course causes someone's death, and then the bugs start some crap.Mind you, these are not your typical bugs that you stomp on or spray with a can of bug spray. These are some nasty ones, ripping you to shreds. They also cause the destruction of Buenos Aires, the capital of Earth (Don't ask). Rico is determined for revenge and goes to fight. However, the first attack is a disaster (Which is how the film opens). With a new plan in place, Rico comes under the command of his instructor, LT. Rasczak (Michael Ironside). With a whole new plan of attack, they come across even nastier bugs, including a bug that drains your brain.There is a lot of scenes in the film that smack of propaganda during WWII (Sort of "Why We Fight" for the sci-fi set). The film in general is political in nature (Even the outfit that Neil Patrick Harris wears in the film reminds one of Nazi uniforms). However, it is an interesting mix with the science fiction element of the film.The violence is incredibly violent (people are torn apart, beheaded,and get their brains sucked out), so this isn't a good film for kids to watch. But it is still good old fashioned fun for everyone else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For some reason or another, I decided to rent Starship Troopers yesterday, I remembered that I loved it as a kid so I decided, why not? I thought it'd be just another stupid action flick, so I picked it up. The first thing in the film is a Armed forces propaganda mini movie, By the way, watch for a hilarious one later in the movie involving soldiers letting kids play with their guns, which was just hilarious it had some pretty good lines in it that I had a good laugh at, and the first act played like a sci if edition of Dawsons Creek, in the chapter selection section it was called "The ago of innocence," and they were pretty innocent and pure, then the scenes in the camp happened, I expected a cheap Full Metal Jacket sequence and it sort of was but the "twists and turns" that happen were surprising, then the battle sequences begin, this is when the movie started to defy logic and fell into some clichs, the main character discovers that it takes a mess load of bullets to take a bug down when its in machine gun mode, but it only takes three when you use it as a shot gun, you'd think he'd learn from this, but he doesn't, at this battle bullets are never an issue, but get to later battle sequences and people are low on ammo left and right, the sacrifices made in war movies are made, and the clichs are followed. Now that the preceding excessively long sentence is completed, heres a new one to sum it all up: Don't watch this movie expecting academy award winning material, because you wont find it here, this is a fun and smarter than most action movie, I recommend for those who wish to kill two hours.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Great Verhoeven Sci-fi film (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when this film was released in theaters, several of my buddy's went and saw it and came back astonished. They made claims that it was better than Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. When I finally saw it on my own I didn't find it to be quite that good, but came to the conclusion that it was in fact a good sci-fi film.When it comes to the visual effects and overall look of the film, I thought it looked really cool. Although the bugs themselves weren't, to paraphrase Ebert, as impressive as the aliens in the Alien movies, they served their purpose as the antagonists in this film.SPOILERS BELOWNow as for the acting, in some areas it could have been better. I wasn't totally impressed with Casper Van Dien as Rico, his presence on screen can be somewhat nonexistent in some scenes. The rest of the cast however is very good especially the women in this film, which were better than most of the male characters. I thought Dina Meyer and Denise Richards were great as a grunt and a starship pilot. The triangle relationship that the 3 main characters have was really good. I have to admit that I was actually really sad when when Dizzy was killed.The story overall is good. Although the bugs live in a far away galaxy, they still managed to find ways to hurl asteroids toward earth, which was interesting to me. What I didn't like though were the way the infantry fight these bugs. As advanced as the future is portrayed in this film, all these guys really do is use 1000 shots to kill 1 bug. Where are the advanced weapons? How about using more nukes rather than have 100,000 soldiers be killed in 1 hour.So in conclusion, I think Paul Verhoeven definitely delivered with Starship Troopers, despite a few problems It had. Although not quite as good his Robocop, I think it tops Total Recall. For those of you that like Star Wars, Star Trek and the Alien films this movie is definitely recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe in this wonderful movie because it has a wide appeal. It appeals to intellectuals and it appeals to non-intellectuals. It's fun to watch, the special effects blew me away as a kid and still hold up today, looking better and more real than anything George Lucas has made in the past few years. If you don't enjoy yourself it's probably because you have a dislike of violence--and this movie has to be one of the most violent things I have ever seen--or because the dialogue is so childish, campy, and vacuous that you feel as if your brain is being sucked out by a gigantic termite.On the other hand...It's a satire. It puts on display the ideal right-wing society, and all the hilarious brainlessness thereof. Authority is never questioned. Leaders are always correct. You don't matter unless you're a warrior. The enemy is a faceless, writhing mass of animals--no, insects--that must be destroyed at all costs. Everyone is remarkably beautiful, but at the same time every character's mind is so malnourished and so filled with state propaganda that no one has anything of any importance to say. The human mind has become so frail that soldiers go into combat without any kind of strategy--beyond "kill them all!"--regularly break formation, wear useless armor and carry weapons that are practically useless, rarely if ever have any kind of effective support in the form of cavalry or artillery, and always fly their ships as close together as possible even though they know that in doing so they are easier targets for the bugs--who do have artillery--and that they will inevitably crash into each other. It's a prophetic film, with it's own Pearl Harbor/911 moment, its own terrorists who hate freedom and are most certainly not defending themselves from a foreign invasion of their own lands--compare the U.S-backed regime in Saudi Arabia to Fort Ticonderoga in the movie, deep in the "Bug Quarantine Zone"--and with plenty of its own blind patriotism. The difference, however, between the film and the modern age is that the Starship Troopers win, as they have the intelligence to fight an actual enemy rather than the concept of terrorism, like us. The metaphor isn't perfect, though, since the Starship Troopers don't feel the need to occupy Klendathu and civilize--pardon me, democratize--the bugs. Beyond that, the sound, music, and cinematography is solid, never getting in the way of telling a violent, satirical adventure. The love story is stupid, as is really every relationship in the movie, but that's because this is the right-wing paradise, where everyone is a little brainless cog too busy making babies or killing bugs to think of anything interesting. The film is about as similar to the book as The Wrath of Khan is to Moby Dick, but that doesn't detract from the immense pleasure I feel in watching it. I laugh, I cringe, I think: I am entertained. Star Wars was obviously a huge influence. My only complaint has to do with the plot: the siege in the middle of the movie is really the high point, and should actually go at the end. It was simply too incredible to be topped. And as an aside, they don't really explain how bug plasma could shoot an asteroid across the entire galaxy in what seems like a matter of a few weeks at most, which leads me to believe that the whole reason for fighting--the destruction of Buenos Aires--was faked by the Federation itself, but who knows? I can't prove it.</fullReview>

I first whatched it at a friends, i just walked into his house and was presented by a big fat bug sucking someones brain out an i was instantly interested :P i whatched the whole thing shortly after and by the end of the film i had a grin the size of a banana, i think for most people the first time they watch this movie they see the gore and the blood and not much else, the second and third times you've seen the fight scenes you can look past the flying legs and see the deep storyline and issues for instance you can decide which are the good and bad guys - the bugs are peaceful until the humans attack their world, while we see images of hatred from the humans, "The only good bug is a dead bug!" and "Kill em' all". We can follow the path of the hero Johnny Rico, how he joined up for a girl and how he became a man through rigorous military training. Overall a stunning movie with an intense plot, wonderful effects and a great message. However it is incredibly gory (One of the first scenes is a news reporter being torn apart by a bug) and i wouldn't recommend it to younger views or people who are offended by that sort of thing. But i would recommend it to everyone else :D 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An alien race threatens mankind. The bugs are coming and they are ugly and dangerous. After heavy fighting for freedom the planet can be finally saved. Sure, the whole thing comes in the jacket of a state-of-the-art action movie. It is not about insects from outer space, however.There was a lot of fuzz about Heinlein's book and what Verhoeven's adaptation displays in the movie. Doesn't it promote militarism? Is this gory over-the-top violence really necessary? Some protagonists behave kind of odd and bad, and the wrong ones die. People even were concerned about the uniforms. Good guys in Gestapo-outfit? It is an amazing complaint since the key to this movie is the human world that "Starship Troopers" describes.Good looking kids engage in sending stupid messages to each other during the class, while the teacher explains that brutal force is the strongest power to solve problems. It's a global community in which coming from Buenos Aires does not mean any Italian or Latin roots any more. There is no place for love in this indifferent world, where men and women sport together, take a shower together, fight together and die together. "Citizenship" has to be earned in battle, since the only real defender of human values is the soldier. It is a world with an obsession for guns and competition, in which telepathic skills are contracted immediately by the secret police. They are convinced of their own superiority, think big and consider individual human life a very limited value. These guys wear fascist-style uniforms because they are fascists. That's the whole point. Welcome to the United States of Earth.Starship Troopers contains some wonderful ideas, presented with the whole range from subtle irony to rough rudeness. A map points at the rear end of the galaxy to locate evil. TV soap stars are casted as leading roles and they also act like in a soap. Most of the teachers are mutilated. When Rico battles the first tanker bug, they look pretty much alike and his size compared to the bug is quite the same as a real bug's size compared to man. Later, a traumatized general will be speaking the magic words: "They are like us" . Final victory is apparent when the enemy is found "afraid" and has been made possible by "a drill instructor who captured a brain" . This is not about bugs, but men. The strange thing is, many people still just don't get it. This statement does not mean any disrespect to the perception of anybody who does not understand this movie. Me, I don't understand most of Frank Zappa's compositions, and I don't understand most of the exposed work at any Museum of Modern Art. But I can clearly see the touch of genius in this cynical and inventive movie called "Starship Troopers".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>an amazing film graphics still looking fine after all those 8 years!!! if your a sci fi black comedy fan one for u! one of the few downsides would have to be the slightly stiff acting in points, but the film has enough action to make up for this, with some original concepts and ideas, with enough clichs to keep most people happy! one minute this film will kick you in the guts the next it will make you laugh, until you realise your laughing is inappropriate and out off place.....and its one of the few films I've seen recently that can successfully do that.(i do realise it is 8 years old!) but yes its a definite if you like the genre...all i can say is watch it watch it now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul v is an excellent director. i liked this. i liked total recall.Micheal ironside is brilliant in this. he always seems to be in this kind of film and for a change he's a good guy. He gets some excellent lines, gets some seriously good action fight scenes and gets to die in a seriously action filled way.The soccer type scene was stolen from at least 2 other movies (one starring dean Cain and Wesley snipes, and it also looked a bit like the really rubbish remake of Rollerball). The young lad who looks like a young Gary Busey (the one who gets a knife in the hand and plays the violin later) was very good and I really enjoyed his acting.The training and preparation for combat puts this film in with other war movies like Full Metal Jacket. It gives you a background about the characters and gives you an idea about the set-up of the federation.Doogie Howser (So I don't know his real name and only remember him from this 80's classic show!) is basically playing himself as the intelligence officer.I love this movie. The space and ground based battles are visually stunning and well put together. There is a story, the characters are fleshed out and made real.The bugs look great, they even have a structure like the human combat system. The brain bugs are nasty but well thought out.The nudity isn't too over done.All in all the film could be a little longer but is generally excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the Starship Troopers one summer night in 2005 and expected a '97 action sci-fi. First moments make you feel watching a stupid movie, but there is something underneath the pictures of young people willing to join the army. And together with the quick camera, more blood, more violence and more nudity you would ever expect from a simple action movie, you fasten your seat belt and want to wait and watch more. I especially liked the unisex shower scene, where the main actors (except for Dennise Richards) take a shower together with all other soldiers. Although I wasn't able to read the faces of the actors in various situations, their cool-headed neglect to pathos was a refreshment to me as a European viewer. This action sci-fi simply stays apart from other Hollywood sci-fi action movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best sci fi movie, much more depth than originally perceived</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starship troopers is one of the best sci fi I've ever seen. Yes, the actors and actresses are a little on the lame side, but who cares about those soap opera action star wannabes, this movie rocks. Why? Well, it's supposed to be parody of mankind/war/propaganda/WWII/nazi Germany/ Hitler/human nature. Don't believe buy the special edition DVD pack and see the documentary. There was much more depth to this movie than it seems. You have to watch it with an open mind. Another thing the documentary clarifies is that originally there troopers were supposed to armed with high tech robotic tank like suits and mega cannons,etc. It didn't happen because they wanted the dramatic effect of swarming masses of blood thirsty humans and to recreate d-day invasion, which had no support units except pure infantry.(there were tanks,m4 shermans, but they sank, only a few made and most of them were blown up)Watch the movie saving private ryan and as a matter of fact any war movie, more than 50% of the fighting is done by infantry, not tanks, not planes, not ships. So for all those sci fi geeks complaining that the Starship troopers future didn't have the robots and other unnecessary crap, get a life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Come on, you Apes! You want to live for ever?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First we have the novel, then the board game, then, nearly a decade after Heinlein's death, we have the Hollywood film.Based on a controversial novel which earned Robert A Heinlein a reputation - quite unfairly, in my opinion - as a militarist and a fascist. The basic idea is an ultra right wing one: that before you are allowed to vote you have to do something positive for society - in this case, serve in the mobile infantry. One can see the point of those who propose this idea: there are people who do nothing but soak up the benefits of living in a welfare state, take more out of society than they are prepared to put into it, yet have the same number of votes as a national hero. However, I think that the practical result, which is neither dealt with in this film, nor in the novel,would be feudalism mark 2. People make the mistake of thinking that because Heinlein uses this kind of society as a milieu for his novel, that these are the views he held in real life, and also forget Turgenev's analysis of art - that it is the artist's job to ASK questions, not to answer them.The film follows Heinlein's novel fairly loosely. The novel is dedicated to drill sergeants everywhere. The line "Come on you apes! You wanna live for ever?" is an actual quote from a real NCO just before his men went into action. Although a drill sergeant is included in the film, the emphasis is taken off him and some of the important drill of the novel like "there are only two sizes of uniform: too big, and too small" are lost. Nevertheless, the special effects are utterly superb,and the characters are pretty well-drawn and acted by the youngish cast. Denise Richards has a wonderful smile.What got me most of all about this film was the attention to detail. Not once did I see something that made me say "that shouldn't be there" or "he shouldn't have said that" or "that's a mistake." So this is a quality product. The film has scenes of violence, but there are not too many of them to make the film tedious.All in all, if the late Robert A Heinlein ever got to see this film, I think he would have approved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The comments are interesting. I especially intrigued by the comment from the Canadian, speaking of American imperialism in Iraq and Afghanistan. Keep one thing in mind about "Starship Troopers"; just like the US on 9/11, they were attacked first. Responding is not imperialism. This movie shows one alternative government, while not my personal choice, is effective at meeting a challenge. And maybe service in the military as a condition to citizenship is not such a bad idea. The acting is terrible; Gary Busey's son is as good as he is, which is not so good. This is also a great example of the possibilities from one world government. A fun film, but do not over think while watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reach for the Stars and Destroy Bugs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In conclusion, mankind carries its need for pest control to harsh extremes as it expands throughout the galaxy. I finally reached that conclusion after seeing this film several times. When I first saw Starship Troopers back in'97, I was taken with its exciting depiction of the future - I'd guess 200 years from now - where-in young gung-ho soldiers, led by older scarred veterans, begin to wage war against giant interstellar bugs. This was a scale of combat rarely, if ever, seen on the screen, with the very survival of our species at stake. It was based on Heinlein's science fiction novel, which I read as a teen and which was written straight - serving in the military was the most honorable thing a person could do, as such an individual takes responsibility for the safety of the human race. If you're a left wing filmmaker, the idea of a military government is an automatic means of depicting a sly form of fascism. The fascism in this film ends up being directed at the alien bugs, as it turns out. As shown by the filmmaker, human beings themselves in this era have no problems with each other; no one looks suppressed or oppressed, everyone has their own opportunities. If you don't want to join military life, that's fine; you're not accorded 'citizen' status, whatever that means, but no one forces you into anything and you lead a comfortable life. Of course, we're shown a surface gloss of what life is like on Earth, but it seems very pleasant - when not bombarded by asteroids from alien bugs. But, it could be that, 200 years from now, a government run by the military may not be the same thing as we would be subjected to now. Verhoeven never shows any sinister signs that all may not be what it seems to be and citizens are somehow mind-controlled or duped.After seeing the film a couple of more times, a few bothersome details became noticeable and thoughts crept into my brain. Take these military outposts set up on bug planets - aren't they the most ill-conceived pieces of crap for an advanced military civilization? I'm not even asking for force fields which maybe no one perfected yet, but what about at least some extended roofing? Some futuristic version of barbwire? (I believe the sequel actually had something like this). And the grouping of the spaceships so that they all get wiped out together above a planet? There're two possibilities: the filmmaker threw aside such logic to depict cool carnage; or, you have a government bureaucracy far more sinister than what was first believed. This would be a government willing to sacrifice millions of citizens, including their own soldiers, for a long range plan of dominating a galaxy. You motivate the citizens enough into hating the enemy and your long range plan will succeed eventually. I don't really understand it all and maybe that's the whole point; it's never explained clearly how the war began - how &amp; why did the bugs throw an asteroid on Buenos Aires and why weren't orbital defenses set up before this? No one knows except...hey, who is the head of our planet anyway in this future? So there you have it: certain filmmakers can throw together a real chaotic brew of futuristic paranoia disguised as a war picture. You check out the over-the-top propaganda in the recurring newscasts, dripping in dark satire, and it doesn't take more than one viewing to get a semblance of where the filmmaker stands. One thing from the outset that never changed for me: though I would start the film dreading those scary giant bugs, by the end of it I'm feeling sorry for them after the relentless onslaught by these fascistic humans. It's a human being galaxy, my friends; no bugs allowed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Background, Weak Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Starship Troopers" uses the same cyberpunk social background as "RoboCop", but set far in the future, with space travel made possible and easy. There is an interstellar war going on, but that's absolutely irrelevant, it could be a street fight or, say, a useless battle in some ''third world'' country. The way the human society is depicted is wonderful, evil. At times, you may think it's exaggerated, but then you watch the TV news and finds out that the ''real world'' can overdo it, anytime.Unfortunately, the story plotted on that background is not good enough for it. Stereotypical characters were expected, but they are not involved in the story, they are just thrown in and move along it. The result is a total lack of empathy from the viewer, you watch it and simply don't care if the characters live or die (seriously, at certain points, you even pray for them to die horribly!)Although it is above average most cyberpunk movies, "Starship Troopers" trusts too much on visual effects, when it should have had a better (or maybe longer) story. Maybe the lack of a hero (or heroes) accounts for that. The story succeeds to show the unspoken division of castes of the society, but fails to show the consequences of it.Anyway, the cyberpunk background is great and, even though the story is not all that captivating, a careful view can show up many truths about the nature of human ''civilization''...Finally, for those looking just for action, the movie can be also very thrilling, because it just seems to be another ''hollywoodian'' production, but no character is safe there, anybody can be a victim of the giant insects!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is a well directed, well written and to a slightly lesser extent well acted film. I'm not a fan of Science Fiction so I wasn't particularly looking forward to this one, but I was shocked to find myself hooked from start to finish. The movie has an extended period at the beginning of the film compared to most before it actually gets into what the movies about - however that period is interesting and quite fun. Also the movie managed to escape the trap of becoming to complex and hard to follow which a lot of Science Fiction movies do.So even if you're not a Science Fiction fan (like me I was just watching it for Denise Richards) check this one out because I think you too will find this to be a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never before has there been a film like "Starship Troopers". I remember watching this movie years ago and enjoying it, and, watching it now, I love it even more.Extremely loosely adapted from Robert A. Heinlein's sci-fi classic, the film details the futuristic adventures of marine Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) and his platoon of "starship troopers" as they wage war against an army of deadly, gigantic bugs. Sound simple? It is. But that's all part of the fun.Paul Verhoeven brings something to this film that only he could bring: a feeling of utter and completely enjoyability. There's your typical Verhoeven sex and outrageous violence/bloodiness - which just helps add to the film's black comedy feeling.Speaking of which, the film is hilarious. Depending on what you expect from the film - if you're expecting "Platoon" in the future, you're apt to be disappointed. Sci-fi fans will feel like they're in heaven, while laughing their - cicadas - off at the same time.The cast is terrific. Casper Van Dien plays Rico with determined perfection; Denise Richards and Dina Meyer are Rico's babes; Jake Busey is Rico's frequently troublesome/annoying pal; Clancy Brown is a flawless Sgt. Zim and Michael Ironside is a great Rasczak.Edward Neumeier's outrageous script is a major improvement over frequently master author Heinlein's depressing, pointless novel. Basil Poledouris also provides an energetic, adventurous, and heroic score.Also worth mentioning is the outstanding special effects, by master Phil Tippett. The bugs are almost always extremely realistic and expertly designed. Excellent.There has never been and likely will never again be a film like "Starship Troopers". With Paul Verhoeven's trademark direction, the cast's fitting performances, Edward Neumeier's flawlessly entertaining script and Phil Tippett's outstanding special effects, what more could you want?</fullReview>

But the high brow aside it has huge spaceships crashing into balls of flame, giant man eating spiders ripping people limb from limb, razor sharp humour, a cool sound track, an easy to follow story line, it is populated with beautiful people who are introduced, get naked then despatched in fountains of blood, there is even a lame love story for the girl friend.

Excellent watch, perhaps more if playing a game, especially in the slim-pickings of good sci-fi.The 'within-ness' of Robo-Cop is carried thru, with the propagandized commercials seeming right at-home when viewed on commercial TV.

OK so this film predicted quite accurately the administration's approach to current/recent actions in Afghanistan and Iraq, but again, this wasn't rocket science. Maybe Veerhoeven felt he had to ram his point home in order for it to be understood by his target audience, which is presumably teenage boys who enjoy seeing beautiful people shoot at/get eaten by giant CGI bugs.

		<fullReview>There are science fiction movies that are smart and provoke thought like Contact and 2001: A Space Odyssey. And then there is Starship Troopers. I'm not going to say that Denise Richards is a bimbo, but when I see her in a movie, I'm not looking for a true mind bender, though I will say she did enhance Wild Things for everything she was worth. Richards plays Carmen, who is joined by her two Buenos Aires friends Johnny (Casper Van Dien) and Dizzy (Dina Meyers) at the highest post high school institution in this Robert Heinlein future world, the world's army school. The world is threatened by bugs from deep into space who, for reasons that are never divulged, hurtling big rocks down on the world's cities. Earth's armies then load up in space ships, go to the planet and try to exterminate this, not civilization, they are truly bugs who have state of the art weapons but don't appear to have any way to communicate with each other, so I'll just call them a large colony. Science fiction, for me, has always been about ideas, putting futuristic characters into situations that are parallel to things we see in our own time. I have not read Heinlein's book "Starship Troopers," but I have read some of his other works, and the movie does not hold the big ideas that his other books possess. I suppose Heinlein was championing a society where everyone needs to come together and the military ready, possessing the best of the best because you never know if something from the outside will want to do us harm. Or he just had an infestation problem. Paul Verhoeven directs one bloody battle with armies of bugs and armies of humans, each with unidentifiable parts, each get a little more boring and boring until the movie finally ends. TV's Doogie Houser, Neil Patrick Harris, also stars and does what he can as a swarmy psychic who's job is to communicate with the bugs, his big moment is when he says one of them is "scared." For popcorn sci-fi, it's OK, too bad there just isn't more there.</fullReview>

Plus, it feels free to kill off any character at any time...one of my favorite qualities of adventure and horror movies.The thing about this film that is hardest for me to swallow, though, is the complete lack of respect for the original novel. I believe that Verhoeven stated once that he read only a portion of the book because he got bored, or for some similar reason. That's a shame. The novel is actually an interesting discussion of social and political structures, much of it couched in the classic "dialogue" format employed by Socrates and the other great ancient philosophers. This aspect is completely absent from the movie.Overall, a good adventure movie with some wild FX and pretty good sound. I give this a **** out of *****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read the book for the first time a long time ago, I was hoping the director and writers would have put more of the politics of the book into the movie. They almost did a good job of it. BUT not quite. They did get some of the propaganda of the book into the film but it really helps to have read the book first.I am amazed at the amount of people who wrote who had no idea of the true underpinnings of the storyline. Of course after 9/11 and seeing how well the administration used the very same type of propaganda in demonizing the enemy, one can say the Heinlein was beyond prescient, he was a true genius in understanding how well a political system can subvert free thought in making it's case to sway the people into doing it's bidding. He just misjudged it by a hundred years or so.Hermann Goering famously put it best(go google it)in how easy it is to lead the masses and the book did it beautifully.This movie shows it, but you really have to be paying attention. The dialog is corny, but right on target in it's propagandizing and making patriots of young men and women and getting in the mood to kill the bugs who ARE THE ENEMY without us ever knowing why they are attacking us. AND that is all the leaders of this future society want you to do. Obey without questioning and become a citizen.The movie was cool though. Great CGI effects and lots of great fighting and action scenes. Very much into the gore aspect of war as well. WOW! was it gory!!. Heads a flying, arms and legs and body parts all over the place. The warrior bugs are just plain GREAT! Talk about vicious! Pretty good nonstop action scenes.Others have delved into the director's intentions and I believe them. Go read more of them.Corny heroism, romance(sort of), sex(sort of) loved the co-ed showers. I mean this has it all. The cast is beautiful beyond all norms. I wish they had done more of a LOTR aspect in terms of making it longer and more involved in the politics of the time. A YEAR AND A HALF BOOT CAMP? Great idea. Earning your citizenship? Great idea. Totalitarian regime that allows for protest? Great idea. Loved the "mandatory attendance of executions" too.BUT if you haven't seen the movie(and even if you have)do yourself a favor and read the book. Some people hate long dialog in books but the dialog goes into GREAT detail as to this society that Rico and his friends belong.I gave this movie an 8 and would have given it a 10 if the politics had been more involved giving us a better sense of the society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Verhoeven knows what audiences like: pure concentrated entertainment. Nothing new. Nothing different. Just pure entertainment given in high doses. Most of the world likes mainstream fare anyway...hell I do a lot of the time. I stay away from some kinds of mainstream crap, you know the glitz 'n glamor films that Tinsletown often produces. But Starship Troopers is quite good, considering that it's directed by the same man who directed Showgirls and Basic Instinct. I think I like Paul Verhoeven better when he's not trying to seduce his audience with open legs or anything (at least as far as male viewers are concerned). I like Starship Troopers because it's easy to digest and appealing to watch. The gore is plentiful and there are even some naked bodies in parts of the movie. I noticed that Paul Verhoeven has a fascination with unisex showers/dressing rooms in his films. In Robocop, there is a scene in which men and women police officers are getting dressed in the same room. In Starship Troopers, there is that ridiculous scene in which Rico and a bunch of other mobile infantry, men and women, are hosing down in the same shower stall. I found the scene particularly hilarious when one of the female soldiers expresses her desire to have "babies" as she's standing butt naked in the midst of her male comrades. What a joke! The only thing I despise about this film is the completely unnecessary sex scene between Rico and Florence. Why in the world would they want to have sex in a place like that? And only 20 minutes to do the deed? That scene was so blatantly added for the sake of having a sex scene, and we all know that. Besides that one blemish, and the nauseating smile Ibanez (Denise Richards) is constantly showing, I think Starship Troopers is a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Parody of Futuristic War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a quintessential guy film. You take the best of the WWII films (even better with alien special effects), combine it with Internet hype, sex it up with a bunch of pretty faces (and bodies) and surround it with the most violence since Verhoeven's previous work on Robocop. What is the most interesting feature in this film, however, is the bizarre love triangle between the three lead characters that doesn't get resolved in the end. This feature, while despised by most female viewers, shows that Verhoeven continues to depict strong female characters that are on an equal level with men and not in direct competition based on their sexuality. While this movie appeals to the most primal of instincts on a base level, it definitely contains much more. The futuristic social-political commentary on militarism and the space age are interesting and worth a critical look. Overall this movie is A+ in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Future Axis of Evil?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it just me, or has the future of the world fallen to Axis leadership? It seems that the world has finally merged under one flag and government. While Star Trek was clearly a socialist society where nobody got paid but everybody worked together for a common good, Starship Troopers is clearly a future where Germany had won World War 2. The uniforms alone are right out of the Nazi war chest. No one is talking about there pay and you never see anybody pray to Allah! So, the future must be a Lutheran based, work for free, and kill you neighbor civilization. Straight out of school, the kids are happy as lambs to join the military. Wow! Not since Vietnam have the wealthy, good looking kids rushed into line to sign up for the war effort. The nudity in the movie is fun but wrong. Having the boys and girls showering together in the future seems fun, but adds to the question of what kind of civilization has the world become. Putting machine guns into the hands of young, 20 year-olds and younger to kill a bug like race of creatures far from home, adds another question to the mix. Overall, Starship Troopers is a fun roller coaster ride but can not in anyway be considered a great movie with other science fiction classics. The idea of a civilization with culture but with no ideas is unbelievable and cruel. It lowers the standards of the audience to believe in a possible future without any possibilities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this movie may be recorded as one of the best Sci-Fi/Action movies made, it pales in comparison to the book. A small book that packs a lot of punch. The book, although written over 30 years ago, has a philosophical relevance in today's world. The author, Robert A. Heinlein takes us into a world where civic duty and honor are tantamount to citizenship and respect. All too often, we take our liberties and freedom for granted, forgetting our responsibility to mankind. Heinlein brings all these to light in an entertaining, yet dead-serious manner. This is a "must read" for all young adults.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In general the movie is excessive, cheesy and a stereotypical sci-fi action flick. But, I think it was meant to be over the top, thats what makes it so entertaining. The advertisements for the army sprinkled throughout the movie really compliment the film, making the whole thing come off like some type of weird social commentary. Though the acting of Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards leave much to be desired, that almost adds to the satirical feel of the film. In the end, its not the best written, best made film of all time; but that all adds to the feel of this modern day B-movie. If nothing else its entertaining, and as far as I'm concerned thats all a movie really needs to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Gorefest/Action/Sci fi ever... EVER!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first, this was the best movie I have ever seen(next to Heat, or Duel). I first saw it a while ago with my friend and my ex-girlfriend. She was creeped out by it and me and me friend were cracking jokes(I have very strange friends). Anyway, the whole premise of six-legged freak bugs is out there and along with their ability to fart out super heated plasma and magically hit an asteroid to destroy cities on Earth is far fetched. But truth is stranger that fiction. What made this a good movie was the guy who wrote the book directed the movie(Thank God). If some other Hollywood director did it, then it would look like my a$$ wiped sideways(except for John Carpenter, has an old school director who uses actual exsplosives for movie explosions).The other cool thing is the CGI blend. Someone else on another comment said this about CGI "It takes something real, and takes the real part out of it."(or something like that). And its true. Most CGI are done up close and you can always tell, but in ST. they used it from a far. This made it a whole lot better for the outpost scene and the first intro battle when the freaks are just flooding around, like a morning after a nite of hard drinking(if you can't figure that on out, then you have a problem).Finally, the little 'news' flashes, like in Robo Cop. The little things are what make this movie great. The little kids stepping on the roaches(not that roach you dumba$$), or the guy who shoots off the freaks leg in a cage, and the scientists who were 'probing' the brain bug. The whole movie was right off a gorefest, then a build up until more blood and gore, and people with one leg or arm. My dad walking the living room during the aftermath of the first fight scene and was like " Did they hire everyone in the state of Califorina to play someone with a missing limb?" and thats what it looked like. So to everyone eat three good meals, take one good s**t, go to bed, and do it again tomorrow. I'm out</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe too subtle for its own good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am extremely dismayed by the amount of imdb users and newspaper critics who did not see the satire in this film. Some thought it was "Yeah! War!" and were either condoning or horrified. Others thought it was purely a sci-fi extravaganza that was as deep as a puddle. A few users understood it for the anti-fascism work or art that it was. Once that level of understanding is established the Barbie &amp; Ken actors, cheezy jingoist slogans and gratuitous violence make sense. Users may sneer at those who misinterpret the intent- but really, only if one has taken both upper level undergraduate english and history courses in which they are exposed to various examples of satire and militaristic propaganda can one more easily discern the director's intent. Those individuals defensive of people in the military please take note that this film is not lampooning the rank and file infantrymen but the "powers that be" that convince young men and women to bravely risk their lives for "ivory tower" strategists. They are not depicted as sheep, but products of their roles and the situations in which they are placed which necessarily shape them into willing pawns of those who outrank them. I would argue that this film is a critique of how well intentioned, highly impressionable youth are transformed into "black &amp; white," "us against them" thinking war mongering fascists.Maybe spoilers?The violence inflicted upon these sympathetic youth scream out that the society depicted is wrong. THe fact that baby faced Carl turns into Nazi-garb wearing, sacrifice his friends, get spider guts splatterd on him on TV type of guy should tune viewers in that the director thinks Carl turned evil. Also the maniacal look of characters in the news broadcast should indicate that 'all is not well' in this fictitious society. Additionally that the "other" is so ugly but the main characters are so pretty but vicious demonstrates that the director, screenwriter or whoever want viewers to understand that there are no absolute good and bad guys. Each specie had their endearing and disgusting points. The arachnids were responding to what they perceived as an attack. Thus they responded in kind. The humans- oblivious to the arachnids' sentiment- reacted to the attack against them. But the brains behind ST are trying to illustrate how issues are not as "good guy vs. bad guy." There is enough blame to go around twice and then some. The humans were not right in colonizing the arachnids land, but the spiders were not right in retaliating with an asteroid.But maybe those in charge were a little too good at disguising their kritik as hollywood fluff. Pitty that at least published critics didn't catch on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>a bunch of fascist,twentysomething hardbodies graduate high school, join the military and travel the galaxy fighting huge, grotesque bugs and work out each others personal problems in this insane interpretation of the classic Heinlein novel. Why "insane"? Because, frankly you'd have to be nuts to shell out 8 bucks to see a film whose only similarity to the book is purely coincidental - the title. Directed by Paul "Showgirls" Verhoeven (the Antichrist - no, really) this front-loaded CGI mess has none of the dark humor of the first "Robocop", which he also directed. The characters are so one dimensional you never really care whether they live or die; none of them display any range, including Michael Ironside, playing his (by now) stereotyped one note tough-as-nails military type. We've said it before: when the effects are allowed to become the movie, you wind up with stuff like this. Admittedly, they were pretty good, but Verhoeven beats you to death with them, and, like "The Andromeda Strain", they get old fast. Oh, and for the record: a meteorite big enough to destroy a city like Rio de Janeiro would leave nothing. Ya hear me out there in Tinseltown? NOTH-ING! Best advice: wait for cable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Science Fiction Satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is based on a popular 1959 novel by Robert Heinlein and is about the Earth fighting an inter-planetary war against giant alien insects. The film is basically a satire mocking militarism and war movies. All the soldiers are depicted as almost interchangeable, bland, good-looking robots. In fact the way that they behave is not much different from the insects they are fighting. The film depicts Earth as being in the grip of some kind of dictatorship (an early scene features a teacher telling a high-school class about the "failure of democracy"), and the film was criticized for being both fascist and pro-violence. But the film is pretty obviously making fun of the system it depicts.However, forgetting any kind of subtext, just enjoy the film as a big exciting adventure. The special effects are superb and the battle sequences are pretty thrilling. One of the highlights are the hilarious fake "news" bulletins inserted throughout the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, the good news is that Starship Troopers has terrific action sequences. If you like a bit of sci-fi horror, this should definitely float your boat. Soldiers get torn limb-from-limb with gay abandon, bugs explode to shower their attackers with green goo, and huge starships explode, break apart and drift in pieces through the formation. Communal unisex showers are a bonus, too - if you like a bit of softcore pornography, this should definitely bloat your boat.The movie's premise is interesting at worst, fascinating at best. Earth has united beneath a supposedly "fascist" (though not racist - we are presented with a fully inclusive society, at least as far as human beings are concerned) government, based in Geneva. Interstellar expansion has brought conflict with a range of diverse insectoids, and now the Mobile Infantry - the US Marines with a new name - are being sent in to win the war.The movie follows their progress, interspersed with various bits of pseudo-interactive news that give us the big picture. This is an interesting and (as far as I know) original device that really does work to give a sense of the wider setting.The characters are just what one might expect from any cod-action movie: the gung-ho type who runs straight in and gets killed, the coward who runs away and gets killed, the shouty "I wipe my arse with thistles one a fortnight if I'm lucky" officer type, the ace pilot, the arrogant smoothie, the heartache drama queen, the introspective one... you've seen them all before, in every crap movie ever made.It's crew cuts and c-cups all the way, I'm afraid, so this is one of those films where you have to forget about the characters and just enjoy the action sequences. Unfortunately, it's hard to empathise with cardboard cutouts, so it's hard to care for them. The battle scenes would be so much less mundane if there was any reason to like or even notice the protagonists.It's a shame that so much potential was wasted. Aside from bits of news footage and occasional scenes around Buenos Aires in the first portion of the film, we see little of the society these people are supposed to defend. Are there any poor people? Where do they live? How do they get about? Is employment a privilege or mandatory, widespread or precious? Does the government lie to the extreme left, the extreme right or somewhere in between?Videophones, dropships, miniature nukes, warp drives, yelling military types and eight-legged aliens with no visible genitals, all the proper sci-fi stuff is present and correct. But some of these clichs can be a little hard to swallow - for example, with mobile videophones on the market since 2003, are future telecommunications really to involve us standing in a corridor and talking to a plasma screen?That interactive news begins to grate after a while. The sequences get sillier and sillier as the movie goes on, and at times it feels like you're watching a sci-fi spoof, rather than the real thing. When they get too bloody, a ruddy great "CENSORED" sticker is slapped over the dismembered cow or whatever it is. Very silly, but not very funny.Like many films before it, Starship Troopers tries to cover too many bases at once. Is it a political allegory, an adventure or an action flick? An ensemble drama or a first-person narrative?Really, Starship Troopers is a daft B-movie with a better budget. The acting's pretty good, and the dialogue glides along without too many hiccups (it's a damn sight better than anything George Lucas ever wrote, for example). The CG sequences are a couple of years ahead of their time, too - the machinery, vehicles and other technological knick-knacks look just as good as they did in 2001's Final Fantasy.If you like your extreme violence then you'll enjoy Starship Troopers. It's of a similar level (four out of five carotids on my scale) to Saving Private Ryan, but where that movie was claustrophobic, detailed and grainy, Troopers is expansive, liberal and very, very red. There are thousands of soldiers on screen at any one time, and a good proportion of them get ripped asunder by mandibles, claws and spikes. On the other hand, if you're expecting any wit, intelligence or genuine thrills then you're in for a disappointment.The opening half-hour hints at so much more - politics, morals, strategy - than what made it into the script. If a remake is ever in the works, I'd suggest the following:1) Exchange slapstick for irony. Irony's funnier. 2) Explain. Explain characters. Explain the background. What year is it? How did we get from here to there? 3) Lose the clichs. They're neither funny nor believable. 4) Get some tension in there. Jurassic Park and Alien we both similar to parts of Starship Troopers; both were far better movies.But keep the shower scene, I mean - wow.....!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting Action Overshadows The Films Other Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Rating: *** out of ****. Starship Troopers is escapist entertainment. Its not something that is particulary intelligent but its something thats sure to get the pulse racing. Paul Verhoeven is not a great director but I don't consider him a bad filmmaker. The violence in his other films is present here but its not gratuitous in my opinion. Surely not all of Starship Troopers is good. The action is much more interesting than the attempted love story or love triangle. In fact, the love story is very much a distraction. Paul Verhoeven is not a director known for crafting love stories and this part of Starship Troopers illustrates why. However, the action is so intense and exciting you'll forget all about the love triangle. Every battle scene with the bugs represents a highlight. One of the biggest battle scenes near the end of the film aided by very impressive visual effects is the best scene of the film and one of the best action scenes in a sci-fi film. In fact, the action is so good here I could compare it to the action in James Cameron's Aliens. Even though what I just said about the film, comparing to Aliens is a huge compliment, this is a vastly inferior film. WHY? Because Aliens didn't have a love story in it with a filmmaker that has no idea what the hell to do with it. Paul Verhoeven shows skill behind the camera during the action scenes. However, both Cameron and Verhoeven are two directors that feel very at home in action/sci-fi films. Anyone who has seen a Verhoeven movie, knows that in most cases acting is not a big strength. He is more interested in the look of the film than performances, so its no surprise theres nothing outstanding here. However, Casper Van Dien and Dina Meyer give credible performances. Jake Busey is funny at times. Denise Richards is actually ok here. Michael Ironside gives a solid performance and has the films best line. Starship Troopers is an entertaining film. Like I said, Starship Troopers is flawed but overall you will have a pretty good time watching it. However, If you saw starship Troopers on the big screen (like I did) it is a better experience than on TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..."Starship Troopers" is one of the worst movies ever made. It's as simple as that. I often hear arguments that director Paul Verhoen (of "Showgirls" fame no less) is trying to deliver a message in the form of this satire of American war and war films. Okay, good job Verhoen, but your movie is still unwatchable. The acting is (purposely) worse than "Star Trek", which means it's terrible. I know that satires don't usually have the best actors, but "The Naked Gun" and "Airplane" had actors that were remotely funny. At least those satires were funny. What good is a satire if it doesn't make you laugh?No, "Starship Troopers" doesn't make you laugh, it makes you fidget in your seat. It starts off with the main characters (played by Casper van Dion, Dina Meyer, Denise Richards and Neil Patrick Harris) being recruited to some world army, and being sent into space to fight an alien race of large bugs. Of course, there is never any action (not that the action is any good anyway) for at least an hour, because the soldiers spend their time in a training camp. Unfortunately, this turns out to be some sort of spoof/rip-off of "Full Metal Jacket".Oh, and then there are the same sex showers. People say that Verhoen did this to show a society that didn't find sex offensive, but I think the guy is just some raunchy old man who needs a million dollars and a camera to get close to a naked woman.Sure, "Starship Troopers"' message about war is good, but it hardly leaves you with a good feeling when it's all over, 1/10.</fullReview>

Being that I'm in my 40's I remember the newsreels that my parents talked of, the beginning of the Info Age, and the Sci-Fi and TV classic melodramas of the 50's &amp; 60's. The director takes all these themes and sets them as the framework of a sci-fi adventure. Taking the classic boy and girl-next-door story and adding the do-or-die mentality of the war of the worlds was a masterstroke. The taboo of the naked body is gone as shown in one brief scene. The grizzled Sargent and Leiutenant are larger than life, sacrifices are made for the greater good, etc. I don't take this movie as a serious drama. It has many comic moments, it's gritty, it's scary, and it's fun escapist fare.</fullReview>

Michael Ironsides turns in the only poor performance I've ever seen him give, because he has so little material to work with. Van Diem is, as usual, moribund. Maybe he could play a vampire...Verhoeven is still living his Robocop days. This movie is basically Robocop, only poorly done. The message is the same, but watered down to the point where all there is is a bunch of guys with guns shooting bugs. And a soap-opera sideplot--figures, with Van Diem. Somebody tell him to get back to making those good movies he once made...oh, wait. He didn't; I'm mistaking him for a good director.

It also has a subtle theme of criticism towards the war hungry and entertainment addictive Americans (for example, the brain bug in the final scenes. Doesn't its mouth resemble vagina to you?). Although Starship Troopers has these themes along with the prediction towards a very fasist future, it is also a kick ass action movie. The combat scenes are incredible, pumped up by the believable effects, solid direction from Verhoeven and the score by Poledouris. Sure it's also basically a teen drama, but who gives a s**t?

I mean--Casper Van Dien? No tact, talent, or pulse of life whatsoever. But he fits the 'B' nature of this film completely. Who better to deliver this atrocious dialogue?The gore is wonderfully excessive, if gore happens to be your cup of tea. If it isn't, stop reading this review, and don't even consider picking up this film.The special FX are top of the line. After six years since I saw it in theaters, I am still wowed. Lots of imagination, beautifully executed.What a combination: terrific special FX, an interesting concept, a hollow script, and poor acting. This is one of the most highly-polished 'B' movies I can think of. And in less capable hands, it could have been awful. But 'Starship Troopers' is thrown at us with a wink, as though Paul Verhoeven were saying: "Let there be no illusions: this is trash. Now come along for the ride."Yes, Paul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's the Satire?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that so many people see this movie as a fun action movie where lots of stuff blows up shows how utterly Verhoeven failed in his attempt to "satirize" the militaristic values of the original novel. Simply making references (e.g. uniforms that look nazi-esque) is not the same as satirizing, and Verhoeven falls into the same trap as he did in "Robocop" of painting the thinnest veneer of "satire" over his movie and then abandoning it entirely for the slam-bang climax. If you can't tell whether he's satirizing or celebrating something, then the satire has failed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can't really call Starship Troopers a true adaptation, because the novel (which is a great work on its own) bears little resemblance to this movie. The acting- meh; The story- meh. This movie is just cool to watch when you really don't want to think. The action is the only reason to watch the movie, but it's still a good one (much like Blade 2). Starship Troopers is a great excuse to watch sh*t getting blown up/killed. One notable thing this movie carries is the anti-mainstream message that was present, but much less significant in the novel: violence IS the answer. 8/10- just because it's fun to watch.</fullReview>

This is what i call an action packed movie, full of special effects and enough gore to repulse even the most die hard gorehounds. The cast is terrific with upcoming names such as Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards, Dina Meyer and Patrick Muldoon, what a great idea to put up and coming names in this, rather than a bigshot moviestar who would only steal the spotlight. Starship troopers may be two hours long, but it doesn't drag on with meaningless drama the way alot of recent movies do, this one is one for your home DVD collection, i think this is one of the very best movies of 1997.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not read the book, and according to some the book is better, however as I come from a single frame of mind I will NOT go out on a limb and say that this movie is phenomenal. The first time you see it you are glued to the special effects, the second time you see it you discover the extreme over the top humor and further viewings get you to see what some call "Nazis in Space". The film is basically a World War II Nazi propaganda film and when looking at it under that eye it becomes so much more intriguing. I love sitting down and watching the movie and going through different moments in the movie and relating them to events happening in WWII, especially the representation of the D-Day invasion. Granted it was over the top, but never the less exciting. And with Paul Verhoeven at the helm how can you go wrong? Paul gives it that rugged yet glamorous flavor that has become regonized throughout his resume. Paul is not afraid to show his audience graphic violence. That is a very bold move to make, knowing that kind of expression could cause a blow in the box offic. And so from the director who brought us such spectacles as RoboCop and Showgirls (I do not include Total Recall as the movie is a dreadful romp into nothingness) comes a true over the top masterpiece, not equally the great dramas of our time, but definitely giving us a little dose of entertainment in world consumed with artists.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a sceptical mind I viewed this movie, looking at the front cover I wasn't hopeful, expecting nothing more than a bad space-based action movie.I couldn't have been more wrong, before I run off and say this movie is great, watch it immediately, take a pause and think, this movie is not great, but it is good. The effects are good and you are force to cringe as yet another soldier bites the dust in every gruesome way possible. If you have a light stomach or aversion to gore I would avoid this film.There is nothing outstanding about this film, and I think that is why it works so well, you can relate to the characters and sympathise with their plight to succeed and save the Earth from the aliens. The battle scenes are not too long, neither does the director belabour the training sequences, the film motors along nicely at it's own pace.Watch with an open mind and accept that we may not be the superior race and you will be looking at the night sky wondering when the Arachnids are coming to get you!

		<fullReview>Good Sci-Fi action, very imaginative and fun to watch. Great breakthrough performance by Casper Van Dien. Director Paul Verhoeven and his frisky cast of TV hunks and babes actually exceed expectations, though it's not for everyone. The violence with hordes of humans and alien bugs butchering each other in pitched battles. Still, it's a clever comic book, with outstanding effects, moments of inspired sardonic humor and a woolly scenario that spins slightly out of control. Cocky lead Van Dien is a rich kid who volunteers as a grunt in mankind's space war versus the seemingly mindless bugs. Though the movie's internal logic is a bit shaky (machine guns are the futuristic weapons for exterminating giant bugs), this mammoth production is the most satisfying adventure film of the year. I give it a 9/10</fullReview>

It is also a kind of American Dream, without a brain : all the characters are beautifull, smart and a bit silly. Just like in those drawings in the 60's where you could see the mother in the kitchen cooking, the father in the garage tinkering about, the boy playing war and the girl playing with dolls, etc. It's a nod to all the crap SF Movies of the 50's and 60's, with huge special effects.

		<shortDescription>OK book transformed into socko movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Starship Troopers" is that rare example of a novel improved for film, its dramatic possibilities developed, its cinematic potential fully exploited. Robert Heinlein's book has numerous flaws that make it, not slow or dull, but half-baked. It's often talky, going on at length about military red tape, political theory (especially the rationalizations of the "only vets can vote" idea that's kept this book much-discussed since 1959), and descriptions of Johnnie Rico's arduous efforts to become, first a soldier, then an officer. The book is also underplotted, with characters like Carmen and Carl simply mentioned from time to time, while playing no real part in the story. The film tightens up the plotline while maintaining its structure: like the book, it begins with an action sequence. The novel's hit-and-run raid on an inconsequential alien planet becomes, in the movie, a disastrous raid on the "bug" homeworld of Klendathu. Book and movie both then drop back in time to the point when Johnnie, Carl and Carmen join the Mobile Infantry, then follow their careers through the escalating Bug War. Important characters Sgt. Zim and Lt. Rasczak are both in the film, the latter composited with Mr. DuBois, Johnnie's school teacher in the book. But the movie brings both Carmen and Carl into much greater significance to the story. "Dizzy" Flores, a minor character bumped off in the novel's first chapter, is given a sex change and an expanded role as a soldierette with a crush on Johnnie. A handsome flyboy with eyes for Carmen is created from scratch for the screen, giving rise to the inevitable wartime romantic triangle. Another major departure from the book has to do with hardware. Whereas the book's troopers are encased in robotic suits of armor and deployed via individual capsules, the movie's soldiers wear much lighter body armor and are deployed via landing craft. Why? I can think of three probable reasons: 1) Encasing the soldiers in exoskeletons and pitting them against bugs would've amounted to a battle between armies of arthropods; the human element would've been greatly diminished. 2) Similarly, a totally-helmeted cast all look alike. Telling the players apart would've been impossible. And an actor must act, which is much harder to do with his face obscured. For this reason, the knights in movies like "Excalibur," "Henry V," etc., all doff their helmets just when they need then the most--in jousts or duels or battles--so we the audience can see their faces. 3) The movie cost 100 million bucks as it was! The producers were no doubt uninterested in seeing it cost another 100 million. The movie's cast of mostly unknowns (other than character actor Michael Ironside; Denise Richards has since gone on to greater recognition) was likely an attempt at budget suppression. All told, "Starship Troopers" is director Paul Verhoeven's triumphant return (after the regrettable "Showgirls") to the turf he staked out so well in "RoboCop": violent, hardware-oriented SF in a futuristic setting, enhanced by Phil Tippett's special effects, scored with Basil Pouledoris's music, and spiced with dark humor. Fast-paced and funny, but blood-soaked, so be prepared.</fullReview>

I feel like holding a can of Raid in my hands every time I watch this flick. Combine this with the initial arrogance of the earth's military and deficiency in weaponry and you have a splatteringly exciting creation. Come to think of it, wouldn't insect spray have been a great weapon of choice?So please... stop comparing paper to disk. Sometimes things don't translate well and a director must take a different turn. Lighten up and see what this movie is all about.

Why indeed not just destroy the planet from space?? Whatever ironic intentions Paul Verhoeven might have had in parodying the American 'genocide for peace' mentality, it all seems to get swamped in a tedious, repetitious sequence of set-piece battles in which the human protagonists emerge as marginally less obnoxious than the insects. The co-ed shower scene is probably the most futuristic thing about the whole film (though Verhoeven IS Dutch after all) and Denise Richards is always appealing, but Starship Troopers remains in the memory (briefly) as a thinly disguised recruiting film for mid-Western matinee audiences. P.S. Did anyone else think the 'brain bug' resembled Terry Gilliam's cut-out monsters in the old Monty Python TV series??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is a fitting end to Verhoeven's career.Verhoeven appears to aim this picture squarely at the European audience. In this adaptation, the Nazis end up winning World War II, then move on to build a gentler, kinder Nazi regime with plutocratic principles that embrace all regardless of race, sex, creed, or even weight.The opening scene of the film features a utopian future built by Nazis.Before long, bugs from another planet start pooping all over the Nazis. A spaceship first encounters hard poop as big as an asteroid coming out of the "quarantine zone" headed straight for earth. The poop is so hard that it ends up vaporizing Buenes Aires, so the Nazis go to war against the bugs.Some of the bugs poop out long blue streams during battles. Those bugs also utilize Superman's heat vision to burn Starship Troopers who get too close.My only complaint with this picture is that it's simply unbelievable that a bug can poop out something as big as an asteroid or something that can go hundreds of miles into the atmosphere.</fullReview>

Secondly, none of the physics makes any sense.There are seemingly three ways to interpret this movie:1 - A "popcorn movie" meant to provide a thrilling ride for the viewer. 2 - A parody of 1940s American propaganda. 3 - A comment on fascism, relating the movie to Nazi Germany.Personally, I don't see how it could be #3, since the government doesn't carry on anywhere near the same kind of campaign as the Holocaust; the people we see aren't meant to be evil. #2 might be plausible, but I don't understand the urge to mock films stirring the U.S. population to action against such horrifying enemies (Hitler and Stalin), either. Whatever the director says, a movie stands alone. Most likely, "Starship Troopers" is #1. Look at "Robocop" - a sophisticated statement of the ineptitude of the police? A serious look at the roots of crime? How about "Total Recall"? A deeply symbolic message on the nature of one man's escape from society's restrictions? An interesting allegory for the oppressed workers of the Industrial Revolution? People can talk about what's in their movies, but "sometimes a cigar is just a cigar."</fullReview>

I am sure that the Americans are no less smart then the rest of us. My guess is that we in Europe see the movie as a clever satire of the American culture, while the Yanks cant see it because it hits a little too close to home. That might seem a somewhat prejudicial, but I cant figure out any other answer. To me and my friends it was so obvious at once what this movie was about. It is a over-the-top satire of the American culture/military/values. Compare it with for instance Pearl Harbor, a typical US 'propaganda' movie, or Top Gun and then draw the parallels!Paul Verhoeven makes fun of the stereotype 'patriotic' movies. Starship Troopers stands as an excellent counter-weight.I guess that a satire of, among other things, the US military is not very popular right now. That is why this movie is more important now then ever. If you can't laugh at your core values and see them in perspective then you are in dire straits, because that is the road to a fascist society.</fullReview>

Casting was probably the last things on the screenwriters job. Paul Verhoeven had it made by 1994 after making RoboCop, Total Recall, and Basic Instinct then forever soiled his career with Showgirls and then this! 'Starship' has the consistency (and lunacy) of those weekend morning/afternoon sci-fi kiddie shows like Andromeda or Cleopatra albeit this is 1000x more violent. Not for little kids, the scenes of soldiers being impaled, torn apart, and shredded by the life-like (almost cartoonish) bugs with low moron tolerance will make any child have nightmares for months.

		<shortDescription>Exciting anti-war film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I fall into the "this is a brilliant anti-war film" group. Director Verhoeven uses the skills honed early in his career as a maker of war film documentaries to undermine the entire genre. There are also some decent performances, particularly by Busey, Ironside, Harris and the bugs. Denise Richards looks fabulous, even if she sometimes looks a bit disengaged, vapid and unrealistically clever, which is perhaps understandable considering some of the cliches she is forced to spout ("Take care of yourself, Johnny."). This film makes a statement along the lines of "All Quiet on the Western Front," but may confuse viewers because it does not downplay the undeniable glamour and excitement of combat, like most bad anti-war films.To see where Verhoeven is really coming from, watch for the massive signs of military stupidity (fleets of ships repeatedly orbiting within range of the bugs' plasma rays, frontal "attack a la ruse" assault tactics, repeatedly taking the enemy for granted through sheer arrogance - "We just thought we were smarter than the bugs") and, most of all, the fantastic and ultimately unnecessary carnage and disfigurement. The casually brutal treatment of the "thinking bug" by the scientist at the end really says it all. The film does show the excitement and thrills of combat, which may mislead some into thinking this is some kind of glorification of militarism, but that is just part of naturalism in a sci-fi setting. Not showing it would turn the film into a polemic that nobody at all would watch, and the excessive violence, after all, strengthens the underlying point.I read the Robert Heinlein book as a kid, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I think that this strays no further than most other film adaptations, which is to say that it has little to do with the book. Some of the liberties taken with the adaptation are rather sly. By never showing a single bug with a weapon or any technology at all (the plasma rays appear to be a natural bug process!), while portraying them such a threat, heightens the sense that militarists should think twice about throwing their weight around against the "weak." Imagine if, in addition to being so naturally ferocious and deadly, the bugs actually had comparable weapons? The ineffectiveness of most of the weapons used (sending grunts into battle with the equivalent of peashooters - another sign of military stupidity) underscores the futility of purely military thinking in general. The repeated Nazi imagery (the command staff shown after they capture the main bug looks like it just stepped out of Rommel's Afrika Korps, and the massed formations of troops and settings appears straight out of "Triumph of the Will") suggests where militarism ultimately leads while also hinting that the brutality and senselessness exemplified by Naziism is an ingrained part of the human experience that must be recognized, accepted and fought when it appears.It is a bit cartoonish in places (Denise Richards runs around as if nothing had happened after the bugs spear her in a coyly subliminal scene; characters die in mock-heroic Nietzchean fashion; everybody spouts over-the-top jingoistic dialogue; impossible coincidences abound; and how can there be any debate about the bugs being intelligent if they can successfully attack orbiting spaceships and perform the fantastically complicated task of diverting asteroids to attack Earth?), but effective. A solid effort that apparently was too subtle (in making its point, not in terms of showing the effects of war!) for its own good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is freaking (or better explicit) insane.First off, if this is not the most violent movie ever made, I'll go buy a hat and eat it. I'm not rating this on the body count, the number of fight scenes, the amount of guns going off, or the gallons of blood. I am rating it on the amount of scenes that had me *gagging*.I have to say that I feel bad for the poor, unsuspecting Joe (and Jill) Six-Pack Space Adventure Moviegoers who went to see this expecting a fun time for all. You do not watch this movie so much as you stare aghast, occasionally laughing nervously, and wondering how in the heck Paul Verhoven got away with this.What we have here, people, is "Star Wars: the Fascist Menace".In it's own way, "Starship Troopers" is even more subversive than "Fight Club". Get a bunch of pretty boy-and-girl teen heartthrobs, turn them into Nazis, then drop them on a planet where they'll end up as food for Preying Mantises from Hell! *THEN* sell said Mantises as toys! Wee!!!I felt physically dirty after watching this movie, but I still recommend it if you want something that will *really* mess with your head.</fullReview>

It has great FX, it has vicious monsters it touches those WWII subjects (propaganda and fascism) it has romance, sex, brief nudity, violence, it has great looking women(Dina Meyer and Denise Richards) and above all it is great fun. It's a great science fiction movie for adults (the way I would love to see the Star Wars movies, although I know that it is impossible)Starship Troopers rules!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good SF movie. (8/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have enjoined watching this SF movie, based on the novel by Robert A. Heinlein. You do not have to think hard or anything else, if you like the genre just sit back and enjoy the ride. This film has the same structure as Robocop. We have to thank for that the same filmmaker: Paul Verhoeven, Jost Vacano and Edward Neumeier. So if you like Robocop you should like this one. Some comments say that this is a B movie. I do not think so, but there are some things, which will make you make that decision. The only thing, which I can say: `This is a B movie thing', is the design of the spacecrafts. For the rest it is top notch: Special Effects - one of the best I have ever seen, music by Basil Polidorious is just awesome, cinematography - very good (Jost Vacano - way to go). The problem with the script is obvious, but as I said, `You do not have to think during this SF flick', this is not some serious movie about the war or the war tactics. This is more of the satire. Be course some thing will remind you of the Vietnam War, some of WWII. Some people criticised it like it was some `Platoon' or `Saving Private Rayn'. They just did not see that you do not have to judge this film on the same level as above-mentioned movies. The blood and gore just filled the movie. If you will cut all the gory parts of the movie it will not be the same. Acting is good, not cheesy, as some will expect. This movie has its weight in SF genre and it is definitely one of the best SF movies in the 90s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Satire!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is not only a very funny B-Movie with very well made FX, but also a very good satire: In the Novel, all is about why it is good to be a soldier and only the person who is willing to join the army to fight &amp; kill is a true worthy human beeing. At first, I thought the novel was meant to be ironic, but now i know its just outright fascistic.Paul Verhoeven mentioned this in an interview for german magazine CINEMA, and he also said he experienced the Nazi regime as a child in Holland, so he wanted to make a statement against fascism. If you look at the movie , you will see a lot of references to the Nazi-Regime: the militaristic society, the propaganda TV, Doogie Howser in a SS coat and so on. Believe me, people, it was meant to be that way!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I have read the book and it's different. Yes, the acting in some scenes is wooden. Yes, it is completely over the top. But the fact of the matter is that this is a much smarter movie than many believe! Like most big fans of this movie I am of the school of thought that those who didn't like it simply didn't get it! The world's best and brightest go off to fight a war against a species that will definitely fight to the last mandible! The kids sign up voluntarily because of sickening (but funny) propaganda, and turn from cute 90210 types into killing machines, fighting until they're literally chopped to bits. The bugs are a truly hideous foe, and are much smarter than they initially appear. Upon repeated viewings you will catch many things that you may have missed the first time around, such as the crazy oath everyone takes, and the "benefits" of becoming a citizen. Johnny Rico is destined to command the roughnecks, as every other location he was considering going to upon his graduation gets destroyed! It should also be mentioned that this movie contains the best CGI I've ever seen, as the bugs interact with the humans in a terrifyingly seamless way. Far superior than anything else to come out in 1997, this movie along with Robocop and Total Recall elevates Verhoven to an elite level of sci-fi director, no matter what other projects he's been involved in. Hilarious, scary, endlessly quoteable and truly jaw-dropping, this is my kind of movie! Great job! 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>don't overlook this silm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>may be a spoilerStarship Troopers is an film that one can too easily overlook. A true sci-fi fan may dismiss it as cartoonish and simple. A non sci-fi fan may view it as a typical lasers and aliens flick. Both assessments only scratch the surface.I've read the book, and I recommend anyone who has seen this film do the same. The book was written in a different era, and the comparisons of the politics in the book, with those of the film are remarkable. Indeed, it appears to me that the filmmakers purposely made a visual statement in the movie that matched what a reader of the book would have expected- the patriotic bugkillers, the military bonding. Yet, the movie throws the whole propaganda of the book on its head, subtly I think. And that's its brilliance. It pokes fun at its entire message. Not to mention it does so with exciting lasers, cool aliens (and pretty decent, and just plain pretty actors and actresses).If this all doesn't make sense, watch the movie and read the book. It'll be worth the effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would you like to know more?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favourite films, and gets better with each watching.I have read a lot of criticism of this film and would like to discuss some of it:1. - The actors can't act and are impossibly beautiful. This is true, and the whole thing has the look and feel of a squeaky clean soap opera. This seems to be the intention of the film. All the sets are scrupulously clean. Even the alien's planet is relatively clean and well lit. This is the only performance I have seen where Denise Richards *hasn't* made me cringe - because she is meant to be inane.2. - The film supports fascist ideology. - I don't believe that the film supports any ideology particularly. As far as I can see it satirises it quite cleverly through the smooth and cheerful characters, Neil Patrick Harris' Goebels uniform. The characters are comfortable in their world, and even when at war on another planet they are in their own world. No one questions anything, including the fact that they don't question anything. They are all too tied up in their own pathetic lives to even glimpse at the bigger picture. This film is ABOUT propaganda more than it is propaganda itself. Just look at the snippets from TV/Internet with the slogan "Would you like to know more?" You never get to know more. The only character in the film that gets to know more is Neil Patrick Harris' character, and he answers questions with "That's classified!" The final scene of the film brings into question whether the whole film was a piece of propaganda littered with commercial breaks. The film is postmodern! Is it a film, or a film of a TV show, or recruitment propaganda, or something to show parents?3. - The film glorifies war. - Again I think that satire has been mistaken for support of an idea. The film has every clich from every war movie going - the hyper-brutal drill-sergeant; the assault course; someone dying tragically in training, making everyone else wonder if they are tough enough to go on. When the characters get to the war zone they find themselves out numbered and out classed by the enemy. Numbers beat brains and technology (except in the end the humans (perhaos) prevail because of brain and technology) and we are treated to plenty of starlets torn to pieces.I like this film a lot. It is great sci-fi. The effects are excellent. The story is more complex than it appears to be at first glance (like a lot of Verohoven's movies - RoboCop, Total Recall, Showgirls even) and has lots of little asides which add to the feel of the thing (the aforementioned web-casts particularly). If you like nothing else, the scenes of millions of bugs attacking the troopers are amazing spectacles.If you would like to know more, watch Starship Troopers, and don't forget to keep your sense of irony and satire. This is not a film to take seriously. And don't take yourself too seriously while watching it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is a spectacular Sci-Fi film that deserves more credit than it has received. The action and special effects are outstanding, as would be expected from Paul Verhoeven, although this isn't all that the film has to offer. The film cleverly uses comparisons to the Viatnam war in which the troops fight a greatly underestimated enemy and pay the price through military blunders. The 'bug holes' are similar to foxholes and in the film it is interesting to note that everyone in the world seems to be American from Geneva to Buenos Aires. A prediction of things to come? The stunningly beautiful Denise Richards adds to an extremely watchable film which is well worth a look. The acting is of a reasonably good standard from a largely unheard of cast. Overall a fantastic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has always bothered me when directors take a title of a book, play, story, or historical event and then completely change the essence of what it was. Poetic license is one thing, personal interpretation is another, but Starship Troopers is so far off, I would not have recognized it under another title. If the title were BugWars, it would have been acceptable under the "Special effects were great, lots of hotties, and enjoyable on a lazy afternoon or a late night movie fest" category. But they raped Heinleins book of ALL importance. The book is about one mans evolution from student dreaming of heroics to the understanding that war is hell. All quiet on the Western Front ring any bells? It is then finished off with a healthy dose of Full Metal Jacket. Instead, the movie is a combination of Melrose Place and Xena. It should have been called the class of Beverly Hills 90210 gets Drafted to go Fight Bugs in Space. Enjoy it if you want, but don't think it is anything like the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sad to say that Starship Troopers doesn't really work on any level. The occasionally socio-political satire is too sparse and tentative, and the genuinely breathtaking CGI gorefests are actually fairly few and far between. The filmwork and editing is competent but uninspired, and Starship Troopers plays like a montage of clips from better films, only in soft focus and run through a Mediocrotron(tm).This would be forgivable if the actors aren't so bland and unengaging. Van Dien's range seems to be limited to "blank", "angry" and "hurt", but that's way better than the unwatchable Denise Richards who's natural posture seems to be grinning inanely over her shoulder. After the tenth time (I exaggerate not), you really wish someone would feed the irritating bimbo to a bug.Michael Ironside apart, the supporting cast are also unconvincing. They are without exception way too old to be playing their parts, and look it. Patrik Muldoon (Rico's rival for Carmen) in particular is dreadfully miscast, unless his math/pilot skills are due to being held back ten grades. And perhaps a tiny part of the FX budget could have been spent hiring professional bit part players rather than dredging the local amatuer theatres to fill the minor speaking roles. The hammy overacting that worked in the quirky Robocop looks quite out of place here among the huge FX budget.But those FX! The bulk of the $95 million budget went on the effects, and it's well spent. We get an early glimpse of the bugs, and (on first viewing) it's enough to keep us from walking out or fast forwarding through the long and pretty dire segment before they re-appear. When when do finally appear en masse, it's a truly awesome sight, with the CGI and live action blended almost seamlessly even even in fully lit scenes. It's not just the computer effects that shine, the quantity of dismembered bodies and gore on the sets make Saving Private Ryan look like a kiddies' tea party. But it's clear that the real leads (hint: the dumbest, most irritating ones) are never in any danger, and so the monster shots have nothing like the tension of, say, Aliens.For every exclamation of "Damn! Cool!" when the bugs appear, there's at least two "Damn! This sucks!" for when the inspid humans take centre stage. Starship Troopers, much like the Matrix, is a great half hour padded out with way too much pointless filler.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most puzzling films I've rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the recent (and, at this time, ongoing) election between George W. Bush and Al Gore, Starship Troopers is a movie that is hard to define because it isn't sure what it wants to be.When we saw this movie in its initial theatre run, my wife and I walked out afterward feeling like it was one of the worst movies we had ever seen. It was especially disappointing to me, because I am a sci-fi fan and had enjoyed Heinlein's book. I knew the movie would be different. Still, the extreme amounts of gore (both human and bug) put us off, and the mixed messages (War makes us fascists! That's good! No, that's bad!) were confusing.The "propaganda" segments that appear from time to time in ST are very clever and at times laugh-out-loud funny. The movie itself that appears in-between is much more inconsistent. I have since had the pleasure of listening to the DVD commentary track of Starship Troopers, and the director notes many times that the movie is a reflection of AMERICAN society and our alleged willingness to use power when we can't get what we want fast enough through other means. There is some truth in that, but I'm not so sure this wasn't a movie about the fact that all humans can lose their individuality and concerns over individual rights when faced with an outside enemy that threatens the status quo. The question is, if it works during war, is that bad? And after the war, can you go back once you have taken those first steps? The movie never answers those questions.There are several moments in ST where a character or a news cast notes that it was the humans who infringed upon the bugs, not the other way around. But that is quickly overlooked in the face of the differentness of the bugs and the way the bugs kill (not through impersonal technology, but by using their own bodies). I would have liked to have learned more about the bugs, but the film chooses instead to spend more time with the young cast, showing the effects of war and the furthering of fascism.Ah, the cast. All pretty, almost all interchangeable. Perhaps that was intentional as well. In a movie where individual desires and differences are overshadowed by society, perhaps having an overwhelming presence among the actors would have been distracting.In the end, ST wasn't about the bugs, wasn't about any single member of the cast, and wasn't about whether a fascist society is more effective or less effective in fighting a war. I'm not sure what it *was* about, other than a few ideas that are brought up but never fully explored. We have ST a 5 because it sits on the fence instead of taking a side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A misguided attempt at parody.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is called 'Starship Troopers,' like Robert Heinlein's book. But Verhoeven simply doesn't understand the novel, and apparently doesn't want to. He remarks that his childhood experiences in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands has informed his filmmaking. Instead, it simply gives him a fetish for Nazism and and violent kneejerk reaction to anything he think is 'crypto-fascist'. Heinlein's novel is about the responsibilities of political citizenship, and about the men and women who have put their lives on the line FIGHTING against things like Nazism. Are their stories worth telling? Heinlein thought so. The millions of readers who have read the novel Starship Troopers think so. But Paul Verhoeven is only interested in fascism. So instead of actually reading, understanding, and adapting the novel, he pays Ed Neumeier to write a parody of the novel, slaps on a coat of 'Nazi' paint, and pretends that Starship Troopers is actually 'crypto-fascist' propaganda. This makes it easier for him to dismiss the worthwhile points that the novel made and get on with his clever little parody. If you're looking for a honest attempt to render the novel, look elsewhere. By itself, the main point of this movie seems to be 'Nazis are bad!' Thanks, Paul, but we knew that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Verhoeven's greatest talent seems to be helming films that the US audiences want to vilify because they don't understand what the film is about. Hollow Man painted an amusing picture of what happens to those with subjective morals when the fear that constitutes their only restraint is taken away. Robocop presented a far more compelling version of the Christ theme than the Gospels (or slop like The Matrix, for instance). So Starship Troopers presents us with a chilling portrait of what we can expect our society to turn into if the education system we currently have is allowed to remain unchanged for long enough. Think about it for a second. In the world of Starship Troopers, Flores is ridiculed for expressing a difference of opinion in the classroom. As a child, I was subjected to treatments that are the equivalent of electrocuting your dog when he urinates on the carpet simply because school was too boring for me. It was little wonder that I found the journey of four high schoolers who grow up to be little fascists to be so fascinating and compelling. If Paul and Ed were any less subtle about this plot point, they would have put up those Education Department posters that say things like "When I grow up, I want to be..." everywhere. Only, given that this is a critique of our current Ritalin-crazed Western society, many of them would say things like "When I grow up, I want to abuse children" or "When I grow up, I want to be Adolf Hitler".This, friends, and neighbours, is the whole point of Starship Troopers. We are introduced to a heirachial insect society whose only fault is that they make no apologies for their natural killing instinct, then we throw them against a humanity that has become a globalised version of the facism we call child psychology today. And then we are left asking who are the good guys... humanity sure ain't them.Like most of Paul Verhoeven's American films, Starship Troopers seperates the intellectual men from the retards. Defensive idiots who cannot understand what the film is pointing out to them scream that it is vapid nonsense. Those of us who have been abused as children and can see the facistic direction Western education is taking as a result, however, find this film and others like it to be strangely prophetic. And if you're thinking that the future depicted in Starship Troopers will never happen, consider the fact that the Media-Net interruptions to the film (as well as much of the film itself) are almost exact copies of Western World War II propaganda films.I gave this film nine out of ten. The storyline could have been tighter, and the overall mood could have been a little more serious, but those are the only faults. The music from both Poledorises (Basil, and his daughter Zoe during the dance scene) is worthy of that much by itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate teenage male fantasy ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Heinlein wrote many 'juvenile' science-fiction works; "Starship Troopers" is one of them.In Heinlein's stories, the young hero is usually strong, always intelligent and independent, perched on the cusp of manhood. He resists the expectations of his parents and strikes off on his own. He perseveres through incredible hardships and becomes part of a great endeavor where people create their own destinies, much like the first pioneers of the American West.Some sort of conflict or struggle is always involved; the young man learns to fight and defend himself like a seasoned soldier, becoming a man in the process. The girls/women he meets are also strong, intelligent, and independent--worthy comrades.This movie is very Heinlein-ian. The teen-aged hero is handsome, confident, strong, independent, intelligent, morally upright, and athletic. He goes off to war with his friends to fight and triumph over an absolutely-evil foe. There is no question that he is on the side of "right". He gains maturity and wisdom, and perseveres in the face of death and destruction. His comrades are likewise heroic, and the women are all beautiful and as strong as the men.For those of us who were NOT strong or confident or handsome or athletic in high school (probably most of us), this movie represents an enduring fantasy that many of us carry around inside. "Starship Troopers" is a comic book come to life, where we always score the winning touchdown and our girlfriends are always the prettiest. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Satire and Splatter Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched Starship Troopers on video last night, and I can't understand how anyone could think that this was a bad movie - I laughed throughout most ST, especially because so many scenes are so recognizable from other war movies (casting Eric Bruskotter as one of the recruits was a very nice touch after his appearance in the first season of Tour Of Duty).The acting was spot-on, if you take into account that this movie is satirizing every WWII B-movie and information film (and shampoo commercial) ever made (Triumph of the Will, the movie in which a dying Hitler Youth holds a speech and I can't recall the name of, etc.).And that's where the real horror lies, not in the fact that large insects are being dispatched gorily, but that before and leading upto the battle of Stalingrad, German troops were decimated from 330,000 to 91,000 (think about it); not in the perfect smiles and hair or the East German uniforms of drill instructors, but in the fact that movies using the same "props" were used to enlist naive youth to die in large numbers and have their privates shot off on remote strips of nowhere on the Eastern front. Or Hamburger Hill. Or Atjeh. That is where the real horror lies. Starship Troopers is a satire.About the movie. [** SPOILERS AHEAD **]The entire movie is played as one long propaganda movie (you don't know where the real events end and the propaganda begins; in fact, it might all be propaganda).Some time in the future, the earth is or may be threatened by a species of insect, hundreds of lightyears away. Rico (Casper van Dien), a rich kid (who's parents have moved to Rio de Janeiro - described as a 'paradise in the Tropics' [catch the irony and doublespeak?]) wants to do something independent for once. His parents want him to go to Harvard, but he wants to enlist in the mobile infantry. The girl he has a crush on in High School (Denise Richards) wants to become a pilot and fly attack aircraft, along with Rico's rival and opponent on the indoor football field (flashes of Born On The Fourth Of July).As Rico enlists in training, the girl who has a crush on him (Dina Meyer) also enlists in the mobile infantry to be with him. Watch everyone go through Basic Training under the sadistic leadership of Clancy Brown, wearing an East German uniform. Watch them take communal showers afterwards (one naked girl even slaps a naked guy's butt on his way out of the showers - too cool).After Rico possibly gets one of his team killed in an life fire excrcise (Eric Bruskotter's helm is too large, he takes it off and _zappo_), Rico is ready to take the walk down "washout lane", as his parents in Rio are annihilated by a giant meteor, which may or may not deliberately have been knocked out of orbit (flashes of the "Tonkin Gulf" incident, as well as Hitler Germany taking artillery fire - ahem - from the Poles) by the bugs and headed towards planet earth.Anyway, they're quickly assigned to fight in the insect's distant galaxy.As the insects take their toll by bloodily hacking through the waves of troopers and spitting huge balls of fire into the atmosphere, their ranks are enforced by Rico's erstwhile civics teacher (Michael Ironside) (nobody is beyond national service), who has the best line of the movie after their leader is hacked to pieces by the bugs: "Rico, I need a corporal and you're it, until you're dead or I find somebody better". Needless to say, with the bugs attacking in full force, Rico quickly makes it up through the ranks in a similar fashion.This is a great movie, and I can't understand why people don't like it. It has humor, sarcasm, splatter, nude showers...The thing is, that Paul Verhoeven's movies have to grow on you. They don't immediately strike you as perfect (although ST is the best I've seen), but they grow into cult classics nonetheless - The Fourth Man, Spetters, Soldier of Orange, Robocop, Basic Instinct - all of them cult classics, but all of them have to have a little time to grow on you.Enjoy.</fullReview>

This is what attracted me most; well the stunning Dina Meyer doesn't hurt your eyes any. The acting is a little light, but the action will keep you occupied. Very good sci-fi adventure.A futuristic military goes into battle against an invading force of clever and relentless giant alien insects.

		<shortDescription>Brainless and maybe even brilliant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Verhoeven's "Starship Troopers" is brainless, meaningless garbage. Its violence is gratuitous, its dialogue is sophomoric, and its manipulation of what I am sure is an excellent Robert Heinlein novel is shameful.I loved it.I ask that you keep the following in mind. I am an intelligent human being who has never liked a lot of violence in film. My favorite movies are those that leave me thinking and guessing, begging for more, like "The Truman Show" and "American Beauty." Yet, here is "Starship Troopers," a film that is all brawn and no brains, a movie that leaves you without a real genuine thought in the world. I think that's why I enjoyed it.In the history of science fiction, the greatest films are (in my opinion) of the "Star Wars" variety. Here there are characters we care about, a plot that leaves us thinking, and, perhaps most importantly, a movie that we can watch with our families. Then came "Star Trek," where relationships are suddenly the most important issue, and problems are solved peacefully and intelligently. "Starship Troopers" throws a wrench in the sci-fi scene with meaningless characters, relationships, and violence.Now I ask you, are very many movies this bold? When was the last time you saw a movie that knew full well it wasn't a great, intelligent movie, and didn't care? What was the last movie you saw whose sole purpose was neither to inspire or bewilder, but simply to entertain? For myself, "Starship Troopers" was a welcome breath of fresh air, a much needed vacation from more serious fare. It will not win any Oscars, but who cares? Certainly not the film makers. And neither should we, because "Starship Troopers" succeeds spectacularly in that it is entertaining. That should be enough.***1/2 out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit that I had the "luck" not to hear about this movie and not to know about the director's identity. I did not see the beginning and only knew the Hebrew name of the movie. I stayed the whole length almost perplexed. The lack of "stars" didn't diminish at all the quality of this film. The plot was very "Total Recall" like (which I did notice during the watch) and this is a very good formula for success, in my opinion. The quality of the animatronics lacked a little, but the "fire squirting insect" was a success. The plot does not have great importance, because it is totally incongruent, but the beauty in sci-fi movies doesn't lie in the plot, no? Even so, I loved the dedication of the hero to the girlfriend and his devotion to the mission. I loved also the item of insects chosen as foes, because it made the movie very politically correct (no one admires insects) without diminishing the fierceness of the battles- the insects were the most competent warriors I have ever seen.To conclude, it is a well done movie, which decided to leave plot to other genres and to concentrate in what sci-fi movie lovers like: stunts and imagination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apart from a few redeeming qualities, such as Denise Richards and some graceful FX, this film really blows with bad acting, NO consistency, and the worse use--or disregard of science that I haven't seen since ID4. Rating: 21.) Gee, all of those pretty boys and girls sure look like they just stepped right off of the Aaron Spelling Production line.2.) Just how in the heck did the bugs (who were never shown to posses any technology in the film) propel the asteroid out of their own solar system which is located on the other side of the freaking galaxy? Did they use a sling shot? And you'd think by the 23th century the federation/whatever would not only have some way of detecting rogue asteroids, but also to eliminate the threat before it had a chance to tumble anywhere near Earth!3.) Why waste the lives of countless men and women with ground forces when a couple dozen nukes could eliminate the bug threat--game over? And not only are they "still" using AK 47s in the 23th century, but they seem to come with an endless supply of ammo, Chin Boy to Ditzy: "Here! Make 'em Count!" Sheesh! Are you insulting my intelligence?4.) How were the bugs able to survive on their planet B which looks like a wasteland? 5.) Why is it in every shot the fleet is packed together like sardines, cruising at 2 mph? And they wonder why they keep getting shot down? Hey! They don't call it "SPACE" for nothing! 6.) Apparently medical science was successful with its regeneratory tissue experiments. How else do you explain the lovely Richards being stabbed in the shoulder with a eight ft long spear only to make a full recovery by the next scene? Can you say "Re-set Button"?</fullReview>

Bad writing, acting and directing, mis-matched with a hyper-active SFX team, propel this film beyond countless other mediocre SF flicks, into an outrageously awful class of its own.If you want a well-written, thought-provoking story, with good character development, read the book.

		<shortDescription>Elaborate Nazi Joke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The central characters are supposed to be flat and meaningless. Their motivations are intentionally one-dimensional. They are intended to seem like a bunch of war-mongering jocks. The reason for this is because they are the National Socialists of the future.These blond-haired, blue-eyed Aryan beauties live in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Could they by chance be the descendants of the Nazis who all moved to S. America after WWII?And all that talk about how to become 'a citizen', how only by conforming and becoming an idealized military warrior can a person win acceptance in society? Everybody else is an undesirable, a social outcast? Familiar.....?If this all sounds a bit far-fetched, then just check out the costumes. Doogie Houser beginning as the school nerd and ending up goose-stepping around in full Gestapo regalia, peak cap and long black leather coat? Hold on.....And that incredible ending. The 'happy' ending is the realisation that our heroes have induced fear in an alien species. How twisted is that?Basically, Starship Troopers was a widely misunderstood film. Shot down in flames for being dumb and too loud, it was criticised for being exactly what it so expertly mocked. The irony was lost on the public at large (no surprise) and Verhoeven's outrageous deadpanning completely overlooked. It is a film that seems dumb at first because the characters are so dumb, but on closer inspection reveals itself to be a sophisticated satire on conformity, patriotism and the cult of the hero.Even if you hated this movie, go back and check it again. Just don't watch it as a sci-fi film or a war film. Watch it as a jet-black comedy and it will please you much more.Plus.....I've never seen carnage like that before. Yeeeeehhhhaaaaaaaa!

The special effects are SO good, you will NOT be able to tell when you are looking at a computer-generated creature, a prop, or a machine. It is THAT good.The fact that Titanic beat THIS movie for special effects is one of the greatest travesties in human history, and speaks to the validity of critics and academy awards.The cast of near-nobodies makes the movie more interesting - you don't know who is going to survive (unlike say Aliens). The soundtrack by Poledouris is wonderful, and the Verhoeven-style news clips are clever, entertaining, and diverting.The movie is violent, and DEFINITELY not for kids. But the military sequences are realistic, as well as the consequences of military mistakes. The Napalm run, the Fortress Fight, and the Home Planet Invasion are absolutely incredible sequences.A must see, and preferably in the theater or with DVD 5.1 sound on a big tube TV. It rocks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>anti-american satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Verhoeven, a Dutchman, is known in Holland for his socio-critical movies. Watching his "Turks Fruit" or "Soldaat van Oranje" is painful for any Dutch, in the way he paints us. After moving to Hollywood, Starship Troopers is maybe his best effort of applying his way of movie-making to his new surroundings. It is quite interesting to see how almost only non-American viewers seem to see the underlying themes of the movie. The self-awareness of Americans don't seem to be up to Dutch standards, which explains the limited success of Paul's efforts. Confronted with american-style glorification of militarism, 90210-arian actors and downright intolerance and racism, his public jumps into denial. Perhaps he has seen this coming and has aimed at a European public, ignoring for example american double-standards when painting a gender-blind society. It's a great film, and movies like Alien(s) become quite ridiculous and shallow by comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Minor Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to understand why some persnickety folks insist on dwelling on the physics flaws in this film when it's clear the film itself is completely unconcerned with being realistic -- the Arachnids hurl asteroids, literally, from one end of the Milky Way galaxy to the other (a distance measured in hundreds of millions of light-years) and they reach Earth in a matter of hours. Such a blatant dismissal of the laws of physics clearly demonstrates that the film could have cared less about these things.ST is a lot of fun, but I think there's a little more going on than that. The enlistment propaganda, laughable as it is, goes to the "Be all you can be" ads you might see on cable TV, and the juxtaposition of this propaganda with the spectacle of infantry troops being hacked to ribbons underscores the lie of these "Be all you can be" ads. ("The mobile infantry made me what I am today.") Also, the bugs come conveniently pre-dehumanized -- a clever take on the recent dehumanizaton of the Middle East, after we did the same to the Vietnamese, the Japanese, etc. (Granted, they did the same to us -- it doesn't seem possible to fight a war without bringing some racism to bear on it.) All in all, a loud, blaring movie with an undercurrent of subtle subversiveness, in the word's noblest sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant! Verhoeven's best Hollywood movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is brilliant satire on everything one can think of when thinking of SF movies, and much, much more. I can only imagine how much fun Neumeier had when writing the script, or how much fun Verhoeven had when he directed this masterpiece. And I cannot believe that there is anyone who can take the "messages" or anything in the movie seriously. So, for all of them, all I can say is: This movie isn't serious about "technicalities" in it (i.e. weapons, laws of physics or biology of bugs). This movie isn't serious about society in it (i.e. about this ideal military society it agitates for). And finally, this movie isn't about special effects. Special effects are there (and they are great) because this is, after all, a SF movie, and because Verhoeven loves special effects. If anything, I think that Verhoeven made this movie just to laugh at people who might take this movie seriously. Not to mention numerous quotation of other movies (any real movie-fan will have a great time just recognising them), and irony and despise Verhoeven's movie has for TV (news, soap operas, censorship, idealisation of " the American way of life", etc.). Maybe it's even Verhoeven's answer to those who accused him of despising and undermining women - this is the most "feministic" movie I've seen in years. Don't leave your brain outside when going to see this movie - take it and use it. That's the only way you'll enjoy this movie. And when you've seen it once, go and see it once again. For conclusion, I think that this movie will enter my all-time favourite movie list, but somewhere with Monty Python's movies, not with Blade Runner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vapid and misconcieved sci fi action film - like Quake on the big screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>$100 million spent on weak science fiction novel. Do you want to know more?Well, I admit, I was intrigued, and the blanket poster campaign in London was certainly effective at building my anticipation. Verhoeven had brought us sly irony in 'Robocop' and I assumed that his intent here was satire. I hope that was his intent, because the film bursts into technicolour splatter like 'Showgirls' but with gore instead of breasts.Not long after the film had started I was wondering: 15? How did this, the most violent film I have ever seen, get passed by the censors as a 15 when 'Showgirls' (which was a harmless piece of adult comic book entertainment) was an 18? Answer: the censors aren't bothered by violence anymore. Oh, they don't want people seeing sex and they certainly don't want people to hear the kind of swearwords that any person on the planet hears on an almost daily basis, but they are happy to pass the most disembowling movie of all time as a 15. My complaint here is not with the film makers - on the contrary, I applaud them for showing a battlefield for what it is, a place where people die and get mutilated in horrible ways - but with the idiocy of the censors who are so far removed from the real world that they might actually have mistaken 'Starship Troopers' as a documentary.Now I have to be careful to seperate my complaints with the film out carefully lest the casual reader thinks that I have missed the irony of the film. So let's look at three elements of the film seperataly: Story, Characters and Special Effects.Firstly, the story. Now I've been told that the original book was a piece of juvenile fiction, and on the basis of the film I can believe it. This is infantile crap from beginning to end, predictable, trite and devoid of any value what-so-ever. The tedium of the set pieces is matched only by the lack of any attempt to rationalise the background.So bored was I that I came close to leaving, but I kept hoping for more of the satire that Neumeier managed to put into his first script ('Robocop') so successfully. The irony is there, but sadly there isn't enough. Verhoevenisms get the film off to a great start, but after the shot of the mangled veteren saying 'The mobile infantry made me the man I am today' we are just asked to remember that this isn't serious. And to be fair, it does satirise World War II movies as well as any film is going to. But this says very little.As if the plot wasn't a large enough Achilles' heel, we have the characters. Now I often suffer from an inablility to identify or empathise with characters on screen, but this is the first film in years to make me wish for the death of the principal characters so quickly. Vapid male lead Johnny Rico (played by Casper Van Dien with all the charm and finesse of a daytime soap actor) was highly tedious, and who doesn't pray for snipers the moment TV's Doogie Howser (Neil Patrick Harris) graces the screen?But the award for 'Please, Goddess, Kill Her Now' must go to the female lead , Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) whose infernally white teeth and irritating smile were so infuriating that when the bugs finally wounded her I let loose a whoop of joy that may unfortunately have ruined the enjoyment of the film for anyone who actually cared.And while it's nice to see Clancy Brown and Michael Ironside getting work, it would have been even nicer to see them in something good. The one character I liked, the hopeless romantic Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer) only appealed to me because of the high quality of her breasts, which were deliciously and prominently displayed on screen twice, presumably as an attempt to provide the viewer some rapport with her.But at least, I hear you cry, the computer graphics were impressive. Well, let's look at this carefully. Firstly, all the really impressive shots were in the trailer (or at least, in the US trailer - the UK trailers seemed to be much more thoughtfully produced for the most part) which kind of burst the spectacle bubble for me. And yes, the bugs were beautifully rendered, but they were not at all scary - certainly not as terrifying as co-star Jake Busey's teeth. All of which begs the same question as 'Independence Day': if you're going to invest all this money in a sci-fi film's special effects, why don't you also invest some time in getting a good script? I mean, even if you're dead set on converting a sci-fi novel from the 1950's, we could have had 'The Stars My Destination' and had a story that might have held the attention of those people who aren't hypnotised by the sight of so many ludicrously underpowered guns being fired at so many pixels.You could be forgiven for believing that I went in thinking that I was going to hate 'Starship Troopers' - on the contrary, I was optimistic that Verhoeven could actually do a decent job with it. But he chose spectacle over substance (as has become the Hollywood way) and the one good thing to come from it was the feeling of happiness that filled me when the film was finally over. Verhoeven so obviously wants this to be satirical (putting Neil Patrick Harris' character, Carl Jenkins, in jackboots and an SS uniform was a nice touch) but it's difficult not to worry about the many viewers of this for whom the irony is going to be totally lost.Very, very disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humans in a fascistic, militaristic future do battle with giant alien bugs in a fight for survival.Director Verhoeven says his satirical use of irony and hyperbole is "playing with fascism or fascist imagery to point out certain aspects of American society... of course, the movie is about 'Let's all go to war and let's all die.'" This theme did not resonate well with everyone, and "Starship Troopers" polarized audiences and critics alike.I did not care for the film when I saw it in theaters in 1997. Re-watching it now (2015), I like it slightly more. It has some nostalgia value, because we have actors like Denise Richards who have faded away... and Neil Patrick Harris who has gone on to bigger and better things. The satire itself is still pretty flat, though... this is not Paul Verhoeven's best work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship troopers is one of the most maligned films of all time, panned by critics on its release, 17 years ago, they called it a "nonstop splatterfest so devoid of taste and logic that it makes even the most brainless summer block buster look intelligent" in the Deseret News and the New York Post called it a "Crazed, lurid spectacle," as featuring "raunchiness tailor-made for teen-age boys." Even Roger Ebert who had lorded the social satire of Robocop said that the movie was a "one dimensional trivial nothing pitched at 11 year old sci-fi fans." But is that all it really is?I feel that the critics have missed the mark somewhat; Starship troopers was, and is, a searing incitement of right wing militaristic culture. Even though the film is 17 years old now (yes I feel old too RBD) the message is still as clear as a bell and that message can be summed up simply as "War makes fascists of us all." The movie comes out and says that violence is "the supreme authority from which all others are derived" and that "Naked force has resolved more conflicts throughout history than any other factor. The contrary opinion, that violence doesn't solve anything, is wishful thinking at its worst. People who forget that always die" these are not the words of a military recruitment officer or of a drill sergeant but the words of a teacher in a high school. The director of the film, Paul Verhoeven, (he of Robocop and Total Recall fame) is on record as saying that the film was playing with fascism and fascist imagery to point out certain aspects of American culture. And one can't help but see a comparison between the gung-ho jingoism of the propaganda films and the rightwing media in the states, especially fox news. Set in the far of future where mankind has reached out to the stars and started to colonize alien planets. This rabid colonialism has provoked an otherwise peaceful race of insect-like aliens to lash out against earth, which it suddenly and quite rightly now sees as hostile. Seeing fairly obvious self-defense tactics as further gestures of aggression Humankind musters its global forces and charges headlong into a grossly outmatched interstellar war, the film uses this as a spring board for a satire on the first Gulf war but it really works for any war that the USA has fought in since the end of the second world war, with the well trained and well equipped troops of Earth representing the states and the poorly equipped and not at all trained bugs representing the Vietnamese or the Iraqis The film is loosely based on a 1959 novel of the same name by Robert A Heinlein the book was meant to be more of a political Essay than a work of pure fiction with large a large portion set in a school classroom the characters debate with there History and moral philosophy teacher(played by the awesomely understated Michael Ironside), who many consider to be speaking in Heinlein's own voice. The script itself was a totally unrelated entity called 'bug hunt at outpost nine' Paul Verhoeven admits to not being able to finish the book as he found it 'depressing and boring'. The film can also be seen as a work on 'paradise lost' with the innocents of youth replaced with the hell of war.Even by todays standard the special effects look good, partly because they used real models, it took over a year for model builders, and special effect artists boss film Sony image works and good old industrial light and magic to make the ships that you see on screen. The movie offers up a beautiful totalitarian state where all the children are beautiful wide eyed and innocent, whereas the adults by contrast are usually maimed in some way from there service. The world itself feels fully fleshed out with different types of alien fulfilling different roles put together the world feels rich and detailed, if somewhat unsettling.The movie concerns the lives of three high school friends, all of whom sign up for military service after leaving high school. Denise Richards plays Carman a high flyer who wants to pilot starships, Casper Van Dean plays Johnny Rico her boyfriend who doesn't really want to join the military but signs on to impress his girlfriend, and there mutual friend Carl, played by Neil Patrick Harris who joins up because? well they never say but it is strongly implied that career choices are limited. So the three join up, Carmen goes to fleet to learn how to fly, Johnny goes into the Mobile infantry to learn how to kill and Carl goes into military intelligence to learn how to commit genocide and the film then follows John Rico's journey from being a fairly amiable high school jock hero to being a cold blooded killing machine. Our hero loses the love of his life when she decides to make a career out of being a pilot, as opposed to just fulfilling her two year service as Rico intended on doing, then an accident on the training field see him take ten lashes as punishment, his dues paid he decides to wash out and quit before he finishes his term of service and to give the fascist state in the movie its due they allow him to, that is until his hometown, Buenos Aires, is whipped of the face of the planet by a meteorite. It is then at our heroes lowest ebb that he reaches inside himself and is reborn, now a man. It is worth mentioning that there is no concrete proof that the meteorite strike was in fact an attack by the 'bugs' and could have in reality just been a random regular act of god, but the all-powerful Earth government treated it as a hostile action and used it as justification to go to war.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Favorite Movie Quote: "The only good bug is a dead bug!" (ADVANCED WARNING: Please Do Not Read The Rest Of This Review If You Are Easily Brought To Tears Whenever Someone Speaks Honestly, But Negatively, About "Star Wars")To me Starship Troopers was "everything" that Star Wars wasn't.From this reviewer's perspective - Starship Troopers was the sort of film that (thankfully) completely dispensed with all of that "Fairy-Tale" suckiness that clearly permeated right into the very core of Star Wars' existence.Depending on how you view things, here's a super-brief summary of Starship Troopers' pluses/minuses - - Endless droves of blandly attractive actors, both male and female.- A first-rate "Spoof" on Military/Sci-Fi/Monster-movies.- Packed to the rafters with eye-popping, jaw-dropping special effects.- Non-stop "Soap Opera"-style love triangles, galore.- Insane violence and carnage to the max.- Gung-ho, trigger-happy Army Cadets in Gestapo-like fashions, aping Nazism.Yes. I do realize that the above movie-summary highlights don't really sound all that thrilling, but somehow Director Paul Verhoeven actually managed to piece together a fairly exciting film by just using these very basic elements as his film's foundation.And I certainly can't deny that the overall end-product of Starship Troopers was a far greater achievement in satisfying movie-entertainment, than Star Wars ever-ever was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evil adaptation of the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Verhoeven tries to make a 'war is evil' movie after a book that is pretty much about anything else. While the book is military Science Fiction at its best, a smarter 'Full Metal Jacket', the movie fails in every concern. It fails to depict correctly the views of Heinlein, mocking them instead. It's a pity, really, since Heinlein's views deserved proper recognition and a good movie.It's not only that Verhoeven decided to destroy the book. It's the actors it chose, the B-class movie that resulted out of that. It's all the cool things that were missing from the movie: the power suit, the tensed action, the military training, the long travels, the effects of the war on the hero's psyche.But let's talk about the film, and not the book. The film is filmed like a B-class movie. It insists that the military should be gender-ignorant, and does that by doing a shower scene of naked troopers, both boys and girls, because in the mind of left-leaning Verhoeven that's how the army should be like. Then, it sends all this equality army to slaughter because the army is mindless, obviously. Now, the army shoots with some things that are not even as good as real live bullets (but they live in the future, probably there are some kind of humane left-leaning lasers that don't kill, just stun or something).The 'love' triangle (square?) that the movie tries to depict is not even laughable. The acting is so bad, it's not even funny. The soapy look, the fake newsreel interludes and the whole atmosphere makes this wannabe war-is-evil movie just a silly waste of time. Avoid.And for Heaven's sake, please read the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basically just a war movie set in outer space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This takes place on Earth in the future. Johnny Rico (Casper Van Diem)joins the military Mobile Infantry to battle giant bugs who are attacking Earth. His girlfriend Carmen (Denise Richards) joins also but is assigned to Flight Troopers. The movie follows them through their basic training and the all out battles with the bugs.This was taken WAY too seriously when it came out. People attacked director Paul Verhoeven saying her made a pro-war film. These people obviously missed the satirical tone of the film. This is NOT a pro-war film at all. Verhoeven is showing war is hell--he's not promoting it at all. The battles scenes are violent, gory and very VERY bloody. Body parts go flying every which way during them. This somehow got by with an R rating--Verhoeven himself was surprised that they didn't request any cuts. Guess they liked the bugs. The story is a basic war story where a couple is broken apart but still reunite at the end. This time it's just done with starships and bugs:) The special effects are very impressive...but the bugs look pretty stupid to me. There's also some skin (male and female) in the infamous coed shower sequence.On the negative side the acting is pretty horrible. Van Diem is a VERY handsome man but just can't. Poor Richard is given nothing to work with and spends 90% of her performance with this WAY too wide grin on her face. Even Neil Patrick Harris (in a small role) is bad! However Patrick Muldoon and Dina Meyer are pretty good supporting roles. It's loud, silly, violent and a lot of fun! I give it a 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so I'm a complete sucker for war movies and technically and convincing historical details. Anthony Hopkins using an accurate sten gun in a "Bridge too Far", and the wonderful realisation by Micheal Caine in the "Battle of Britain" that spitfires tend to overheat when sitting too long on the ground. This is the amazing stuff that I look for in a Spielberg movie or from British filmmakers.This is a completely different kind of movie, and one I thought I would hate. Quite the reverse. Sometimes its just an-over-the top science-fiction flic, and yes it is indeed that. But it does say something, in my opinion, about the youth that governments typically send into battle, and why they behave as they do.Combining humour, pretty good CGI, an unlikely plot (it is science fiction after all), it still rings true for the sense of what young people have been asked to do for the rest of us. Lay your sense of disbelief aside, enjoy the shower scene, and revel in the fact that Hollywood did something quite good in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Overwhelming Broad Satire On America's Self-Righteous Xenophobia and Militaristic Machismo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, look. Starship Troopers is not a kiddie movie. It's also not just a dumb go-for-broke action flick. If you've seen Verhoeven's past action pictures made in America, RoboCop and Total Recall specifically, you know what to expect here. And nearly everyone has seen RoboCop and Total Recall. Do you really think that a movie starring less-than-B-list actors playing roles with names like Johnny Rico is supposed to be taken seriously? Even a little bit? The film's biggest star is Denise Richards, that is if you don't count Rue McClanahan in a bit role as a blind biology teacher, for all those fans of Maude and The Golden Girls scattered all over the audience of Starship Troopers.I have not read the original novel by Robert Heinlein, but I know that it does not have the satirical approach that the film does. Verhoeven is a Dutchman who since coming to America has taking great pleasure in spoofing it. The film illustrates a country which unwarily evokes Nazi Germany, through fashion, use of propaganda, and iconography. Verhoeven's Earth is dystopic. It is xenophobic and militaristic in nature which he sees as a natural development in the righteous and victorious mentality of post-WWII America. The military training is deliberately brutal. Commanders intentionally mutilate recruits, and whipping is a means of penalty, which is to some extent moderated by the depiction of the future's technology which can heal such injuries in a jiff.Gender distinction is presented as having become less significant. Dina Meyers plays the adept starting quarterback of the high school football team who follows Casper Van Dien's hunky rebel protagonist through military training and into the front lines, as the military takes on both men and women to serve in combat. A particularly appealing and unabashedly Dutch bit is that the soldiers of both sexes shower and lodge together and by and large hardly think about sexual misconduct.With interstellar travel and a all-embracing galactic government, humanity has found themselves at war with an alien race of arachnids. Johnny Rico (Van Dien), his girlfriend (Richards), and best friend (Neil Patrick Harris) are all graduating from high school in Buenos Aires. Richards and Harris both plan to enlist in the military to become upper-class citizens after their term. Johnny, wanting to follow his girl, goes against his parents' ultimatums and enlists himself, but he finds that his grades are too low to join Denise Richards in Flight School, and is as an alternative assigned to combat. There, Johnny shows himself to be an exceptional leader, and is assigned head of his squad. He also meets an old high school classmate, Dina Meyer, who specially called for transfer to Johnny's division, as she has always been in love with him. Johnny comes to learn that his girlfriend is happy with her training and has become intimate with an old high school of his, hilariously named Zander, but that she will probably make the fleet her career, shattering Johnny's dreams.As both insect and human forces are massacred in extraordinary numbers, they are filmed and photographed by entrenched TV crews for viewers at home, further accenting the theatricality in the movie's spirit and the nature of the war of the future. Really, the humans are the invaders and the bugs the victims. When the bugs devastate Buenos Aires, they are not attacking Earth but acting in response to human migrants intruding on bug planets.Verhoeven truly directs this movie rather than filming it and influencing the actors. He really distinguishes it as its own beast. The story has a soap opera feel, almost like an old American war or religious epic by Cecil B. DeMille. He makes all the hero worship and self- righteous American military camaraderie not just satire but, in my eyes, broad comedy, way too corny to ever be meant as anything else. Even the music score by Basil Paledouris fits this thin-ice tone. Yes, its cavalier approach to all of its subject matter makes you much more detached and tired before the end that you should be, and that is its real fault, not that it's immature and stupid. Because, if you read between the very thin lines, you will find it is quite the contrary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great action sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched this I thought it was just an entertaining rip off of Aliens, little knowing that much of the earlier film had been inspired by the book of Starship Troopers. It also feels a bit like a sci-fi version of Full Metal Jacket in the way the first half is about basic training and the second half is almost non-stop combat action.The film is set in a future where in order to become a citizen and gain the vote you must have served in the armed forces, to this end a group of students enlist when they finish school. Most of the first half of the film follows Rico as he undergoes basic training. He nearly quits after a fellow recruit dies due to a mistake he made, but as he is about to leave he learns that his home city of Buenos Aires has been wiped out in an attack from a distant world populated by huge insects.The action then switches to the "bug planets" where our heroes expect an easy victory over the supposedly mindless insects, unfortunately for them the planet is crawling with insects that can tear them apart and even attack ships in orbit. Later on they learn that Military Intelligence suspects that the insects are being led by a "brain bug" and are tasked with capturing one on a small planets where they had just suffered a major defeat at the hands of the bugs.While this film isn't perfect it is great entertainment, it also isn't as brainless as it might appear at first sight, I don't think it is a coincidence that some of the uniforms resemble those of the Third Reich. There is a slight let down in the fact that the main characters are a little too good looking and some of the acting isn't as good as it could be, it must be pointed out that this complaint doesn't include the excellent Michael Ironside who played the teacher who re-enlists to become the troops' Lieutenant. The CGI bugs are also excellent, it does look as though our heroes are really battling huge alien bugs.If you enjoyed films like Aliens and have yet to see this then I'd recommend giving it a go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a film Starship Troopers has done some interesting experiments in style and layout. It manages to divide pretty cleanly as first half plot, second half war, and as far as your average watcher will go (I.E. not some *whole world is about star trek/LOTR/My religion* ist) it manages to create some pretty cool action, and as far as I'm concerned did its best to keep morals and justifications out of the relative range where it is questionable.Almost all the people I know have a copy of some of the lord of the rings, but bar your first viewing has anyone (certain stereotypes excluded) done much more than flick to a big battle. Little to understand, lots to watch.If viewed this way, as the head of unquestioned unplotted war genre, it is quite good, a decent amount of graphic violence, without being to chilling, an awesome amount of ammunition spent, and even by todays flawless standards, pretty decent CGI.an optimistic 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading about a dozen glowing reviews of Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers, I realized that these folks must have seen a different movie from the copy I saw, one that wasn't a ridiculous and embarrassing blob of blood, bug guts, and bad acting. Now, you have to accept that I am not exceptionally well-read in the science fiction genre. I have found some scifi appealing, but a lot of it is tedious social commentary wrapped up with robots and little green strangers.Whatever social comments Verhoeven and the book's author Robert Heinlein have to give you are lost in quite possibly the most repulsive orgy of CGI human vs. arachnid violence you could experience in an unintended-consequence drug-interaction incident. ST is beyond nauseating, bordering on the Ipecac-level of vomit inducement. I actually sat there sipping 7-Up to keep the gorge down (and I mixed in a bit of Tequila to make the movie a bit easier to take).But you have to accept that this is a product of Paul Verhoeven, a producer of cinematic vomit from the way-back. I kept hoping that things would get better, but what do you expect from the director of Hollow Man and Showgirls.Don't be surprised when you get phlegm from a "hack." Or is that bug guts?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a bad movie. And it's a bad action movie. When i watched it, i got bored, especially with all the actors who either couldn't, or was told not to display any range of feeling. I can't tell which. Parents and family dying: No feeling, but I do feel a bit compelled to kill the bugs, even though i'm not sad. Being dumped by girlfriend: So what, eventually i will get together with the girl who loved me all along. I did get stunned by the bad acting, but it didn't provoke me. Who could actually expect a movie with Denise Richards to be filled with good actors?After 30 minutes they had lost my interest completely. But a while after that they started shooting bugs. Like many others i am quite amazed at the lack of advanced weapons. But it's action, lets accept it. Problem was that after a while i got tired of the bug killing too. It was to much and to pointless. After the third shooting i got it: IT IS A LOT OF BUGS. So many that hand-held weapons at three meters distance is incredibly stupid. Well. Somhow the guy with the square face dies, but is patched together again. I don't really see why they couldn't use this technology on the dead army girl who is in love with square jaw, but i don't really care either. More bugs get killed. Denise has trouble in her spaceship and has to be saved. La-la-la. I can't really remember at what point i stopped watching. The movie ended up as background noise and picture while doing other things.When reading all the other reviews i am stunned by the praise for this movie, and people saying it's a satire or parody. It's just not good enough to be either. I can see some of the points, the news-clips is kind of funny and satirical, but that's about it. Most of all its a boring movie. And complaining about to much blood and gore and to much nudity... Well. Honestly. The sex-scene was incredibly boring, and the shower thing was different, but hardly provoking. The blood and body parts. Green and red slime doesn't really scare me after having seen more than one action movie. You had to know you were not about to watch My little pony. All in all: Forgettable. But i wouldn't be surprised if i saw it again if i stumbled over it on TV and there was nothing else on. Gives you space to think about anything else. Like elevator music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Totalitarian human society fights a total war with huge alien intelligent bugs, what else can you ask for?Directed by Paul Verhoeven (Total Recall, Basic Instinct) this movie represents for me everything I like about Sci-Fi action movies: space travel, war, realistic cruel society, alien race. The society in the movie resembles Nazi Germany but rather mockingly: the news broadcasts look like propaganda, soldiers are sent to death without much thought. However I think that in case of a war with an alien race this is the kind of society humanity will need.This movie is based on a novel by R. Heinlein, which I recommend to read even if you've already seen the movie. The movie covers a rather small part of the book, and the book is just so much more interesting!What I didn't like is that they didn't dress the soldiers in muscle power magnifier suits with jet engines like in the novel. This raises the question why didn't they use tanks against the bugs. The novel provides an explanation: those suits are better than tanks. But anyway, for year 1998 the special effects and computer graphics look just great.Definitely one of my favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you look back at some of the best movies in the last 10 years, Starship Troopers is one of them.This is one of the first "modern day" war movies of its kind, and it dtails the career of several troopers and how in a real war you can go from a scared sh*tless private to a battle toughened lieutennant within a matter of months.The way I looked at this movie was by comparing it to world war and Vietnam scenarios such as losing friends and loved ones in an ambush and even in victory there is defeat. The plot of the movie comes on strong because this is true war, and in war you lose when you win.Character development is awesome for they build the individuals up so you either cry when they die (you know you did and you know when too, don't lie) or you cheer when they save the day. Thats how you build a strong cast, make them memorable.The CGI and special effects were wonderful and other than a few scenes, its really as good as I described. Check it out if you want something really good to watch The highlight for me was when Ace asks why learn knife throwing when you can pull a trigger and Zim embeds a knife in his hand and says you can't pull a trigger if you can't use your hand, good stuff 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a flick that's essentially straight out of the usual "war against the alien hordes" genre, this one seems to have generated some of the most interesting and insightful reviews I've seen on IMDb in a while. jamesjlr2's commentary on its simultaneous pro- and anti-war stance really hit the mark, in my opinion. One wonders if we'd pursue the slaughter of the alien hordes with the same gusto if they looked like Ewoks. Somehow I can't picture propaganda videos of children and mothers stomping on guinea pigs...Heinlein's novel Starship Troopers was essentially a glorification of combat, and made much of the whole idea of the "just" war, while Joe Haldeman's excellent "The Forever War", published around the same time, painted war as ugly, dehumanizing and ultimately pointless. Veerhoven's film, it would seem, attempts to be a little of both.</fullReview>

However, i can only name a handful of films that i enjoy on this level as much as this: 'Die Hard'... thats it actually. cus u see this is a classic in its genre, so it wasn't made in the 80's or even the 70's where action movies reached their peak, but screw that its a damn bon a fide classic. The movie is so easy to watch you'll hate yourself for picking up that copy of Ulysses and hacking your way through it whilst repeatedly looking at the glossary every two words (ok bad example) and realise that there is some trifle out there that DESERVES to be watched.

		<fullReview>Paul Verhoeven is presenting a big mirror for the American society of today. Wrenched by critics when the film opened, it is now a clear reflection of the way the American government is trying to rule the world and is trying to shove democracy down the throats of civilizations who don't fit the profile... It takes a intelligent filmmaker to use such subtlety that it was granted a theatrical release in the US. Were 'they' any smarter, they would have forbidden the film in the first place... probably.This film should be as mandatory in history class as Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the will. It is a clear warning people seem to overlook. Look past the pretty faces and hard boiled action. Look at the political statement and draw your own conclusions.Then look at a regular news broadcast of today... This man is clairvoyant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm normally not a fan of Sci-Fi movies, but because so many people have made such a fuss about this one, I really wanted to see it. OK, not everything that I heard about the movie made me look forward to it, but there were some very nice comments as well. In the end I decided that I wanted to see it for myself, in order to form my own opinion about it."Starship Troopers" is situated in the future (distant or near I don't know), where high school kids are encouraged to become citizens by joining the military instead of staying inferior civilians. Johnny Rico joins the infantry, not because he fully believes that this is the best thing to do, but because his girlfriend already has enlisted in the army and he doesn't want to leave her behind. Their training is tough, but nothing can prepare them for what they are about to witness: a full scale war with gigantic and ferocious aliens that want to destroy the human race...If this movie had been written and/or directed by a German, everybody would have called him a neo-Nazi or at least a man with fascist believes. Not only does it use the idea of the bermenschen (people who are better persons because they belong to a certain race), the military is also clearly inspired by the German fascist ideology. You can see it in the organization, but also in the uniforms. There can absolutely be no doubt where the idea for those costumes came from as it is close to identical in every detail. But the director is Dutch and the writer is an American, so no-body seems to have a problem with that anymore. Now they say that it is an excellent way of showing a totalitarian, right-wing ideology. Can someone please tell me what the difference with Nazism is then?Another thing that bothered me was that everybody in this movie seemed to be perfect Barbie dolls. Every main character in it could at least apply for the title of 'Miss or Mister Machine Gun' with the perfect toothpaste smile and bright blue eyes. Imperfection doesn't exist, they are all smart and beautiful and eager to kill everything and everybody that doesn't follow the rules of the regime.Still, I must admit that not everything about this movie was bad. The special effects for instance were very nice. I admit that I looked with a lot of interest to all those ants, dun beetles and other alien life forms which didn't have to look human for once. They all looked mean and ferocious and were in my opinion the best thing this movie had to offer. But was that enough to save the movie? Certainly not. A movie with such a bad story and mediocre acting (at best), which so heavily relies on gore and special effects to save it, certainly doesn't deserve to be called a masterpiece. I give it a rating between 4.5/10 and 5/10, only because of the magnificent special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can't believe some of the people on this site! This movie had no depth, no real characters, no wit, nothing in any way special. It may be an amusing movie, but most certainly not a good one. A bunch of angry, licentious teenagers go off on an evil, alien bug killing spree. Thats just about it. I don't remember much about the other actors but Denise Richards was wasted. If you really want to see a decent movie starring her as a decent character, watch "Wild Things". Love that movie. OK, so it's a pretty narrow-minded opinion probably, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and this is mine. I'm not suggesting anyone else on this site base their thoughts on whether or not to watch this movie on my personal opinion. If anyone even reads this, that is. Just had to get that out of my system. It's still a rather amusing movie, just not a deep, amazing, special, thought provoking masterpiece. I don't think that last sentence was written exactly as I meant it, as movies don't have to be deep, amazing, special, thought provoking masterpieces to be good always.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Virtually everything was wrong with this movie. It was so horribly messed up that I can't give a 'non-spoilers' review, but rather just highlight some of the wonderful problems I had with the movie. These are just the ones I can remember.Spoilers follow, but nothing critical to your enjoyment (or rather lack thereof) of this movie.To begin with, the premise of the aliens hitting the earth with an asteroid was a bit sketchy. I mean, that's a heck of a job for bugs to see an asteroid, calculate its orbit, and somehow launch a projectile in order to change its path with enough precision to hit a planet. Sure, earth may seem big to us people, but in, say, the volume of the solar system it is an immensely tiny speck. But, lets suspend disbelief for this. Now, conveniently, this asteroid not only hits the earth, but it hits *land* on a planet where three quarters of its surface is covered in water. Then, to top it off, it hits a MAJOR POPULATED CITY. One in which the main character also conveniently has family. Right. Very likely.Next, we have the human's approach to the bug planet in their fleet. All the ships bunch together, and they get wiped out as much by the bugs as they do from running into one another from being bunched together. Space is really big folks, spread apart so you don't kill yourselves! Anyway, this, again, is forgivable. Until they do it AGAIN, on their second attack!Now we get to the actual combat. Why, oh why, did the powers putting together this film decide to abandon the high tech machinery such as cybernetic exoskeletons from the book in favor of simple ground troops? Again, they can be forgiven for this- until they show that they DO have advanced weaponry, and don't use it to effect. They wiped out huge piles of bugs with their air strike, yet they only thought to use the air strike once. They have miniature nuclear warheads that can do massive damage yet they only bring a couple along. With the technology demonstrated in the movie, it would have been possible to annihilate the entire planet without even setting foot on the planet- just drop nuclear bombs from the ships safely in orbit!This leads up to my favorite part of the movie. There is a scene in which Pretty Young Face # 3 (Denise Richards) must pilot a battlecruiser after stereotypically showing that she's the best hotshot pilot ever. For some reason, they don't notice a giant asteroid bearing down upon them as they are traveling in the opposite direction, and a suspense-filled scene follows in which she barely turns the ship out of the way in time, and saves the day, but not before they loose their only means of warning the earth about this impending disaster. Sorry, but I have a few problems with this. First, how do you not *notice* an asteroid like that? Second, why do they loose all communications from this collision? You're telling me a vessel like this, which must survive in the vast empty environment that is space doesn't have a redundant set of antennas? Finally, the entire scene is completely impossible. Both the ship and the asteroid are traveling in OPPOSITE directions at interstellar velocities. Even if they were traveling at, say, merely the reentry velocity of a space shuttle, both would be moving at 8 km per SECOND! The asteroid would have flashed past and destroyed whatever part of the ship happened to be in the way- not the heart-stopping, nerve-wrenching slow turn more fitting of a submarine movie.The only thing in this movie that was vaguely interesting were, at the time, the advanced computer graphics. Now, there's nothing left holding it up. Well, maybe one thing. I suppose there's the shower scene for all the teenagers who aren't old enough to rent porn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Verhoeven a clairvoyant genius!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers three times:1) I first saw it in 1998 and hated it, it looked like American teen rubbish (the actors were especially bad and two dimensional).Then I read Robert A. Heinlein's classic SciFi novel (a veritable seductive fascist manifesto) which I enjoyed greatly as it rather challenged my liberal outlook on life.2) In 2000 I re-watched the film and thought it O.K but not as good as Verhoeven's previous films (I thought Total Recall Was excellent).3) In 2002 I watched it for the third time. With the perspective of the "9-11" events the film makes Verhoeven look like a clairvoyant genius.Well Done Paul.See guys it serves you right for intruding on bug space, and the Brain Bug is still at large!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denise Richards. I kept hoping she'd die in the movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are lots of people that slated this movie for a number of reasons. Either it didn't follow Heinlein's book closely enough or the tone reminded them of fascist dictatorship and Nazism. I don't think these people really understood what Verhoeven tried to do, which was to point out the inherent flaws in such systems and try to get a little amusement value out of them.The "news breaks" are classic examples of just how propaganda worked in WWII, with one side villifying the other mercilessly. The woman laughing insanely while kids stomp on cockroaches cannot be taken to be serious in any way, unless you have no sense of humour, I guess.Likewise the uniforms in the film have been likened to Nazi uniforms. But a quick look around the uniforms of eastern European countries shows many similarities with those in the film. Are they all Nazi's?Getting back to the film.It's a war film set in space. What more needs be said. And a war film done infinitely better than John Woo's recent Windtalkers. The cast are reasonably unknown (at the time), with the exception of Michael Ironside, Clancy Brown and Neil Patrick Harris. And they all give good performances.....with one notable exception.Denise Richards. I kept hoping she'd die in the movie. Her acting expressions ranged from grinning fool to cheesy grin and all the way up to Cheshire Cat grin. I began to wonder if she'd had plastic surgery that had gone awry and fixed her features in permanent "grin-mode". I hated her so much in this movie that I won't watch her in anything else (luckily she hasn't done that much else).Patrick Muldoon plays the oily Zander pretty well. If it wasn't for Denise Richards I'd probably have found him more annoying, but next to her he was fine.Clancy Brown gets to ham it up nicely as Drill Sergeant Zim and gets most of the best comic lines and scenes, especially the knife throwing scene in boot camp.Michael Ironside reprises his usual tough guy role as Ltnt Rasczak with good effect. He also gets some of the good lines "Pick up the General" and deservedly so.Jake Busey (son of Gary) also does well here.This movie is pretty darn good. It's not perfect, but it's pretty close. If only Denise Richard's character had been ripped apart by the bugs....or better yet....she wasn't in it at all, that would have made it fantastic.It's worth noting that the score, done by Basil Poledouris, is fantastic and really enhances the mood of the film, particular in the action sequences. His offspring, Zoe Poledouris, sings a song or two in the movie which is not so good and best forgotten. But Basil's work is perfect again.Recommended as a good all-round action flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is excellent entertainment. If you watch it more than once then you begin to appreciate the subtlety of it's message and the very clever way this is put accross. However, if you aren't at all interested in what it's trying to say or why Verhoeven was trying to say it then FINE !!!!!!Why do people have to analyze the thing to death and pick holes in it. I'm sure that Verhoeven is laughing at all the furore this film has provoked. I personally think that he loves being controversial and does it just to see if he can get some kind of knee-jerk outrage response from people. I like to think this was his excuse for 'Showgirls'. Basically the film is ultra-violent, the main characters have a very skewed morality and the bugs are gross. Watch and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignorance surrounds me...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been defending this film since it first came out. I can spin yarns about how witty this film is, how well thought the satire plays out, etc. But I won't. I'm going to state here, once and for all, that anyone calling Starship Troopers "silly" or "stupid", should take a course or 10 of world history, spend a few years bumping up their IQ's and then returning to the film with the capacity to analyze it. See, anybody can argue whether or not the movie is good -that's a matter of opinion. If Joe Somebody approached me and said, "hey, I didn't like it, because the satire didn't appeal to me...", then fine. They're more than entitled to feel that way. But in a world where most films wear their true meaning on their sleeves, such as Blade II (which I liked, btw), it's refreshing to see that filmmakers aren't afraid to screw with their audience, and test just how observent we truly are. Verhoeven and Neumeier constructed a brilliant political and social satire, and for the life of me, only 1 out of 10 people see that. It's a crying shame. I'm afriad to say that some people are just plain stupid. They really don't know their heads from their asses. One comment I observed reffered to the obserdity of having a cameraman in the middle of this battle with the bugs. I believe it was called "silly" or "unrealistic." My argument here will serve as a basis for my entire outlook on Starship Troopers and its effect on the general masses: The news anchor is filming a battle, caught in the midst, still reporting. Absurd? Yes. Unrealistic? HELL NO. Anybody watch those wonderful WWII documentaries on the History Channel? No? How about live reports during Desert Storm? Hrrm. I guess maybe I'm the only one here that saw this as being completely feasable given the scenario, and the tongue in cheek nature of the film (which incidentally, nobody seemed to pick up either.) This film is horribly misunderstood. It's a SATIRE, folks. A brilliant sci-fi political and social comedy. And if you don't laugh...well...get an education. And if you're already out of college, get a refund.Brian Rosenthal</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to agree with all the reviewers who pointed out all of the satirical elements in the movie. It's blindingly obvious (who really launched the asteroid, anyway?), and I'm surprised more people don't pick up on it. The genius of this film, just like Robocop, is that it combines its sharp satire with a really kick-ass action/war/sci-fi plot that has some excellent video-game style fight scenes. Maybe this is paradoxical or hypocritical, but it sure is entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capture's Heinlein's irony to the tee</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being about man-shredding insects attacking super-jock humans, this film seems to have been a bit too subtle for the average movie critic. It is a masterpiece of irony, and captures the essence of Robert Heinlein's masterful SF novel, which at the same time pays respect to those who give their lives to protect others and showcases war's futility and dehumanizing horror.In the near future, insectoid aliens and humans fight over colonizable worlds. It's not really clear who attacked whom first, one suspects the humans are the initial aggressors. You can be a citizen of Earth only if you serve a very dangerous stint in the military, protecting our home world from the insect aliens of Klendathu. The film follows four naive high school recruits (the 'hero' infantry grunt; his love interest, a space pilot; a female infantry grunt who loves him unrequited; and his friend, the skunkworks military scientist). They go through boot camp, training, and brutal warfare where the smallest mistake instantly costs you limb or life.This was one of the early digital effects movies, and they are still great to see. In fact, the effects here are physically more realistic, despite the usual space sounds and such, than most modern effects, which seem to have abandoned all laws of physics. The effects are also there for the story, not vice-versa.The humans in this film are almost as unpleasant as the aliens: oversexed, perfect smiles, walking advertisements for a fascist military dictatorship. You'd love to punch them in the face. You root for the insects when certain humans bite the dust. Perhaps that is responsible for the moderate (ca. 7) rating on IMDb. The film paradoxically manages to condemn all-out war by glorifying it because in the end you have to ask: who is nastier, we or the Klendathans?One of the minor characters proclaims, while his hacked-off legs and crippled arm come into view, "The infantry made me the man I am." He says it proudly, and captures the dichotomy of serving humanity willingly by putting his life on the line, and yet the dehumanization and horror that war bring. The contrast between individual valor and bravery vs. the squalidness of the whole military-industrial operation overall.Pride and agony. This one's one of the best war films ever made, and richly deserves several viewings. Eventually even the professional critics will get it, so this will be a classic in the year 2050.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It would appear as though some people are just stupid.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It never ceases to amaze me how one film can be so universally misunderstood. How the satire and criticism of American fascism and imperialism can be so whole-fully misinterpreted as a love letter to the far right. It would appear as though the world's collective iq lowered just for the occasion of reviewing this film.Of course this film is not a love letter to fascism, and the squeaky clean look of both the film and it's cast is In my most humble of opinions meant to appear almost Step-ford Wives like. They are supposed to appear too perfect, an eerie reflection of the brainwashed masses duped into supporting a state that is inherently against their interests. It is presented as right wing propaganda but not in a serious manner, but rather to poke fun at average Joe and his blindingly loyal attitude to his country. Perhaps the problem lay with the fact this film resonated too closely with the public and as a result they resented it for holding a magnifying glass so closely to their precious little infallible lives. Who knows? The only thing I can know for sure is that the unwashed masses are wildly incorrect with their assessment of this film, because in a word this film is great. Allow me to analyse the film just that little but simply. The essential quality a film must have in order for it to be a success is not a stellar plot, or a stellar cast, or any amount of such things. The essential quality is watch-ability. Can you watch this film and better yet can you re-watch it? Well Starship Troopers is nothing if not re- watchable. Every time I watch this film I enjoy myself, whether I watch it for it's satirical view of American politics and somewhat hilarious take on the meat grinder of war or to watch a mind blowingly awesome summer blockbuster, even as a cheesy high school romance this film holds up. It has a little bit of something for everyone, Starship Troopers fills every niche and fills it well. I can only hope that those who with negative views of this film take the time to re-watch it because they are missing one of the most fun films in decades that has allot more going for it than what is on the surface. Paul Verhoeven somewhat extracting the urine with Starship Troopers and it seems as if almost every one on the planet missed the point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few years ago a person commented here that how you liked the film depended upon whether you read the book.I read the book as an adolescent and loved it. Now I look upon Heinlein as a hack who nearly had one mature moment with "Stranger In A Strange Land" but was endlessly boring in his later works. When I was a child, I spoke as a child, yada, yada, yada.I saw the movie as an adult. The first time through I was titillated (got to make sure the kids are in the other room) by the nudity and violence but disappointed that it did not follow the sci-fi potboiler's plot line. I was also puzzled as to why Dougie Houser managed to join the SS.I bought the DVD nonetheless since it was a great comic book.Then came the Iraq War and FOX News. Suddenly the comic book started looking subversive. That will teach me to turn on the director's commentary earlier.Verhoeven has a legacy of gratuitous sex scenes which, coupled with a Peckenpah level of obligatory violence, that probably fosters a cringe or two when he thinks over his career (look no further than Showgirls).This cunning little epic is his vindication.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A second look: STARSHIP TROOPERS.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review summary: The best in acquired taste. Thrilling, bloody, funny and wildly satirical. When I first saw STARSHIP TROOPERS (due to my curiosity when I saw bits of it when I was a kid), I praised the film but didn't nearly treasure it. I praised the film's wonderful use of special effects and the action scenes which really kicks into high gear. However, I did have a lot to complain about the excessive gore and graphic violence, not to mention this film feels like it would appeal more to 9-year olds and their life-long dream of kicking aliens' butt. But when I watched STARSHIP TROOPERS again last night, I found myself not just liking it as I did, but liking it even more. My jaws almost still dropped to the ground, but like it or not, this was the kind of film Paul Verhoeven wanted to make: a broad, ultra-violent satire of old gung-ho war propaganda, fascistic military actions and other modern cultural references (not to mention promoting violence as the ultimate tool for peace!). But best of all, it's simply one big bug movie and it delivers exactly what to expect: Big bugs that really rip you apart. This may be the best bug movie ever at the time. Would you like to know more? Like most of his films, Verhoeven presses the no-shame button without even the thought of apology. Not everyone will like what he's doing, but if you know exactly what to expect from the shameless Dutch director, STARSHIP TROOPERS is an acquired taste at best. Call it a guilty pleasure, but I know no guilt on this one. It isn't great motion picture (probably not one of the very best science-fiction adventures either), but one thing about the film is that it doesn't really aim for something so high. Like STAR WARS in 1977, this film never really intended to be a "great" movie in the first place; All it wanted was to make a movie about fascist square-jawed guys and muscular babes arming themselves with rifles and staving off a menagerie of outrageous out-of-this-world alien bugs, from mindless blood-hungry arachnid warriors to giant stag beetles that set fire on anything it catches. Not to mention an ugly brain bug that sucks the brains out of human heads like a kid sipping lemonade from a straw.Other than that, cultural and political references abound including a couple of short, hilarious advertisements that encourages citizens (Pardon me, civilians!) to join the Federation army. If you remember Verhoeven's ROBOCOP, you might easily be reminded of the hilarious commercials (including one where a scheduled execution of a guilty criminal is aired live on cable) and a dark, sadistic sense of humor. Not everyone will find his films a pleasure, STARSHIP TROOPERS mostly. There's enough blood and graphic violence here to fill a bathtub (No! Make that 10 bathtubs!) of blood and corpses. The actors, including relatively unknown Casper van Dien as gung-ho hero Johnny Rico, Dina Meyer as a steamy female fighter, Denise Richards as a tenacious ship pilot, Niel Patrick Harris as an ever-watchable psychic military scientist and Michael Ironside as a hard-ass heroic commander make a fine screen presence, albeit overshadowed by the film's greater aspects. The first half is heavily devoted to these characters and, save Ironside's professional commanding presence, none of them really have any higher intention than to look good. There's a love triangle (or love square) going on between the adolescent characters that does provide some dignity among the characters though. Still, what the heck? The last thing you want a giant all-out-war against giant bugs is a soap opera.Very few errors almost never harms STARSHIP TROOPERS as a wild and wacky thrill-ride. I knew this when I first saw the film back then, but re-watching it, with all the right expectations laid on the table, I was able to truly appreciate the film for all its being. Verhoeven, with an odd taste that he might have, never took the film too seriously. Somewhere throughout the picture, you could swear Verhoeven had a silly little grin on his face every time a soldier gets sliced in half, bitten apart or has his head sliced off by his Klendathu behemoths. Like the 9-year old that probably inspired Robert A. Heinlein to right a book about Federation soldiers-vs.-alien arachnids, Verhoeven has a lot of fun with his little toys. The great thing about it is we too get to play along. STARSHIP TROOPERS has to be the best guilty pleasure since INDEPENDENCE DAY. Come on! Any movie that encourages you to do "your part" on the war against alien bugs by stepping on cockroaches with a silly grin on your face has to be fun, right? Additional Note: I misinterpreted the satire when I first saw this movie. Usually, I really don't dig in to a film's message too deeply. Anyway, I have made the necessary corrections. Rating: ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Big square jawed macho beefcakes and sexy girls face off against giant bugs from space! Doesn't sound like a film of much intelligence does it? Yet here, Starship Troopers finds director Paul Verhoeven at his satirical best, because although he is given the audience all the violence and madness it craves, he is also crafting a biting commentary full of fascist leanings and pokes in the ribs of the army mentality that urges obliteration in the name of jingoistic fervour.The story is a simple and untaxing one, Earth is at war with a bug planet called Klendathu, the youth are urged to join up for the service to rid the universe of the insect menace. We follow a group of ridiculously pretty characters thru clich ridden training camps until their respective lives hurtle towards the finale. Naturally there is a flowing love interest story, and sure enough Verhoeven milks the cheese factor for all is worth. The violence is savage, limbs are torn apart and body orifices entered in a way that nobody should ever have to suffer! Yet the violence and construction of said violence is crucial to the films heart. It's a film that the squeamish really should stay away from, but rest assured that for although it may seem violence for violence's sake at first glance, it's actually there fleshing out {no pun intended} a biting and snarky viewpoint from a very interesting director. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a near perfect satire... not to mention action and violence and fun for everyone!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Full of tongue-in-cheek clichs, dark humor, and ridiculous action, Starship Troopers is a sassy and bold film, and one that's often misunderstood. To some people, it's pure garbage, but anyone who can see it for what I perceive it as- pure satire- will love it.Starship Troopers is loosely based off a Robert Heinlein novel. I haven't read the novel, but the way I see it, the makers of Starship Troopers completely changed the entire tone of the book, adding loads of sarcasm and references to fascism.The driving force behind Starship Troopers seems to be a fascist ideal; the main character, Johnny Rico, feels pressured to join the military by the government's giving special treatment to people who enlist (such as the privilege to vote) and society and the media's glorification of military life. His parents are strongly against it, but he enlists; after all, as he puts it, he doesn't need his parents when the Federation (a governing body that seems to control the entire planet) can take care of his every need. After the obligatory but always fun boot camp scene, the rest is pure action as the Earth goes to war with a deceptively intelligent race of bugs from the other side of the universe.If you don't "get" the fascist references and the very sarcastic and satirical humor, Starship Troopers will seem like across as the worst film ever made. It definitely comes across as a bad film sometimes, but it's all purposefully done in mockery of old sci-fi shows (there's definitely some pokes at Star Trek), and in particular, war films. Starship Troopers contains many a stirring speech about patriotism that could've been lifted right out of a John Wayne film. The acting- virtually all of it, every performance- is up to 50's standards, and thus perfect for the film. While there are a lot of serious situations, a lot of the situations are still comic, in a way... it's hard to describe.Besides all the fascist mumbo jumbo, Starship Troopers gives the viewer a good time, which is what really matters. The action scenes and computer graphics are incredible, good enough for an Oscar nomination, and I'm sure it would have won the Oscar if it had been more of an "Academy-type" movie because I don't think better computer graphics had been achieved up to the time Starship Troopers came out. The film has a good story, but especially a good way of telling the story: one of its unique features is three or four short propaganda films for the Federation. They're not only hilarious and entertaining, but they're an extremely clever way of filling in background information and moving the story along.A few years ago, it seemed like there was a lot of badmouthing about Starship Troopers, how unbelievably awful it was and stuff like that. Now I guess more people get it; I'd say that it's considered a classic by the public. Some people aren't fans of sarcasm or jaw-dropping action, and those people probably can't stand this film. But I can't understand how anyone can dislike sarcasm or action, so I can't understand how anyone could not love Starship Troopers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. I guess my father isn't the only person that likes this movie after all. Though, I think comments touting this sci-fi schlock as the greatest anti/pro war movie is a bit much. Oh, and the only sentence what should include both "Starship" and "Dr. Strangelove" is: "Dr. Strangelove" is a far superior film to "Starship Troopers." "Starship Troopers" is decent in only one respect, it's a shoot 'em sci-fi film that delivers action. Nothing beyond that. The screenplay incorporated only parts of the novel, and did poorly solidifying any commentary or satire. I mean, I can see what they were getting at, but you've got to be kidding me by saying that it was done on a Kubrick level. The acting was plain BAD, and no matter what anyone says to me to try to justify said acting is useless. It wasn't tongue-in-cheek acting, they were actually trying, and trying really hard. It was also waaaay toooo looooong. It was entertaining enough for me to get through it, but barely.See it if you like action films. Give your brain two hours off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Impressive Action Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this film for the first time back in 2000, I decided that it was worth watching. I may have been only in the 7th grade at the time, but I watched it when it first premiered on national television.The action sequences and the visual effects really kept me on my chair and waited to see what happens next. Casper Van Dien, Jake Busey (this was a better role for him than being the villain of "The Frighteners"), Neil Patrick Harris, and Denise Richards really did an excellent job.Humanity is nearly lost due to the increasing threat of alien insects and it's up to brave soldiers to put an end to it. Overall the film is director Paul Verhoeven's best work!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah. Paul Verhoeven, the wonderfully subversive director of 'Robocop' has yet again mocked our sensibilities with 'Starship Troopers.' Where in 'Robocop' Verhoeven satirized technological dehumanization and corporate fascism, 'Starship Troopers' satirizes world fascism and militarism. Verhoeven has taken the militaristic gung ho of 'Star Wars' and 'Aliens' and turned it on its ears, creating what is easily one of the goriest action adventure movies ever made, all the while lampooning the foolishness of it all.After a bloody opening battle sequence on a faraway planet, 'Starship Troopers' flashes back to Buenos Aires, Argentina, to reveal how our heroes and heroines were suckered into their future military roles. Somehow, this seems appropriate, since the 'world federation' presented resembles NAZI Germany, right down to the uniforms and it's alleged many Nazis escaped to Argentina. Later, after a 'sneak' attack on Buenos Aires by the giant insects, vengeful humans stage a disastrous attack on the 'bug' planet. Director Verhoeven and writer Edward Neumeier brilliantly deliver the truth in a throwaway leading question by a reporter, that humans actually caused the aggression by invading planets already colonized by the bugs. This kind of misguided adventurism goes back in America at least as far as the French and Indian War. Nonetheless, it pretty much applies to one side or the other in every war in our history, including our present misguided operations in the Middle East. Verhoeven initially presents this in a kind of amalgam of World War II propaganda movies, Aaron Spelling soap operas and practically anything presently shown on the WB During the battle scenes, however, Verhoeven grosses us out with disembowelments, decapitations, burning alive and enormous puncture wounds during the mostly one-sided battles, with the bugs usually coming out on top. Ironically, the bugs are presented with superior battle technology, the result of adaptation, while the humans are pretty much stuck with 20th and 21st Century technology. After all, why would a civilization possessing starships be using bullets and not lasers? The most awesome weapon presented is nothing more than a mini nuke, such as the kind being presently proposed by the Bush administration. I believe Verhoeven was doing more here than cribbing from Jim Cameron's 'Aliens'. Besides making a wry allusion that the bugs may be in some ways to humans, Verhoeven was thematically commenting on the devaluation of human life. The federation was not providing leading edge weapons, armor or adequate air cover, because they really didn't care that much about individual soldiers. This should be pretty obvious by the bootcamp abuse, including Rico's "administrative punishment". 'Starship Troopers' were just so much cannon fodder. This is also implied in the sacrifice of Buenos Aires. After the starship is hit by the 'bug asteroid,' the ship's captain communicates that earth should be warn the asteroid is 'coming their way.' However, Rico's parents in Buenos Aires are not aware they are about to be hit, as this is made clear during his conversation to him by picture phone. Sounds like a 'communications failure' (Gee, where did we hear THAT before). The planets where troopers fight insects look like the middle of the Mojave Desert; in other words, uninhabitable for most humans, certainly not worth dieing for. The only things keeping 'Starship Troopers' from being totally realistic is the absence of Coke machines and Halliburton cheating the government.'Starship Troopers' is the 'bad boy' among science fiction war movies. It's a great antidote for the syrupy romanticism of 'Star Wars'. It has better than average special effects, music, color and action. Performances are not nearly as bad as you've heard, particularly given Verhoeven's intent. You'll discover this if you watch the deleted scenes; they create a more intimate relationship between Carmen and Rico. Including these scenes would have made us care more about the characters, but I don't think that's what Verhoeven had in mind. One piece of advice: save your snacks for after the movie. You've been warned. I give 'Starship Troopers' an '8'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hmmm.... An army full of Perfect little Boys and Girls. Makes one wonder if they were genetically engineered by the Aaron Spelling Mannequin Factory. Judging by the way they fight, its obvious they were manufactured for their perfect looks... and nothing else.This rates as one of the worst movies I have EVER seen. Acting was non-existent, situations were ridiculous, and the plot was as thin as air in space. The holes in the plot were as big as Moon-sized asteroid chunks.1) Main characters. Duh! I did not care whether they lived or died! Why didn't the bugs get the chance to eat the entire cast? Not one of the characters had a slightly likeable personality, acting was wooden and stilted. Just check out Denise Richards' acting ability. Her acting is about as good as mine. And my acting is ATROCIOUS!!!2)Battle tactics on planet. Shooting at run-away cranes on multiple legs with pathetic little guns is bound to have little to no effect. Shooting at bugs the size of houses with pathetic little guns is ALSO bound to have little to no effect.3) Do keep all your battle ships in a tight cluster while bug fart bombs bombard you - then wonder 'but why are we being shot down for? It's just bug fart gas! Besides, Denise Richards is at the helm!'4) Bugs firing an asteroid across the galaxy to earth - and nobody tries - or bothers - to stop the thing before it hits Aaron Spelling's Mannequin Factory. Hey, maybe that was a good thing after all!!!5) Boot camp. Oh puh-lease. Need I say more?We could go on and on, but I would be simply giving away the droll and dreary plot line of this miserable excuse for an action film. So if you haven't already seen this, I apologize for the above spoilers!MY CONCLUSION? A complete waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers. What can I say. This movie was more terrible than could be imagined. The violence is non-stop. Humans are just shrieking paper bags of blood that are stronger than strong, but somehow could have their arms broken off by a 2-year-old. The plot is non evident, the characters do nothing but scream, scream some more, and scream even more. Did I mention that they scream? And couldn't this whole mess be avoided if they had taken out the planet with some kind of missile? If this is the future of mankind, count me out.The "aliens" are no better. The skittering and deadly "bugs" that roam a planet similar to Arizona are constantly picking off wailing humans. Some bugs are like ants with a few extra limbs, some are giant beetles that fart blue fire, some are slow and massive capsules of mucus. It's an exterminator's nightmare.Even the way that the movie progresses defies logic. At some points, a toolbar pops up and various information (that is often irrelevant to the "plot") is given. Soon we return to another viewpoint. And then another. And another. This movie can't decide if it's a TV show or a security camera.The line that marked the point where I gave up on this movie is "They sucked his brains out." I guess he was talking about the audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie not long after it came out in the stores, because I had heard good things about it. I truly wish that I hadn't, because this movie was perhaps the absolute worst that I have ever seen (and I watch a lot of movies...including What Dreams May Come and Jackie Brown).The cast that "starred" in this film seemed to have little-to-no acting ability whatsoever, in addition to the fact that the film was directed/shot/etc. in a very MTV-esque fashion (which is not a good thing, in my opinion). The dialogue was cliche and uninteresting...the nudity was superfluous and did almost nothing to further the plot, storyline, or anything besides the actresses' porn careers.The worst part of the entire film would have to be the gratuitous, senseless, pointless, protracted scenes of very graphic CGI violence. This movie just killed people off constantly, until there are literally only about two people left. But despite the protestations to the contrary, it does not do so in a way that is a satire about violence or war; to do that would require some technique, subtlety, storyline, or character development. None of that is present in this movie (and good ol' Heinlein's book isn't that much better), and the film degenerates into a pure action film because of it.Well, I use action in the loosest sense of the word, because it still stinks in comparison to a movie like Lethal Weapon 4.I found the movie to be absurdly long -- long enough that I was almost bored to tears before the end of it. However, it was too bad to stop watching it -- the true sign of a horrible movie.Bottom line: Worst movie ever (?).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Verhoven's heavy-handed style is only good for some things, but this was one such thing.With this film he finished saying what he started to say with RoboCop. All the manifold little digs at right-wing laissez faire capitalism and how closely it resembles stalinist communism. The buy-in from the peons who are sure they are on the winning team.A myth persists that this film started off as a serious enterprise, then gradually got pared back into satire - as though it were actually possible to make a film this way. Oh well, some people really are that gullible it seems.No, this film was conceived from the ground up as the most biting kind of satire. And it's fairly obvious that Verhoven shares my view of Robert Heinlein's writings (similarly, Oliver Stone shares my view of Jim Morrison and the Doors).It must be pointed out that Heinlein's book is not as 'bad' as this film - the humans of the book are marginally more likable and marginally more sensible. But I still rooted for the bugs - and in this film, you are quite clearly meant to.Visually it also knocks you over the head with Verhoven's naive use of primary colours, and it was a film that pushed CG to the limits too - and for once it paid off. The critters be amazing.GO THE BUG!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the time it came out I seemed to be the only one in my closer environment who actually detested this movie for its gruesome use of Nazi imagery and violence. Everyone seemed to embrace the idea that it was a satire, that Verhoeven was not to be questioned for his political ambitions (or at least naivety) and the films graphic depiction of violence could thus be enjoyed without remorse (something that has actually become en vogue among many since "Pulp Fiction": Laughing about violence in the theaters no matter what context the violence takes place in.).Having seen it again now, I must say my view hasn't changed a bit. The irony is aimed at, but to me it just doesn't work. I'm still quite sure that this sorry effort is highly popular among skinheads and other right wing dumb nuts and it is disconcerting to see that so many people still seem to acknowledge this as a clever satire.To me, the irony wears thin and only hardly covers the immature joy that Mr. Verhoeven obviously had in fumbling around with Riefenstahl-imagery he could not control but solely copy and illustrations of gore that can almost be called violence-pornography.To be avoided.</fullReview>

This could be the perfect first R rating outing for any 17 year old male.The story is about a group of young hopefuls trying out their future by joining with the Federal Armed Servies. This isn't any war, this war is against the Arachnid Bugs of Klendathu. They come in all shapes and sizes from flying bugs to gigantic lava spewing behemoths. The Earthlings are coming to Klendathu and the Bugs are ready! First off, this movie is pure popcorn movie awesomeness. It's one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen, with awesome battles, great special effects and a great story. With these attributes it gives Starship Troopers incredible replay value.

		<fullReview>I just read part of one comment in which the user, obviously not familiar with irony or subtlety, spends the better part of his comment telling us how impossible it is for a meteor to get halfway across the galaxy to hit a planet. We know this. That's the point. How ironic that a mere few years later, a similar disastrous event would prompt similar finger-pointing. It is hard not to see Ed Neumeier as a prophet after George Dubya hit Afghanistan with everything he had, ignoring the people who asked why he did so when the Bin Laden family is mostly in Saudi Arabia.You can stop reading now if you want to keep the story a surprise.But apparently, the media's ability to make people blame the wrong people for a heinous attack (or possible natural disaster as the case may be in this film) is not the only thing Americans don't get. Carmen gets a thorough vilification from audiences just for having the nerve to make a choice. Through connection, when Dizzy Flores dies, it is often said that the wrong girl died. Well yeah, that's war, friends. The wrong people die all the time in war.However, I don't necessarily feel that the film reaches the same dizzy heights as RoboCop did. All the right elements were in place, but there was something lacking in StarShip Troopers. Part of it is the money quotient. On RoboCop, money was very tight, and a lot of problems had to be solved creatively rather than by washing them away with the money hose. On StarShip Troopers, the money flowed freely, allowing the crew to throw in all the effects shots they wanted. Unlike some recent science fiction films I won't mention here, they didn't totally rely on the effects to carry the film.However, the story is simply too straightforward in structure to stand out. Contrasted with RoboCop or Total Recall, it just doesn't involve the higher processes of the brain at all. Whereas Total Recall managed to surprise the viewer in spite of the plot being given away well in advance by two distinct characters, StarShip Troopers has no real surprises, or even turns. It is literally a straight line from beginning to end. Given that the story is so linear, I think it says a lot about American audiences that they still didn't get that this was a satire.I've also read a previous comment that the film is a failure because it doesn't go out of its way to let the audience know it is a satire. I sure hope I never have that guy doing my taxes or editing my work. Like This Is Spinal Tap, one of the principal joys of StarShip Troopers is that it rewards the intelligent viewer by letting them work out that it is satire on their own. This is a primary ingredient in all of the best satires. At some point, the light goes on in the viewer's mind and they feel good about themselves because they didn't need any help to work out that it shouldn't be taken at face value. That is, of course, unless they're too stupid, or too Americanised.In all, I gave StarShip Troopers a 10. That is a score that any film which cons an audience into thinking a man like Paul Verhoeven would make a Nazi propaganda film deserves.</fullReview>

I love seeing things being blown up and being blown up real good. But I also like story, characters I give a hoot about, I like good pacing, direction not a lot of plot holes and decent special effects. At points you can see where the filmmakers went to other popular sci-fi films to help them out of their mess. They DIDN'T need to! That's why this film is awful, that's why it doesn't work.This film is bad on so many levels. Not "Manos, Hands of Fate" bad...but bad because here you have SO much going for it and it fails miserably on everything its trying to get across. Even at blowing things up..and blowing them up real good.Pass on this unless you're severely bed ridden and all other sci-fi films ever made in the United States, Europe, Russia, Australia, Africa, South America, Antarctica, and Asia you've seen at least twenty times before.

Not only by the terrible adaptation, but also by the change of technology. I really looked forward to seeing a power suit in action. Since they made no effort to make the plot anything like the book, why couldn't they spend some time on the awesome technology? What's the real difference between the landings in "Starship Troopers" and the landing on the beach at the beginning of "Saving Private Ryan"? None! It's just soldiers, gripping their rifles and storming out of the vessel, screaming. In the book it's a very different thing. I know that Rico (in the book) at one point notes that infantry has been the same forever. But he also notes that technology has changed. Which it hasn't in the movie!</fullReview>

This movie is unbelievably lunkheaded, rife with insipid dialogue, a kindergarten worldview - does anyone out there still believe that it isn't morally bankrupt to revel in glorifying war? - and an incredibly annoying cast of the worst scenery-chewers from the ranks of Young Hollywood. And the special effects rank with 'Battlestar Gallactica."As bad, offensive movies go, this is even worse than being subjected to the 'The Replacements' on a long-distance bus trip. At least here I had the option of slipping out for some air, thus relieving me of having to watch the final 40 minutes or so... nevertheless, when I meet my Maker, I expect to be sent to Purgatory to make up for the ~85 minutes I spent watching this... ah, maybe I'm just bitter because Denise Richards is in this movie, but ISN'T in the totally gratuitous coed shower scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film fails on every level, with the exception of its superior special effects. Not unusual, as Hollywood cannot handle Heinlein's material. What's wrong with "Starship Troopers"? Intermittent, unsuccessful attempts at farce. Empty-headed, inept lead "actors". Too much gratuitous gore.I somehow managed to watch every painful minute at this lame attempt at sci-fi, hoping it might get better at some point. I have seen over 2,000 films on the big screen. This was the first time I actually booed during the end credits, with many of nearby audience members commenting in agreement. This is a film for juveniles, who do not know what good sci-fi films are.Instead of "Starship Troopers", why not try the much better "Fifth Element"? Great special effects and art direction, fun cast, fun film! Since you no doubt have already seen "Star Wars-The Phantom Menace," you now know what a big piece of crapola "Starship Troopers" is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can a director manage to make a movie with such a high budget look so cheap? I'll admit that I didn't see it in the theatre, but seeing _Starship Troopers_ on TV made it look so clunky, so stupid, and so, well, bad, that I feel grateful that I didn't waste any money by going to see it. The costumes made it look as if it was made for TV (or at least filmed in Toronto). Futuristic? My ass! This movie isn't even two years old - and it already looks dated! I actually found it somewhat disturbing how Aryan a lot of the actors looked. It seemed almost like Nazi Propaganda for the future. Is this the message Verhoeven was trying to get across? I hope not. This offensive, poorly-made, downright cheesy movie should be avoided at all cost. Pick up something good instead, like Rushmore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Books get mangled in movies. It's a fact of life. There are so many examples of this, it's not necessary to name them.But was it necessary to mangle THIS book, which wouldn't have been too difficult to adapt to a movie? Remove a LITTLE blood and guts, a LITTLE nudity, and put in some genuine character development and social commentary. The book was a classic; the movie, a charlatan.The actual movie is in loyal to the book in plot summary, but not in the important details. Sex plays far to large a role, the weapons of the humans and bugs are wrong (in the book, bugs used projectile-style guns as well, and humans wore tremendously fascinating body armor), social commentary is made in to some sort of snide plot device, and the actors are WAY too attractive (any HUMAN society would use them as models, prostitutes, or actors in teen-exploitation movies, in that order).The basic plot is the same: young people, after intense training that rips away their innocence, are sent to battle giant insects that for some reason are hostile. Caspar Van Dien plays the principal actor, which I suppose is an insult to anyone else of that profession. Dina Meyer and Denise Richards are his two love interests (in the book, he really had none); they've got great bodies, that's all you need to know plot-wise.The movie definitely has a facist aspect, as human society is controlled by a massive political system that borders on military dictatorship, but this, as with so much else, is a mangling of the book. The movie almost seems to promote the repressive political system.If you've got $5.95 to blow on one or the other, definitely spring for the book; it'll last longer than 3 days, and actually conveys one of the best sci-fi writer's ideas intact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RAH mst still be rolling in his grave after this hack job.I was hoping that an RAH novel would get decent treatment at the hands of a director that is, by and large, good at his job (witness Robocop and Total Recall and forget Showgirls).Unfortunately I was sadly mistaken. This movie bares little relationship to the book except the title and the characters names. It was turned into a unhappy mix of soap opera and gungho Marine recruitment advert (begging the question: just how much did the military pay PV for this thing).Gone are the power armour suits, the other battles that the Troopers are involved in, the training in different conditions, the different casts in Bug society. In comes a needless love story, brain sucking aliens and more blood and gore than a slasher flick.We have seen it before in Hollywood's sojourns into Science Fiction books. For example, take the movie War of the World (and bury it in the middle of a volcano PLEASE!), Dune and, more recently, another one of RAH's books, Puppet Masters.I was left feeling nothing for the characters that had much appeal in the book. The movie characters reminded me of cardboard cutouts, no matter how tasty they look (Denise Richards being a case in point). The trite ending left me cold. Another "kick their ass to hell and no more problems" ending that seems to permeate movies, even when the story says otherwise.Unfortunately Hollywood seems to be relying on special effects to pull people into a theatre now rather than a coherent storyline and characters you can feel something for other than a twitch in the groin.If I had been involved in the production of the movie, my name would have been replaced by the venerable Alan Smithee. Thankfully I wasn't involved.Rest in peace Robert. One day Hollywood may someday come out of it's cranial -rectal inversion and do a decent movie treatment of one of your books but I am not holding my breath.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a disappointing gore fest. Yes, the book by Robert Heinlein's contained imaginative battle scenes, but the storyline had philosophical commentary on an alien world of the future. By alien, I mean the human world. Only people who served in the military could vote, for example. We learn that Johnny Rico's father has never voted and doesn't consider it important(does that seem familiar?).We learn about a society where the parents of naughty children are whipped alongside the children.We learn a little about the world of a soldier and the hard training of boot camp (a few ant bites should never bother a soldier). We also learn about the camaraderie of soldiers and how it leads to a better fighting team.The movie contains none of this. We get bugs, blood and gore.If you're a fan of the book, watch the special edition of "Aliens" (James Cameron read "Starship Troopers" before producing this movie). IMDb provides a trivia post -- it states that actors playing Colonial Marines had to read the book (research).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is set far in the future where our precious Earth is threatened by a race of giant ugly alien bugs. Therefore, we call upon our heroic young men and women of the mobile infantry to fly out into the vastness of space, wipe these aliens nasties out of existence and return triumphant.That was the plot and the plan rolled into one.You could be thinking that's it's just another mindless action film where annoyingly attractive men and women (who should really be models than soldiers) shoot swarms of CGI monsters. And it is. Only it is and it isn't. Yes, there are plenty of breath-taking action scenes where the computer effects actually work and it really does look like the monsters are there.However, although Starship Troopers likes to come across as just another shoot-em-up film, it does have - believe it or not - some deeper meaning. It pokes fun at the media, propaganda and even allows us to catch a glimpse of a 'utopian' future which is only one step away from fascist (check out the eerily similar Nazi uniforms the officers wear).If you liked Robocop and the way it almost threw in some tongue in cheek social and political commentary with mindless action, then you should like this. And, if you're like me, you'll be repeating the slogans from the film for days to come... They'll keep fighting... and they'll WIN!!!</fullReview>

For those who wrote about this movie being something of a satire or commentary on our current society, all I can say is really? Most good movies strive to provide some kind ou social commentary, weaving it into some recognizable dialog and...a story that at least makes you think. SST had none of that, instead using massive cgi to draw in the game boy crowd. Obviously it worked, with the high ratings far surpassing the lower ones. It demonstrates our society alright, feed em blood and gore, spend the majority of production cost on CGI and you hav the young crowd breaking down the doors to see it...sad really, for a social commentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>4 star grade B SF flick - ZERO star adaptation of the novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starship Troopers would be a typical grade-B SF flick if it DIDN'T attempt to claim the mantle of Starship Troopers by Robert A. Heinlein. Weak script, lots of action, little thinking, and superb special effects. If the movie had been titled "The Bug War", or "Spaceship Troopers", I would have given it four stars. Not an utter waste of two hours of my life, but definitely not worth the money unless you managed to snag a free Redbox rental.The problem is this movie perverts the original author's intent. I've seen poor screen adaptations, but this is different. They actually quote scenes from the novel in a way that utterly warps what Heinlein intended. Instead these scenes are a deliberate a send-up of novel and show how a clever director and script writer(s) can utterly twist the original author's intent. This was done deliberately, as the message of the movie, which is a send-up of jingoism and right wing propaganda, is the opposite of what the novel is about.Starship Troopers is an excellent book, which actually examines war and violence, military virtues, and responsibility. There is a right wing element to it, though anyone who believes it is fascist does not understand fascism. The movie instead makes a parody of all these major themes of the actual story. Those of us who grew up reading Heinlein hope that people will be motivated to read the book, it is classic SF for a very good reason. We don't want people to mistakenly think the movie is at all related to the book.Read the story, compare it to the movie, and you will see what I mean. Just imagine what Harry Potter fans would say if Voldemort was portrayed as an antihero, Dumbledore an ineffectual boob, and Harry an egotistical little snot. Oh, and let's remove Quidditch entirely since we don't like sports for our wizards (i.e. no power armor). You couldn't even make a post about the movie, anywhere, without being flamed to death. That is why people loyal to the novel post about the movie. That is why I am writing this review, to warn anyone watching the movie to please give the novel a chance. The novel is vastly superior, very nuanced if you read it thoughtfully, but yet it can be read as a light action novel, if that fits your mood. The novel is what GOOD writing is all about.</fullReview>

Some, or most, viewers, might be offended by the fact that all the characters we follow are happily growing in a society governed by this kind of totalitarian ideology. I'd say those viewers are forgetting an obvious mitigating factor : the bugs. Do you think a happy-go-lucky bohemian democracy could produce troops eager to kill those myriads of bugs ? No, you kill bugs you are happy. Simple. Yet, the movie can be a drag to watch. It's still a standard sci/fi-action affair regardless of your affections to Heinlein phylosophy and the fact the director treats the material with a sardonic smile ( most of the dialogs sounded intentionally corny to me ) don't help much.

But American culture seems to have regressed to some sort of neo-McCarthyist fascism, so it's also a bit like the 1950's.The plot follows a group of graduates who sign up for national service. Humanity is expanding across the galaxy, but our expansion has been inhibited by an insectiod alien race, the Arachnids. When the bugs get too aggressive, it's all-out war. Action scenes ensue, and it becomes clear where Blizzard's inspiration for 'Starcraft' came from.There is a lot of violence and blood and stuff. There's an awesome drill sergeant called Sergeant Zim (Clancy Brown) who keeps maiming his troops as a means of emphasis. He is an utterly reprehensible character, but we all love him. Well, I do.The main crux of the film, however, is whiz-bang action. And as whiz-bang action films go, 'Starship Troopers' is put together just a little better than a lot of other films in the genre. There are nice little touches that make its world a little more complete - it is mentioned once, and once only, that a licence is required to have children (and considering the job some parents do I'm not sure this isn't a bad idea). The whole film is peppered with propaganda newsreels, telling everyone how wonderful military service is. It certainly sets the nationalist mood.There are also a few plot holes. For example, the Arachnids live in a system on the other side of the Milky Way, and fire asteroids at Earth. That's about 30,000 parsecs away. Which means that the asteroids would take several million years to reach Earth. So how does that work? Have the bugs been firing asteroids at Earth for the past 20,000,000 years (so we've got another 20,000,000 years of bombardment to look forward to), or do the Arachnids fire the asteroids through a wormhole or something? It's never explained.So, 'Starship Troopers' is crap, plain and simple. But it's such wonderful crap. It's an enjoyable romp that won't challenge you in any way. So if you're after a deep, thought-provoking film, look elsewhere. However, if you're still in touch with your inner 14-year-old, or if you are a 14-year-old, it's a blast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't tell if the director missed to point or satyrized it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Heinlein's masterpieces, Starship Troopers was a complex novel that focused on the morality of violence and militarism. In the novel the society was democratic and free to the core, but only ex-servicemen could vote. The mobile infantry and military were dedicated, professional, and absurdly moralistic. The book made you think hard about when it is and is not okay to use violence.The movie is only tangentially related to the book. Sure the names are the same, and so is the general story arc. But everything from Rico's character, to Zim, to the MI was twisted and distorted. (MI in the novel had massive powered armor and could move kilometers in a single jump) It's hard to tell if the director either totally missed the point of the novel or understood it so completely he decided to parody it. Based on how little the movie seemed to focus on the inherent morality of violence and militarism, and instead chose to just parody it, it seems like he missed the idea.Still an enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superficial sci-fi action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie with a high expectation, for Paul Verhoeven was one of my favorite directors. I like the likes of Total Recall, Robocop. They were all my favorite action movies. I heard this movie was directed by Paul, so I decided to give it a try. This movie was not bad as most of the critics said, my vote is 6 out of 10.The Special Effects in this movie was terrific, it should have won an Oscar for that. The scene showing all the spaceships flying around was incredible, and I also wondered how they did the landing scene on Klendathu with millions of soldiers scattering all over the place was also amazing. Lots of explosions, guns, spaceships, you name it. This movie is definitely a must-see for every action-lover. The only complaint was that the weapons were less advanced than I thought it would be. Why did they use huge automatic weapons instead of ray guns. And where were the artillery, planes or even tanks. I think the commander was disqualified to send a bunch of mindless soldiers to their deaths. If he wanted to reduce casualties, he could just send planes to bomb the hell out of them.The violence was on par with Saving Private Ryan. However, the cheesy characters couldn't get our sympathizes. Seeing bunch of soldiers getting decapitated, dismembered and incinerated, I laughed out loudly for their idiocies.The plot was mediocre. But what do you expect? Is it always the same thing for those human-vs-aliens movies. Independence Day, Mars Attacks, Stargate, you name it. The acting was cheesy as hell. I hated every single character in this movie except Sergeant Zim, he was kinda a flesh-and-blood sergeant. And Clancy Brown delivered his best performance since the Shawshank Redemption. Others like Caper Van Dien, Dina Meyer, and of course, the most despicable actress: Denise Richards. She couldn't act, please stop hiring her. Anyway, if you're looking for a more substantial action movie, go watch Terminator and Robocop instead. This was definitely enjoyable. Rated R for Strong Sci-fi Violence and language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently borrowed starship troopers off a friend and sat in and watched it. I'd didn't know much about it but decided i'd give it a try.So i watched it and it was probably one of the best sci-fi's since star wars or blade runner.The film is about the humans in a war against massive bugs which is quite different than you everyday sci-fi.The film shows the battle scenes against the bugs and a lot of human and alien gore which is always good. The best performance was from clancy brown as the bad-ass sargent.The movie will hopefully be remembered as one of the best sci-fi's in history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie a reflection and blown up version of America today (or at least ten years ago). But if one looks at "The war on Terror" and how its being televised, Verhoeven wasn't that far from the truth with starship troopers. It is of course a movie and the cheesiness and super-handsome actors were there on PURPOSE! Its called sarcasm. Think about it. I loved this movie and I love its genre. The only thing that put me off was the guns. Stupid old-fashioned guns WTF! I'd say they would have better weapons in the future. Still, I almost never see movies twice or more. This one i saw 4 times and still loved it. That is the hallmark of a good movie! 8 out of 10 is definitely its value. Not an epic movie, but a good one nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not as good as Heinlein's book, however, it did manage to convey some of the same messages as Heinlein did.The film shows a society where full citizenship can only be granted by serving your country. While controversial it is interesting how many antiwar liberals say this today when talking about the Iraq war. When Michael Moore falsely said in his lying propaganda movie Fahrenheit 9-11 that no member of Congress sent their kids to be sacrificed in Iraq ( which was not true like a lot of things Michael Moore said) he was implying that only people who were in the military should have a vote.Yet these same peacenik, hippie, liberals don't like the military.The film also makes the point that it is a lie to say war doesn't solve anything. It shows how some are willing to make sacrifices for others and how those in the military know the difference between accepting the responsibilities for the welfare of society and those like Johnnie's parents enjoy the wine and cheese while letting others do the heavy lifting.The only criticisms is that too much of the violence was gratuitive as were the nude scenes. If you can't sell a movie without sex and violence then maybe they shouldn't make movies. Personally I think this movie could have been made without the violence and sex. It was an excellent novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average Sci-Fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Starship Troopers the first time with my friends in the theaters when it came out. Then I decided to buy it on DVD because of the great special effects of the insects and the combats. But after I watched it again and again I have to admit that the bum-bum on the insects until they have been killed bored me more and more. You know what I mean? The cinematography was very fine but the running time therefore was too long. Especially the first half was too slow paced with love stories. I think they wanted just present one by one the main characters of this average sci-fi. The story is empty without any emotions and it works perhaps more for teenagers. I have a great suspect that this one was promoted by the US army. If you enjoyed it you may like the better adventure movie THE MUMMY or EIGHT LEGGED FREAKS with similar special effects. Rating: 4/10. Too overrated on this site.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangely pointless action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is quite an extraordinary film. From the outset it seems to be satirising something: the sci-fi action genre, the B-movie ? even the infomercial. This is largely because of the knowing humour that has replaced the shallow earnest of those (Aliens? Pitch Black?) its could be sending up. But it quickly becomes apparent that the genre is not the target: rather Verhoven has cherry-picked generic elements of these films. Combining them with set-piece homage (a genre-relation) he seems to be off in search of more abstract targets for his satire.The problem with the film is that nothing emerges as the uncontested butt of the joke. Verhoven, in a DVD commentary almost as confused as this intention, reveals political intent (etc. but this is a film comment, not a comment comment). I don't think an animal rights target holds up, even when transmuted into racism.The frustration I'm outlining here is made worse by the slick competence of the rest of the film, despite its necessary 2-dimensions. You expect it to have a point. I say watch it with a lot of friends in a full theatre and preferably after a couple of drinks. Too many. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb space action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the future. Americans live in Beunos Aeris, Argentina, and are currently under a rule: to live, have babies, etc. you must be a citizen. And in order to be a citizen, you need to be a member of the federation (i.e. signing up for military combat) and, apparently, that is the way for Johnny Rico.He's cool, confident and envied- he's got the money, the girl and the friend qualities to make him irresistible. His parents insist on him going to Harvard, but he insists in the total other direction- in other words, having his hormones get the better of him by following beautiful girlfriend (Denise Richards) out into space. It's a daring move, and not one soon forgotten.Straight to the facts- categorically speaking, this movie is not excellently great or well done (like Star Wars) but it is simply irresistible. The acting and script are clunky, and it has the feel of a nothing space TV show. But it is hugely likable and enjoyable, and as soon as they get booted off into space, everything picks up a notch, in some cases in rather gory and graphic detail.The relationship between Dizzy and Rico may be rather unnecessary and short lived, but that can easily be forgiven; as soon as the bugs and the guns come out, you won't really care. A note, however: why are these armies, in such futuristic times, with colonies in space, resorting to hand-to-hand combat with only world war II weapons to fight with? As said before, though, it can be forgiven. The action sequences are nothing short of awesome, and the rare nudity tends to spice up this picture, though that is not really necessary. I cannot think of a better book to film adaptation. Offering both interesting political questions and stunningly lively space combat, Starship Troopers is one not to be missed.***/ out of **** (3 and a half out of 4)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie should've been called "Bug Invasion" or "Jumbo Arachnaphobia" or some other "B" movie title so that people would know before-hand that-that is what they are watching.I will concede that not much if anything in this movie is realistic, nor is it supposed to be. But is that an excuse for the horrendous acting, the almost laughable blood, guts, and gore, and a military that is actually worse in the future than it is today.If this was supposed to be a comedy I sure was getting mixed signals. One moment the movie is serious, and the next moment they do something absolutely asinine, e.g. shooting your partners brains out during training, turning your back on the enemy, celebrating unnecessarily during combat, sending a couple of thousand troops after millions of overgrown bugs, etc.The movie would have been better off going the comedic route instead of the semi-serious route it took. It was just one ridiculous event after another sandwiched between corny dialog and lackadaisacal attempts to make it all believable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was through about the first 10 minutes of the movie I thought "hey this is gonna be good". It seemed like a modern version of "Brave new world" and the super-Technicolor imaging of the protagonists with all this perfect world around was a rather close projection of how I would imagine one possible future. The longer it went though, the more the story got flat and in the end the director seemed to have lost track of what he originally wanted to make clear. After all it was a good idea but the energy or will to make a really ironical or cynical movie gave way to the possibility of getting a blockbuster that must not be to ironical or the average consumer wouldn't understand it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read Heinlein's novella years ago and thought it was a pleasing yeoman piece of work with good cinematic elements, though certainly not Heinlein's best.What's bad? the acting! As Dorothy Parker once commented about an actress "She runs the gamut of emotions from A to B." Double ditto here! The twisted storyline and perpetually immature characters make a hash out of Heinlein's simple story. The unresisting imbecility of thinking that a fascist society could be technologically advanced. (Heinlein would be with me on this one.)What's good? Great special effects and battle scenes. Casper Van Dien's derriere.If you want the spirit of the Heinlein story of Space Grunts battling evil bugs see James Cameron's "Aliens." At least in that movie you actually care what happens to the characters. In "Starship Troopers" you could care less--but not much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this film. Not bad. Typical Verhoven. Too bad he didn't read the book. The movie IS based on the Starship Troopers book. While it follows the book loosely (and I mean LOOSELY) it changes far too much to be enjoyable to anyone who's READ the book. Most of the technological aspects of the book are cut out, so are the moral and emotional issues our hero has to face. Too much of it centers around the gung ho guts and glory aspect, which the book never really follows.Campy acting, reasonable special effects and lots of violence make this a decent film for fans of movies like the Texas Chainsaw, but if you're hoping to see the book made flesh, you're in for a huge disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Spoilers***Starship Troopers works on multiple levels. On the most obvious, it's an ultra-violent science fiction war film, technically competent even as it brims over with soap opera actors and B grade cliches. Many viewers seem to miss the obvious satire and enjoy the film on this level. I agree that Starship Troopers is like a World War II movie - but many people don't see that it is being told from the Nazi point of view!Verhoeven has subverted Heinlein's original story. He piles on the satire and pokes fun at the militaristic fascist society with their relentless propaganda, not to mention the incompetent military who send fresh teenage recruits up against swarming hordes of lethal Bugs. This is par for the course, with previous Verhoeven films running in a similar vein.Beyond the obvious satire, there is a subtext in the film that in fact the humans started the war against the Bugs. We are told the first bug conflict was with renegade Mormon settlers who attempted to colonise the Bug homeworld. The Bug asteroid attack on Buenos Aires is a logical impossibility (as we are shown the Bug planet is light years from Earth, and impossible for slower than light asteroids to reach in the period of time shown).Also, the slick television coverage of the Buenos Aires attack, complete with a rolling body count within minutes, hints that perhaps the attack was staged as a means to incite the local populace. It echoes our own history with the burning of the Reichstag and the sinking of the USS Maine. Are the humans the aggressors in this interstellar war? Only Verhoeven knows, and even in the DVD commentary he only hints at this possibility.If nothing else, this movie appears to polarize people, especially those fans of Heinlein's book which bears only the most cursory resemblance to this film. This is potentially the most subversive big budget film to come out of Hollywood in many years.Overall 7/10</fullReview>

The special effects were pretty good, but especially the larger bugs looked more robotic than living. Rather gory too I thought.&lt;Spoilers Ahead!!!&gt;I don't quite understand why they killed off Dizzy, I thought she was much better suited to Johnny than Carmen was. I mean, sure Carmen and Johnny had been going together for a while, but to make it simple, Carmen dumped him for the new hot guy. Yeah I'm a sucker for chic flik parts! The part with the bug sucking people's brains out was a little extreme. Especially when they showed it happen to Zander...I mean, the guy would have died immediately! If a sharp object went into his brain, I think he would have died sooner. Having never read the book, I can't comment on the differences. It was overall an interesting movie, but it left me feeling sort of like..."So what?" It's not something I'd seriously recommend, but if you're into blood and guts go for it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..and I'm not condemning the other folks who didn't get the social satire.Verhooven's world is presented as a matter-of-fact result of what clearly was a U.S. takeover of the world and elimination of local culture and language. The ultimate cultural imperialism. After all, why does Buenos Aries look like Beverly Hills? Because the U.S. has consumed it.Is there only one TV channel? Perhaps so. the one shown in the movie is an interactive TV channel obviously completely managed by the government. Dissenters from government policy are shown as tokens -- to allow for the appearance of balance (And this was filmed before there was a Fox News Channel!).The blandness of the characters, again, is a direct result of a government policy of homogenizing the population and eliminating independent thought.I guess the reason this is not readily apparent to some is that it all is incorporated in what 'is' in the movie, not explained. You have to give the movie the credibility it deserves (and I for one, did not at first, until I read an interview with the director, who was absolutely aware of how the Nazis controlled the media in WWII) to actually think about how things got to be the way they are.Why do the bugs attack? Because "extremists" move on to their planet. Do the bugs propel asteroids at Earth? Maybe. Maybe not. The government doesn't really care, because it needs a common enemy to unite the citizens. So seconds after an asteroid hits Earth, the culprits are announced and troops are sent. Jeez, does that remind you of anything that's happened since the movie came out?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you enjoyed "RoboCop" you'll enjoy "Starship Troopers." But if you don't like violence or right-wing action movies, this is not the film for you!The director, Paul Verhoeven, has tried to pass off this stylish, violent, and cliched sci-fi war pic as a satire, but don't you believe it! It is far less intelligent and much more macho-fantasy oriented than effective satires such as "Three Kings," "Kelly's Heroes," "Small Soldiers," or even Charlie Sheen's "Hot Shot" comedies. The violence is extreme but clean, the politics simplistic, and the director's distantly patronizing sense of humour is, as in his former movies, unobtrusive. The result is a celebration of fascism that, purely for entertainment purposes, cheerily blurs the distinction between militaristic imperialism and survival in a dangerous universe.Despite protests from purists, the film is faithful in spirit to the main argument of the original Robert Heinlein book, that civilization has a moral imperative to use force to survive and that military service should be a requirement for citizenship. The implications of this belief, which was basically the mindset that produced the Vietnam War, are important to analyze, but that has nothing to do with this movie!"Starship Troopers" presents an appealingly clean and integrated Star Trek-style future, with apparent social harmony and patriotically idealistic high school students. The bad guys are destructive, soulless insects. Throw in a little female nudity, and the result is perfect for a violent videogame.</fullReview>

Imagine that! Just goes to show everyone that you don't have to have a brilliant concept, pretentious thoughts, well-developed characters or good dialog - heck, you don't hardly need any dialog at all. You just need to stay focused and keep things moving along at a good clip. Then, if special effects are to play a large role, use effects that live up to their star billing. You end up with a decent movie. Not a great movie, but one that is watchable and even enjoyable. End of lesson.</fullReview>

Also I believe that the fighting scenes, though not totally bad, were too redundant.The space scenes were really bad and the spaceships, not necesarly ugly, were a bit dumb, a lot actually, nobody knows how to fly a ship (except for Carmen &amp; Zander obviously).And I just want to know what happened after the movie, yes, we won, but i want to know how it happened.Those who liked the book but not the movie because they're not the same, you may kiss my ass, the rest of us don't care about that.The script was totally silly with simple lines for plain actors (some of them), so improving the script and making a better effort in the casting would have been right.So, it deserves something between a 6 and a 7, like 6.5, but you'll like it I guess, like I did.PS: Buenos Aires has no mountains, thats the major goof i've found (or cared).</fullReview>

And the violence only got more grizzly and horrific and, thus, comic. The dismemberments! The decapitations! Disembowlings! Brain eating! Rule! After an hour and a few minutes, the movie was over, and I had a buzz. It was the kind of fun movie even a seasoned film lover can enjoy.About a month later, I went home and my brother had rented the movie. I told him that I had really liked it, so we sat down and watched it. After all, I had missed a bit of it. Or so I thought. The movie is about two hours long, and it is split right in the center. The second hour is what I saw: the ultra-violent bug warfare. I had missed the first half: the military training. Ugh!!! Sitting through the first half of that movie soured me entirely over the film's entirety. They spend an hour training to fight against human beings, then they spend the second hour not using any of that training. The first half has some sporadic violence and nudity, but it is not worth it (well, one thing I can;t argue with is that this is the movie that (for almost everyone) introduced Denise Richard's chest to the world). Overall, I can only give the movie a 6/10. That's how bad the first half is. I would have given it a 9 if it were only an hour long. I recommend watching only the second half of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Earth goes to war with vicious six legged soldiers who resemble giant insects. Director Paul Verhoeven finds yet another way to disgust audiences by presenting us with one of the most violent films ever made. Imagine every graphic act and it's used in the film. Ironside, one of the finest in the B-movies is an entertaining commander. A very, VERY violent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anomalously Overpraised Drivel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starship Troopers is a strong contender for most overrated movie of all time. This is one of the most unimaginably stupid movies I have every had the displeasure of watching. I can only reason that this movie has more than two stars because of a particular scene which was probably many internet fanboys' first exposure to nudity back in the 90s.I don't understand how people can defend this film as nuanced satire with a straight face. Worse yet, how they can claim critics simply "didn't get" the satirical wit. There is absolutely no satirical wit in this pathetic excuse for an action movie. The fascist, pro- war symbolism is overbearing and obvious and in no way compares to the multitude of truly great films which have echoed the anti-war sentiment. This movie is not clever, nuanced, or even mildly interesting in its plot or motif and I fear for the intelligence of people who claim otherwise.Then they call this science fiction. I've never heard such slander against the genre. Science fiction is Blade Runner, 2001, The Prestige. When are the people who sort movies by genre going to learn that science fiction is more than spaceships and lasers? No, this is nothing more than a cheaply made, poorly acted, action movie with some banal symbolism thrown in for good measure.But at last, many review this film from the perspective that it is simply good ol' brain dead fun. Brain dead it certainly is, but only about as fun as watching paint dry. Don't make the same mistake I did. You will never get back the time lost watching this drivel.</fullReview>

The film is so loosely based on the novel that it should have had a different title. The actors are bad,really bad, and the general look of the motion picture is fake,polished,sanitised.To those who gave a rating higher than 3: make yourself a favour, read the novel then go back to change your rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not much I can really say about this movie. I am a big fan of it, but it's not really for everyone. It starts out with a group of high school friends deciding to join the military in order to become citizens or follow their crushes around? either way they wind up in the military fighting the forces of bugs that are threatening their way of life. It sounds a lot more stupid than it actually is.My favorite part of the movie is the beginning, where they're catching you up to speed through website new reels. They explain the threat and the war without making you feel like the writer thinks you're stupid and you can't figure things out.It's a campy kind of movie, but it's cute.

		<fullReview>In the distant future on Earth, a group of graduating high school kids are encouraged to join the military and, after doing so, they find themselves at war against an army of alien insects for the safety of humanity. I guess this movie is also supposed to define unity and patriotism, as the setting occurs when world governments are overthrown and everybody exists under one world order. This movie is somewhat like War of the Worlds set in the future, with humans battling a swarm of very hideous looking aliens. There is carnage in abundance and intense fighting scenes, which make the film grabbing and riveting. The acting wasn't all bad as I thought the chemistry between the lead characters was touching and effective, giving the film a dose of drama that counterbalances the intense sci-fi action. The special effects were neat, giving a definite war-torn atmosphere and, like with many sci-fi movies set in the future in planet Earth, the setting is barren and almost lifeless. Overall, it's an action-packed movie: lots of fights, monster gore and heroism. The cheese factor is high, though, especially in the some of the acting and monster effects, and the basic plot is pretty predictable. Grade C+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is utter rubbish, a dreadful carve-up of one of the great SF novels of the past sixty years. Verhoeven clearly never read the book, and utterly misses its point and its message. The wonderfully imagined Power suits Heinlein envisaged are absent from the movie, as is the book's point that the average M.I. "cap trooper" is a highly skilled, efficient intelligent and superbly trained elite soldier, not the dumb grunt portrayed by the "baywatch" types in the movie. I am baffled by the number of reviewers who call this film "brilliant" etc etc, it's tripe, full of pretty boys and girls playing war and being killed in graphic and gory fashion, when they aren't playing some dopey "football" game, posing naked in the showers together or joyriding round the solar system in half-million ton interstellar assault ships that apparently have the handling qualities of jet skis.......... there's no satire or hidden message in this movie. it's just an abysmal adaptation of a superb book, that has taken the title and some of the character names from the book and ditched almost everything else. The military tactics shown in the film are laughable, or would be if they weren't accompanied by the excessive gore and splatter effects, I mean, soldiers armed with automatic rifles crossing millions of miles of space to invade another planet without artillery, armoured vehicles(or indeed, vehicles of ANY kind) no air support,no apparent medical back-up and not even carrying any supplies or extra ammunition..........And as for the tactic of running into battle blasting away with their rifles and then a few seconds later running away back to the ships.........it was a good job these tactics and these blokes(and glamorous girls too!!) weren't involved in the D-Day landings in 1944, that's all I can say....... to anyone who has read the book I'd say DON'T watch this movies, in fact to most people I'd say, don't watch this movie.......it's rubbish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers has to be one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen in my entire life. There, I said it. I am so goddamn sick of stupid idiots out there calling it "A jaw-dropping experience"(Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times) or "Massive, hilarious and thrilling." (Gregory Weinkauf, berCin) Those idiot critics are f morons. There ain't nothing deep about this crap pile: it's a dumb sci-fi shoot em' up that only works about a quarter of the time. The story, what little there is, is that a bunch of space marines have to stop a race of fake ass cgi bugs from wiping out humanity. There are those idiots out there that are probably like 'But it has such dark themes such as humans being where they don't belong and questioning whether or not we have the right to exterminate a species" Yes, the movie does carry those themes but they are so poorly executed and used to no effect. If you want to see a deep, mature, dark, science-fiction epic that carries those themes and does them justice, well James Cameron's Avatar is for you (Then again, that movie also has its fair share of problems). Starship Troopers is nothing but a clich, dumb as hell meathead war story. The acting in Starship Troopers is wooden, stale, and just bad. These characters are seeing the friends being torn to pieces and suffering gruesome deaths and yet they show no goddamn emotion about it. The dialogue doesn't fare any better. Some of it is so bad that it makes you cringe; it tries to add in some dark humor but fails miserably. The characters are unlikable monkeys that you never grow attached to and you begin to hate their guts over the course of the film. The special effects look like they were created on Windows 87', I mean seriously, this came out in 1997 and this is the best that they could come up with? Seriously? The positives that I have about this movie are the awesome action scenes and that if you can somehow manage to turn your brain off than I can see people enjoying it. Why this has become a cult classic is a mystery to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No doubt Robert Heinlein would have hated the film. In the early days of SciFi, Starship Troopers was considered space opera: a western taking place in outer space, i.e., horse opera on other planets. And as pure shoot em up the movie succeeds. However, the director must have had every actor sign a non acting clause before being allowed to sign on as cast. I don't believe I have ever seen a film wherein there was not at least one character who regardless of the script was able to turn in a few minutes of actual acting. Not in this film. If anything could make it a cult classic it would be its perfection in not allowing anyone to turn in a performance. Watch if you must but only if you must. And the sequels were able to completely replicate the non-acting agreement.</fullReview>

By itself it is a mediocre B-movie sci-fi flick that is fun to watch, but it misses the whole point and frankly PV is a fool for giving this movie the name Starship Troopers. It steals only the most vague parts of the book and leaves out everything that mattered. As far as movies based on books go, this is one of the very very worst, most far-from-intentions film ever made. For those who like minor spoilers! In the book Dizzy was a man, Du Bois is the name of the teacher that became Rasczak in the movie, and Carmen was no one's girl. Read the book if you want to get the real story. Read it two or more times to better understand the point. After all, even PV admitted that he only got though a couple of chapters then quit. He is, on that point, a loser and an idiot who should have given the movie to a person better qualified to make it. I.e. someone who actually READ it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're just after an action flick with lots of gore and exploding bodies, this isn't a bad movie. If nothing else, it has Dina Meyer which makes up for a lot (even Casper Van Dien's wooden acting). Jake Busey is pretty good, and Michael Ironside is typically pretentious and overbearing as the leader of the Roughnecks.On the other hand, if you're looking for an actual adaptation of the classic novel, this isn't it. The whole story has been reworked, characters have been changed around, and the plot barely resembles the book. The main character (indeed ALL the main characters) are white, whereas "Johnny" was actually a Filipino named "Juan 'Johnny' Rico" in the book. While the movie preserves some of the book's often heavy-handed political message, it's largely consumed by action sequences that never appeared in the book.I also found it amusing that, apparently hundreds of years into the future, the movie depicts space faring human soldiers being dropped into combat with no armor support, no heavy weapons aside from a few bazooka-like nukes, and hand weapons that are nothing more than high tech machine guns. Given that they're supposed to have fought the Bugs before, wouldn't they know these MGs were barely effective against the enemy? Why, then, would they drop millions of soldiers onto Klendathu carrying the same guns? And with no air support? Come on...Sorry, it just doesn't make sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If someone could remove the vacuous TV brats, the nonsensical plot, and Verhoeven's trademark "teasers" from this film then there might be enough stock footage of bugs and spaceships to sell to some acolyte of Bert I. Gordon or Roger Corman who knows how to make a decent piece of trash. I really think there is about 15 minutes of salvageable CGI in here looking for an episode of the Outer Limits to inhabit. It is not satire - it is stupidity, pure and simple. I read the original Heinlein novel as a boy in the 60's, and then reread it before I saw this flick - obviously, there is no comparison. Although the book is not anything I ever raved about, it is far more cohesive than this movie - and presents the casual acceptance of militarism much more powerfully than the "Itchy and Scratchy in Outer Space" show that Verhoeven shat out on the screen. If you must, just fast-forward to the cool parts - it really does suck that bad!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think most of the people who have defended this flick are just trying to find a good excuse and for that matter a reason to watch this poor excuse of a movie with no real story going for it. The pace of the movie at the start is both slow and adds no real point to the overall plot line, and the fact that the setting is Argentina when every person living there is American doesn't make much sense in my book. The boot camp is very brutal, and with the exception of the one guy being accidentally shot in the head, did not see any real logic to all the wanton violence going on. When the fighting finally did start at first i thought it would finally get interesting and explain whats going on. I mean it doesn't give a rational explanation as to why the human race is at war with these bugs besides the fact there angry that humans are moving in on there territory (I would be angry too). The more i watched the more disappointed i got and by the time it was finally over i still did not understand the logic of the movie. I think if the director spent more time crafting a good futuristic storyline rather than putting together some really good state of the art special effects together the movie could have been on par with the Alien series but instead just ends up being a B grade movie with cheesy actors and even cheesier acting.</fullReview>

They are vastly different forms of storytelling, and cannot tell the same story the same way. But for God's sake, if you claim to be telling the same story, TELL THE SAME STORY.This movie, on its own, may have its merits-- but should have been made without any association to the book it was supposedly based on. All these writers did was steal characters and the occasional line. The plot bears a slight resemblance to the book in that the humans are at war with the bugs. Easy enough to just write your own bug-war story without spitting on the grave of a great man.Would I recommend that people watch this movie? Yeah, sure. You can't really avoid it, it's like seeing a car accident. You can't tear your eyes away. But I would also recommend that you read the book... and see for yourself.</fullReview>

Heinlein, in his own day, was often called a fascist for his frequent use in his novels of virtuous military governments, genocide, and torture. Anyway, Heinlein always rebuffed his critics by saying he was just a Libertarian and a patriot. Now, this movie comes along, adapting one of his most popular books, and turning all of the heroes into a bunch of obvious Nazis. The truth is that Heinlein's stories were all over the spectrum, but always seemed extreme. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe he would have liked this rendition of Starship Troopers. But my first instinct was that this movie was an embodiment of his critic's claims.There are lots of cool explosions and stuff, too.

They got the story wrong, the message wrong, the characters wrong, the relationships wrong, the politics wrong, everything is wrong.

This movie must have been sponsored by Velveeta, because it's nothing but cheese, and not even good cheese at that. This film has more cliches than a teen slasher movie. The writing (the screenplay - I haven't read the book) is horrible, and quality of the acting suits the quality of the script. If this is serious sci-fi, then the directing is the worst I've seen. If it's a satire, then the directing isn't much funnier than a Tom Green it's-funny-because-it's-stupidly-annoying bit or one of those 1-800-&lt;insert collect call number with an obnoxious spokesperson here&gt; commercials.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starship Troopers (1997): Dir: Paul Verhoeven / Cast: Casper Van Dien, Dina Meyer, Denise Richards, Michael Ironside, Jake Busey: Candy coated spectacle that is a laugh a minute without intending to be. In the midst of chaos a man yells into the camera, "Get out of here now!" He doesn't have enough sense to move and is soon digested by a giant bug. These morons are trained at the Federation and shipped into separate fields. Children are handed guns as if they were toys. These bugs suck the fluid out of the brains of their victims but judging by the intelligence given these characters they had best seek smarter prey. Uninspired directing by Paul Verhoeven who should be congratulated since this film is even worse than his Showgirls. Casper Van Dien plays a whiny hooligan hero who has the amazing talent for standing on the back of a violently thrashing bug. Dina Meyer plays whiny girlfriend #1 and Denise Richards plays whiny girlfriend #2. One of them dies while the other survives so that she can whine some more. Michael Ironside is given the thankless role of commander. The handling of genres misses its satire approach and is squashed like a bug to a fly squatter. The special effects seem to be the only element that this tripe can offer since the writers apparently were on break. The result is a foolish pile of garbage bent on showing off a budget.

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie Ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no question that movies rarely hold their own compared to the books that they are based on, but this one is a travesty. I simply can not understand why they bothered to name this movie Starship Troopers...it has virtually NOTHING to do with the book. Written in 1959, the book is a masterpiece exploring culture, philosophy, and the preconceived notions of our powers that be, couching the whole thing in the realm of an interstellar war with truly visionary weaponry and technologies. The book reads like it was written in the last couple of years, and is filled with action tempered with humour and thought provoking examinations of why we believe what we do about justice and peace. The movie is none of this. One of the main stories of the book is the battle armour worn by the MI, completely absent in every detail in the movie. Heck, one of the main characters in the movie dies in the first chapter of the book and is never mentioned again. Essentially, the screenplay borrowed the name of the book and the names of some of it's characters, and that is it.So forgetting what an amazing travesty this movie is compared to the novel, how does it stand up on its own? This can be answered in one word: poorly. The acting is sad, the characters have no edge or depth at all, there is little plot development and nothing to engage the viewer beyond some T&amp;A and bit of gun play. Michael Ironside is the only redeeming feature of the film, because he is by definition rough and tough, which is what you expect to see in military veterans...Van Dien can't pull off tough to save his well manicured life.Do yourself a favour. Put down the remote, and pick up a copy of Heinlein's Starship Troopers. You won't regret it. You might regret ever having watched this movie, though...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A waste of time if one expects something faithful to Heinlein's book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not sure what in the world the Heinlien estate was thinking by allowing this movie to call itself "Starship Troopers". All I can figure is that someone (Heinlien's wife?) was more interested in earning a few bucks instead of preserving the spirit of original book itself. Yes, movies often stray from the original novel, but this movie makes a mockery of the book.One important difference that most people miss is that in the book, citizenship was not dependent on military service--it was dependent on national service. In the book, people are assigned to serve where they can best be used, and no one is turned away who wants to serve. This concept is one that many on both sides of the political aisle have embraced. This is turned into something ugly in the movie, with militaristic jingoism instead of what Heinlien was trying to portray.I guess I was too dense to see the satire the first time I saw this movie ten years ago. I just thought it was a bad movie which butchered the original work. Now that I have seen the comments here, I know that the director and producer maliciously and purposely butchered the work to support a political agenda. Either way, it is still a horrible movie with an unrealistic portrayal of war, inclusions of sex and violence to titillate the juvenile in most people, and a distortion of why a just society may find itself forced to defend itself.</fullReview>

What kind of a frigging monster proudly ADMITS to deliberately perverting a respected writer's work? Does this guy have a SHRED of dignity? I might be able to forgive Verhoeven if it was merely a terrible movie. But it's not merely terrible; it's insulting to a great man's legacy.Heinlein would have NEVER supported that trash if he'd been alive to see it. It completely mocks his politics, discards or perverts beyond recognition all of his revolutionary technological ideas, shamelessly panders to the chest-beating Rambo watchers of the US, and throws in some nudity for kicks.The fact that this movie made more than 10-cents at the box office makes me sick.

		<fullReview>This was one of the worst big-screen film experiences I'd had for a while. With this film, plus SHOWGIRLS and BASIC INSTINCT, Paul Verhoeven has stamped himself as currently one of the worst blockbuster directors. His celebrated film TOTAL RECALL was - I admit - successfully scripted, but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws. Obviously nobody wanted to invest TOO much money in a production from someone like Verhoeven, the result being that much of the special effects in STARSHIP TROOPERS seemed fake. But not everything bad in the film was the director's fault, even though he was one of the guys who employed the actors. It is surprising that none of the actors received nominations for the Razzie Awards (I expected five for the acting categories). Casserole Vanity Devoid, Dense Ribald, Dingy Miasma , and Jackass Bushy are in serious need of acting school. No, they have to pass primary school drama classes first.</fullReview>

Satire? Tongue in cheek? All of this? None of this? A lot of people try to be nice to this movie by suggesting it is a subtle satire. Well, if that is what it was meant to be it has failed. Good satire relies on wit and humour to achieve its goal of undermining its target. Unfortunately, there is no wit in this film and the sparse humour seems to be wholly unintentional. In fact, I doubt very much if satire was the intention at all. I think the film makers never rose above the teen age target level of the original book, and simply translated the Heinlein story onto the screen without ever considering that it is possible to infuse films with meaning that goes beyond the most superficial actions and feelings depicted in them. And that, of course, means that this simplistic movie can be summarised in one sentence: Ken and Barbie join the Hitlerjugend and get what they deserve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a lame attempt by a ultra-liberal leftist director to capitalize on R.A. Heinlein's popularity while attempting to ridicule his values of citizenship, libertarianism, and mature civilization. Heinlein's novel envisioned a civilization that had learned to balance rights with responsibility in a benevolent libertarian society. Verhoeven, being Dutch (a country that is both a brothel and a crack house), feels he must justify his "Utopian fantasies" of promiscuity, excess, infidelity, and selfishness. To Verhoeven and his ilk, morality and love for ones country = fascism. This circular reasoning explains the totally implausible plot of this movie. Edward Neumaier (screenplay) must have been in a crack house while writing this script. He basically took Heinlein's characters and story line (a war between Earth and an Insect Race) and and goes off into cloudland in order to brainwash gullible young people about the evils of patriotism and civic responsibility by mixing a poorly scripted and incoherent story with gratuitous gore, nudity, and sex. If Verhoeven were an honest man, he would have called this mess 'Space War 90210' and used Tori Spelling as Joanne Rico (instead of Caspar Van Dien) with her dad Aaron Spelling producing. Just read the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deadening wall of noise and violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Purportedly based on a Robert Heinlein novel, this is an especially empty-headed science fiction action flick from over-the-top director Paul Verhoeven.In the future, on a vaguely fascist militaristic Earth, high school graduates are recruited to join up in a military endeavor to combat races of giant, intelligent insects on a distant planet. And that is about the size of it. Anyone looking for anything of special relevance or depth is in the wrong movie.There is absolutely nothing wrong with having good dumb fun at the movies. Unfortunately, this effort is neither good or fun, just dumb. The film never really explains how these insects, which are planet-bound became a particular threat to Earth and felt that we were worth their while to antagonize. Verhoeven's attempt to instill the material with some irony seems to be in garbing Neil Patrick Harris' scientist to look like he is an SS officer and making the recruitment videos and the news bulletins reminiscent of Nazi propaganda pieces. Rather than amuse, it has the distinct impression of inducing unease. The film also never bothers to explain how so many diverse species of insects on this far away planet have decided to harmoniously come together and pool their resources to take on humanity.The battle scenes are marvels of visual effects, but after the first one they just seem recycled. The viewer has no stake in the outcome and they all begin to look alike - how many times can one see the same movements of identical looking soldiers being impaled on giant bug legs or have their heads lopped off by flying insects before it gets old hat? The characters and acting are so bad that they do not even qualify as stereotypes. They make the kids on the average episode of Beverly Hills 90210 look like studies in complexity. The "human" story is some foolishness about all American Casper Van Dien being stunned when his girlfriend Denise Richards joins up and leaves him behind. He naturally follows her into the armed services. Mopey Van Dien is pursued by gutsy fellow grunt Dina Meyer, while Richards' pilot gets to make goo-goo eyes at colleague Patrick Muldoon. Yawn! The second string leads Meyer and Muldoon come off better and seem to have some degree of acting talent, which means that the film will need to do something about it. If six-pack abs and a rock hard butt were indications of acting talent than Van Dien would be this generation's Olivier. There is absolutely no disagreement that he is easy on the eyes and rocks a completely gratuitous (but welcome) nude co-ed shower scene, but he is a hopeless actor incapable of even the tiniest bit of charisma. However, he is a veritable whirlwind compared to the tragically talentless Richards, who spends much of the film sporting a vacant stare, delivering her corny lines with a flat affect, and does not even have the excuse of getting naked at any point.Watching the film, it is difficult to figure out who is target audience of this film. The writing and acting gear the film towards children, but the graphic violence and the aforementioned nude shower scene would seem to skew the viewing audience older. Yet anyone beyond eighth grade would undoubtedly find the film silly, if not downright laughable. Director Verhoeven loves to push buttons and sometimes succeeds in coming up with something stylish - this is not one of those times. The film is never bad enough to become a camp classic, nor does it ever hit the heights of sheer dumb goofiness that would make it a great guilty pleasure. Instead, it just seems like a waste of time. If you are determined to watch it, do yourself a huge favor. Skip over the dialog scenes to the nude shower scene and watch that - then fast forward to the first battle scene and watch that. Those two scenes are the highlights of the film - further viewing would be irrelevant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Travesty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this 3 for execution of effects for the time.Robert Heinlein's novel, in spite of what ignorant civilian readers have projected onto it, was not a pro-military indictment of soft, civilian rule. The author, a veteran of World War I, recognized the merits of honorable military service, but did not glorify war or militarism. His novel was "speculative fiction" which is the literary equivalent of philosophical "thought experimentation." It is the answer to "what if" questions. What if society were arranged in such a way that only military veterans had a political franchise.The film was a mockery of Heinlein's thoughtful premises and conclusions, thinking it was a rebuttal to what amounted to a straw man argument. The producers of the movie set up a false understanding of what Heinlein communicated in his literary text, then burned it down with scathing parody. If what Heinlein had written actually was jingoistic, the parody would have been spot on, but since the man never indicated that he felt military service produced (or identified) superior individuals, or that he advocated the arrangement he explored, the parody only serves to mock one of the greatest minds in speculative literature.This "crime" of staining the memory of one of the ten best authors in the history of science fiction, and making money from debasing a valuable original work, goes even further than this, however. The movie also issues an infantile and intellectually fraudulent insult to the real military. Unoriginally stealing dialog and plot points from legitimate war stories and actual events, this movie is a middle finger in the face of every veteran who served sincerely and in good causes. The military is often misused, but that is the fault of ignorant civilians making political decisions based on media hype and poor philosophical training. The fact remains that a volunteer military is largely made up of admirable people doing difficult jobs under bad conditions, and the movie soils the record of these people.Anyone who likes this movie as any sort of protest against militarism is deeply lacking in sound information or critical reasoning.</fullReview>

The visual effects are spectacular, but the film is a little too leisurely for its own good, and director Paul Verhoeven adopts a mocking tone at odds with the gore and carnage. Despite failing to ignite the US box office, the movie has become something of a cult item, like so many other entries in Verhoeven's curious filmography.

Fortunately, it was shown in B&amp;W, which helped maintain the illusion. Trying to make TOO realistic of an insect, actually works against the film.

This could be called the "Robo Cop" of outer space movies. It is a non stop thrill ride with characters who are very likable and well defined. There isn't any weakness in script or in action. And the humor that is added in makes this very Robocoplike (is that a word?) We have a hero and heroine who do gain our trust and understanding. But we also care about the other characters, most of them a bit stock, but well explored, much like "The Quick and the Dead", which doesn't hesitate to poke fun at even the mightiest icons of our culture.

I didn't want to but was asked "pretty please with sugar on top" I never liked it the first time and the second time took any suspense away from the movie entirely.Technically its OK. Acting is below average from everyone, but mostly because of clunky writing. Who ever designed the helmets should have been shot. At least size it to the actors head. In at least 3 scenes, any number of actors can be seen trying to push the helmet back on top of their head instead of in their eyes, or dangling off to the side awkwardly.You know how I mentioned the writing was bad-dialogue wise-its not nearly as terrible as the book. I sat down and started reading this recently and had to come here to re evaluate this movie. While I thought it awful before, it is better than its source material. Yes it should have had the power armour. Course then it would have looked worse than Robot Jocks(that one was sooo bad) But the book is just awful. Boring, no plot, no character development, bad descriptions and worst of all preachy militaristic fascism philosophy. So its hard to imagine the movie being better than the source but it was.See how bad the book must be if this only rates a 5. At least you had some action here. There was a half hearted attempt at developing the characters. And some of the technical staff did a good enough job for this to pass as better than DTV quality. Hey look a plot, not just marching. So grudgingly I had to bump it from 3 to 5. Almost a 6 because the book was just so bloody boring and they tried to make it work. So good effort, but still falls short.There are already plenty of reviews that detail the movie, so I won't bother. I just want people to know this movie is STILL better than the book so don't be dumb like me and go reading the novel thinking it will be better. It isn't.See Aliens for a good alien vs infantry movie. Or Forever War for a better novel. Hope this helps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AWESOME action packed gore fest WARNING!!!!!!! SPOILERS!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AWESOME action packed gore fest man oh man you like gore then you will love this movie but i must say the special effects are just breath taking especially that main last bug at the very end which sent shivers down my spine it was very freaky looking and it looked very real as well. Well Done! the script was quite interesting and it had surprisingly likable characters and i didn't find most of them annoying just a couple Zander and Ace they bugged me quite a bit. the sets were awesome and the camera work was pretty good once again i must say the special effects are just amazing i still can't get over it. Now on to the gore wow! where to begin we get tons of bloody claw stabbings tons of people get ripped in half with torso's flying everywhere we get TONS of severed limbs everywhere tons of bug goo everywhere gooey bug surgery with slime all over and TONS more that i can't remember. The Acting is surprisingly excellent Casper Van Dien does surprisingly AWESOME here he is so likable and i was rooting for him the whole way. weird i usually find him annoying but not here that's for sure. Denise Richards does VERY well here she showed she she is a good actress here and not the vamp she usually is and i liked her a lot not only that she was GORGEOUS!!!!! she looked great in a space outfit.Dina Meyers does well here and is very good looking to boot i liked her lots. Jake Busy on the other hand i did not like he got on my nerves too much and his character wasn't that likable Neil Patrick Harris does his job well good job!. great to see Clancy Brown again he does well here. Patrick Muldoon annoyed me so much that i felt like jumping in the (TV) and scream at him he acts with his hair and he was on screen too long. Michael Ironside is great here and was great to see him kick butt again i LOVE this guy. Overall a MUST SEE or own just see it! another ***** out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie is void, the plot is flat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the first 15 minutes I thought that the movie was pretty interesting, with some good theme as a society centered on the military or the way people seems to join the army. It could have been a deep sci-fi movie. I was even impressed by the special effect, back it 1997 in must have been awesome. But after I understood that the plot is in fact superficial and flat, that the character are boring, and that the whole movie is just a pointless action shi*t movie with nothing credible in it and really bad acted, I felt duped.Like Hollow Man (does Paul Verhoeven s*ucks hard at making good movies?) the VFX work is nice-looking but the movie is really Awful, you will get really bored in about 1 hour. Do not waste 2 f*ucking hours of your life for this shi*t.Btw, this film is way OVERRATED @ IMDb.com.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sex &amp; violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>have read dozens of comments here, am amazed no one mentioned the giant vulva bug toward the end of the movie. it actually has orgasmic spasms and discharge as it's sucking some poor schmuck's brain out of his head. all through the movie a big deal is made of the relaxed co-ed structure of military training and war, but at the end of it all there's the primal vagina getting off on sucking a man's brains. that idiot psychic pronounced the bug to be afraid, but he wouldn't recognize an orgasm if it slapped him up both sides of his head. and the very final scene is a "censored" depiction of someone violently raping the bug w/a scientific instrument. never read the book, never liked Heinlein, but to me the movie is a rather over-forceful statement about a society sublimating its primal sexual urges into violence and domination. same s***, different galaxy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movies must be poignant to deliver a message. This fails.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is certainly a critique on the emotional propaganda that is used to recruit people for a war.OK. So, now why should I care? The movie certainly compares war like humans to 'bugs', or an insect survival mentality that eschews reason and the value of human life for the sake of humanity's domination over all life forms.That's a message; and I appreciate anyone who tries to deliver a message.But enjoyment of movies is not solely predicated on the value of the message.You cannot argue that bad writing can be excused because the message of the narrative is so grand and important.The idea behind the movie is fine, and the political message is delivered clearly: Those who join the army are mindless, and the hierarchy of military institutions are simply opportunists who happened to be at the right place at the right time. OK. There is nothing wrong with a message in a work of art.The challenge of any kind of art is to find a message, and then make it relevant to an audience. All artists should ask themselves why their audience should care about the art they perform.Let me share some points of view: The hero in the movie is unrealistically elevated from no rank to high rank based purely on his acts of heroism (which are diminished by the movie's end) and his timing.The audience's belief in the hero's ability to think is continuously diminished by his pithy can-do remarks which he hijacks from his superiors.The hero is presented as a strong jawed, good-looking guy who adopts leadership phrases from his deceased predecessors.Where the plot fails is in its mockery of the hero. The audience is left, at the end, wondering, "who is the hero?" because the story mocks the hero.The graphics and music, the 'mis-en-scene' which any literature graduate is supposed to ignore, are the best parts of the movie. That means that the development of the hero, falls second place to the mis-en-scene. That's basically not good.Shakespeare made a folly of his hero Macbeth, but in the narrative, the audience still felt empathy for the hero.Empathy means you care about the character's fortunes.A story is only good, no matter how noble the message, if you feel empathy for the characters.So, however cool the message is, if you don't give a darn about the hero, why should you care about the message.I appreciate all the comments about how great this movie is for its message, but, when you want to tell me a story, you better make sure I care.Present me with heroes I care about, and then I will listen to the 'message' in the story.But if you don't give me heroes I care about, don't waste my time.This movie, which has great effects, somewhat decent music, and a basically pathetic script, did not move me enough to care about its message. For all its noble intentions, the movie was a waste of time.But: for all you who are not convinced: Just look at the continuity at the end. The end of the movie is twenty minutes of suspense that have nothing to do with the resolution of the plot, which is concluded and explained in 30 seconds, 'Deus ex machina' fashion. All you budding story tellers would do well to understand 'Deus ex machina' and why it is the biggest indicator of bad story telling around. Look it up.For those who are looking to find truly awful art, this movie is it. For those who seek an enormous waste of time and effort, this movie is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Strangest Gay Porno I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have this friend. Everything with him is "gay this" and "gay that," you know the type, a very latent kind of guy. So when he bought me the DVD of Starship Troopers, I knew it had to be some kind of practical joke. I vaguely remember hearing something about it years ago, but I couldn't remember what. But coming from my friend, I knew it had to be some sort of homosexual porn gag gift . . . and boy, was I ever right.I put in the movie, ready for a quick laugh or two before shutting it off, but I noticed something very strange; there were FAMOUS people in it . . .alright, well almost famous, anyway. You always hear about stars who did soft core or other kinds of movies to be ashamed of, but I was really surprised to see Doogie Hauser and Denise Richards and Casper What's-His-Face and even that guy from Carnivale.The movie revolves around a young gay twink fresh out of high school who wants to do manly things. His father is a butch breeder who doesn't understand and wants him to go on some fabulous vacation then go off to college. Twink doesn't want to do that, which leads up to the utterance of the single gay-ist line in contemporary American cinema, "I am NOT going to Harvard!" Twink then goes off to boot camp where he's surrounded by all these cute boys who seem to fill their days with co-ed showering, playing grab-ass in their bunks, wearing tight black uniforms, and a little more grab-ass before lights out.All this time, however, Twink is in denial and is still trying to hold on to his high school beard (Denise Richards). But she's off sauntering through the galaxy with a straight boy with horrible future hair.There's also some bugs that eat people along the way, but they are merely part of the back drop for which Twink discovers his love for his men (whom he then gets to order around . . . delicious!) as they fight the slimy bastard bugs.Then Michael Ironside comes in and says, "They sucked his brains out." Brains? Sure, Michael Ironside . . . brains . . . right.At the end, Doogie comes in sporting an S&amp;M outfit with an adorable little hat. That was too much for me, I had to shut it off. I'm no gay, mind you . . . but Doogie in a uniform? Ummmmm . . . Doog, I'll take you places Wanda never knew about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Redneck movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A perfect redneck movie. I'm sorry I know I shouldn't use the term 'redneck', I believe the politically correct term is a 'country singer'. Either way, you've got to be from Texas or have voted for Bush to enjoy it. It reminded me of those stupid commercials for US Army. You know, the ones that go 'See the world, meet new people and kill them...' or something like that... Anyway, if you're a high school drop-out you will enjoy it so my opinion is very subjective. On another note, I wonder why they make this description to be 10 lines minimum. I think I made it pretty clear what I think about the movie in less than that... It's garbage. (Or as they say in Italy - Garbaggio.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the worst films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loved the book. The movie has basically nothing to do with the book. In fact, it spends as much time as possible mocking the things that made the book great. The political message is turned on its head, as is the vision of what makes a man and a society righteous.Put all that aside, though. Pretend the producer/director had no political agenda and judge it as an action/adventure film. Now it's even more of a stinker. The casting is terrible. The actors are wooden and unlikeable. The battle scenes are stupid and unforgivably long. The blood and gore are practically slapstick -- and still revolting. There is no progression toward a meaningful goal and no story line worth following.Verhoeven at al should never have been allowed to get at Starship Troopers. If he wanted to make a social commentary on the slippery slope between patriotism and fascism wrapped up in the cover of a sci-fi shoot-em-up he should have created his own story and not tormented one of the greatest works of an iconic author.This film is a disgrace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Erstwhile Political Satire That Takes Itself Way Too Seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, without a doubt, one of the worst films I have ever seen. It milks every cinematic- formulaic emotion to the absolute hilt... and beyond. It fails miserably on every score except one: the prurient appeal to extreme violence, which permeates it from its inner core to its outer (arachnoidal) exterior shell.Here's the core of my disgust: I kept waiting for the obviously over-the-top asides from "Federal Central," internet-style ads (meant as propaganda), to be revealed as a gigantic hoax put on by evil global-political dominators to reduce the population of a crowded planet (ours) by shipping much of it off to outer space to fight a fictitious enemy, and then secretly eliminating all of them. The Starship Troopers, that is. As a nefarious side-effect, this would cement their control of Earth by making everyone believe they had to group together under these dictators, subservient themselves to them, to better fight a hated enemy they believed would destroy Earth entirely.Not exactly an original idea, but wouldn't it have worked well here? But it never came; there is no relief. Zilch. Nada. Zero. This cesspool of a film believes in its own juvenile claptrap to the point where it becomes absolutely real, completely unending , and forms a living cinematic Hell for all of us. No relief. Ever. The very concept is completely nauseating to anyone with a mind of greater capacity than a bug. (Sorry, I just had to say it).I'm ashamed to admit that the violence factor got my interest enough to give it a two, rather than a one.One question: What is Neil Patrick Harris doing as a hired actor (with a completely unbelievable role) in a movie so horribly bad? Shame, shame on you NPH; I no longer believe in your integrity. What a bloody sell-out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very controversial result</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is shine example, how common Hollywood money-making film-industry production how to work. Excellent casting, excellent camera, effects (with some tragic exemptions)... On the other side, who know Heinlein book and understand what's the point of that book, cannot be more disappointed and, in some case, angry. So let's explain. Key part of book is about importance personal responsibility towards society, "Dubois lesson". It explain how right attitude and responsible behavior is important for everything and everybody. It is base of book and packed in incredible good sci-fi story. Another important part of this story is powered combat suit. Dare to say Heinlein invented it. It play such important part of book and story, that I can't imagine it would be dismissed. However - in movie was. Instead of that Verhoeven and Neumeier replace it by some ugly space-bugs, and gave them unthinkable skill - insects, without something like high-tech space navigation devices or transports, they are able to attack civilization on another far distant planet!!! Put it to simple analyze - screenplay just robbed the book, thrown away whole core and important things and left that unimportant - bugs and butchering. Even it is described by high professional cinematography level, I can't wait for another adaptation of novel, where storyline will be kept.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fake showers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the mercifully brief ad breaks in Inspector Morse on UKTV last night, I switched over to Starship Troopers on Sky Movies, a truly atrocious shoot 'em up sci-fi dirge. The only interesting bit in the film is, of course, the shower scene. It's the usual coy camera shot above the waist only. For most pimply adolescents this has the bonus of the girls' breasts visible during the banter. And, of course, the boys' fabulous pectorals - the only thing a movie multiplex dweller can aspire to. The terrible sexism of the shot was not the girls proudly displaying their tits, which turns the boys into soaped-up droolers, but the clearly visible (and listed as a goof) boxer shorts on one of the boys. I hear it is fairly common in New Zealand sports clubs that men shower in their underpants. Personally, I can't think of anything more disgusting. Why isn't that unnatural behaviour outlawed?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My only regret is that I sat all the way through this travesty. Verhoeven either intentionally distorted the message of the book or just didn't care (or both).The plot was juvenile and the entire point of the book--service in a time of emergency--was buried under layers of PC nonsense and militarily unsound behavior.Oh, and the SS uniforms? Gee, that was about as subtle as a pie in the face. Didn't quite get the whole "Doogie Howser, psychic Gestapo Officer" angle, either.Do yourself a favor--throw away the DVD and read the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starship Troopers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a 1959 novel, this high-action, ultra-violent science fiction film is great entertainment from director Paul Verhoeven (Total Recall, Basic Instinct, Showgirls). Basically, in the distant future, giant bugs are overtaking the planet Earth, and only the mobile infantry stand in their way of total annihilation of the human race. Johnny Rico (Sleepy Hollow's Casper Van Dien) wants to become a soldier for them, just after finishing college, along with girlfriend Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards). It hits Rico when she is to become a pilot, and possibly never see him again, but also his home town of Buenos Aires is blown up just after he was quitting, but don't worry, he goes back, and he is determined to help kill all the bugs. So you can imagine most of the film, after the tiny romance story, is mainly just sending troopers onto parts of the planet, where the bugs hang out, and all hell breaks loose. You also find out, that as well as the horrific crawling and flying bugs, there is also the disgusting brain sucking, possibly head of the bugs, which at the end is probably the best key they have to finding the way to defeat the hideous creatures. Also starring Dina Meyer as Dizzy Flores, Jake Busey as Ace Levy , Neil Patrick Harris as Carl Jenkins, Clancy Brown as Sgt. Zim, Seth Gilliam as Sugar Watkins, Patrick Muldoon as Zander Barcalow, Total Recall's Michael Ironside as Jean Rasczak and Amy Smart as Pilot Cadet. The action is almost non-stop, the special effects of the space ships and bugs are very good, and of course, the over-the-top animated gore is sensational, just a great satirical science-fiction adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Very good!</fullReview>
