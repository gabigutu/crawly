		<shortDescription>The Darkness (2016)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes, a bad horror movie can have some redeeming quality to make it at least watchable for its runtime even if you'll forget about it the next day. Then, about once a year, the stars align, Wes Craven rolls in his grave, and a movie like The Darkness limps into theaters, a horror flick that's so inept at everything it tries to accomplish that it only triggers catcalls from the audience. In The Darkness, the whitest family I've ever seen goes on a family trip to the Grand Canyon, and by some ridiculous series of events, the son brings back five rocks that have Native American demons inside them. The family is now haunted by some incredibly convoluted curse, and demon stuff happens. I can't even say anything specific because nothing really scary happens to this family. Every single scare is just a door opening, the faucet turning on, a dog nonchalantly walking down a hallway, or handprints appearing on the wall. There aren't any scares because every time something that resembles a shock comes along that thing isn't scary! It's a faucet! The only thing that came out of the faucet was a little bit of water, they didn't even try to put blood or black crap coming out of it or anything! And then in an effort to save this god forsaken atrocity, they try to put some stupid family drama in the plot that's referenced once and never mentioned again. The daughter has bullimia? Who cares, put black handprints on her! Mom has a drinking problem? Might as well have the faucet turn back on! Not to mention there are several characters that enter the plot for two scenes and then mysteriously disappear. I've never seen a horror movie so incompetent at every single basic aspect of filmmaking. I can't pinpoint one exact reason why I hate this movie so much other than the sole reason that it exists. I could name about fifty other movies that I've given bad reviews that I would rather watch than this train wreck. I think I can now give every other horror movie the benefit that it's not as bad as The Darkness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't know why people are writing comments slating this film.It is not a 'hardcore; horror that is likely to make you seek therapy for the rest of your life, but it is not dull or unwatchable either.The production is good, the acting is good, and it is the kind of film you can watch when you just fancy a 'movie night' with friends or family.The story is engaging enough to make it interesting.All these pseudo-intellectual ramblings criticising the film are just that - pseudo-intellectual.It is probably not the best film you will watch in your life but is it also very far from the worst.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>where's the actual BAND The Darkness when you need 'em?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is simply a lame and lazy movie. It has the smallest seeds of potential I think in the aspect of the child with autism. There could be something with a horror movie that uses a child who has this disorder and has some sort of psychic or supernatural connections to things, it could make for a good premise for a movie. This isn't it, however. The Darkness is generic all the way down to its title - can you imagine the faces lit up when the actors (who did get paid anyway so whatever) are told they'll be in a new horror movie produced by Jason Blum (whatever you think of Blumhouse they made Whiplash so points there for that), and then comes a script called 'The Darkness' and those faces fall a little - and its laziness comes largely in execution.These aren't all necessarily bad actors really; Kevin Bacon, Radha Mitchell, even Paul Reiser I've seen do excellent work in major films for major artists. Here, it's slumming in a story that feels like its grafted plot points and character beats from a Lifetime movie; the mother/wife who's an alcoholic; the philandering husband/father who can't keep it in his pants (until he decides to not to that so much due to the crazy s*** at home); the daughter who has bulimia since, you know, she has to be given something to do. And of course the son who is autistic (though we don't see that at the start of the movie, set at the Grand Canyon where he happens to plop into a hole and find some spooky rocks, woo rocks, scary), and the filmmakers use the autism more to keep things in the first half suspicious.So in other words, it's not taking autism really seriously aside from it being a crutch to hold on to: there's some weird things going on in the house like (gasp) hand-prints and prints on a mirror during a shower, well you can blame it on the autistic kid Mikey, right? The kid is directed to be pretty one dimensional, and there's a few moments that are just laughably poor. And it all leads up to a conclusion that we've seen a thousand times with these possessed-house movies - and for some reason even though I believe the Anasazi are Native American in heritage the "healers" are Mexican because maybe they couldn't afford to hire Native American actors (and having actors speaking Spanish makes things more, uh, 'authentic' or scary).This is weak by way of building up family drama (also it feels confused as if on the one hand the family had these problems before this phantom menace so to speak arrived, but on the other hand it's also meant to be like the ghosts make them more effed up, which is it) and by the numbers (plus logic stuff, simple things, like is the movie so cheap that they couldn't show the boy at a school - the actor playing him doesn't look too young to be in school as autistic kids *do* attend), and yet its laziness causes it to be borderline offensive. Could you at least TRY to build real suspense? Even jump scares, the more tired of the crutches of horror filmmakers today, at least give us something to do in a theater if only by motor-reaction or something. The jump scares here are non-existent to bare-bones (ooh, the son's behind her, whoops), and by the climax it's ultimately bloodless too with a PG-13 rating so, uh, kids can sit bored too? This is a movie made at the prestigious school for hacks, The University of Don't-Give-a-F***ery, and if you don't care then I don't, either. Kevin Bacon can do better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is deja vu all over again....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not understand why Hollywood still makes films like "The Darkness"...It is always the same thing. There is nothing new, no creativity. They change one or two elements on the script but in the end it is the same type of reheated and recycled haunting story.If they had, at least, included some gratuitous nudity or sex to make things a little more interesting or less soporific the film could be watchable. As it is, The Darkness is boring as it can possibly be, without any scares, and in the final act, the introduction of the healers and their magic feather is painfully ridiculous.I wonder what forced Kevin Bacon to star in such drivel....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Deep dark scary horror movie voice* When the music stops and the lights go out... Kevin Bacon must kick off the dancing shoes and face....... 'The Darkness'. Okay, that was a horrible intro but I swear it is not half as horrible as this movie. Damn, wait, did I just spoil my opinion section? Oh well... Friday the 13th of May 2016 brings on the release of 'The Darkness' starring Kevin Bacon where his family must do battle with ancient spirits of the Grand Canyon... No, I am not making this up. Just keep reading, thanks.'The Darkness' begins as Peter Taylor (Kevin Bacon) and his family have a camping trip within the Grand Canyon. During this trip, Peter's kids, Stephanie and Michael (Lucy Fry and David Mazouz) go exploring some trails with family friend Andrew (Parker Mack). While exploring, Andrew and Stephanie continue their exploration while Michael decides to stay back. An incident causes Michael to fall through a hole which leads him into some old caves below the canyon. These caves navigate to a shrine of some sort which consists of five stones. Intrigued by these stones, Michael takes them for himself which only leads to a living nightmare for the Taylor family as these stones bring terrible misfortune to those who posses it. Thus beginning the horror sequence that is 'The Darkness'.*MINOR SPOILERS* Sorry, I spoiled my opinion already. 'The Darkness' is yet another film victimized by my favorite term, "Hollywood Horror". Except ironically enough, it hardly had any typical Hollywood Horror pathetic jump scares, which is an issue all in itself. This plot was all over the place as the core story was focused on the evil Michael brings upon the family. Yet, there were random inserts of inner family turmoil spread across the film for pointless reasons whether it had anything to do with this "darkness" that was taking hold of the family or if it truly was pointlessly inserted into the film. Regardless, a terrible attempt at a linear plot. To give it any kind of positive feedback, I would say it was very odd. Odd enough to give it some credit yet still too odd for my taste. Again, overall bad. Yet another movie that if you are in desperate need of a date night horror movie or want to have a "bad movie" day/night, well, you have your winner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So this kid with Autism is more accessible to the preternatural and disturbs evil native American spirits that decide to disturb him and his family back.It Reminds me of Stir of Echoes, which also star Keven Bacon, but is nowhere near as good as that movie. in comparison, Stir of Echoes looks like The Exorcist when standing right next to The Darkness. The story had potential. Some evil native American spirits get their resting place disturbed, by some white folks (shocker), so in return, these spirits decide to unlock these guys inner most demons (mom's an alcoholic, the daughter is bulimic) to split up the family and drive them all crazy. It was a brilliant idea, but it was done so corny. Even seasoned actor Keven Bacon looked cheesy delivering simple lines and trying to be serious as he reacted to the ghost. It was a very sad display of what could have been gold. I don't know what went wrong, but I know this: Don't wast your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not THAT bad 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So another example of how IMDb user reviews and ratings have slated another reasonably good film. Clearly everyone has different expectations when it comes to horrors, and for me personally, movies like Insidious, Paranormal Activity, Sinister and Dark Skies etc tick the box. And this was one I would gladly add to that list. Unfortunately with most new movies, the story lines and scares are nothing original and this one is no different. If that is enough to put you off then I suggest you don't watch this. I on the other hand, take a movie for what it is and I was not in any way disappointed. The cast, acting, script and effects were all decent enough and it was all a bit predictable but who cares.... I enjoyed it. Unlike 90% of the reviewers here who seem to be wannabe critics and outright movie boffins, I on the other hand am just a NORMAL person. This film is worth watching if you are not going to dissect every scene from the start to the finish merely to find faults. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Story, but Cliché</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey Everyone, If you are a horror movie fan like myself, you can probably pass on seeing this one. You knew when there would be a "scare" and the ending was pretty cliché. I do feel that the character development in this movie was wonderful! They actually allowed you to get to know the characters as the story unraveled. However, none of those family dynamics really played into the scares. In my eyes if you are giving me background on a character, or getting to know the characters weaknesses, they should somehow effect the overall story line. I'm giving this movie a 4 out of 10 because the movie did keep me intrigued through out, and definitely more of a pre-teen horror movie. I wish the writers or director would have put in more scares and jumps. I would consider this more of a thriller than an actual horror movie. I'm interested in reading what other horror seekers feel about this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just got back from seeing this in cinemas &amp; have say it was pretty good though not 100% great.The film starts with a family who go camping in the Grand Canyon &amp; their youngest son, who has autism falls into a cave &amp; discovers a post supernatural ritual camber of some kind. But after returning from their camping trip, the family start to discover scary occurrences! The film as a whole was pretty good! Worth a watch definitely! Though I think it lacked jump scares here &amp; there &amp; a few other scary occurrences which could've been thrown in, but it was a satisfying! The jump scares were OK, not the best but OK. Typical of horror clichés like the whole, "I'm taking to my friend who isn't there" or the father trying to fix everything &amp; not excepting the supernatural you know the score! But still it was good!The ending was quite satisfying &amp; no one died or got killed so that was a great ending if I ever saw one! The demons at the end were pretty greatly executed!I overall would give this a 7/10. It was great, but lacked a bit here &amp; there! But it was a pretty creepy dark horror film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was a bad movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was so bad. The acting was bad, effects were bad, the plot was bad. This movie was just overall bad. The trailer and the artwork of the movie cover made the movie look good, but in reality the movie was just horrible. The actors put what seemed like no effort into the movie, and the special effects were almost worse. Not only is all of this true, but the plot was just horrible, I mean what kid takes rocks and hen get haunted(not a spoiler because it mentions this in the trailer). So sorry to the producers of the movie, but they honestly just wasted their money on what seems like a "iMovie" production a child made. Personally, this movie was a 1 out of 10 because of all of the horrible qualities that this movie had. So, if you or someone you know is planning on watching this movie, don't waste your time or money on something that is distressingly bad. Thanks for reading my review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Much Exposition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie suffers from something A LOT of modern Horror movies suffer from. They Explain Too Much! There is too much time spent explaining the villains, how they work, what their entire history is, and how to stop them. Remember the scene in ALIEN when they explain all that about the Xenomorph? I don't. The characters in this movie are all stereotypes. You have a father who doesn't spend enough time with his family, a mother who is broken up about it, a teenager who only cares about herself and is annoyed with her weird younger sibling who turns out to be the main target of the supernatural beings. We have never seen characters like this before. Isn't that right INSIDIOUS, POLTERGEIST, THE POSSESSION, SINISTER, and various sequels, remakes, and rip-offs of the aforementioned movies? The only thing I was able to appreciate was the music. The music for the movie sets up this creepy mysterious tone that works at creating this unnerving dread and is actually kind of unique for a movie like this. Otherwise this movie is not worth seeing. It's cliché, uninspired, and above all Not Scary. Save your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have seen: The Amityville Horror, The Exorcist, Poltergeist, Paranormal Activity, Paranormal Activity 2, Paranormal Activity 3, Insidious, Sinister, and The Conjuring.Then you most likely have seen "The Darkness". It's nothing new or original.It's a lazy copy cat of better horror movies that came out in the last few years- With endless amount of clichés that you thought died out years ago. The acting was so awful and not convincing at all. Well, coming to think of it, Kevin Bacon is the only actor in the movie that wasn't terrible, because he is the Bacon.The only scary thing I can say about this is that I got to see the preview of the upcoming horror film "Don't Breathe". That film looks really intense and way more scary than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Scary Movies? You've seen this before...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love scary movies. I love most things that come out of Blumhouse Productions since it's been around. Things like The Conjuring, Annabelle, Sinister, Insidious, all wonderful forays into the genre of spook. But The Darkness, which I thought had a lot of promise, is absolutely miserable, paling in comparison to the other films from the studio. It seems a desperate, highly formulaic premise that's a money grab at best. There is nothing original; The script is incredibly lazy, relying on jump scares and the musical score stabs. There are no likable characters with any redemptive qualities. It's another well off family in a big beautiful house that you'll never afford in a very basic plot that has zero substance. It's been done over and over, but better by Poltergeist, Paranormal Activity, Amityville, The Shining... the list goes on and on. This film tries very hard to simulate the recipe of the latter films in order to make money rather than entertain.Great talents are wasted here, Kevin Bacon, most notably. The genre has had far better entries in the last couple of years, so there is simply no excuse for this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poltergeist rip off with cheap scares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only real scares in this movie are the cheap jump-scares. Although the plot is fairly interesting, it's not enough to make me want to sit through the entire thing. Throughout the movie, I noticed uncanny similarities to the 1982 Poltergeist. From the Indian folk, to taking a child to another-world, etc.If you're into thrilling scares, this movie is not worth the time. Jump scares will scare anyone, it's the true creepiness and twisting scenes that give you that true fear - which this movie severely lacks. Loud noises and pop up creatures on the only things that will give you quick, temporary scares.Not worth the time or money.</fullReview>

The whole theme. Awful. Because With Kevin Bacon And radha Mitchell. How can It be bad. Well. It Gets 3 Pts for me For their acting And thats It. Nothing else works. Made by The Guy who did rogue And wolf Creek? But wolf Creek 2 was so bad. I can believe He lose his touch.Kevin Bacon try hard in this film but with the matter of the subject, even a Matthew McConaughey could not save this film from being this boring. It is not entirely an horror film, if it is, well, Jurassic Park get more horror and it is not pg-13 like this flick. It tries to hard to be something it is not. The ending is a major mess. It could have make a 5 or 6/10 OK film but instead, it is even lower because nothing made sense. Avoid at any costs, even if someone tell you he will pay you to see this ! 1h40 that feels like 3 hrs !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going to discuss its plot anymore and just go straight to my review:This film isn't a horror film, it's a drama film. Honestly, this film could've worked even without (or maybe even better) the writers trying to make it into a horror film. The story's so slow-paced, plus the characters have so many things on their plate already. They wanted to happen so many things in one film.The characters are already horrific, and adding a bad CGI monsters to it won't really help. The mother's a drunk, Father's a cheater, Daughter's a bulimic, and Son's an autistic. That backstory can already go on so many directions. Actually, the thing that made this film so stupid is that it's so drama-oriented. You don't know what's worse: the drama or the horror?The actors were actually great at their jobs, it's just the story that sucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insidious the remake but without being Insidious the remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Literally if The Darkness had been announced as an Insidious remake I would have believed it. There are so many things that are identical between the two films. The good news for them is that Insidious is freaking amazing so watching a similar story done nearly as well is worthy and was entertaining. It wasn't nearly as creepy and it did feel very cliché but it was still solidly entertaining. The cast was very good and the story was well written. Essentially if you liked Insidious or even the plethora of similar "Amityville Family gets haunted" style PG-13 horror like Sinister, The Conjuring, Possession and so on then you will really enjoy The Darkness. Literally the only thing stopping this from at least being a huge 9 is the fact that it is cliché and recycled in a lot of ways. Even the name itself "The Darkness" seems almost too stereotypical. It also lacks a truly great scary scene. There were certain moments in any good horror film that just get under your skin and The Darkness is lacking that "moment."The cast is very solid as I mentioned. Kevin Bacon fills the father role very nicely. Perhaps the script doesn't give him as much to work with as he could have but certainly his chemistry on screen and star power is enough to drive the film. Not to mention the fact how damn good this guy looks at FIFTY-EIGHT years old. he is actually believable as a middle-aged-ish guy with younger kids. He's also believable with Radha Mitchell who plays his wife and 15 years his junior. I've always liked Mitchell, especially in Silent Hill. I think she has a certain look that fits the tough scream queen image. She is a little underused in this film but she still plays the Mom role nicely. Much like Bacon though she is underdeveloped as a character. David Mazouz who was excellent on Fox's Touch plays a similar character here as an autistic boy haunted by ghosts. He obviously plays it well and it's a subtle role but very good for the type of character he is. Lucy Fry is also very good as the daughter of the family. Director Greg Mclean was behind the brilliant horror film and it's even more brilliant sequel, Wolf Creek so I know he has the eye for horror. He certainly sets a tone here and the film is very dark and creepy and commanding. I think it just lacks polish in some areas and it struggles to differentiate itself as we mentioned. It feels like the script was left over bits from stronger stories. Nonetheless, I'm not bashing the film. I liked it a lot. It definitely has it's moments and well worth the time. It just won't be as memorable as the other aforementioned titles. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moderately entertaining Poltergeist knock off with an American Indian mythology twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Darkness is, in my opinion, a pretty obvious Poltergeist knock off, with an American Indian mythology twist. This film follows much the same formula made famous by Poltergeist. It makes a few distinctions, by drawing on American Indian mythology but beyond that, its business as usual. That said, this film is in no way as creepy or frightening, as Poltergeist. The demons, look more like a bunch of bad extras from a cultural festival. Their evil is not really all that evil either. They feel more like bad tenants or squatters, who have personal hygiene issues. Hand washing in particular, is not their thing. That said, in fairness this is not a bad film. Its moderately entertaining and it has a good cast, including Kevin Bacon, who I have a lot of time for. His performance helps lifts this film and is complimented by a capable cast who generally share good chemistry.The family dynamic, in particular, is very believable in a middle aged, kind of yuppie-ish way.I give The Darkness a six out of ten. Its not exceptional but it is still quite watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Darkness", starring Kevin Bacon-The Following_tv, X-Men:First Class; Radha Mitchell-London Has Fallen, Silent Hill; Paul Reiser- Concussion, Beverly Hills Cop and Ming-Na Wen-Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._tv, ER_tv.I had high hopes for this movie-I love good scary movies-but I was very disappointed. I mean it looked good in the trailer, plus, it was opening on Friday the 13th. But, it just wasn't very scary. It was slow moving and did not reach any semblance of being good, until it was almost over. Kevin and Radha are a married couple with 2 kids and everyone in the family has problems. Kevin had an affair, Radha has started drinking-I guess the affair had something to do with that-the teenage daughter has an eating disorder and the pre-teen son is autistic. Kevin wants to smooth things over and get the family back together like they used to be and decides to take the family on a camping trip to the Grand Canyon- FYI: There is another couple with them camping, which is a cameo of Jennifer Morrison &amp; Matt Walsh. When the son accidentally goes cave exploring, he finds some rocks with strange carvings on them and decides to take them home-being autistic, I guess he doesn't know that national parks usually frown on such behavior-unknowingly releasing some evil supernatural spirits that come along, too. It seems that a long time ago, Indians had placed the rocks as guardians, to keep the evil spirits prisoners. Wow, they must be some powerful rocks! Anyway, strange noises are heard, water facets turn on by themselves-Ohhh that is so scary-and even animals appear in the house, unexpectedly. Paul is Kevin's boss and Ming-Na is his wife, who just happens to know a person that can help Kevin out by exorcising the evil spirits. Like I said earlier, I was disappointed. It's rated "PG-13" for violence, language and sexual content-no nudity- and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 32 minutes. I would not buy this on DVD. I wouldn't rent it either. If you really want to see it, I would wait until it comes to cable, if I was you.</fullReview>

It has a very respectable cast but it is really just as interesting as a observing evolution occurring and I do not have that kind of life expectancy! I did find it comical that a fire breaks out in the boys room, he is carrying a pack of matches and the father after arriving home is stopped by his ineffectual wife from kicking his little posterior. I was immensely disappointed. "So our son is an arsonist, he will grow out of it!" So 862 jump scares later we realize we have discovered an entirely new depressant that can be utilized to overcome the worst insomnia one could incur. Let us just realize that there in NOTHING new EVER. Just a repackaging of the same elements over and over again. All one can hope for is the repackaging is pieced together differently.

As with so many horror movies - the evil force only has a sliver of a chance to be remotely scary - because the family consists of idiots.The mother is an utter idiot incapable of proper communicating her feelings. The father is a stoic that could as well be a stranger to the family. The daughter seems to be an emotional and cognitive wreck - and the son at least has the excuse of being mentally retarded (or do you call it mentally challenged these days?).The family is insufferable but sadly the evil is even more incompetent than the family.All in all - this movie actually had OK-ish acting (except for the two children that were both fairly bad) but a terrible and uninspired story. There weren t too many scary scenes at all - and to qualify as a mystery movie - it would need considerably more lore.i get more scared by "the monster of the week" in any X-files episode.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He keeps leaving dirty hand prints everywhere......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blumhouse now are the name for horror films, but like later Hammer studio releases, the quality of their films are becoming increasingly poor, and this, despite starring everyone's favourite face of EE, Kevin Bacon.But he's really become Footloose and fancy free choosing roles like this...During a family camping trip at the Grand Canyon, a young boy stumbles upon an ancient Native American burial ground. He takes five sacred stones from there back to his suburban home, unaware that they contain a malevolent supernatural force.......We see horror films like this every other month, youngest child starts to see and hear supernatural things, but he is quiet and maybe has slight mental health problems, so the family just brush it off, even when he draws a big grey smoke like picture on his wall.Then things get a little stranger, and it starts to affect dad's work, and all of a sudden Paul Reiser gets involved, and predictably Bacons job is at risk, but not before he starts to believe that something sinister is happening in the house.Radha Mitchell spends most of the film looking sullen and depressed, and despite her having second billing, she does less than she did in London Has Fallen. Seriously, it should have been Bacon as a single parent, it would have made things a little more tense.Bacon is fine, he's always watchable, but it's gets to the point that you are observing Bacon more rather than watching him, trying to figure out if he's had any work done, because the man doesn't look 58, because the script is so poor.Things that are meant to shock are just plain laugh out loud funny, such as the strange cleansing of the house where the Exorciser is holding two bits of metal that move ever so slightly now and again, or the haunting moment where the daughter gets dirty hand prints over her face.And then the last act is upon us, and it just maunders to its boring conclusion.It's not very good, Bacon must be doing this for an easy payday, but at least he puts in a good performance.Uneventful stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is not a bad movie, either is not a great movie. We have here some good moments, and scares.The film show us a perfect family, doing a trip with friends. So, something bad happens and one kid (always a kid) do something wrong. Back to their house, strangers things starts to break the family. THE kid start talk to a ghost e all of sudden everything went bad. Just like this. Without spoilers.The "ghosts" aren't that good, for me, they were the bad things on that movie. Ridiculous even. But the tension is good. Bacon and Mitchel are great together, great actors.We have here all we already saw before. The medium, the problematic teenage, the strange kid and the perfect family. Same thing! But it works well. Is not bad at all. Go and watch this one on a cold rain day. It will help you to break the boredom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THE DARKNESS': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new supernatural horror flick from director Greg McLean (who also helmed 'WOLF CREEK' 1 &amp; 2, and 'ROGUE'). It's about a family dealing with a disturbing supernatural presence, after visiting the Grand Canyon with friends. The movie was written by McLean, Shayne Armstrong and S.P. Krause. It stars Kevin Bacon, Radha Mitchell (who also starred in 'ROGUE'), David Mazouz and Lucy Fry. It's a pretty disappointing film, especially coming from Greg McLean.The Taylors are on vacation at the Grand Canyon, with another family, when the son, Michael (Mazouz), stumbles across a dark supernatural presence. He unwittingly brings it home with the family, and really strange things begin happening; all involving the family's deepest fears. The whole time Michael appears to know what's going on, but he also seems possessed. The family turns to friends for help.I really enjoyed McLean's other horror flicks, so I was looking forward to this movie, but it definitely let me down. It's not that bad, until the end, but it's not good either. It's just really routine and unoriginal. The performances are decent, at least, and it's a little creepy. The ending is awful though; it's shockingly bad!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFKDfA8QZiM</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting family dynamics but lacks originality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a family holiday in the Grand Canyon a young boy with autism takes five black pebbles marked with symbols. These stones belonged to the Anasazi tribe and by removing them he inadvertently releases supernatural forces into his home. Not to be confused with Jaume Balagueró's Darkness (2002) talented director/writer Greg McLean of sleeper hit film Wolf Creek and underrated killer croc flick Rogue offers a supernatural horror in the vein of Poltergeist and Amityville Horror including their remakes.What really works in McLean's favour is the Taylor family is not made-up of the stereo type character models synonymous with the genre. No stranger to mainstream horror Kevin Bacon returns to genre looking fittingly pasty and washed out as a former philandering workaholic father Peter who is determined to change his ways. Incidentally, his wife Bronny effortless played by the excellent Australian actress Radha Mitchell is a recovering alcoholic mum. To add to their rocky relationship, their son Mikey is autistic and their teenage daughter Stephanie is bulimic. The cast deliver the obvious challenges as well as underlying pressures of the family dynamics engagingly. Worthy of note is Lucy Fry's Stephanie Taylor, the actress really portrays the teen angst and hysteria convincingly. Trian Long-Smith's Sammy Levin, the savvy, bright intern leaves an impression but is sorely underused possibly to avoid clichés with Bacon's Peter. Also writers McLean, Shayne Armstrong and Shane Krause effectively unfold some plot points, from Bronny's alcoholism to Peter's self obsessed boss Simon Richards played (notably) by Paul Reiser. Although a functional role, he gives background to Peter as well as moving the story forward with regards to his own family history. The derivative setting of American wealthy suburbia is eye-rolling. Yet, you kind of get the impression that Australia's McLean, Armstrong and Shane Krause intended this to possibly be set in Uluru (formerly Ayers Rock) rather than the Grand Canyon, maybe to appease producers. Also there's a choppiness that suggests there was another cut. As it plays out McLean offers, taps inexplicably turning on and doors closing by themselves. There are shadows in the background, demonic shapes in photos. The demons with animal headdress are creepy enough along with a few jump scares including a dream sequence with a wolf and a nasty dog attack. Johnny Klimek's music is particularly notable with it tribal-like beats and the sound design peaks when spiritual healing Hispanic women Teresa and granddaughter Gloria (salient Ilza Rosario) try to 'cleanse' the home Tangina Barrons' (Zelda Rubinstein) style. The corresponding mystical stone pebbles to each animal, wolf, snake, dog, crow, cow to their five un-rested spirits (with excellent earthy costumes) which the Anasazi tribe used to keep them at bay is an interesting element but like the family set-up there's little pay- off apart from lessons ? 1. A family should stick together no matter what 2. Don't remove items from an ancient cave or you'll unleash vicious demons that will break up your family, take your child or send you mad. To McLean's credit we get to see each animal practically (rather than CGI but disappointingly we never get to see the bull. Thankfully an attack on Mikey's grandmother's cat tastefully takes place off screen.Considering this feature is based on a true story that was relayed to McLean the build up follows all the usual horror tropes, things going bump in the night, investigating the cause, calling in the spiritual help and so on. There's even Exorcist homages with noises in the attic and Mikey's Mr Howdy-like imaginary friend Jenny. As the story develops the special effects also increase. While the portals, shadows and black hand prints and swirling clouds are finely executed as with many paranormal horrors the effects driven closing undermine the grounded set up. Instead of CGI for CGI's sake it may have worked in its favour for the family to physically race to return the stones. In true late 70s and 80's style during the end credits there's a shot leaving it open for a follow up or putting it to rest. Either way while it doesn't tread any new ground in terms of supernatural horror, those unfamiliar with the aforementioned supernatural films will certainly get a kick out of this and for old hats there's the alternative family set-up. That said, given McLean's creativity and originality with previous works this has too many moments of déj? vu and not enough scares to give The Darkness its own legs despite the well developed family drama foundation.Overall, worth checking out if only for the performances and creepy costume design.</fullReview>

However, there were many plot points that didn't go anywhere. Some characters only showed up for brief scenes and we're never seen again. It seemed as if these "brief characters" had a purpose and meaning for being in the film, but you never see them again. Also, the first 85% of the movie was like slow moving molasses and the last 15% went by in a flash and then the credits rolled.

Even Kevin Bacon couldn't save this miserable waste of celluloid from becoming what everyone already knew (evidenced by the complete lack of promotion) it was destined to be. The only question remaining is why movies like this continue to be made? Sure, everyone in Hollywood has a mortgage to pay, but until there's something worthy of embarrassing yourselves over, perhaps the screen writers (obviously taking time out from their table busing day jobs)might consider not using every trite gag in the bad horror movie book.If you waste your money on this in the hopes that Bacon can make this turkey taste like filet, you deserve every moment of what you get.</fullReview>

To be honest, I stepped out like 3 times before leaving the movie early so i don't even know or care how it ends but spare yourself from the monotony! The transparency/ingenuity is painful and I wish I left and got my refund the moment I saw that Footloose baconstrip on the screen of a "horror" film.. all he did was peg everyone's wives and yell at his own the whole time. Top-rated among people who've never seen a "horror film" before ever, I'm sure.</fullReview>

Echoes of POLTERGEIST reflect this haunting horror film about a family encountering malevolent Native American spirits AKA Anasazi who make their way into their home after a vacation trek to the Grand Canyon and communicating with the autistic youngest member (Mazouz) with spooky results. Well-cast and rather well directed by Greg McLean who collaborated on the hit-and-miss script with Shayne Armstrong and Shane Krause the film is better than expected in a rather well traversed genre flick.

		<fullReview>I nearly decided not to watch this horror due to its rating but I am really glad I did. The actors are all familiar faces to me with Kevin Bacon as the lead and David Mazouz (tv series Gotham) playing an autistic and quiet boy whose acting made the story convincing to me. To me there are different kinds of horror, there is gore, slasher, scary, psychological, haunted and violent. Unfortunately all get lumped together as the genre horror and a gore/violence fan will hate a haunted scary movie and vice versa. This is a haunted house film which is my favourite genre of horror and the effects are very convincing, not too fake, not too over the top, not too scary, just proper creepy like a good horror should be. Think house on haunted hill and poltergeist. Best horror of 2016 for me.</fullReview>

The plot had some promise but the execution was so lackluster it came off as boring and stupid. The characters are all unlikable and one dimensional. 95% of the acting is trash (With the exception of Kevin Bacon who actually tries). This film is filled with jump scares that would only scare a 5 year old. Despite some parts dragging on for longer than they should some scenes were unintentionally hilarious, Such as A fight between the mother and her daughter about anorexia which usually isn't a laughing matter. It escalates so quickly it turns into a full on fist fight after a minute. In conclusion this is easily the worst horror movie of the 2010's so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Darkness' would be a great movie if a hundred other similar movies hadn't preceded it and because of this, I found it very bland and unoriginal. It brought nothing new to the horror genre whatsoever and was what I would call a very stereotypical, run-of-the-mill American suburban ghost story that we've already seen too many times in recent years. Kevin Bacon plays his role well and this is probably the only real highlight of the entire film with the other cast members seeming too ineffective or unbelievable. The plot felt quite cheap and hollow and without any real 'scare' moments, this film has very little to offer. If you've seen Insidious or The Conjuring, you really aren't missing anything here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a quarter of the way through the latest supernatural Kevin Bacon film makes you think of and want to stop to re-watch Stir of Echoes, you know you're not watching the right movie.Well, to be honest, this isn't the movie for me. I don't believe in ghosts, haunted houses or roaming spirits so these kinds of movies never frighten me in the least. But, beyond my own personal beliefs, this movie was so A-B-C and so much like all the others: The Conjuring, Insidious, Paranormal Activities?It was kinda a bore. Oh. And because of which it's a chore, as well.The film's saving grace was the acting and it was competently shot. Plus, if you're a fan of all those other ghost stories that have sadly dominated the horror market of the past decade plus, you might love this. It'll fulfill your need to run through the same traps all the spirit movies fall into.Basically, a vacationing family other than the Brady's visit the Grand Canyon and bring back bad spirits with them to their L.A. residence. Despite some spouse tension, kid obstacles and some lazy past problems, the movie just follows the path of the stereotypical ghost story.I did like how it ended, and always love me some Kevin Bacon, but it's hardly a recommendation when 6 to 8 of these exact same movies come out every year for the past decade plus.***Final thoughts: Not supernatural, but if you are a Bacon-Lover, check out his recent indie film that was 20x better than this: Cop Car. Unless, of course, you'd rather just watch the same ole ooooohhhh ghost story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The DarknessBad direction, writing, and acting made this movie a struggle to watch. The movie starts out in the Grand Canyon to be some sort of juxtapose to the title of the movie. Bright landscape and colors that develop into the darkness to come. I wasn't impressed. The teenagers in this movie are stereotyped. The kid has something wrong with him, cliché. See The Shining, Six Sense, etc. The teenage girl has a serious issue with any parental figure and "much needed" shower scene, cliché. See Halloween, It Follows, Psycho, etc. More cliche's like birds showing up randomly, or dogs/cats getting upset. Is anything in this film original? Not even the synopsis is original. Family is terrorized by an ancient supernatural entity they unknowingly awakened and engages them in a fight for their survival. Yawn.Scenes do not end naturally and many times I was left wanting meaningful dialogue or more sustenance from the scene. Jump scares could take some notes from James Wan since this is a good example of how to do them wrong.Kevin Bacon mailed in another performance. I can't imagine he would go as far as to become another Bruce Willis or Robert DeNiro. The actions of his character sometimes don't make sense. Like how he deals with each of the members of his family.I enjoyed Radha Mitchell performance in this movie. If you're wondering, 'Where have I seen her before." It was probably the cult classic Pitch Black. She was also in Man on Fire but most people have forgotten that.Verdict: Don't waste your time or money.</fullReview>

How many spooky movies could you watch with family members who are still studying in middle school?

While fans of the original FOOTLOOSE may be horrified to see Kev looking as long in the tooth as he does here, Baby Boomers who missed that Rite of Passage may well enjoy a restful snooze when they bring their Great-Grandkids to a showing of DARKNESS. Though there's not only a musician credited with composing a score here, but three others for chiming in with "additional music" (not to mention a raft of itemized supplemental songs), the first twenty minutes or so of DARKNESS will have viewers wondering if they've wandered into a showing of THE SILENCE by mistake. An eerie quiet underscores the opening camping trip scenes, which include a lapse of logic (How exactly does "Michael" get out of the Demon Cave?) to prepare audiences for a plot holier than a wool suit left hanging in a moth hatchery.</fullReview>

But if you are a hardcore Horror fan then this movie isn't going to get a rise out of you in the least bit, but the usual fan base for Kevin and Rhada which consists of my mom and company will probably enjoy this light thriller. The movie has great acting and direction of story playing off a kid who has autism and never actually saying or showing the word until a hour into the movie. But where it fell short I believe was trying to work in to many story lines and directions it cut down the scary parts of the movie to almost non-existent.

		<fullReview>Anaasází (or, Anasazi) is what the Navajo Indians called a mysterious ancient Native American civilization (also known as the Ancient Puebloans) which existed around 1,000 years before Jesus walked the earth. The name has been translated as "Ancient Ones" or "Ancient Enemies", among other things. The Anaasází built seemingly inaccessible cliff dwellings throughout the region that is now known as the Four Corners area of the United States. The sudden, unexplained complete disappearance of the Anaasází has mystified archaeologists for 150 years. One theory is that the Anaasází underwent a profound change in their religious beliefs, some scholars even suggesting that this involved demons from Anaasází folklore. Native Americans consider the Urraca Mesa in northern New Mexico (to the east of the Four Corners) to be a gateway to the demon realm. Some parts of the Grand Canyon (to the west of the Four Corners) are said to be haunted. What's the relationship between these legends, which are so loosely connected by geography and a general belief in a supernatural evil? Well, the 2016 horror film "The Darkness" (PG-13, 1:32) ties these legends together. Unfortunately, the scariest thing about this movie is how bad it is.As the story begins, two families are camping together in the Grand Canyon. Joy and Gary Carter (Jennifer Morrison and Matt Walsh) have a teenage son named Andrew (Parker Mack). Peter and Bronny Taylor (played by Kevin Bacon and Rhada Mitchell, and, yes, I checked those spellings) have a teenage daughter named Stephanie (Lucy Fry) and a tween son called Mikey (David Mazouz), who happens to be autistic. After their families enjoy a cookout, the three kids wander off to check out a cool-looking rock formation. When Andrew and Stephanie climb higher for a better view, Mikey falls through the ground and into an ancient room constructed and used for some spiritual purpose. On a stone altar, Mikey finds five carved black stones, which he puts in his backpack. No one else is aware of any of this and Mikey either wasn't aware or didn't care about the rules in our national parks. To quote the Grand Canyon website: "Possessing, destroying, injuring, defacing, removing, digging, or disturbing from its natural state any plants, rocks, animals, mineral, cultural or archaeological resources? is prohibited." Oh, yeah, and ancient evil spirits. You probably shouldn't disturb or remove them either.Back home in L.A., bad things start happening to the Taylors. (The Carters aren't seen or mentioned again, so you can just forget about them.) Peter gets an attractive new assistant (Trian Long-Smith) at his architectural firm and his boss, Simon (Paul Reiser), practically dares Peter to sleep with her. Bronny, who rarely smiles, grows more sullen, drinks vodka straight out of the bottle, nurses a grudge about one of Peter's past indiscretions and fears that he's having another one. (Oh, and Peter and Bronny argue more and more about? pretty much everything.) Stephanie is a typically disagreeable teenage girl who develops an eating disorder and has wild mood swings. The only one in the Taylor family who seems happier than before is Mikey who now has a new imaginary friend whom he calls Jenny. The family writes off Mikey's imagination (and his increasingly bizarre behavior) as manifestations of his autism.The film's focus is primarily on what happens to the individual family members and the bonds between them as things go from bad to worse, but there are also strange happenings inside casa Taylor. Scary shadows are seen, strange noises are heard, unusual animals appear, the neighbor's dog starts barking a lot more and black handprints appear on walls, bedsheets and, eventually, people. Fearing some kind of haunting, Bronny discusses all of this with Simon's wife, Wendy (Ming-Na Wen) who once used a Native American spiritualist to heal her sick son. Next thing we know, Teresa Morales (Alma Martinez) and her granddaughter, Gloria Ortega (Ilza Rosario), stop by the house for coffee and an attempted exorcism."The Darkness" is a derivative, condescending mess of a movie which is not frightening in the least. Director and co-writer Greg McLean has said, "The story is based on a true story that was relayed to me first-hand many years ago about an actual haunting." If that's true, the person who "relayed" the story must have been helping Bronny finish off those bottles of vodka because this story's mythology is an awkward and enhanced combination of legends separated by many centuries and many hundreds of miles, but everything focuses on a specific spot in the Grand Canyon in the 21st century ? and plays out like "Poltergeist". The film's scariest images are black handprints, which are as horrifying as a careless auto mechanic coming home from work without washing up. And, one time, black liquid spills from Mikey's mouth, but, like many details in this movie, that moment doesn't clearly connect to anything.There are almost no characters to root for and they're mostly caricatures (all men are pigs, all women are either bitches or crazy, all thin girls have an eating disorder, all autistic kids are to be feared and so are Native Americans). Character development isn't bad, but most of it takes place on that camping trip, after which three of the characters don't reappear and I strongly suspect that whole sequence was an afterthought in the film's development. The acting is decent, but with unlikeable characters and a disjointed and ridiculous script, who cares? The movie's climactic scene has some good visuals, but it's tantamount to finding a single puddle of water in the desert ? and about as satisfying. In my opinion, the only way to enjoy "The Darkness" is with the lights off. And the movie projector. "D"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you're looking for a Kevin Bacon flick to watch on Friday the 13th</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>then go back and watch Friday the 13th again, because this one isn't worth much.Family (of fully clichéd stereotypes: hard-working father who is too busy to notice what is happening around him, specifically his wife's drinking problem, his daughter's anorexia, and his autistic son's new invisible "friend", and his new rock collection) finds themselves being followed by vaguely defined spirits after a trip to the Grand Canyon. They want their rocks back.Kevin Bacon does as well with the material as he could, and the film does have a couple of eerie visuals, like the coyote casually walking through the house (which turns out to be only a dream, which provoked me to shout " Oh, **** off!" at the screen)Film contradicts itself several times: Bacon is furious at his son for setting his room on fire, but in the next scene, he casually acts as though it is no big deal. He also says it will be easy to paint over and repair the damage, but at no point in time does he do anything about it.Daughter's anorexia (which was a needless addition to being with) is also pointless, because it is dropped after only one or two scenes, and never mentioned again.Typically lame PG13 horror feels like it had every scene trimmed slightly, possibly just to keep the run-time down, to fit more screenings in during the course of the day. The opening sequence in the Grand Canyon had a couple of times when it was difficult to tell where people were standing in relation to each other, the first scene of Kevin Bacon and his wife in bed had something obviously edited out, and the closing credits stop shortly after beginning, and have a brief shot of the rocks again, in what appear to be a post credits scene set-up for a sequel, but even that scene is cut short. If only there was a way to cut short that impotent little bitch with two accounts, who goes around voting down every review, regardless of the title, or whether the review is positive or negative. "0 out of 2 users found this comment useful". F off and die, impotent little bitch.</fullReview>
