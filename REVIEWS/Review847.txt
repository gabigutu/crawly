		<shortDescription>Seems almost an accidental classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if George Lucas really knew what he had in this picture--surely the screenplay seemed funny enough, and the thought of the cars and the period music was enticing--but did he really know these "unknown" actors would bring these characters to life? It seems almost a fluke, shot in 29 days and on a tight budget, but "American Graffiti" is a classic. It is perhaps pure nostalgia, mixing pathos and humor, sadness and craziness, hope and reflection in quiet little bursts of excitement. After cruising with Milner all night, teenage Carol hates to say goodbye but does, waving from her porch with the light on; Toad survives one bad accident after another, but his real moment is in hearing praise from his date (fantastic, husky-voiced Candy Clark, dolled up like a speeding Sandra Dee) just before she says good night; after chasing his dream date all night, Kurt (Richard Dreyfuss, green and anxious, and appealingly bemused) finally gets to talk to the stunning blonde wonder on the telephone, where she whispers a wrenching goodbye. The whole movie is steeped in reflection. It has great, great humor, yet it leaves one with a bittersweet melancholia. For yesterday is in the past, with our music, our memories and our hesitant farewells. ***1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The American Garden</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The summer of 1962, for these four Youths, it's the closest they will ever get to the Garden of Eden. The music, the cars, the drinking, the dancing, and the innocence, American Graffiti is a harder film to make than Star Wars. To identify with the generation and to create truth from the characters, George Lucas's masterpiece is American Graffiti. From the town Big shot, the future Race car Driver, the Perfect Couple, and the local Nerd, it is amazing how the audience identifies with all these characters from out past. Like a page out of the high school year book, this movie jumps back into the early 60's, before the war, before the lines were drawn, the age of innocence in America would soon be coming to an end. This is the last party of the summer before the dream finally ends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Teen Film Ever Made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I just love it when guys peel out." -Debbie DunhamAmerican Graffiti is the best film about teenagers. It actually has a point, unlike the other teenage films where all that they do is get drunk and party. American Graffiti is about different types of teenagers doing different things on the last night that they all have together in 1962 after graduating. They all actually learn about themselves and what they want to do with their lives. One of the olderteenagers, Curt, is planning on leaving the next day. Steve is trying to work out his relationship with Curt's sister, while John and Terry have their own dates for the night. American Graffiti is a wonderful film on many levels. It is both funny and serious. A great direction by George Lucas and a fine cast with RonHoward, Richard Dreyfuss, Cindy Williams, Paul LeMat, Charles Martin Smith,Candy Clark (Oscar-nominated), MacKenzie Phillips, Harrison Ford. One of thebest films of the 70's and the only teen film in my memory that has had thepleasure of being nominated for Oscar- Best Picture. 10/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The single-greatest teen-age cruising film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Graffiti, voted in 1998 to the American Film Institute's list of 100 superlative films, is as good today as it was upon its release in 1973. Countless films (such as Linklater's excellent Dazed and Confused) have borrowed heavily from Lucas' blueprint of multiple characters and storylines punctuated by wall to wall rock music. If possible, you should try to see the 1998 documentary that accompanies the DVD release, as it provides a wealth of information directly from Lucas, Coppola, LeMat, Ford, Clark, Dreyfuss, Howard, and many others about the creation of the film from concept to box-office phenomenon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true American classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As many people know, George Lucas is most famous for the fact that he wrote a certain series of fantasy films. Most of those films certainly were a great achievement, but one thing that many Star Wars fans overlook is the other entries in Lucas' list of directorial credits; one of which is this film, American Graffiti. The movie tells the story of the last night in town for a bunch of school kids about to leave to go to college. Now, this might not seem like a great base for a classic movie to work from; and it isn't, it's the handling that makes it great. In spite of his latest batch of movies, Lucas has shown with this movie that he has the talent to create an innovative and groundbreaking movie in spite of the plot. It's this fact that made Star Wars work so well, and it's nice to see the same effort transplanted into an earlier film that doesn't have the special effects and grandiose that Star Wars had. The energy and vitality that Lucas gives his multiple stories makes for a great ride, and American Graffiti is a lot of fun throughout.The film is most notable for the way that it captures the American youth of the sixties. It benefits from a great soundtrack that adequately helps to achieve this, and includes the likes of Buddy Holly and The Beach Boys. The film takes place in one night, and makes use of a number of different characters and story lines; all of which are interesting and unique. A lot of which are also really funny, and this is where my favourite part of American Graffiti comes in. The film works because it's such a good time, and the way that Lucas shows us that ensures that we have just as good a time as the characters on screen are having. The events that befall the characters in the movie will no doubt touch a nerve with anyone that has gone through childhood - things such as splitting up with your girlfriend, to being forced into doing things that could get you into trouble...all the way to asking an adult to go into a store to buy alcohol for you are shown with great care, and show that Lucas obviously knew what he was doing when he took on this movie. On the whole...it's very good stuff indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Much For Being 17</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching this movie on May 31, 2002, the night before my high school graduation and when I watch this film, it reminded me of the things that happened with me throughout my senior year: from a guy I knew, who cheated on his girlfriend with a cheerleader, to the terrorist attack that tore America apart; causing Americans to go against one another, from the crushes, the heartbreaks, prom night, to Spider-Man being the movie of the year, graduation rehearsal, and technology becoming the new aspect in my life and when I watched American Graffiti, it reminded me of when the good times meant something with those around me.The film takes place in 1962 California, a pre JFK assassination which showed the innocence of youth crusin' the streets and talking to buddies outside of their windows as they drive; now, in today's world it's a bloodbath. Even the music played a part of innocence back in the 60's where artist such as Fats Domino, Beach Boys, Bill Haley and the Comets, The Platters, even Chuck Berry were a pain in the butt to most of the adults of that time, but a joy. Now? Songs about sex, drugs, and murder have become the new waves to today's youth of America.American Graffiti has four teenage boys who cruise in different directions in their hometown where some question their own faith. The main character in the story is Curt Henderson (Richard Dreyfuss) who is about to leave east for college where he is dubious on whether or not he should leave town in order to start a new life. Yet his friend Steve (Ron Howard) encourages him to leave and tells him not to crawl back into his little nest. All night, Curt cruises the streets with his sister Laurie (Cindy Williams) and Steve, where he sees a blonde woman driving a white T-Bird who mouths "I love you." Now Curt is on the hunt to find this blonde woman as he encounters a gang called The Pharaohs who want to pound him after he scratches the gang's car.The next character is Steve whose Curt's best friend and happens to be dating Laurie and wants to rush things as quickly as possible. He wants to break up so they can see other people; but later when they are named King and Queen at the homecoming dance, they are together again where he tries to have sex with her. Yet, things don't work out well between them, and Steve questions his own destiny on whether he should stay or not, leaving Curt to be right as usual.John Milner (Paul LeMat) is the hotshot of the state who doesn't want to leave town because he is afraid that everything will change. After the beginning of the film he talks to Curt about "The Pickin's are really getting' slim" that everything is changing in terms of music, girls, crusin' the street even from his friends departing. He cruises the streets where he accidentally picks up an underage girl (MacKenzie Phillips) who becomes more of a pal to John as they listen to Wolfman Jack and hear good old time music. Yet, John is up for a little competition, as a new drag racer by the name of Bob Falfa, (Harrison Ford) wants to race him.The other character of the gang is Terry "The Toad," Fields (Charles Martin Smith) the nerd who drives a mophead, gets to take Steve's car for a ride in the town. Yet, as he tries to impress people, he meets one girl Debbie (Candy Clark) who decides to go with Terry after she hears about him talking about his "new" car. Terry who thinks he is a reject is now proved that he is a man as he cruises the streets with the girl on his arms, and just trying to prove that even nerds have their moments as well.American Graffiti in my opinion is a retrospect of the good times that people had when everything was innocent, in an era where crusin' was important, especially rock n' roll. But as time changes on, people will always remember the good times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An eventful summer night for teenagers in 1962 California town</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This multi-layered DVD version of "American Graffiti" is the best trip back to the summer of 1962 Hollywood ever had to offer! The eventful night when freshly graduated high school friends contemplated their futures while immersed in small town America's car-hops, drive-in movies &amp; doo-wop music (the soundtrack is one of the best featured in ANY film!), is shown in "real time".Richard Dreyfuss is perfect as the smart kid, ready to drive off to college the next morning, but wondering if he's doing the right thing. Ron Howard and Cindy Williams get some practice for their soon to follow "Happy Days", while Charles Martin Smith and Candy Clark are wonderful as the goofus who wants to show a pretty girl a good time.Wolfman Jack plays himself (and cupid) when he plays a very special request going out from Richard Dreyfuss to his dream girl Suzanne Sommers. Look for a pre-teen McKenzie Phillips and a young Harrison Ford in minor roles. This film is a big winner in my book!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Where were you in '62?" (Original ad)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nostalgic look at one night/morning of a small California town and some of its teenagers. Story-wise this is nothing new--all the stereotypes are in place--the loving/bickering couple (Ron Howard and Cindy Williams); the rebel (Paul Le Mal) stuck with a 13 year old (Mackenzie Phuillips); the nerd (Charles Martin Smith) having a disastrous date with a blonde (Candy Clark); the hood (Bo Hopkins) showing the good boy (Richard Dreyfuss) a night out and Harrison Ford and Suzanne Somers in small parts. What makes this movie better than average is the great direction by George Lucas--he fills the Cinemascope screen masterfully; the non-stop soundtrack of 50s/60s hits; a great script and the cast of then-unknowns. It's incredible to see some of these actors so young (especially Ford and Dreyfuss) and full of life. Without this cast, this movie would probably have long-since been forgotten.So, no great shakes, but very sweet and nostalgic with some good acting. Worth catching. Try to see it letter-boxed or on a big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's be the way we are not going to be anymore for just one more night!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Graffiti was a compilation of pop culture pique, a harbinger of political changes, and the birth of an era that explodes the "Leave it to Beaver America" simply by saying farewell to it!!!...Set in a small town in Southern California, with a bunch of people who's existence in 1962 means the 13th and final year of the fifties, it correlates a cosmic awareness with an innocent societal disagreement.... People are happy, but not happy enough to want to stay the same.... The constant bond throughout the film is Wolfman Jack, the "supercool" disc jockey who creates a thousand different images of himself just by virtue of what he says on the radio...He is illuminating as well as socially influential to a bunch of naive teenagers....The music in this movie is extremely entertaining, as it signifies the end of an Eisenhower style Utopia.. The couples that are paired off in this movie homogenize the attitudes and aspirations of these precocious 1962 teenagers, who are on the verge of growing up!! All of the characters in this film have an imperviousness to the objections related to a perceived totalitarianism brought on in the sixties, not just because the radical aspect of the decade has yet to be, but also, because locking horns with the authority figures is not second nature to them ...(Even Big John Milner)... The bevy of Radicalism which besieges our nation over the remainder of this decade, (the 1960's) created a metamorphosis in social behavior that would change all Americans, even the people living in the town of Graffit, California!!! This movie superbly exemplifies the phrase "The calm before the storm" It gives the entire movie audience a crystal ball concept analysis report that sparks a bittersweet realization and empathy for everyone who plays a significant role in this George Lucas masterpiece!! Director George Lucas has never been better...The cast is sensational!!and the film's unassuming demeanor surprisingly captures the honor of being one of America's greatest films on record!!! Five stars!! No question!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The great, seminal '60s nostalgia flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was born at the beginning of the next decade--1970--yet "American Graffiti" was a chord that rippled throughout my life.My father, who, like George Lucas, grew up in California's Central Valley, said this movie perfectly captured what it was like to grow up there--street cruising, hot rodding, picking up chicks, pulling pranks. Though this movie necessarily sidesteps the boredom inherent in growing up in the pesticide-choked San Joaquin Valley, the place itself is not as important the time it explores. It was a time just before the 1960s descended into the beginning of the end of American culture--the prototypical middle America that existed in almost all its small towns and now has substantively disappeared thanks to the urbanization and suburbanization of much of this country. The ensemble cast, including so many that went on to become hugely successful in Hollywood--Ron Howard, Cindy Williams (well, with Laverne &amp; Shirley at least), Richard Dreyfuss, and of course Harrison Ford (not to mention Lucas himself)--is handled with great skill from such a young director and reinforces the mystery why Lucas has so horribly mishandled Star Wars Eps. I and II. Lucas simply has been at the Ranch too long and his brilliant career has arrived parked in the garage at a large, entirely perfunctory business and media empire.Anyway, regardless of Lucas' drift far away from the cutting edge, "American Graffiti" still stands as a kind of monument to his precocity. It is the kind of movie that hits every note with effortless precision, which I think is less the effort of great editing as it is a combination of youthful exuberance and actors and a director at essentially the beginning of their ascent as some of the best in the business. This movie also withstands the test of time simply because it works magically both for those who have no particular emotional connection to the '60s and for those who were there on nearly equal levels. There is tremendous humor and naturalistic character play and dialog that few can help but be drawn into. Anyone with any sense of history will acknowledge that all the characters are standing at the edge of the deflowering and self-destruction of America in the '60s. It is a time of tremendous innocence, change, and harrowing decisions. The Bay of Pigs, Cuban Missile Crisis, and Vietnam haven't happened yet. With Iraq and terrorism chewing at our consciousness every day, it's pretty easy for modern youth to identify and yearn for the nostalgia of such innocence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thanks George Lucas !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to believe that this year marks the 30th anniversary of "American Graffiti".Other reviewers have already made mention of the fact that the outstanding success of this landmark film was almost single handedly responsible for igniting the "retro" craze that quickly grew into a major international subculture and is still going strong today. Although, back in the '70s we used the word "nostalgia". The movie's soundtrack album, which was nothing more than a compilation of 1950s and early 60s Top 40 hits, generated massive sales figures across the globe and immediately triggered a flood of similar vinyl offerings from other record companies. I turned 13 in 1973 and, like so many teenagers of the time, I totally lost interest in the music of the day and started to collect many of the aforementioned compilation albums.Again, as others have correctly pointed out, the initial retro scene was mainly confined to the musical side of things which included the establishment of "Oldies" radio stations. It wasn't long, however, before the general mood of nostalgia became more widespread with an increasing number of people becoming interested in other pop culture commodities of the era such as movies,TV shows, cars and clothes.Pretty soon the whole thing exploded and the "Good Old Days" suddenly became big business. And why not? There's some fabulous entertainment to be found in the archives for those who care to look.Give me 'dem ole' time movies any day of the week! In fact, when you look back, I think we owe a debt of gratitude to George Lucas and the gang for giving us "American Graffiti". It started a positive and enjoyable marketing trend which has brought a great deal of pleasure to millions over the years. And that's a pretty nice legacy for any movie to leave behind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The American Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1973. It was the ten year anniversary of JFK's assassination. The US was still in Vietnam. College students were dying and being beaten during protest demonstrations. Watergate was happening. Rock stars from the psychedelic era of music were dropping like flies. America had officially completed the decade long process of losing it's innocence. It was gone. Then something funny happened. A young film maker who was trying to make a name for himself in Hollywood made a movie that was supposed to be simple. It wasn't supposed to be important. But it was. That movie was "American Graffiti"."American Graffiti" is a story about one night in the lives of a group of small town teens. They are all on the verge of something great, but none of them know it yet. That something is called growing up. This night is their farewell to innocent youth. It is an obvious parallel to what America was about to go through. Within a couple of years, most of the people that the film's characters represent would be affected by the chaotic events that occurred in this country. But on this night, none of that existed. These kids were still dealing with the all important activities of cruising, muscle cars, going steady, street racing, the choice between beach music and rock &amp; roll, and whether or not they should wait a year before going off to college. It is the last great American night.Why is this film so important? It was made during a troubled time in America. People seemed to have lost pride in themselves and in their country. We had changed. This simple little movie changed that. It reminded us of what we used to be like. It reminded us of what we could be again. It was about good times. And the country needed a good time. We needed to go cruising for girls (or boys) while listening to Wolfman Jack crank out rock &amp; roll classics. We needed to play pranks on each other without the fear of violent retribution. We needed to be innocent again. The movie did not make us innocent again, but it reminded us that we could be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Yardstick for Teen films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of two teenagers on the final night of the security of their hometown, before moving away to college. The first, Curt Henderson played by Richard Dreyfuss, is having second thoughts while the other, Steve Bolander, played by Ron Howard in a pre-cursor to his role as Ritchie Cunningham in Happy Days, feels more comfortable about leaving. As the events of the night unfurl, they explore whether they are making the right decision. If they stay home and don't go away to college they could end up like their friend John, a man several years their senior who has never stopped being a teenager. Curt gets advice from a number of people over the course of the night such as his former teacher, his friend John Milner and DJ Wolfman Jack. All express the opinion that he should go away and experience life a bit. Steve on the other hand, realises that he is not as adventurous and would rather have the security of his hometown and his Girlfriend.The film is a series of amusing vignettes of their last night together as teenagers before they move into Adulthood. It is one of those films where everything falls into place and every line seems totally believable. A film I find it easy to lose myself in, a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My own past.... and it was so great !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1962, I was 19 years old. So, don,t ask me if I can relate to the movie American Graffiti. Music, emotions, friends, drive-ins, THAT WAS MY LIFE.. . and many scenes remind me of that good time, before making adult decisions.Darn, Curt leaves friends and family to persue studies in the East. I left friends and family to start my carreer as a jounalist in a small town weekly newspaper in 1963. And YES, I sured danced to music and songs provided by a real little musical groups. The Platters were standard fare for slow dances. Those sock ups dances in gymnasiums were soooooo full of different kinds of emotions. My Wolfman Jack was Joey Reynolds, then a fast talking DJ, at WKBW, in Buffalo, that came in strong at night in Montreal. And yes, I went back years later to my old high school to walk in the halls, like Curt, and remember ... remember friends that I still had and those that had moved into their own world of responsabilities and out of mine. All the songs in me movie can stick to something I lived listening to them, as they came out, got airplay and made me dance or fall in love, if not both. My Mel'S Drive In was a A &amp; W drive in and, yes, in our gang there was a 1957 Chevrolet, with a boosted motor under the hood. Milner would have loved to drive it. I could go on and on.... Don't ask me if it's a great movie. For me, it's a window on my youth and, darn, did I have a great time. So, for me, the movie is GREAT !. I always watch it with a broad smile on my face. No nostalgia goose bumps for me. Life is great also today but when I watch American Graffiti, I have the immense pleasure of reliving my teenage years and enjoy the magic of them, with all my heart and soul. Thanks Lucas !!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"American Graffiti" was the first real film to deal primarily with the lives of teenagers. Several teens have just graduated high school and are now standing at a crossroads. On their last real night of youth and freedom, they all learn about themselves and what they really want in their adult lives. The cast, led by Richard Dreyfuss, is superb. Ron Howard, Paul LeMat, Cindy Williams, Charles Martin Smith, and Candy Clark (Oscar-nominated) all have their moments as well. Look for a young Harrison Ford as a hot-rodder who has the need for speed. The screenplay and direction are impressive and so is the film as a whole. 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's pretty much what sums this movie up. Everyone is graduating and it's their last night together, and how they spend it turns up to be in pretty funny situations. There is what they might call a Revenge of the Nerds type of situation, a kid and a rebel hottie, a man finally getting a dangerous adventure, and a questioning relationship finally has closure.I can see where this movie had such impact back in the 70's, but to be honest, I wasn't that impressed. I think maybe I was expecting too much because of the fact that this movie is practically mentioned everything people bring up cinema of the 70's. Also, it was mentioned in a few of my film books and one of the funniest movies of all time.I would recommend this for movie buffs, just so they could say that they at least saw it, but honestly, I think it's lost some effect for this generations. But I would never diss this movie, just for the fact it had me on the floor sometimes in laughter, and that line "Your car is uglier than I am!". LOL! 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is stunning. It pulls you in and convinces you you've just spent an entire evening with a bunch of teens whose destinies will be shaped by the events that transpire on the screen.George Lucas, who loved cars and racing himself, filmed this time capsule of his own high school era (the early sixties) in less than a month. Of course, the planning and writing of the movie took much longer. The amazing speed in which this movie was filmed, however, is an indicator of the genius of Mr. Lucas.One of the biggest stars, who receives no notoriety, is the radio, which narrates the story as the action takes place. The songs never stop except for a brief few moments when Steve's car is stolen. This is only to heighten the tension of the scene.The opening song, "Rock Around the Clock" tells you we're going to be up all night as Terry "The Toad" loses control of his Vespa pulling up to Mel's Drive In (Actor, Charles Martin Smith admits he really did lose control of the Vespa and Lucas insisted the scene be used exactly as it happened).Lucas used speakers blaring out from behind buildings rather than dubbing the sound to give the effect you are listening to the radio from the cars as the teens "drag the gut" throughout the night.The radio continues to croon out its commentary as it blares out the Big Bopper's "Heeeeellooo Baaaaby" (from Chantilly Lace) as Terry is confronted by a thug who has stolen the car he is driving for the night (while trying to steal it back) to when Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) enters the radio station (with radio tower doubling as a church spire) seeking wisdom and advice from above (Wolfman Jack) while the radio plays "Crying in the Chapel." The best moment of the movie, I believe, is the exchange between Curt and Wolfman, where Curt realizes the D.J. he has been convinced is just a local station employee relaying The Wolfman's voice - is, in fact, the actual Wolfman. Then again, there are so many wonderful moments...The moment Curt is successful in sabotaging Officer Herford's car (and earns the chance to be a Pharoah), the jabs and jives of each other's cars between John Milner (Paul Le Mat) and Bob Falfa (Harrison Ford) as they prepare to race, the parting of Milner and Carol (Mackenzie Phillips) as John drops her off from their "date," everything that transpires as Terry endeavors to score himself and his date "some brew"...If you can walk away from this movie without being affected in some way by the music and the characters, it's with great wonder and stupefaction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was an innovator in so many ways. Essentially following a group of teens around during one night in 1962, American Graffiti essentially paved the way for a lot of things. First of all, it was one of the first movies that had multiple character studies happening, inter cutting from one to the next, was the movie that got Lucas noticed, and most of all, seemed to star every young actor that later went on big, Ron Howard, Cindy Williams, Mackenzie Phillips, Wolfman Jack, Richard Dreyfus, Susanne Somers, Wolfman Jack, Susanne Somers, and Paul LeMat . The best performances here come from Dreyfus of course, who was just amazing in his early roles, because he was just cackling with energy (see Duddy Kravitz as well as a great example) and Paul LeMat who hasn't had quite the career as everyone else in the cast, but still shined in amazing roles (Melvin and Howard being an excellent example).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's nice, and I'm sure George Lucas appreciates it, to put all the Star Wars hype aside for a moment and realize that way back in 1973 George Lucas made a film called "American Graffiti" that had nothing at all to do with Star Wars, and is a very good movie."American Graffiti" follows a number of high school students and recent graduates in a small town on a late summer night in the early 1960s. Two of them (Curt and Steve) are planning to go to college. Unlike my experience, staying in their home town is actually an attractive, or at least viable option, so whether or not they will go is a very serious question that the movie revisits often.On this night, we meet Curt and Steve and their friends, and over the course of the night, various people have different adventures, occasionally crossing paths. I learned from watching an interview with George Lucas that inter-cutting the 4 major character stories was a revolutionary idea when Lucas made this movie. It allegedly made the movie a difficult sell for him, but one has to admire his talent for thinking of the idea, and his creative conviction for sticking with his plan. Compared to telling the stories in the traditional linear fashion, the inter-cutting helps to tie the movie together, emphasizes the relationships between the characters and gives the audience a feeling of *being there* watching the events unfold instead of being told a story.It would be completely unjust to review "American Graffiti" without mentioning the music. As a modern film-goer, I took for granted that the movie was filled with songs from the time period in which it was set. Watching the "making of" documentary, I learned that this was also a revolutionary idea of George's. Although the film-makers put a lot of effort into integrating the music, so that, for example, it would seem to come from a car stereo where appropriate, I found that the music supported the movie more by the atmosphere it created and the 60's associations that the songs brought to mind.I was born in 1979, so unlike George and the films' other writers, I completely missed the 60s, and even the 70s (when the film was made). It is a great testament to the quality of the acting that I completely believed in the movie's characters and even strongly identify with them. George Lucas wanted to make this movie to document his experiences cruising in California as a high school student. Forty years later, I am happy to have had this same experience by watching "American Graffiti".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathtaking!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the ground-breaking work by George Lucas, loosely based on his friends and his experiences as a teenager living in the San Joaquin Valley at the beginning of the 1960s, a time of gentle naiveté and innocence. There are no words to describe the edgy sweetness and humor that permeates this ensemble story of friends and enemies, jocks, brains, and punks maneuvering through the stultifying heat of the last weekend of summer vacation, 1962. American Graffiti is a comedy, a drama, a tragedy, a musical, and a reminder of what small-town America once was, a mere forty years ago. From its breezy humor to its excruciating last moments (I remember theater-goers stunned in their seats, sobbing after the credits were done), Lucas's first major hit hits home. American Graffiti is pure magic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While born three years after the events in the film, I could still relate to the plight of being a teenager on the threshold to adult life. I think it takes a pretty insensitive person not to be captivated by this excellent movie (boring? - because just one car blew up, or what?!). This was the 3rd or 4th time I saw it, and it is just getting better. It is unusual to see filmmaking of this caliber coming from Hollywood (not least when considering Lucas' latest offering - blech!), but like movies like "The Year My Voice Broke" and "My Life as a Dog", "American Graffiti" tells us something about where we came from, without being dull or preachy. ***? out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivating and Pleasant Movie Create a Glimpse of The 60's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Lucas is mostly known for presenting to the world Star Wars, but surely American Graffiti is another successful and memorable film made by him. The story isn't the most profound but this doesn't matter because it so funny and delightful to watch. It's wonderful see a movie, having such an 50's/60's atmosphere present in it. You certainly dive into the 60's as a result of the good job in picturing the essence of this particular time, for the way how were their hairstyles, their clothing even how they used to dance. However what really caught my attention were the cars and the soundtrack. The classic cars had charm, which most of the cars nowadays lack, and their design made each model unique and fascinating. The soundtrack is so catchy and enjoyable that in some moments you really want to have experienced or be in that film, due to the immersion that was created in some scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Graffiti 1973</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Graffiti 1973 Director George Lucas Starring Ron Howard, Richard Dreyfus, Harrison Ford Set in 1962, director George Lucas in one of his pre Star Wars outings takes the audience onto the streets of a small southern California town to tell the story of four friends on the last night of summer vacation. The film opens at dusk where the main characters meet at local hangout Mels Diner to make plans for the night ahead. Steve Bolander played by Ron Howard is set to leave the town the next morning to go to college along with his friend Curt Henderson played by Richard Dreyfus who reveals that he is undecided about going and may spend another year at school. The Other main characters Terry the local nerd and John Milner racing legend and tough guy are sad their friends are leaving town, but are keen to make the most of the last night together. As night falls the characters head off to cruise the streets and the action takes us in and out of the finest collection of hot rods you will ever see in one movie set to the soundtrack of 50s and 60s hits echoing out of car radios as all the kids listen to local radio DJ and urban myth Wolfman Jack. Throughout the movie Steve and Curt wrestle with the decision of whether to leave town for college the next day to study for a better future or stay with their friends and family meeting girlfriends past and present and encountering local cops and Street gangs through the course of the night. Terry picks up local blonde Debbie impressing her with Steves car which he has been left to look after while Steve goes to college trying his best to impress her with lies about how many other cars he owns (he drives a scooter) Whilst cruising the streets John does his best to get himself a date for the night from a car full of girls cruising alongside him on main street, but gets tricked into taking one of the girls little sister Carol played by Mackenzie Phillips . At first John is annoyed but despite being the local tough guy decides to take care of her like she was his own little sister and the on screen relationship between the two characters is superb as John is taunted by out of town trying to take his title of fastest guy in the valley racer Bob Falfa played by Harrison Ford. Some of the kids spin stories on who and where their DJ hero and soundtrack to their lives DJ Wolfman Jack is "He blasts that thing out of Mexico", "He is black and fly around broadcasting from a plane" In reality he broadcasts from a station just outside of town. One of the best scenes of the film is where Curt meets the Wolfman who pretends to be his own assistant rather than reveal his identity. On hearing his struggle of should I stay or go to college Wolfman gives him some advice which ultimately influences Curt's decision. The film culminates in a race between John and Bob Falfa in the early dawn and with Steve and Curt making their respective decisions about going to college. An on screen narrative reveals the fates of the four main characters. I have seen American Graffiti many times first when I was younger than the characters in the movie, but even now at the grand old age of fifty the film absorbs you into the twilight world of hanging out with your friends. The characters are strong and well-crafted and most of us will recognize elements of our own friends past and present amongst them. It's like a night out without leaving the comfort of your own sofa. 5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Lucas's charming coming of age film. Set in the 1950s a group of teenagers spend their last night of the summer before going off to college or embarking on life after high school. Lucas rounded up a sensational group of unknowns for the roles. Paul LeMat cruises the strip in his hot rod while Harrison Ford, in his first role, searches for him in his hot rod to challenge him to a drag race to determine who's the best. Ron Howard and girlfriend Cindy Williams try to break up and dorky but lovable Terry the Toad (Charles Martin Smith) gets laid. Richard Dreyfuss agonizes whether he should go to college. Critics and directors voted American Graffiti #77 on the American Film Institute's 100 best films list. The film is a quiet little film very different from Lucas's smash hit four years later with Star Wars.</fullReview>

He finally flies off to college in place of Ron Howard. In Close Encounters of the Third Kind, he flies off with aliens. I wish the soundtrack included more real rock and roll and less doo-wop.

		<fullReview>"American Graffiti" is fun-filled. The story is basically OK about four high school graduates in California who are going to remember the good times they had. Richard Dreyfuss as Curt Henderson is a guy who thinks that every girl who says "hi" is ugly and then suddenly he meets a blonde in a t-bird and is searching for her for nothing. Ronny Howard as Steve Bolander is ruining his last night with his girlfriend Laurie(Cindy Williams) because he thinks that seeing other people while he is in college would strengthen their relationship. Paul Le Mat as John Milner (probably the most coolest guy you will ever know then any other character in another movie) is out on the town and picked up a fourteen year old girl named Carol(Mackenzie Phillips). Last is Charlie Martin Smith as Terry Fields who gets pushed around a lot as we can see in the film meets the girl of his dreams Debbie(Candy Clark). Not really for all tastes, a bit of denouement but it proves to be good with its 60's music and Milner's racing with Bob Falfa(Harrison Ford in his film debut). It is an alright film. 8.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LUCAS' ONLY GREAT FILM!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Lucas should have stuck to directing. This is easily his best film and one of the best of '73. Excellent cinematography and a splendid cast of youthful actors. Richard Dreyfuss was never better as the wannabe writer. Candy Clark deserved a Supp. Actress Oscar as Debbie, the flirty fun girl. Cindy Williams was never lovelier or more believable. Paul LeMat embodies the 50's with his "James Dean" type. Mackenzie Phillips was never more natural and amusing. Charlie Martin Smith is a crackup and deserved an Oscar nod. This is also one of the few times Harrison Ford was interesting as an actor, albeit in a small role. A 10 out of 10. Best performance = Candy Clark. A 24-hour time span is covered and the locations are authentic. A great film! Now that Lucas seems to be a toy manufacturer it's a shame.</fullReview>

It is pacey, funny, sympathetic, and evocative of the era. The acting is exceptional, the photography, mostly at night, is brilliant. The young actors, and George Lucas, the director set a standard that has not been beaten since. The music of the era, which runs non-stop though the movie by means of the local radio station, is not intrusive and adds to the atmosphere. I could go on.

		<shortDescription>A Family Of Innovators</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The striking visuals and sound collage point to the collaborative genius of director George Lucas who had the good sense to involve brilliant stylists (here, editors Verna Fields and Marcia Lucas, sound recorder Walter Murch, and Haskell Wexler, listed as `visual consultant', though the cinematography is credited to Jan D'Alquen and Ron Eveslage) and the immensely talented professionals working in harmony gives you the feeling of watching a lovingly creative family as they innovate. Lucas and co-scenarists Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck have fashioned a sweet-tempered ode to the end of adolescence as played out on the last night of summer vacation for Camelot-era high school graduates planning diverging life paths in the morning; they precisely capture the rueful melancholy and idealism that teenagers about to step into the void feel and combine them with a graceful slapstick that makes the touching symbolism easy to identify with. The performances are equally inspired, from Richard Dreyfuss' sensitive confliction to Paul Le Mat's easygoing charm infused with despondency to Ron Howard's all-around nice guy/pushover and Charles Martin Smith's painful grabs at acceptance. It's a film with a male point of view but this time around, that's not a bad thing--there's a na?ve misunderstanding of women that seems deliberate and affectionately wrong-headed and it dovetails perfectly with the overall wistful sense of young aimlessness. The soundtrack alone makes this worth seeing. Toni Basil did the choreography, most notably a memorable sock hop that takes up an early portion of the picture. Whatever drubbing Lucas has taken since `Star Wars', at least he can point with pride to this critical Seventies masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Genesis of a legacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to know the quintessential All-American Teenage film then this is it. This was George Lucas' first major film, coming after THX-1138 (1970) and before his first installment of his enormously successful Star Wars saga (1977). Even though American Graffiti was nominated in five categories at the Academy Awards that year (Picture, Director, Supporting Actress, Original Screenplay and Film Editing) it lost every one of them, most notably to George Roy Hill and The Sting. Amazing, seeing how The Exorcist was the other heavily favored film that year as well.The greatest asset to American Graffiti lies within its soundtrack. This soundtrack was the inspiration for the "collector's soundtracks" of today. It is a must-have for any film buff and/or fan of this film. Something interesting to watch as you watch is that all of the "stars" of this film eventually broke out into a bigger success as a result of this film: Cindy Williams (Laverne and Shirley), Suzanne Somers (Three's Company), Richard Dreyfuss (The Goodbye Girl, Mr. Holland's Opus), Mackenzie Phillips (One Day at a Time) and especially Ron Howard who appeared on television's Happy Days (a spinoff of American Graffiti) and parlayed that experience into a very successful directing career (Cocoon, Backdraft, Apollo 13) finally winning his much-deserved Oscar for 2001's masterpiece A Beautiful Mind.All in all, watch this film when you just want to feel good, because that's what this is: a feel-good film. There are no hidden meanings, no socio-political messages hidden within it. It just wants to show you what being a teenager was really like during those days of surfboards and sock hops. More importantly, it is an important piece of the puzzle into an accomplished director's legacy.My rating: 3 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a landmark film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Lucas made two films that will always be known as breakthrough &amp; defining films. One is obvious : "Star Wars".The other is almost just as important : "American Graffiti".By seamlessly intertwining the soundtrack into the movie, Lucas made this simple film into a breakthrough cinematic experience. It opened the doors for the usage of music in the future of film.But the great thing about the way the music is utilized is that it isn't just used for the sake of filling in otherwise dull spots of the film. It is used in a way that fully capture the whole 50's experience. Of course there are so many other aspects of the 50's that help Lucas accomplish his snapshot of the 50's experience. There are the cars, the fashion, the trends...and of course there's Wolfman Jack acting as a type of narrator throughout the night.Besides capturing the 50's experience on film, "American Graffiti" also acted as a catalyst for the "50's revival" in TV shows &amp; music - another reason this is such a landmark film.For me personally, after viewing this film, and listening to the soundtrack as a child, I too felt that I had experienced the 50's in a way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes American Graffiti so special is the way that the music is combined with the dialogues,almost non-stop.Classics like Rock around the clock,That 'll be the day,I only have eyes for you and Green onions(!) are heard sometimes loud and sometimes in the back ground while the actors talk or the engines of the cars roar. Another special thing about this film is the legendary cast and crew,although not yet at that moment.The movie is directed by George Lucas before(Star Wars was yet to be made),it is produced by Francis Ford Coppola(one year after he made the Godfather).And then the actors:Ron Howard(Richie Cunningham from Happy Days and academy award winning director for A Beautiful Mind),Richard Dreyfuss(Matt Hooper from Jaws),Charles Martin Smith(the accountant from The Untouchables) and the one and only Wolfman Jack playing Wolfman Jack.Other important parts are for Paul LeMat as the greatest dragracer in the universe,Bo Hopkins as a gang leader(he dies in the first scene of The Wild Bunch) and Cindy Williams as Howards girl(she also played in some episodes of Happy Days).Candy Clark got an oscar nomination for her role as the beautiful Debbie. But the biggest surprise in this movie comes from the great and legendary Harrison Ford(my favorite actor) as Bob Falfa,a drag racing sort of bad guy. All these famous actors in their early days makes it extra special, because in these days this cast and crew would be all-star! The car scenes are beautiful,it is a pity that the don't make these cars anymore.Some scenes are very funny(the liquor store scene for instance)and some are very emotional. With all this the story is not bad either and the ending is pretty surprising too.Don't go away before the movie is truly ended,because then you see what happens with the characters in the future.(why,Toad, why!?)PS:buy the 2-disc soundtrack,it is absolutely great,the final song is a great cut:All summer long from the Beach Boys.it is not heard in the movie,what a shame.I'm gonna listen Green Onions once again! 10/10</fullReview>

High School romances beginning and ending. Kids cruising the town in Hot Rods. Drag racing. Gangs. The best sound track I've ever heard (be sure to get it on DVD).

Well written, well-acted, and a couple of messages about life thrown in as well. I loved it when I was a teenager in the 1970's and I still love it now.

		<fullReview>Kids, cars, and music are the intrinsic elements in this nostalgic cinematic portrait of America in the year 1962, set in California. With the Wolfman Jack radio show playing 1950s and 60s pop songs in the background, kids, mostly high school seniors, cruise up and down the main drag in cheap but colorful old cars. With time on their hands, the kids chatter about the subtleties of teen dating, hotrod racing, and future career prospects. Though the film's tone is thus lighthearted, the story's theme is nevertheless profound. Cocooned in the innocence of a small, secure world of the known, American teenagers in the early 60s express, either explicitly or implicitly, the anxiety about the larger world outside, of which they know nothing.The film's plot starts at dusk at Mels Drive-In, the perfect place to eat, congregate, and engage in a little sophomoric high-jinks. Most of the rest of the film takes place during that night, and ends the following morning.Characters in this ensemble story are quite stereotyped. You've got your proverbial nerd guy (Terry, "the toad") who wears big glasses. Then there's the boy-next-door (Curt) and the naive, sweet girl (Laurie). You've got your big-man-on-campus (Steve), and the requisite greasy hood in a white T-shirt (John). There are others who come and go, but everyone here is White, photogenic in their own way, and preoccupied with the opposite sex. That's how it was in 1962.The film's first half is a delight. We get to know all these people, and get to listen to some great oldies. As the film moves along, however, the plot becomes tedious and repetitive. The songs in the second half lack the verve of those in the first half.The least enjoyable part of this film for me was the cinematography. "American Graffiti" was a low budget film. Instead of the more expensive Cinema-Scope, the film was shot with the cheaper Techniscope lenses. The result is a very widescreen frame that I found annoying. It is tantamount to letterbox format, which I have never liked. Interestingly, the Techniscope format made for dim lighting, which had to be augmented by high-voltage lights inside all the cars. It also made for a slight amount of grain in the images. Overall, the film's visuals have a documentary look and feel.Period piece costumes and production design are realistic. And as pop songs on car radios combine with character dialogue, the film's sound mixing is terrific.What is interesting about this film is that it is as nostalgic as the era that it portrays. "American Graffiti" separates its portrayed era by only about ten years. Yet, well over thirty years have come and gone since the film was made ... a nostalgic film about nostalgia ... "Those were the days my friend; we thought they'd never end; we'd sing and dance forever and a day ... for we were young and sure to have our way."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the great coming of age movies. Great cars and great music.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The real star of this movie are the cars. It's like watching the Woodward Dream Cruise in Oakland County, Michigan. The hot rods are great but so are the stock 50's and 60's from Ford, Chrysler and General Motors. When I was in high school, we would cruise Woodward every Friday and Saturday night. Going from drive-in to drive-in looking at the cars and the girls. i was a passenger until my older brother went in the army in 1961 end entrusted his 1955 Ford Victoria to me. It looked much better than it ran. Stock engine meant that I never raced. But I was able to peel out with the best of them. Watching this film really gives me vivid memories of my own teenage years.We were in such a hurry to grow up but didn't really want to accept any responsibility. It was all about having fun. The costar is the music. It's a really great selection of early rock and roll. Great cars and great music. What more could you ask for?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If this film does not define a "10" then nothing does..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is possible I have seen this film beginning to end over 10 times. As far as I can tell, it is perfect. When I watch it I lose all sense of time. It is a textbook study in the importance of character relationships in a story, and the corresponding resonance with the viewer, over brain-dead action and flash-bangs. I am aware there are arguments that you need to be a child of the era to appreciate this film. It is a great argument, as arguments go, but essentially flawed. Every generation understands the essential themes of growing up, wanting to be liked for who you are, going to war, being in a relationship where you are either dominant or submissive to the other, feeling like you want to do something crazy but not get caught, and, at the core, just plain having fun. Ron Howard was never better. Suzanne Summers, before she became an icon, was perfectly cast as the mystery woman. MacKenzie Phllips was never younger or more sassy. If you look closely, there is even a prototype here for the "Fonz" before that character became a TV hit. The solo by Wolfman Jack as someone who is not in real life what he appears to be "electronically" is brilliantly conceived. In fact, the heck with it, the entire film is brilliant, the impact has never been repeated by any other film, not even the sequel, and if this is not a true "10" then ... to quote one of my favorite Marvel characters, paint me blue... and call me Cupid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The right film at the right time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether you love this movie or not, you have to admire this movie for two reasons. First, its return on the dollar was among the best ever for any film. While the budget was a very modest $777,777.111 (no kidding), it returned $115,000,000 in the United States alone! No wonder this film made George Lucas famous. Second, it was very innovative. While I was not a huge fan of the film's style, it was unique and sure had an impact on the world as well as future films. No one had made a film like this before--chock full of one song after another blaring across the soundtrack and its odd semi-structureless plot was also quite unique.The film concerns a bunch of young adults just hanging out and cruising. There really isn't a lot more to it than that. Sure, their stories all reveal a bit about them through the course of the film, but most of the characters have no great depth. It's more like you are a voyeur watching some likable and not especially likable kids doing...well...nothing. Now if you grew up in the early 60s and remember all this, then it's a great stroll down memory lane. If you didn't, I think the movie will be more of a tough sell, as the nostalgia angle is non-existent. As for me, I wasn't even born until 1964, so the nostalgia aspect was less--but I loved the music and great cars. My daughter, while less impressed about EVERYTHING did grudgingly say that the music was great. She also said that she pretty much ignored the plot and just listened to the songs! And, perhaps, this is pretty typical of a person from her generation. As for me, the film was mildly interesting and I respect it--though I did not love it. This isn't really meant as a criticism--just a statement about how this film appealed to this 47 year-old guy. For the right audience, it's the perfect film. Otherwise, you might feels it's all a bit overrated.Aside from the nostalgia for the early 60s, the movie also is quite interesting when seen today because so many future stars and super-stars are in it--mostly when they were young unknowns. Ron Howard (a child star but not all that popular yet as an adult), Cindy Williams, Harrison Ford, Richard Dreyfus, Charles Martin Smith, Mackenzie Phillips and Suzanne Somers all appear in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How did we get from there to here?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess I enjoyed the soundtrack more than the story lines. It was a time before 1963 and the Kennedy assassination, when America was still relatively innocent culturally. The songs were about true love, rather than just random fornication. Everything evolved around music, cars, hamburger joints and finding love. But I failed to see great film-making here, as others have. It is a nice subject matter, moving on from high school friends, an ending of an important stage of life. I am 51 years old now, and I still never have found the same depth of bonding with others that I once had with my high school friends. I was also sad to think, that many in this same generation depicted in the movie American Graffiti are now conservative Republicans, pro war/pro torture religious hypocrites.

		<shortDescription>True '70s classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm an avid lover of the entire decade of the '70s, and this movie is one of the best films of the era.There's not just one but several plots to the movie. It's about the last night of the summer in 1962, and the exploits of several teenagers. This is one of the few films that manages several plots at once without being downright confusing. I actually love the fact that they made this movie with less than a million dollars, because the somewhat grainy quality adds to the vintage charm. You'd actually think it was made in 1962. They just can't make a period film these days without a million pop culture references of the time being thrown in your face. Those horrors aren't in American Graffiti, but there's just enough signs of the times to keep the early '60s vibe (the soundtrack being the best thing by far).Since I can't stand including excessive spoilers in my reviews, I think you should check it out for yourself. You won't be let down, trust me. I can't even bein to go on with the countless classic lines. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that started it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, American Graffiti is the UNDISPUTED king of teenage oriented movies. George Lucas' masterpiece started the ball rolling for such gems as Fast Times at Ridgemont High, The Breakfast Club, and Dazed and Confsued. In my opinion, those three movies in addition to American Graffiti are the best teenage movies ever made because, simply put, they are as REAL as it gets. Even though my favorite movie of all time is Dazed and Confused, I am happy to honor American Graffiti as the king of the teenage movies. Dazed and Confused borrowed a lot from American Graffiti and, in a way, it was kind of fitting. American Graffiti was about a generation that was still innocent. Dazed and Confused, 14 years later, pretty much shows the generation that came about after the assasination of President Kennedy and Vietnam. Even though they are set in completely different times, both sets of teens still cruise their towns at night, hang out at the local gathering places, think about the future, and even show the next generation a good time: Dazed and Confused did it with the character of Mitch and American Graffiti did it with the character played by MacKenzie Phillips.And, if that wasn't enough, American Graffiti has Wolfman Jack in probably my most favorite scene of the movie. Seeing it made me want to go find old copies of "The Midnight Special".I might only be 19 years old but I can relate to what happens in American Graffiti. George Lucas made a movie that will stand up throughout each generation of teenagers in this country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up in Northern California and graduated from Fremont High School in the not so small town of Oakland in 1965 (and later from California Polytechnic University in San luis Obispo in 1975, after a short stint in the service). I remember the Mel's drive-in in downtown Oakland, and I remember the 'cruising' on San Leandro Blvd on Friday and Saturday nights (although I couldn't afford to get a car until 1968--a 1961 Volvo PV 544 sedan--(Wow, I wish I had that car back!). I have to say that this movie is truly one of the best nostalgia stirring movies I have ever seen. It tugs at your heart and reminds us babyboomers that there really was a simpler, more carefree time and we lived it! When gas was 23 cents a gallon (or less when the gas wars were on), you loved Casper's Hotdogs, and education costs were almost nothing if you attended Merritt Junior College. When you rode on the back of your friend's Vespa motorbike to San Jose, just because you had never been there, and when you took off in your car on a whim to visit Big Basin to see the redwoods. Talk about a movie that causes you to reminisce!I have the movie on VHS and have watched it probably a dozen times and it nevers gets old--guess I am a hopeless nostalgic. When we just bought our PT Cruiser the maiden voyage song(s) was of course the soundtrack from American Graffiti--nothing else would do!This movie was a true inspiration from George Lucas and gets a 10 of of 10 from me.</fullReview>

It's a tumultuous time for a teen and they are grasping to hang on to it for one last night. Those who are younger in the movie have "their time" ahead of them and this night is one big adventure.

I just saw Singles which was a modern romantic comedy about dating. Compared to American Graffiti that film was terrible. It is simple and cliched, like a soap opera. American Graffiti is the kind of movie where all of the characters seem familiar, but it has nothing to do with cliches. It's because we all know people like these. A nerd, a tough guy, ect. It's like the Brakfast Club, only instead of a drama it's a comedy where everything goes wrong. The situations that these four guys get themselves into (with exception to Ron Howards) are all funny as hell. I like that there were four main characters and four different stories, but with a movie like that you have to make sure that they are all good. Four Rooms had two great rooms, but the two lousy ones ruined the movie. American Graffiti has all four excellent situations, three of which are so funny you'll wish you had seen it sooner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrific portrait of youth....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Graffiti is more than just a film about a group of isolated kids in the early 60's... it is a very effective study of youth on the cusp of change; a metaphor for the cultural revolution of the 1960's that was about to take place and change these kids hot-rod and drive-in lifestyle. The coming of age these kids are undergoing is also something any of us can relate to, and the fact that is set in the past allows it to feel nostalgic to anyone; 1962 is symbolic of anyone's youth. The expert method in which Lucas directs the movie presents us with a rather unconventional method of storytelling. We feel like we are just part of the gang on a typically active Saturday night...there is no real plot, but think about your last Saturday night--was it really Shakespearean material. That's what makes the movie so enjoyable. The terrific Rock n' roll soundtrack, placed in context, allows us to feel the excitement this music created when it was new, and how it affected these kids. American Graffiti makes us long to live in a more innocent era, whether that era is 1962, or simply our own childhood.</fullReview>

I absolutely loved this film and its characters because it is just downright funny and doesn't have to use obsenities every second word to accomplish this. Some of today's directors and writers of the younger generation should take note. I am not from this generation, however, I felt as if I had been taken back to this point in time and it almost seemed familiar to me.The acting in this film is superb, especially Dreyfuss and Le Mar who play their characters to a par. The photography is great especially during the climax of the film (Harrison Ford Losing?). I would even consider going to rent the sequel.A must see! 8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm only 19 and it still feels nostalgic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This a very enjoyable movie. It takes place over one night in 1962, following the exploits of a handful of kids, some of whom will be leaving for college the next day. In particular the relationship between John (a hot rod driver) and Carol (a young teen girl he is forced to drive around) is excellent. The best scene in the movie is a brilliant cameo by a philosophical Wolfman Jack that elevates the movie above just an entertaining flick about kids. Look for Harrison Ford in a small role, this movie isn't one to miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant nostalgic period piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing American Gaffitti now is a curious experience. It was set in 1962 but made in 1973 with several future stars in their early roles. If you look carefully, you can see that many of the boys have struggled to turn their 70s hairstyle to match those over a decade earlier. But overall, AG is a dazzling and memorable nostalgic drama superbly written and directed, falling just short of a masterpiece.The editing is particularly good, depicting the experiences of all main characters as they go through the last night of celebration before going off to college. I liked the idea of using the local haunt - Mel's Drive-in - as the focal point for the gang's fun even though they actually spend very little time inside it during that night. Also interesting and nostalgic is the all night 'cruising around' by the kids looking for fun and mostly getting it. One possible complaint that I have is that there should have been an attempt at introduction of the characters at the start. Ideally, it could have been by way of a nostalgic voice-over by Curt Henderson (Dreyfuss) looking back at that night and introducing various characters as they arrived at Mel's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director Lucas' Magnum Opus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the all time great nostalgia films presents a bigger than life look back to the early 60s. Its hard to view this movie 20-20 given the widely viewed subsequent series Happy Days which, while excellent, lacked the excitement and charm offered in the film. The soundtrack is wonderful and the Wolfman clearly demonstrates that a good voice can be hit you more directly than visuals given that you don't see it coming. I would have preferred it if Lucas has continued in this direction rather than become overly enamored with special effects in his subsequent films. Harrison Ford was fine as a young actor, although his acting skills did develop considerably in later years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Over all, a great movie, especially for all who "grew up" during that decade. The director/producer, a true visionary, has became a giant in the industry. The casting was exceptional . . . many being able to use this movie as a springboard to greater fame &amp; fortune. The background music plays a big role in setting the tone and telling the story. The theme is universal in that even though I grew up in the MidWest and the story is set in California, I could relate to many, if not all, the interactions and situations that comprise the story line. Even now, some 30+ years since the movie first screened, I enjoy replaying my DVD of the movie as it continues to entertain and brings back memories galore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie dealing with nostalgia!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah yes the 60's, a great time to be free. In California, buddies from high school share their last times together before college get to enjoy fun. Even though my mom was around that time, she would have her perspective view of that time. "American Graffiti", has got a lot of nostalgic momentum which makes it very watchable. The music, the cars, the juvenile quips, are all in this fine movie Francis Ford Coppola made. There's a lot of stars of tomorrow there. Ron Howard, fresh out of "The Andy Griffith Show" and way before "Happy Days". Cindy Williams before "Lavern &amp; Shirley" Harrison Ford as the upstart driver. Richard Dreyfuss as Curt who's on the hunt for that mysterious blonde. And Mackenzie Phillips way before "One Day at a Time". These and other stars really made the movie magic work. And as for George Lucas, he is the man all the way. I liked every scene the movie has. And John Miner(Paul Le Mat) has to ride around town with Carol(Philips). He is "The King of the Road" until Bob Falfa(Ford) taunted him to the race. John did win the race via blowout. It's a shame that he lost his life to a drunk driver. At least Carol got a piece of his car to remember him by. And it wouldn't be "American Graffiti" if it wasn't for DJ Wolfman Jack(1939-95). His voice will live on forever! I liked the part after Carol got pelted by the water balloon, John and Carol get their revenge big time when Carol creams the windows as John take out the tires. The 60's are a crazy time, but just like any other decade life moves on. A very fine performance for everyone, this movie is a must! 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nostalgic, beautiful, just sad really</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this the day before going to University. It was one of the most appropriate and moving moments of my film viewing life.First off; this is no complex or intriguing film. Its concept is very simple; various teenagers enjoying their youth with pranks, racing, outrageous flirtatiousness and most beautiful and touching of all the teenage dream of romance. My favourite moment of the film is when Dreyfuss's character sees an attractive, young blond early on - he later tries frantically to contact her - she eventually does, but just says her dues and leaves him - the boy, instead of being heartbroken or dissatisfied is happy and upbeat - at least he gave it a chance, at least he lived, as my father put it 'the teenage dream'. It touched me like few films can.That is what makes his film so good, so classy. It shows youth in all its beauty, without cynicism - the simple joys of life are shown in all vibrance. It also does not contain those elements that are omnipresent in modern versions; unnatural lighting, a unrealistic script, profanity. Lucas and Wexler were the perfect combination, Lucas could hide his shortcomings in dialogue behind Wexler's excellent photography and the great performances of all the cast.The ending moved me greatly, being at the stage of life that I am. Every student must watch this film before going to University because it highlights those qualities of youth so well and so elegantly that one cannot help feel tinges of remorse and sentiment at the sight of the plane soaring into the sky carrying the boy to University and away from his childhood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably Lucas' best film as a Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't recall the first time I saw this movie. It is still one of my dad's favorite movies and he's always had a copy (be it on VHS or on laser-disc, yeah he's had it that long). I guess you might say that I grew up with this movie. I rented it recently, mainly because of the nostalgic value it has for me, but remembered why I enjoyed it so much. This film is pure Americana and represents an era of American innocence. George Lucas really took some risks on this one. He made a film about cruising in the early 70s (an era that was marked by down beat films). I have to say that when Lucas was young, he had balls.The plot is extremely simple (but I still hope that I can do it justice). Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard) have graduated from high school in southern California and are headed out east to go to college (the whole film takes place on the last night that they're in town). Their friends are Terry the Toad, the geek (Charles Martin Smith), and John Milner (the best driver in the valley, played by Paul Le Mat). The story follows the four as they cruise around town. Curt is worried about leaving town and decides he may not want to leave.Curt starts cruising with Steve and Laurie (Curt's sister, Steve's girlfriend)he sees a blonde in a white T-Bird, who becomes his obsession for the night after she mouths "I love you" to him. Curt goes from being with Steve and Laurie to cruising with his ex-girlfriend, to being abducted by a car gang, to finally finding disc jockey Wolfman Jack to play a song for the blonde in a white T-Bird.Steve decides to break up with Laurie because he's going off to college. Laurie takes it very badly (of course) and the two go through the ups and downs about their relationship through the night.Steve lent Terry the Toad his car for safe keeping while he's out of town. Toad cruises around and eventually picks up Debbie (Candy Clark) who normally would be way out of his league. The two get into several bizarre situations (including a liquor store hold up and having Steve's car stolen).John ends up having to drive around with Carol (who is probably about 13) after some girls who are cruising play a trick on him. John and Carol definitely have a love/hate relationship, but John tries to look out for Carol. John is being chased by Bob Falfa (Harrison Ford) who wants to beat him in a drag race.The separate stories all tie in due to the friendship shared between the four. Ultimately, the story is about going away and remembering the good times that everyone has when they're young. The epilogue really puts this theme in perspective. The film really could have been made about any period, but the fact that it was made about the last great period of American innocence really drives the point home that it is a film about growing up and changing. Granted, Lucas grew up during this period and was into cruising, but the setting is still essential to the theme of the movie. This period is coming to a close, for the characters because they're moving on and because of the events that would happen in the 60s. The setting is 1962. However, as I have previously stated, the film is not merely a period piece because the themes involved are timeless.I recommend for anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 30 Greatest Films Ever Made, Continued</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(part of 30 essays I'm writing on the 30 greatest films of all time. They are written in no particular order)"Jesus, what a night!" -Terry "The Toad" FieldsThe first song played in American Graffiti goes as follows: When the clock strikes 2 and 3 and 4 if the band slows down we'll yell for more we're gonna rock around the clock tonight we're gonna rock rock rock till broad daylight we're gonna rock we're gonna rock around the clock tonightand around the clock we go. The film starts at sunset and ends as the sun rises the next morning. Our characters: 4 teenagers, 2 of them on the verge of going off to college. Richard Dreyfuss is in turmoil and doesn't want to go. little Opie Ron Howard (about to release a new film, The Da Vinci Code, in May) is the class president and boyfriend of the head cheerleader and is obsessed with getting away from this Midwest "turkey town" but Cindy Williams, the cheerleader, isn't so eager for him to go. Then you have Paul Le Mat as a James Dean wannabe drag racer who accidentally ends up with a bratty 13 year old in his car. And Charles Martin Smith plays Lucas' autobiographical role as the dorky kid who ends up the luckiest, trying to lie his way through a date with the only Oscar nominated cast member in this film, Candy Clark, who plays s Shirley MacLaine type adorable-but-not-too-bright girl. And we have cameos by Wolfman Jack and Harrison Ford, who didn't want to give up his carpenter job for this film (he was paid more as a carpenter.The setting is 1962, a year that was still mostly grounded in the innocence of the 50's but beginning to show the first signs of rebellion. The writer director is George Lucas, before his name could have ever been attributed to the phrase "Star Wars." The film broke and still sets the record for biggest budget/box office margin. It was nominated for Oscars for best picture, director, and screenplay. The music is completely unoriginal, featuring what must be a record for least amount of film time without music playing (that record may have been beaten by Koyaanisqatsi). The 45 songs used are by Booker T. Jones, Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, David Allison, David Bartholemew, The Beach Boys, Max Freedman, Fats Domino, Frankie Lymon, Sherman Edwards, Jimmy Bowen, and more. The film is delirious, hilarious and fun, and may just leave you a little dazed as the sun begins to rise. You can't see this film and not think about it. I was never impressed by Star Wars, but if Lucas makes another film, I would gladly see it if it comes even close to the sheer genius of "American Graffiti."The trivia to this film is quite interesting. see IMDb's page for it, especially the "disasters" bullet. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069704/trivia</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's of a time and place.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this film, I was utterly taken with it. My folks ran a restaurant which became a hangout for the kids of the mid to late fifties and early sixties. It wasn't a drive in, but it became a place for much of what went on in this movie. We were in a small town, so there are urban elements that didn't apply. But there was cruising. There were fights. There were tough guys. I remember John Steinke who spent his Saturday evenings shooting up people's mailboxes with his .22. Most of the kids were normal kids. Some portrayals of the fifties make it seem like everyone had a leather jacket and a duck tail haircut. These were just a small percentage. Most postured and pranced around like the kids we have today. Different times; same basic behavior. I loved the mythos. The girl in the white car. The average Joe (Richard Dreyfuss). The nerd. The girl friend who you thought would be your love forever. The scary future. It's all here. Then there is that midnight journey, that quest. Wolfman Jack, whose career was really made big by this film. The police, who are understandably obsessed with these hoods and what they do. It's a lot of fun. I don't know why, however, this film didn't wash quite as well the last time I saw it. Was it too many Happy Days episodes? Is it less relevant now? Have we no innocence? I just didn't feel the magic. Or is it that I was so much closer to the ages of the characters when I saw it the first time. It's still a landmark film. The cinematography is striking. See it if you haven't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bigger Ground Breaker than Star Wars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was George Lucas first big Hollywood Blockbuster. It broke ground on so many levels. First it was a nostalgia picture. (Made in the 1970's about the last days of American Innocence pre Kenedy Assasanation). This was also a fragmented story! It had different points of view from different people. This was the first movie that had more than 1 story going on. This was also the first movie to play "Rock and Roll Classics" instead of having new songs written for the movie. There was no soundtrack per say it was just music coming from the cars that provided the soundtrack. This movie was also a meal ticket for many stars. The people that were in this movie all of them parlayed into further success. Ron Howard..need I say more. Cindy Williams became one of TV' biggest stars of the 1970's. Susan Richardson (had a cameo) was the cast in "Eight is Enough". Harrison Ford.. need I say more. Everyone in this became a star if Noe a superstar! The movie holds up and if you never have seen this well your missing a CLASSIC..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie on TV as a pre-teen. It took place well before I was born and I had never been to California. But even today--decades later--the movie has an incredible tone that has universal appeal. On one level, it appeals to Americans (and Canadians) ideal of a simple time: it takes place just shortly before JFK was assassinated and American pop culture went out the window in a mayhem of drugs, acid-rock, and bizarre envelope-ripping behaviours and lifestyles. On another level, if you've been a teenager, you will be able to relate to this movie. The movie was somehow--even to us in Canada hundreds of miles away in a different climate and culture, and a different era--it was somehow OUR last night of summer too. What more can I say? Brilliantly shot with the hand-held camera at times for a suggestion of reality. An incredible film with classic, universal themes and characters. Absolutely love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before all of the present day knucklehead mash of mindless teenage movies, this intelligent, Oscar nominated (for best picture) film shows the last night of summer retreat for a group of young people in a small northern California town, one of whom is about to head back east to attend college. Richard Dreyfuss provides the intelligence, Ron Howard the aloof personality, Paul LeMat the muscle, and Charles Martin Smith the comic relief as the four main players in director George Lucas' first major breakthrough in movies before his adventure with the 'Star Wars' films began in 1977. 'American Graffiti' and 'Star Wars' are the only truly great films that Lucas has been involved with and 'American Graffiti' is shot like a documentary, edited with care, written with charm and performed with excellence by a cast that will always be remembered for this film that helped them launch careers that would take them to the top of their profession.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies. I'm a little younger than Mr. Lucas but I find myself taken back to high school when I see this. Each of the main characters is struggling with the idea of their futures and what they ultimately value in life. In this movie you have all the usual suspects, Mr. Prom ,Mr. Gearhead, Ms. Easy. Ms. Perfect, Mr. Troubled, but somehow the fear and uncertainty of the future seems to connect them and they become stronger. There is a wonderful sense of community which is illustrated so well through the music and the almost fatherly figure of Wolfman Jack. My two sons just graduated from High school in '03 and '05. It doesn't seem as though they feel as connected to each other, everyone has their own personal reality. In this movie they all share this bittersweet night for better or worse and struggle with elusive dreams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My reaction to this film when it first came out in 1973 was that I thought I was the only one who was secretly saddened inside. Everyone else in the theater was laughing.And I thought it was because I grew up during the time depicted and the film hit so close to home. How could that producer filmed my own life? I saw it just a few years out of high school and with a first spouse. The film seemed to emphasize my post high school misery at the time.But two things really made the film great. First it didn't just depict the 60s, it depicted high school everywhere any time. Second, because it captured those years so perfectly we all knew what was happening to those kids and what was going to happen to them as soon as they left home. I know I wanted to shout out don't do this or be sure to do that and then you'll have a great life! I wanted to climb onto the screen and relive my own high school years. Over the past 31 years I've watched "Graffiti" many times over and I realized what the key to its success was. Everyone in that theater in 1973 felt the same way I did inside. It was their life on the screen too. Every character we ever knew in high school was there. The jock, the JD, the prom queen, all of them. And somewhere in that crowd we each found ourselves. And we also found out what we had wondered all those years we were in school...even the cool kids were a bit like us, insecure and afraid.Besides the obvious comedy plot lines and character play there are subtle, shadowy serious exchanges going on in the background, which mirror the whispers and rumors of high school. Watch the sock hop sequence closely (the benefit of playback and pause) you can catch a very quick scene between the lecherous teacher played by Terry McGovern (Mr. Wolfe) and a barely walk-on Kay Lenz (as Kay Ann Kemper). As Steve and Mr. Wolfe are talking about their past and future, Lenz shows up, aptly just out of the shadows, and softly asks to speak to Mr. wolfe. As Steve walks away you can just read Mr wolfe's lips as he says "you're pregnant?"I was afraid the last scene would end with the 1959 Martin Denning song "Teen Angel" playing in the background--with Laurie Henderson dying when Falfa's car flipped over and caught fire. But that would have made the film too tragic. Leaving home was going to be tragic enough especially since we, the audience, saw the times coming and Steve, Laurie and company did not.Fortunately six years later John Belushi and crew made Animal House, a mirror image of college and happier times. I always watch both films together and feel a lot better after I do. Toga, toga, toga!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is the perfect depiction of American high school life in the "innocent" 1950s - 1960s before Vietnam and assassinations of Amercian political leaders brought us to the brink or anarchy.George Lucas managed to capture and present all the high school characters we've ever seen, from the shy geek, the Stepford cheerleader, class president, class clown, lecherous teacher, to the class bully.In both a comedic and serious vein they are all there, showing their strengths and weaknesses. The heroes, villains, doers and watchers each had their moment on stage. And it was narrated by the town's favorite radio DJ (in this case Wolfman) that somehow connected every high school in your hometown.This film is a true classic. Along with Animal House, it defined the wry side of American youth academia. Anyone who hasn't seen this flick gets three days' detention.</fullReview>

I first saw it in 1974, when I was 13, and got hooked on the fifties music soundtrack. I had not heard that kind of music before. (Belive it or not, there were no oldies stations in those days) I still listen to that kind of music 30 years later. It was my introduction to Chuck Berry and Buddy Holly. I could go on and on, but the best tribute I ever gave this movie, was a real life one. I moved to Modesto California, where the story was set. The cops tried to ban cruising. Ha!

		<shortDescription>American Graffiti (1973)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In dealing with a film as important and great as George Lucas's American Graffiti, I suppose it would be appropriate to give a dictionary definition of the title -- a la Pulp Fiction. American: of or pertaining to the United States of America or its inhabitants. Graffiti: words or phrases written on public sidewalks, on the walls of buildings, public restrooms, or the like. In one way, this doesn't make any sense, but in another, it perfectly sums up the essence of the film. The year was 1973, and people were already beginning to feel nostalgic for the 60's, so a pre-Star Wars George Lucas and a post-Godfather Francis Ford Coppola decided to team up and make what they probably thought would be nothing more than a momentary hit. Little did they know they were about to create one of the best American pictures of all time. I remember watching this on TV at 3 o'clock in the morning when I was a kid, thinking it was one of the most perfect movies ever made, and I still believe it is: American Graffiti is just as perfect today as it was 30+ years ago, and I have no doubt that it will continue to be. It tells the story of multiple characters (in the fashion initiated by Robert Altman) during one long night in which not much happens -- and yet, upon further scrutiny, quite a bit happens. Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) is debating whether he should go to college or track down the woman he's fallen for from afar; Steve (Ron Howard) and Laurie (Cindy Williams) are "going steady" but hit a rough spot in their relationship when he brings up the prospect of seeing other people; John Milner (Paul Le Mat) is the token guy-with-the-cool-car who spends the night with a younger girl (Mackenzie Phillips) as he hunts down Falfa (Harrison Ford) for a race; and lastly, Toad (Charles Martin Smith) is a klutz who picks up a bombshell named Debbie (Candy Clark). The focus of the movie shifts seamlessly through each interweaving plotline, tied together by the music on one radio station (a technique later used by Quentin Tarantino in Reservoir Dogs) -- in fact, more than two-thirds of the movie is accompanied by music, making the moments of silence seem ever more poignant. The performances in American Graffiti are simply flawless, putting to shame most modern young actors: Howard (whom I normally am not overly fond of) is appropriately manipulative yet romantic, and Williams is a great counterpart. Le Mat is irresistible, and Phillips has a precocious charm that far outshines John Hughes lamentable "Brat Pack." Smith is just terrific, and Candy is oddly charming -- you can see where Mira Sorvino gained her inspiration for Mighty Aphrodite --, but the show is stolen by Dreyfuss, who is both subtle and urgent in every shot (the scenes in which he hooks up with a punkish gang called the "Pharaohs" are worth a time capsule). And Ford makes an impressive acting debut -- although it may only seem impressive because we know in hindsight where it would lead him. The script by Lucas, Gloria Katz, and Willard Huyck is incredible, with snappy dialogue and timeless insight. At the end of the movie, Debbie tells Toad to give her a call the next day, but she neglects to leave her number: neither of them notices, but it doesn't matter for the time being. Because when you're young, all that matters is that moment, and after seeing youth through Lucas's vision, you begin to genuinely wish you still felt that way. American Graffiti is romantic, funny, and absolutely beautiful -- not to mention influential. We knew it was great when we first saw it, but now we know WHY it was great. American Graffiti is an American masterwork.Grade: A+(#39 on my All-Time Top 100 list. Visit http://imdb.com/board/bd0000002/thread/6917771 to view the entire list)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when I was in high school myself. I had no idea what it was -- it was just playing at one of the local downtown theaters -- a real theater, too, an old Vaudeville house, not a cineplex -- and it was just something to do. But it didn't take long to figure out there was something special about it. We had no idea so many stars were going to come out of the movie -- we knew Ron Howard from The Andy Griffith Show and that was about it. But the way the story was just so familiar to a high school kid, and the soundtrack that just pumped out oldie after oldie, you could tell it was something special. The first 2 seasons of "Happy Days" kind of captured the same spirit, then that, as they say, jumped the shark. But this movie, in addition to providing the nostalgia for the early 60s that my older brother and sister lived through, helps me remember the time when it first hit the screens, my own teenage years.</fullReview>

Its values are universal, the music selection timeless and to cap it off it has that great early George Lucas energy .It's hard to believe today, but he was an excellent writer in the 70's up to the mid 80's. A number of familiar faces help: Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, and to a lesser extent Charles Martin Smith, plus Harrison Ford. It's an entertaining film and highly likeable, if you haven't seen it already why not take the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great Comedy about teens getting ready to leave town in 1962 and have only one last night there. Wonderful, clean humor is in the movie so the whole family can watch. Great acting from Dreyfuss, Howard, Williams, LeMat, Smith and Clark and the direction is excellent from George Lucas. Funny cameos from Harrison Ford.4.5 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Fellini</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AMERICAN GRAFFITI is a tribute to Fellini. If you've seen LA DOLCE VITA or FELLINI'S ROMA you'll see lots of scenes of cars and/or motorcycles being driven at night. AMERICAN GRAFFITI has the same type of lighting as Fellini's night scenes. The background music, although of a different kind, is treated the way Fellini treats background music. It's the music people hear as they are passing each other in the street. In AMERICAN GRAFFITI the characters are always going from one place to another and passing each other. This is a chief quality in Fellini's movies.American movies are famous for car chases and, of course, car races. But George Lucas, like Fellini, somehow puts the viewer in the car. Look at REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE. You'll be moved, but you won't feel you're in any of the cars. You'll see a car chase in Hitchcock, but you'll feel like a spectator and will laugh at how phoney it looks. Hitchcock probably laughed, too, but that doesn't change the fact that his car chases look fake. Lucas banked on the realism of his car scenes and this was highly unusual. AMERICAN GRAFFITI is, perhaps, about the effect of the automobile on American life. But its vision was an adaptation and a trumping, if you will, of a foreign director's innovation. The automobile motif was a part of Fellini's picture of the world, but George Lucas saw how its dimensions fit the American scale and worked a masterpiece from this single element.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still great after all these years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that I've seen more times than I can remember, and I always come away with a smile on my face. If nothing else, this picture gives physical proof that George Lucas was once capable of telling an interesting story (four of them, actually) about characters we really care about.In the documentary that accompanies the DVD version, Lucas is not shy about describing the various "breakthroughs" that this movie accomplished, and the truth is, even though it may come off as just a fluffy, nostalgic teen comedy, American Graffiti was very much "of its time", if not ahead of its time in many ways. Some examples are commercial -- this was the first big movie to use an non-stop soundtrack of pop radio hits, and inspire a hugely successful soundtrack album -- and some more artistic, e.g., Lucas' budget forced him to shoot this film in an improvisatory, pseudo-documentary fashion not unlike the style for which Robert Altman is routinely praised to the high heavens. Not to knock Altman, whose work I love, but Lucas is using many of the same techniques in this movie without drawing so much attention to them. But in the end, this movie would be nothing but a well-shot comedy if we didn't care about the characters, and the characters in this movie are pure gold. For all the Porky's and American Pies out there, I think this movie is still closer to the typical American high school experience for most of us, even if it was originally intended as a nostalgic look at a lost era (how things have changed since 1973!). Lucas has said that all of his first three movies are about characters making a decision to leave their home in search of something, but this is really the best example of that, both because it's the most realistic and because the characters are the most fully-drawn (compared to THX 1138 or Star Wars).I think it's significant, in light of Lucas' later output, that he based the characters of Terry, John and Curt on different aspects of his own life, but needed help from his co-screenwriters (Katz &amp; Huyck) to flesh out the only two characters who have a genuine "relationship" (Laurie and Steve). Too bad Lucas didn't re-enlist them for Attack of the Clones; they might have helped make the stillborn romance in that movie a little less painful to sit through. But in the end, it doesn't really matter how many blockbusters he's made, or how much merchandising was spawned by Star Wars. If he had made no other pictures after this one, American Graffiti would still insure Lucas' place in the pantheon of great American directors of the 70s, and this movie surely deserves a place in any discussion of the best films of that decade, along with MASH, The Godfather, Taxi Driver and all the rest. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

It is great to see how seiniors in high school of the early 60's. The characters are all great to. Steve, the perfect student, who doesn't have a perfect love life, Curt, the guy who wants some one to want him, and is alway's in the wrong place in the wrong time, Terry, the nerd. Milner, the tough guy who's soften by Carol. This film also had great editing, there were like four or five stories going on, something George Lucas would do again in the Star wars films. All in all, I give it 10/10.</fullReview>

This, of course, was Ron Howard's first "adult" role and it was also just before he took his other defining role as all-American teen Richie Cunningham on Happy Days. Richard Dreyfus was pretty much a television actor and after the release of this film he became a bankable Hollywood star. Cindy Williams went on to do her career definining role three years later as working class princess Shiley Feeney on Laverne and Shirley. Paul Le Mat also became a bankable actor after years of playing small rolls. But, let's not forget Candy Clark and Charlie Martin Smith. They were the funniest part of the film and their rolls of Debbie and Terry "The Toad" made this classic film even more of a treasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is great, I have always been a huge fan of the '55-63 era of music, film, tv, etc. Lucas hit a national nerve with this in '73, when the 60s had finally peeled away to a close and what a good chunk of the country wanted was to look before them. Here was The Nostalgia decade of choice. You think that the 60s were 'in' during the 80s, or the 70s in the 90s...you haven't seen anything like what happened about the time American Graffitti came out. Acts like Rick Nelson, Elvis, Chuck Berry, the Beach Boys, the Four Season, Paul Anka, Neil Sedaka and Bobbie Vinton all had big comebacks c. '74 or so. Happy Days, Laverne and Shirley and Grease were huge. Doo wop oldies shows ruled the AM dials. But nothing quite caught the Mood better than American Graffitti, seems to me.What isn't there to like? Paul Le Mat seems to be the one guy outta the leads who really didn't wind up having much of a career, to me that's a shame. He comes across as being clearly Ford's equal, kinda reminding me of a Ray Liotta with more of a swagger. I love seeing Richie Cunningham, the kid from 'One Day at a Time', Toad, Suzanne Sommers, the Jerry Reed lookalike contenst winner Bo Hopkins AND the Wolfman in this. What a good, young, talented group here! The soundtrack is terrific, have always loved the doo wop and rockabilly that you hear here. Plus those vintage cars, and the utterly genuine feel for the early 60s that seeps through in every frame....Lucas really got it right here.Why hasn't he been able to give us another film with such well rounded characters(besides the first two Star Wars films, I spose...)? I wish I knew. This one was one of The seminal films of the 70s, along with 'the Exorcist' and 'the Sting', its made '73 a year to remember.The Gazzo-2 rating? **** of course. Go see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lucas' REAL work of genius.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can have all the 'Star Wars' movies, Episodes One through whatever; I'll trade them all straight up for 'American Graffiti' and consider myself as having got the best end of the deal.This was only Lucas' second major film as a director (though he was already plenty experienced at filmmaking) and it is extraordinary. 'AG' chronicles one long night in the lives of some recent high school graduates in a north California in 1962. But it's not just a look at the teenage ritual of cruising. By the time the next day is dawning, the main characters have all learned lessons about life and themselves and glimpsed the directions their futures will go in.A group of talented young actors form the core of the large cast in this film. Ronny Howard, as he's billed here, pulls off the formidable task of turning in a performance that makes one forget about his past as a well-known child actor from a popular TV show. He plays Steve, an All-American boy eager to enter the new world of college, which means leaving home. He talks with his girlfriend Laurie (Cindy Williams) about how their relationship might change now that they're both soon to be worldly adults. Perhaps they should consider seeing other people. Fighting ensues between the two, causing Laurie to at least temporarily abandon him for another cruiser, one in whom she has no interest whatsoever.Steve's good friend Curt likes to have a good time too, but he's also a sensitive budding writer. His great ambition is to shake JFK's hand. But he's having his doubts this evening about going away to college, something Steve can hardly believe he's hearing. He spends the night getting mixed up with a local gang and chasing a fantasy woman he sees at a stoplight. Another friend, Terry (or "Toad"), played by Charlie Martin Smith, is in heaven this evening. This Vespa-driving, awkward bumbler is to be entrusted with Steve's fine automobile while he's away. In it he picks up a fast girl with a bit of a reputation who under normal circumstances he'd never have a chance with. The group is rounded out by Big John Milner (Paul Le Mat), king of the cruisers who can outrun all challengers in his rod. But this local legend is once again going to be left behind by another group of high-school grads while he cruises the same strip.There are also several other fine supporting performances, led by a young Mackenzie Phillips as a 13-year old who gets pawned off on Big John. Bo Hopkins also shines as the leader of the small-time local gang, the Pharaohs. Also seen here are Harrison Ford and Kathy (Kathleen) Quinlan in their pre-star days. (After the success of 'Star Wars' Lucas added a couple of more minutes of Ford to a new cut of this movie.) In addition, Suzanne Somers, "the girl in the white T-Bird," has one of the most effective cameo roles in Hollywood history.All the actors mentioned are good ones, but they all benefit from Lucas' guidance. The film is enlivened by a knowledgeable choice of period rock &amp; roll which serves as a pervasive but unobtrusive backdrop for the action. The conclusion wraps things up beautifully as we get a taste of what will happen to these characters we've come to care so much about in this short time. George Lucas may have made films with more flash and more popular appeal, but none has more heart and soul than 'American Graffiti,' a true classic of American cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes "American Graffiti" a true American film classic, is that it accurately represents the teen experience of the era in which it represents. To those of us who grew up as teenagers during the late 50's and early 60's, are able to relive our youth again while watching the many antics surrounding the different characters in the film. Everyone of us knew a "Toad" in High School. That, along with a soundtrack containing all the music that so dominated the airwaves at that time, all contribute to making this movie a truly warm and nostalgic trip down memory-lane. After seeing the two-blocks of old town Petaluma California where most of the street scenes were shot, gave me an even greater respect for Lucas' film-making talents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie from a decade of great movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie. I saw this in the theater during it's initial theatrical release and have seen it probably 20 times since. What a fun coming of age slice of Americana of the early 60's still living in the 1950's. A fantastic young cast in Richard Dreyfus, Ron Howard, Cindy Williams, Candy Clark, MdKenzie Phillips, Paul Le Mat, Charles Martin Smith, Bo Hopkins, Kathleen Quinlan and featuring Harrison Fors and Suzanne Sommers. This was nominated for 5 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director as well as Supporting Actress for Clark and Screenplay and Film Editing. George Lucas had previous directed a film that he adapted as a full-length theatrical feature from a student film he had made called THX 1138 and then followed that with the very different American Graffiti here in his only second film. Hollywood recognized his genius with two of the biggest Academy Award nominations for Best Picture and Best Director. Lucas' dream was his Star Wars series which he devoted the rest of his time as a film maker doing which he is of course deservedly acclaimed for but I would have liked to have more films by Lucas more like American Graffiti. Any thing besides the Star Wars theme. A great soundtrack here with tons of great original recordings from the Rock and roll era of the late 50's and early 60's. This film still stands up wheel and I would give it a 10 and highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fellini's I Vitelloni transposed to rock n roll, teens, cruisers, and good vibes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They're each on the crossroads of High School into real life, either still deciding (Richard Dreyfuss' character Curt), or more just in the moment of their lives on a specific night following graduation (Ron Howard's Steve, Charles Martin Smith's 'Toad', Paul Le Mat's Milner). It's a night filled with riding in cars, meeting, wanting, or getting stuck with girls and women, racing, getting into mishaps, all the while having the unmistakable Wolfgang Jack on the radio playing the hits of the day. In fact, as the co-writer/director George Lucas has said, the film is more like a musical than a real drama/comedy, where the music informs the action. Scorsese was using this technique at the time as well, and it has become as heavily influential in the style of adolescent comedies and many other films as the special effects in Lucas following film, Star Wars. Sometimes the music makes a scene funnier, or more somber, or just adds that little bit of excitement, but more often than not it comments on the action, which helps far more than a musical score would've done for the material. If for nothing else, American Graffiti's musical compilation is a masterpiece unto itself.Lucas' second feature, American Graffiti- to date his one non-sci/fi &amp;/or action film- keeps a cool, sometimes odd, but magnetic energy to it, even through some scenes that don't play great compared to others. Like with Lucas' inspiration for the film (aside from his own personal experiences and his own self), Federico Fellini's I Vitelloni, there is an original feel to the material, and particularly spontaneous in some of its humor, as well as the improvisational freedom (or at least feeling) from the actors. The main four characters, one a cool-dude (Milner), one a nerdy type (Toad), one the popular prom king (Steve), and another the average Joe of high school (Curt), each go through their own cycles of discovery on this night, and Lucas cuts their stories together wonderfully, never keeping the interest far off from the last story. It is a film of its time and a lot more for the generation of its time, and the humor shouldn't all work (I found myself laughing much more than I expected)- but it is on the money for most of it. The female performances s well, are memorable, and bring out some of the best laughs aside from some of the more uncomfortable or surprising bits; Toad wouldn't be as interesting or funny without the big blonde by his side all night, or the younger girl with Milner - much of the best awkward/genuine comedy comes from them. A lot of it is sarcastic, witty, and wild in its outlook, but there is also the tender, more emotional side to it all (much as would be in the Star Wars films with the comic relief). It's a well-rounded effort, and a small classic in the realm of 70's breakthrough cinema.</fullReview>

Filled with great music, beautiful cars, believable characters, an excellent cast, strong script and directing (perhaps the first movie made to feature multiple story-lines) American Graffiti is truly one of the best movies ever made. This movie opened up the careers for many young talented actors: Ron Howard (who plays Steve Bolander, the Class President, an all-American kid) later went on to play Richie Cunningham in the television sit-com Happy Days set in the '50s, a product of the nostalgia that came following the release of this movie, and not to forget Richard Dreyfuss and Harrison Ford (who it seems more or less had given up the movie business). American Graffiti is strongly recommended for everybody!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of those classic American movies, a fairly humorous depiction of teen life in the 50s and early 60s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can we believe "American Graffiti" is almost 30 years old?? So many young actors went on to greater fame in film, not the least of which were Harrison Ford and Ron Howard, who finally this year won a "Best Director" award for "A Beautiful Mind". As movies usually do, situations were a bit exaggerated. Although some Friday and Saturday night cruising went on, it was never as blatant as depicted here. The jerking out of the cop car's rear end probably would never have happened. You wouldn't find some little studio in the middle of nowhere with WolfMan Jack broadcasting live, and just walk into the back door. You wouldn't find such agreeable gang members as the ones who did an impromptu initiation of Dreyfus' character.I grew up in the 50s and early 60s, and many of the situations were very accurate. High school lovers facing separation as one plans attending college across the continent. The high school dance with the live band. The teenager trying to get someone to buy booze for him, but the robbery and gunfight were a bit over the top. The gathering at the local drivein. Kids jumping into the back seat to make out, for no particular reason. Cigarette pack rolled up in the sleeve of the T-shirt. The film depicts one night, from early evening to sunrise the next morning. As a result the entire film is "dark", which to me detracts somewhat from the fun. But it truly is an American Classic film, probably deserves to be in any serious film collector's library.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Graffiti is a brutal movie with a poorly developed plot and a mediocre cast. The biggest issue is that there is simply no story whatsoever, we are just watching a gang of teenagers driving around in cars and listening to classic music for ninety minutes. As well at that, the cast are extremely lacking in chemistry, there is no sense that they are truly friends with one another and it really takes you out of the movie because of the fact that a convincing friendship is the most vital part of a film like this. It's poorly directed and edited, George Lucas made this because it was cheap and would give him money to create a more expensive production, which went on to be Star Wars, and a lack of passion in bringing this to life is highly evident. Poor cast, writing and short on laughs, American Graffiti is simply not worth the watch.

		<fullReview>American Graffiti is the second film from George Lucas, made after his quirky sci-fi effort THX 1138 but before he gave up crafting real characters in favour of larger-than-life comic book fantasy entertainment. It's a paeon to a long-forgotten world that was the 1950s, and features as its cast a bunch of high school students celebrating graduation with all of the angst that comes with it.Films like this tend to be pretty easy to like, because the topics are universal and the situations are easy to identify with. Some of the themes covered here include machismo, gang culture, romance, nostalgia, and the ever-difficult transition from childhood to adulthood. American Graffiti isn't exactly a world-changing film but I found it likable enough, and the cast (including Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, Charles Martin Smith, and Harrison Ford in early roles) are very good.One of the things I liked most about American Graffiti is the soundtrack. It's much better, say, than the original music in GREASE; I love 1950s film and many classics are featured here. Occasionally (and annoyingly) the song gets cut off halfway through, but nonetheless the soundtrack helps to make this film both likable and fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hot rods and cruising???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just read the other reviews and one thing jumps right out at me. All the reviewers -- whether they liked the movie or not -- seem to accept without question that in the late 50s and early 60s (the movie is supposedly one night in 1962), teen boys got in their hot rods and big souped-up muscle cars and "cruised" around and around and around and around. Now, I never lived in Modesto, or anywhere else in California, so maybe that actually happened there. But everybody in the world didn't grow up in Modesto, California. I myself grew up in twenty-something mostly small towns in seven different states in the American south and Midwest, in the time period represented in this movie. In all those states, in all those towns, I never, repeat, never, ever, saw a "hot rod." When I was old enough to drive, I did not get in a car and spend the evening and night "cruising" the town's streets, looking for girls to pick up. Most guys had to borrow their parents' cars. I knew one guy with his own car, and it was a really cheap old Ford that had trouble getting up steep hills. We didn't cruise around looking for girls, we called a girl and made a date, picked her up at her parents' house, and took her to a hamburger place or a movie theater or possibly to a school dance. Any girl who allowed herself to be picked up and driven around would've gained a terrible reputation and been avoided by everyone else. So I don't get it, I don't get the time and setting and atmosphere and characters, they are alien to me and not from the 50s and 60s I experienced. Maybe the title of this movie should have been "California Graffiti."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Well Made Coming of Age Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fortunate to get to catch this 1973 classic in an old theater in my hometown recently during a street festival with a cruise in later that evening. I had never seen "American Graffiti", and aside from having heard that Ron Howard was in it and that it had some muscle cars in it, I knew very little about the film. I was presently surprised with how much I enjoyed it.The movie is written and directed by George Lucas of Star Wars fame, just a few years before "A New Hope" hit screens in 1976. The film tells the tale of a group of teenagers in the 1950's--most of them recent high school graduates--on their last night in town before school starts back for some and others will be going off to college the next day. The film is replete with 50's era culture, from muscle cars to drive-ins and packs of cigarettes rolled up in the sleeves of white t-shirts.This movie is both fun and yet also has a serious undertone. It watches a bit like a cleaner version of "Porky's", and certainly has a sophomoric element to it--albeit one that doesn't cross the lewd line that a "Porky's" or an "Animal House" does (though it comes close at times).The car scenes are quite fun, as is the adolescent romance that plays out for several characters as the night goes along. Still, at the film's closing scene you realize that the film's title is a poignant one, as these young people's lives themselves serve as the graffiti of the American saga.All in all I'm giving this movie 8/10 stars. It's a fine film with good acting and a fun script.</fullReview>

His creation of some truly engaging over-the-top vignettes backed by music familiar even to the younger generations makes this a worthwhile 90 minutes for anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I make a reference to Pacino's movie which the only common interest is to be a night movie. Here, the movie is really about driving cool in the city after the sunset. This particular hobby of 60s American teens is well directed by Lucas, all the more than the cars were beautiful and filled with great rock song (which is not more the case actually). According to him, he was the first director to tell parallel stories about a multiple cast. I can't verify his statement but i can say that his choices of characters are rather uneven : Toad have the best interesting part with a delicious date and funny adventures. John comes close but mainly because he met original sidekicks : Carol and Harrison whose character acts like Han Solo on earth ! On the opposite, the adventures of Curt and Ron Howard are rather dull. In addition, i had the memory of the movie being bright, colorful and indeed shining like a jukebox whereas the DVD version i watched was rather dark and the colors very pale. But at the end, filling all the stories in one night in one little town is close to classic drama and the thematic of leaving homes and becoming an adult are rather interesting interesting and well done as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the end of the summer 1962 for a bunch of high school graduates. Curt Henderson (Richard Dreyfuss) is unsure about college. Steve Bolander (Ron Howard) expects to leave town tomorrow with Curt. He tells his girlfriend Curt's sister Laurie (Cindy Williams) that he wants to date other people while he's away. Terry "The Toad" Fields is their flunky friend. John Milner is their friend who's stuck in town. As they drive around on the strip, Curt is entranced by a girl (Suzanne Somers). John picks up little Carol Morrison (Mackenzie Phillips). Bob Falfa (Harrison Ford) is looking to race John. The Toad is driving Steve's car and meets the experienced Debbie Dunham (Candy Clark).George Lucas presents a convincing slice of American life. It's the music, the cars and the style of his youth. As an artifact, it's a terrific piece of a moment in time. As a story, it's rather scattered. The characters have their own separate stories. It would be more compelling to have them together developing chemistry and advancing their relationships. It is interesting to see some actors in their youth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People who view this movie as "nostalgia" are kind of missing the point. To my mind it's the equivalent of seeing the Mona Lisa and commenting on how much you like the frame.Also, this film is NOT a comedy though it has plenty of humorous scenes.Now I'm not saying how or why somebody should appreciate a film, I just want to point out why this film hit home so hard for me.This is a coming of age movie. Yes, it came out when I was a Junior in High School so it made me think. About life. About life decisions. About how sometimes the silliest and most insignificant things that affect our life decisions can change the outcome of our lives - forever.Since then I've read so many historical accounts and biographies and I am constantly struck how so many quirky and happenstance occurrences have drastically changed peoples lives and all of human history. This movie is the first time I considered that history is not "inevitable". We make our own history by the decisions we make. I'm struck by how many times the best decision is made for the wrong decision. And sometimes the best thought-out and seemingly logical decision can turn out to be just horribly wrong. Like Chuck Berry said, "It goes to show you never can tell."We see at the beginning of the film that two main characters have plans to head for college back east the following morning. Curt is hesitant and waffling at the beginning of the picture. Steve is all Gung-ho. The theme is laid out right there in the beginning."You want to end up like Milner? You just can't stay 17 forever!""We both know what we want out of life and it's not in this town!"But as the film goes on and events and situations affect them each... at the end the tables are turned and Steve can't/won't leave Lori, his high school sweetheart. While Curt realizes he's not a hood/Pharoah and his elusive quest to find and love the gorgeous blonde in the white T-Bird will not be enough to keep him home.And as he's waiting to board the airplane to go east to college in the morning, there's Milner, who realizes who's got a future ahead (Curt) and who's just killing time driving around the shrinking strip in their little town (him) - Sure, he gives Curt the slap on the face and tells him he's not a big shot, he'll always just be a punk, but he's just hiding the fact that he knows who's making the smarter life choice.Okay, the cinematography, the lighting, the dialog, the soundtrack are all brilliantly executed, but the real point of the movie is, we all need to make a choice to grow up and face our life eventually, even if you don't make it the summer after high school (I didn't).I gave this movie to my nephew to watch before he headed off to college and probably will give it to every graduating high school senior that sends me an announcement. The message is timeless.Again, it NOT about nostalgia, and it's not a comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(62(it had to be)%) "Where were you in in 62?" Nowhere I wasn't born yet. A confusing aspect here is that if Lucas wrote this, then how can he explain the crappy scripts of the Star wars prequels? This is a rose-tinted trip back to when cars were made of metal and music had to be at least half decent to get on the radio. There isn't a whole lot to the story as most of the characters spend a large spell of the run-time driving up and down their town looking for fun, but it's well acted/made, and the tragic sense that the simple fun days of the character's youth are coming to an end and will never return is handled well. It's overly nostalgic, but funny at times and sweet-natured, although I'd have liked some more meat on the bones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast cars and crazy characters!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Graffiti is a 70's film set in the 60's that is actually quite a funny and also fun adventure. With some greats of cinema so young acting in this and a script and direction done by a known name, this turns out to be well not in my opinion as good as people sometimes say it is, but nevertheless is good. I thought going into it that maybe it would be dull and just another teen comedy than runs out of jokes on the first corner but this is different and maybe being set in the 60's helped it out a bit. I thought it was a solidly good movie, and here below is why.The story is one that takes a little time to get into it, at first I felt it was never going to start properly and just like the cars, was going to stall fast. It does however get into a nicer flow of things and the comedy also in the middle and end of the movie really flows as well, it genuinely is funny stuff and should make people laugh if only just a little. I liked the ending too, I won't ruin it but you actually are interested in the characters involved and kind of want to see the thing they want, to happen.Richard Dreyfuss is the real star actor in this and his character Curt is funny, clumsy yet weirdly rational among all the crazy youths hanging around. Ron Howard is in it, back in the day when he acted and he does OK too, he doesn't seem to have that much screen time which is good as it isn't just focusing on one person in the story. The entire cast are pretty solid and watch out for a pre Star Wars and Indiana Jones Harrison Ford who even in a pretty minor role, still acts really well in it.George Lucas is the mastermind behind it all, directing and co writing it he does a good job with it all, the script is probably one of if not the best thing about the film with some great word choices and dialogue that kind of draws you in. I enjoyed the set production of the movie, for anyone who lived in these times it could be a massive nostalgic trip back in time, especially if you enjoyed cruising down main street and whistling at every girl you saw.When it comes to criticism, one point for me stands out for me, and that is the music of the film. Now I am not hating on 60's music but the songs are played way too loud and they all sound exactly the same and so for the first half of the movie, I was just annoyed at the music choices. Sometimes I felt it also dragged off just a little bit so that is wasn't that great but it doesn't swerve off the cinema road badly at all.Who to recommend this to?, well I think if I watched it back then I would target youths but even now, the teenagers of today and college students could still watch this and enjoy it all just as the kids of the 70's did. If you enjoy them type of high school Comedy/Drama's then this could really also be for your tastes, however it does feel slightly different to usual ones seeing as it is set in the 60's, and isn't actually all about taking drugs and meeting girls on the street or at parties.Overall it is Solidly a Good movie, some will disagree and say it is great as I have seen many who do, but don't be afraid to dislike parts of it or even not like the film as a whole. I also will say that if you decide to watch this, try to be a bit chilled out whilst doing so as the movie is fast yet slow at times and being comfortable whilst watching it well, you may like the movie much more if you do it that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While Lucas would go on to handle the massive Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises, American Graffiti still stands as one of his finer outings.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before he became one of the industry's most financially successful filmmakers, most notably through his Star Wars and Indiana Jones series, George Lucas was a name nearly nobody had heard of. Lucas made his directorial debut in 1971 with the dystopian sci-fi film THX-1138. Paired with mixed critical reception and mediocre results at the box office, the film went under the radar until it slowly became a cult classic. However, one misstep wasn't enough to stop the young filmmaker, who promptly pumped out another film, this time a coming-of-age drama entitled American Graffiti. American Graffiti fared better upon theatrical release, and for good reason: Lucas managed to craft a perfect representation of the cruising, rock and roll culture of the early 1960s.American Graffiti chronicles four young teens having a night on their California town following their high school graduation. Curt Henderson has received a $2,000 scholarship and is debating going out east to attend college. Steve Bolander, Curt's longtime friend, is having problems with his girlfriend, Curt's sister Laurie, upon planning to go to school with Curt. John Milner, in his '32 Deuce Coupe, decides to use his time cruising around the town. Like John, the nerdy Terry "The Toad" Fields decides to cruise, only he has to borrow Steve's 1958 Chevy Impala due to his lack of his own car.As the night progresses, the lives of the teens change as their last night of innocence comes to a close. Curt gets wrapped up with a group of greasers and a mysterious blonde girl in a white Thunderbird. Steve continues to figure out his relationship with Laurie. John finds himself stuck with Carol, a teenybopper who he's not terribly fond of. Terry overcomes his social awkwardness with girls when he meets the flirtatious Debbie. What follows is 112 minutes of humor, nostalgia, and coming-of-age for the on-screen characters, and even the viewers.Written by Lucas himself, along with Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck, American Graffiti's screenplay executes all of the necessary elements of a coming-of-age story perfectly. The various plot lines are all unique and relatable, giving viewers a further something to relate to in an already relatable concept of being on the brink of adulthood. Characters are vibrant and full of personality, allowing them all to be entertaining during viewing, as well as easily remembered well after viewing. All this grouped with a bittersweet tone make for one of Lucas' better screenplays.All of the performances in American Graffiti are spot-on in delivery. Taking the lead is Richard Dreyfuss, who plays the role of Curt perfectly. Dreyfuss is excellent in conveying the anxious "good kid" mannerisms of the character he portrays as he teeters between going to college or sticking around his hometown, earning him a Golden Globe nomination for his efforts. Ron Howard (known then as Ronny Howard), known for The Andy Griffith Show and Happy Days, is also brilliant, showing his dramatic range as an actor as he, like Curt, considers his own future. Also helping steal the spotlight is Candy Clark as Debbie, the flirtatious and rebellious opposite to Charles Martin Smith's Terry. She really embodies the blonde girl who just wants to have fun, earning her a well-deserved Best Supporting Actress nomination at the Oscars. Also worth pointing out are the performances of Paul Le Mat as the James Dean-esque John and Harrison Ford as a street racing greaser. Yes, THE Harrison Ford.Having grown up in the time period portrayed in the film, George Lucas masterfully recreates the culture of the early 1960s, an era full of post-World War II baby boomers. The streets are lined with pre-1960s cars and neon lit buildings, adding to the night atmosphere of the story. The soundtrack is also full of classic rock and roll hits, including the ever famous Buddy Holly, The Beach Boys, and Chuck Berry. The cinematography is also superb, really bringing out stunning imagery in each shot. It may have been filmed ten years after the time period it's set in, but American Graffiti really makes it hard to tell.American Graffiti was a huge success, making $144 million on a budget of less than $1,000 and earning five Academy Award nominations, including the coveted Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay. It's a shame the film left empty-handed, because American Graffiti is certainly deserving of any of, if not all of, these awards. While Lucas would go on to handle the massive Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises, American Graffiti still stands as one of his finer outings. Well-written, well-acted, and well-directed, the film is certainly one of the best coming-of-age films out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the time, many of the cast members were new with the exception of Ronny Howard, a television star. Ron Howard would go on to Happy Days and a successful film directing career. He played Steve, the All American guy from high school. This is his last night before going to college. Steve's girlfriend, Laurie Henderson, is played by Cindy Williams who would later play Shirley Feeney on television. This film brought Harrison Ford out of acting retirement. Richard Dreyfuss played Curt Henderson, an ambitious graduate going to college on the East Coast. Curt is also Laurie's older brother. Suzanne Somers has a pivotal role. The film is about teens, cars, a drive in, and cruising in town. A lot happened on Curt's last night before going off to college. It has become a classic but I wished they told us about the female characters in the film. Can't forget Wolfman Jack, the radio DJ of the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Film About Teenagers During The 60's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Graffiti is a film about a series of stories about a group of teenagers and their adventures one night that includes themes such as change,loss of innocence and the culture of the United States back in the 60's.It has an ensemble cast the includes Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, Paul Le Mat, Harrison Ford, Charles Martin Smith, Cindy Williams, Candy Clark and Mackenzie Phillips.It was co-written and directed by George Lucas,a legendary director known for Star Wars.Set in 1962 Modesto, California,the story is about a different group of teenagers that wanted to experience fun in the last night of summer before they go to college.They include Steve and Curt, college-bound students with mixed feelings about leaving their family at home;a nerd named Terry,who manages a dream date with a blonde named Debbie;John,a drag racer who wonders how much longer he can stay champion and how he got stuck with young 13-year-old Carol in his deuce coupe. When the D. J. started playing different rock and roll songs on radio all night long,the interplay of different stories begin.Steve ponders a future with girlfriend Laurie and Curt chases a mystery blonde.Meanwhile,Terry tries to act cool to impress a beautiful blonde.Then,Paul prepares for a race against Bob Falfa while stuck with Carol in his car.All of them prepare for a future that awaits them as the night goes by.This film definitely provides bittersweet moments for people who were young during the 1960's.It will definitely provide nostalgic moments for people born during the era of the setting of the screenplay.We also get to witness how the young Americans dealt with the different issues they faced such as loss of innocence,change,college education,dating and the influence of rock and roll music.Aside from that,we also get to witness people who participated in it that had successful careers later after the film was released such as Harrison Ford and George Lucas.Finally,its method of narrative of an interplay of different stories and youth-oriented themes that it presents provided a hallmark for similar films that were released years after.Despite the fact that I am aware that film may not hold up to the present time and may not be even appreciated by young people of today,I still believe that one who wants to see good movie will not be disappointed with this one as it accurately depicted what it is like to be a young American during that time and the method of narrative of different stories that it contains which was considered alternative during its time is comparable to similar films that were released today.These reasons alone makes American Graffiti a classic!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Lucas's neon lit, nostalgic theme park ride into the swinging 60's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like in human history, film evolution has consisted of lots different defining moments and monumental landmarks that have culminated in helping to scrupled cinema into the divine creature that it is now. Some these include; the very first motion picture by the Lumiere brothers and their motion pictures of workers leaving the factory; Birth of a Nation ? which is regarded as the very first epic; to Citizen Kane ? seen as the greatest film of all time, then we have American Graffiti which is quite possibly the god farther of all teen or coming of age films ever conceived thereafter. Without American Graffiti you have no; Breakfast club, American Pie and more recently Mean Girls (Back when Lindsey Lohan was still a creditable actress) each of them is a fine fantastic film that we all hold close to our hearts, but would never have existed, if it wasn't for George Lucas's neon lit, nostalgic theme park ride into the swinging 60's. American Graffiti is a George Lucas American film gem that interweaves seamlessly and effortlessly between four simultaneous stories. Although they are all different, each in its own rights becomes eventful, full of outrages twists turns that leave your head spinning, thus for us as well as the of the young men who experience them in sunny Modesto in the outskirts of California on the last day of the 1962 summer holidays - each remains unforgettable for all the right reasons. There is no rest period in this film; it goes from 0 ? 100 mph in matter of seconds. When watching American Graffiti for the very first (And I envy anyone who is) you can look forward to; pranks, love lost, love founds stolen cars, drag racing, big explosions and a bare knuckle fight just for good measures. It would be hard to find identify a negative from AG, as it is blessed with so many great qualities, you could easily draw on the cinematography, the sound tracks or the acting and for each one you could write a detailed essay on what makes each so great. Like I mentioned before about the neon lit nostalgic theme park ride, I felt the bright lights of shop neon signs lit up and illuminated the scintillating and beautifully sculpted cars, making them look like little fire flies dancing against the backdrop of the night. If someone would have walked in on me watching this film, they would have thought I was crazy, because each time every song played I had to get up and dance, for each was catchy and summed up the 60's majestically, whilst complementing every scenes mood and theme, adding an extra intoxicating layer in what we are seeing and feeling. With the likes of the "The Great pretenders" by the Platters and "Teen Angel" by the Big Boppers, you can't go a whole 10 minutes in the film without a hearing a true classic. Lastly a notable another great aspect of the film were the acting performances exhibited by likes Richard Drayfuss, who plays the man obsessed splendidly, similar to his character in Close encounters of a Third Kind, except you swap a dwarfed alien races for a tall beautiful blond (I know which one I would rather obsess over). Then we also have Charles Martin Smith, who played the helpless romantic impossibly well, never failing to put a smile on my face. We also have the appearance of Harrison Ford (Mr Indiana Jones himself), who at the point of casting still had aspirations in the carpentering field , but his part was far too small, and one leveled for him to really stand out. All in all this film was phenomenal, and if like me you enjoy amazing trend setting films, that will live forever in our hearts, I recommend that if you're going to sit down this weekend to watch a film, I urge you that you make it American Graffiti.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Along with movies like American HOT WAX, THE BUDDY HOLLY STORY and THE OUTSIDERS, American GRAFFITI manages to (re)capture a moment in Time- a time that'll never come again. The drive-in that I grew up in played '50s and '60s Rock and Roll every night before the feature(s) began and it managed to take us back to a simpler (if not exactly 100% accurate) Time- and it's THAT spirit that American GRAFFITI captures so beautifully. One can almost FEEL the late evening breeze blowing through the rolled-down windows, can almost SEE the setting sun turning the sky a molten mix of colors; can almost HEAR the faint echoes of some of the greatest music this country's ever produced wafting along on the breeze.

		<shortDescription>Where were you in "62"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where was I in "62"? I wasn't even born yet and my parents were little kids. But still its nice watching a nostalgia movie even if you're not part of the generation that's represented in this movie. Teen movies always tend to be period pieces of the time that they were made in but what makes this movie work for me is the relatable story and characters. No matter what generation you're part of you'll always find something that you can identify with.The story follows the single night of a bunch of high school graduates spending their last night before they head off to college in 1962. Curt Henderson (played by a very young Richard Dreyfuss) cant decide whether he wants to go to college or not and while driving with his friends sees a very beautiful blonde girl and spends the rest of the movie trying to find out who she is before he decides to leave. Steve Bolander (played by a young Ron Howard) is leaving to go to college but his long time girlfriend Laurie (played by Cindy Williams) can't come with him so they decide to see other people in order to "strengthen" their relationship. Steve loans his car out a friend named Terry (played by Charles Martin Smith) who uses the car to pick up a hot girl named Debbie (played by Candy Clark) but gets the car stolen in the process. And finally John Milner (played by Paul Le Mat) has already decided he doesn't want to go to college and spends the evening in his somewhat older car with an exposed engine trying to pick up girls but ends up accidentally picking up an annoying prepubescent girl named Carol (played by Mackenzie Phillips) Also (pre-Star Wars/Indiana Jones) Harrison Ford shows up as a driver that picks up Laurie and its a nice little role. Each character has their own subplot so the movie never really focuses on a particular main character making the whole thing feel like a bunch of random events but still very intertwined and everyone does a great job with their performances what more can I say.George Lucas wanted to capture that moment in American history where the culture was changing and to recapture his teenage years with the huge emphasis on cars, cruising, and good old fashioned 50s/60s rock and roll music with Wolfman Jack who makes a cameo appearance in the movie."American Graffiti" is a great nostalgia movie that recaptures the moment when we were still innocent and coming of age. Even if you weren't there in "62" you'll find something to enjoy and relate to like I have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Portrait of American Nostalgia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I probably agree with those who feel this to be George Lucas' greatest achievement. It very evocatively captures a moment in time, both culturally and in the characters' lives, and even though I was decades from being born yet in American Graffiti's 1962 setting, I can't help but be drawn into the yearning sense of uncertainty, melancholy and hope.All of the elements work together beautifully. The look of the film and cinematography, the soundtrack of early rock and roll songs, the terrific ensemble cast, the classic cars. By focusing on a single night in a single town, the film is able to get inside the minds of the characters, who are all at points in their respective lives where they wonder who they will be, or should be, when the dawn breaks the next day. There is not really any one "main" character; rather, there are four separate stories going on at the same time, involving a group of friends, and all tying together at the end.The only thing that I would change is the profanity, which realistic though it may be, is a bit more persistent than I would like. But as an artistic statement, it is hard to imagine how American Graffiti could be any better than it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly Entertaining Movie For How Little Actually Happens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple of high school graduates spend one final night cruising the strip with their buddies before they go off to college.What blows my mind about this film is that it is a George Lucas movie. At the time, that meant nothing, but today he is known almost exclusively as the creator of "Star Wars". I would suspect that many "Star Wars" fans are not aware he made this movie or have even seen it (which is incredibly unfortunate). The only connection I could discern was the cameo from Harrison Ford, who was not yet famous. In fact, none of these people were really famous yet (with the exception of Ron Howard).I do love that essentially the film is nothing but two hours of kids driving their cars up and down a street. And yet, it is incredibly entertaining. There are subplots like the pre-college breakup, the dork getting the girl, the drag race, the street gang... but it all comes back to the cars, the music and the street.I received a very strong "John Hughes vibe" from this movie, and wonder if this influenced him in any way... there have been numerous "last night together" teen movies, but it seems like this was the one that really kicked off the trend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lucas drives us back to the Oldies ;..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where was I in 1962? Well, since Pop was only 7 and Mom only 3, I guess I wasn't alive enough to remember. Yet George Lucas' "American Graffiti" has this 'magical' quality, just like Woody Allen's "Radio Days": it made me feel nostalgic for a time I didn't belong to. Take Rob Reiner's "Stand By Me" for instance, because I could identify with the four kids, to a certain degree, the film created a feeling of 'déj? vu' echoing my own childhood memories and its male-bonding insouciance; while in "American Graffiti", I couldn't relate to the four guys but to the time they lived. George Lucas didn't make a nod to the innate innocence of his teenage days but an ode to the early 60's, what we label now as the 'oldies'. The tag line 'where were you in '62?' couldn't have been more explicit.And in one single night, "American Graffiti" encapsulates the whole juvenile lifestyle of 1962; juke-boxes, fast-foods, cars, cruising, the tone is set right in the beginning with the classic sound of Bill Haley's "Rock Around the Clock", the first of a series of an unforgettable soundtrack. Indeed, every scene is accompanied with a defining song of that era "Runaway", "You're 16", "Only You", "Little Darlin', whatever fits the mood. In fact, what makes "American Graffiti" a kind of a milestone in filmmaking is in the way it redefined the use of music for atmospheric purposes. By depicting to the core what the 60's musically meant, before "Forrest Gump" or "Goodfellas", George Lucas created what would become a trademark in 'period' films. Music was everywhere, youth could fantasize on a voice rather than a sex symbol, those were the radio days, those were the cars' days."American Graffiti" is also remembered as a car-themed film, car as less than a vehicle than a social instrument. Young people back then had no other alternatives than going out and discovering the wonders of life only through experience because staying at home was a self-condemnation to a dull nothingness. Cars were the Freudian materialization of freedom level. A man was independent with a car; it enabled him to take a girl, because there was the possibility to drive her home then, and in-between, if he was lucky, to have some intimacy. Charles Martin Smith as the insecure Terry the Toad whose status changes as soon as Steven (Ron Howard) lends him his car, he gets the pretty Debbie (Oscar-nominated Candy Clark) in and is forced to keep on trying to impress her. John Milner (Paul Le Mat) is more of a bad-boy type and his car is the incarnation of his male power, like a complement of his tumultuous personality.Lucas used an interesting word to describe "American Graffiti": anthropological, the film enlightens us about the days' habits and codes, notably how cars were used for social purposes. Cruising can even be compared with today's surfing on the web, we chat on Facebook or visit websites while people were just driving in the neighborhood, to meet each other, or with no other purpose than having a good time, meeting someone, or just aimlessly driving. In a way, cruising defined the youth's state of mind, a transitional moment where many options converge and any choice can be crucial. Steven and Curt (Richard Dreyfus) incarnate these phases. Steven thinks about leaving but is not quite sure about letting his girlfriend Laurie (Cindy Williams) alone, while Curt (Richard Dreyfus), less charismatic and adventurous, hasn't made up his mind yet, his journey embodies the coming-of-age feeling of the film.And all these characters ring true despite the overall comedic tone, a credit to the writing. "American Graffiti" is one of these gems like only the 70's and the New Hollywood generation could have made, it's a character study combined with a social commentary. The character is the baby boom youth, the last generation who grew up with the post-war prosperity, who danced to sweet ballads and rock and roll when it was still a continuation of good old rhythm and blues and the commentary is that this era is over. The fact that the film takes place in 1962 takes all its significance when you know what happens in 1963. Remembering the 60's without thinking of Kennedy's Assassination or the Vietnam War is as impossible as remembering the last decade without September 11th. After 1962, America lost her virginity, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones drowned the American charts, John Milner complained about the Beach Boys wave, English Pop was a tsunami. Girl's dresses would get shorter and shorter making the 50's hottest cheerleader as sensual as a nun. 1963 would be this big leap in the 'sex, drugs and rock'n'roll' mentality. And I guess in the 70's, in the middle of an oil-crisis, where the world was struck by unemployment, where the hedonistic dream of the hippie counterculture vanished from the spirits, people like George Lucas started to feel nostalgic toward these days of lost innocence, and decided to make a film that would sound like both a celebration and a eulogy to a lost era. It's a celebration through the nostalgia-inducing exhalation of cars, colors, a gallery of colorful characters (including a young Harrison Ford) and the kaleidoscope of the greatest hit songs, and a eulogy when it ends with the fate of the four guys, proving that despite the relative innocence of the script, the film was much more mature than that. "American Graffiti" is warm and fuzzy but there is an inner sadness lying beneath and elevating it to one of the best of the New Hollywood era, and of American cinema in general. "American Graffiti" resonates in the heart like a cinematic "American Pie", I'm talking of Don McLean's 1972 tribute to the same era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nostalgic Review of a Nostalgic Movie, that began a new form of Nostalgic Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember back in the 90's when 70's nostalgic entertainment became a popular genre in movies and TV shows? A pop-cultural shift in entertainment that came to a crescendo by the end of the decade with the release of Boogie Nights, The Ice Storm, Slums of Beverly Hills, and Jackie Brown in 97', and the premier of 'That 70's Show' in 98'. All of which, was due in large part to the surprising success of a small semi-autobiographical independent film called 'Dazed and Confused' in 1993 about one night in the lives of high school students after the end of the 76' school year.The sudden popularity in retro 70's Nostalgia entertainment during the 90's wasn't a new pop-culture phenomenon however. But merely a nostalgic repeat of a cultural phenomenon that happened in the 70's when an even bigger 50's nostalgic form of retro entertainment was kicked-off after the huge surprising success of the small semi-autobiographical independent film "American Graffiti" in 1973, which was written and directed by George Lucas about one night in the lives of high school students after the end of the 62' school year. Sound familiar? Despite its shoe string budget 'American Graffiti' became so popular and beloved by audiences in the 70's that Richard Dreyfuss, who played 'Curt' in the movie, said in an interview that co-star Cindy Williams called him shortly after the wide release of 'American Graffiti' and told him to, "Go have dinner at a restaurant and see what happens.". When Richard Dreyfuss took Cindy's advice out of curiosity, to his surprise, he was greeted with a room full of patrons and restaurant employees standing and applauding his arrival. This could be considered the official moment when a whole new form of modern nostalgic entertainment began.Sure, there were nostalgic Westerns before that, but no one watching them was actually alive during the events depicted in the multitude of Western movies and TV Shows of the 50's and early 60's. And a lot of the War movies were made while the actual war in Europe and the Pacific was still being fought, and shortly after the war that eventually extended into South Korea during the early 50's. So the War movies were more of an attempt to romanticize current events, and not so much a nostalgic retrospective of the past.All that kind of changed after 'American Graffiti' was released, and the 50's nostalgic era of pop-culture entertainment was officially on. Happy Days, Laverne and Shirley, Grease were all huge hits during the 70's, while lesser known but equally beloved low budget cult classics like American Hot Wax, The Lords of Flatbush and The Wanderers contributed to the saturation of 50's pop-culture nostalgia as well.Also, Sha Na Na was a very well known 50's retro musical group that must have been popular with someone (don't ask me why?) because they were everywhere in movies, radio and TV.But, of course like every temporary pop-culture sensation from Jazz music of the 20's to Adam Sandler movies at the turn of the century. The 50's nostalgic period of the 70's was coming to a slow but definite end with the declining popularity of TV shows like Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley, and the release of only a hand full of movies like Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Outsiders' and 'Peggy Sue Got Married' in the 80's. And, the super retro group Sha Na Na had already broken up as well, although nobody noticed or cared at the time. Whatever your opinion is about the actual cultural landscape of the mid 50's-early 60's is? The 70's era of 50's nostalgia would have probably never been bank rolled to the extent that it was, if it wasn't for that small semi-autobiographical independent film "American Graffiti" in 1973, written and directed by little known George Lucas back in the early 70's. Whatever happened to that guy anyway?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Teen Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Graffiti is the father of the American teen films that we see today. Without this classic, I am positive that great teen films like American Pie and the Breakfast Club would not exist. Outside of the Star Wars films, this movie is the best film George Lucas directed. Even though the setting is in the early 1960's, I can relate this movie to my senior year forty years later.This film is practically about the last day of freedom and innocence of a group of high school graduates before they head out to the real world.The actors playing the teenagers were really good. They were all unknown at the time but this movie jumpstarted the careers of Harrison Ford, Ron Howard, and Richard Dreyfuss.As I stated before, this movie is somewhat nostalgic to me. I saw this with my parents and they saw it when it came back out in 1973. This film also has a killer soundtrack. I loved the tunes by Bill Haley and the Beach Boys.Overall, this is a nostalgic teen film and the father of teen films as well. However, this movie is long in some parts. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great coming of age story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few years before Star Wars, George Lucas directed American Graffiti. And it was good. I mean, really good. I probably haven't seen a more realistic and engaging movie about teenagers. In comparison to most of the other teen flicks that are really nothing but a bunch of silly comedies without any deeper sense, American Graffiti actually has a point and it's put out on the table very clearly. Because of the marvelous atmosphere and a truly superb soundtrack (so many fabulous songs played throughout, accompanied by one funky DJ's comment and jokes) I wished that I could turn back time and be a teenager in one of the American cities in the 60's era.This coming of age tale shows the one-night journeys of a group of boys, strolling around the glistening roads of Modesto. Two of them, Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard), are about to go to college back east in the morning. The first one is having some second thoughts about this big life-changing decision, while the second is really glad that he will have a chance to make a change and study someplace else. Along with John (Paul Le Mat) and Terry (Charles Martin Smith) they experience a bunch of crazy, funny and very entertaining adventures. Every one of them does something that he probably wouldn't be able to do on a totally different night of the year. This is the one occasion that lets them do whatever they feel like doing, without any regrets. All the drinking, fighting, fooling around, stealing, picking up girls, making love - it feels like there would be no tomorrow. And in that one special night some individuals can go through a sudden transition, just to realize what they truly want in the first place.George Lucas showed, obviously not for the last time, that his directorial skills are on the highest level. Not many directors would be able to present the overall complex and very peculiar sensations that young people are going through in such a truthful manner. The viewer can reminisce about his teenage years and relate to all the issues and emotions that the characters exhibit on screen.All of the four main actors are simply marvelous and really convincing. Richard Dreyfuss is great as a guy, who spends the whole night looking for that one pretty girl, and eventually engages in some risky pranks with a gang trio. Ron Howard as a boy, who deals with some girlfriend problems, and ultimately understands that true happiness is right in front of him. Paul Le Mat's adorable James Dean impersonation makes him look like a handsome and tough guy, with all the catchy taunts and car races. And the last, but probably the funniest and the coolest one ? Terry (played by the amazing Charles Martin Smith), a nerdy guy who finds out that spending an amazing night with a cute girl could be easier than he thought.All in all, American Graffiti is a splendid teen movie that is actually both funny and serious, and presents the problems of the youth in an utmost believable way. Everyone, who ever had to go trough this troubling period in a life called 'growing up', has to see this film, as it shows that the years of fun and freedom aren't always exactly what they seem like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best of the Decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Graffiti (1973)**** (out of 4) George Lucas' best film centers on a group of high school friends who are spending one final night together before two of them head off for college. American GRAFFITI is without question the greatest "cruising" movie to ever be made and I also think it's one of the best films of the decade. It's rather remarkable what Lucas managed to pull off as the start of the 70s were a time when movies were really changing with more sex, violence and more adult material yet here's a real throwback to the 1950s and the director pulls off a miracle in making it work so well. We're basically greeted with a night of hanging out with this group and kids and usually when you're dealing with a film like this there's a character or two that just aren't as interesting as others and when the film deals with them you wish you were watching someone else instead. That's not the case here because all of the characters are so memorable that it doesn't matter which one you're watching because they all manage to bring you into their story and make you care about them. My personal favorite has always been the dork Terry who finds himself with the beautiful girl and of course he can't do a thing right. The performances by the entire cast are wonderful and what an amazing cast Lucas lined up. Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, Paul LeMat, Charles Martin Smith, Harrison Ford, Cindy Williams, Candy Clark, Mackenzie Phillips and Bo Hopkins are all terrific in their roles and even though many of them became very familiar faces, you can still watch this film and see them as the characters and not the stars. American GRAFFITI also has perhaps the greatest soundtrack ever put to use in a film with numerous classics that just add to the film. There's really not a weak moment to be found here as the film is just pure nostalgia and remains one of the funniest films to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A coming of age masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A 1973 coming of age classic that is remarkable in the fact that it contains no box office draw talent, but was a huge hit . The time period was a hook for baby boomer's who were asked " where were you in '62?" The film follows a group of teenagers at the last throes of summer who must make the choices we all must make about the future. Ron Howard leads the cast as a guy who has broken up with his girlfriend and his story intertwines with a hot rod enthusiast, a nerdy type who has a chance meeting with a hot girl, and a young Richard Dreyfus who encounters hoodlums that at first menace him, but eventually respect his cool nerve when challenged. The film is enhanced by some great rock and roll hits of the era. Before Star Wars made George Lucas a household name , this gem is in my mind one of his finest works. Rated PG for mild language. I would recommend this movie for those who enjoy nostalgic themes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Graffiti</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Graffiti at first glance appears to be a typical American High School film, with all the stereotypes that go with it. On watching I'm afraid it does very little to alleviate that sense, yet it is an important film for it's genre and probably created many of the stereotypes which are common place today.I think a lot of the films value probably comes from nostalgia and having grown up in similar times, with events like this going on around you. I can't really relate to any of the characters, that doesn't in any way mean I don't find some of them interesting, I just think that most of the time they are too obvious.The film is well made, and certainly proves that Lucas can direct without entering too deeply into the realms of fantasy. The music of the film certainly fits it perfectly, and adds to the flavour and feel of the piece.It is definitely a believable film as well, whilst watching you certainly get the idea that this actually happened and the characters, even if horribly 2-D, are reflections of real people.It was also a novel experience to see actors like Harrison Ford and Ron Howard so young on screen. Apart from the novelty factor though that really doesn't add anything to the film.I would say that American Graffiti is a good solid film, but it is no way one I can profess to love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a classic with a classic soundtrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I watched George Lucas's 1973 film American graffiti. Well was it a classic, well yeah why not. Let me start by saying that a movie watched in 2010 from 11973, that takes place in the early 1960's can throw a person off but having a memorable cast helps. Lets face it the movie has Han Solo before he was Han Solo Mr. Harrison Ford, one of today's biggest directors, Mr Richie Cunningham, I mean Opie Taylor, I mean Ron Howard, and the still relevant but barely Richard Dreyfus. It also has a pre incestuous relationship Mckenzie Phillips (or possibly not yuck!), Shirley from Laverne and Shirley, and Suzanne Sommers. What did it for me about this movie more than anything else was both the basic story of boys at the precipice of manhood, and the soundtrack that for oldies were far more golden than moldy. I likes this flick and don't see why kids of today wouldn't enjoy it if they gave it a chance. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Graffiti (1973) ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderful coming of age experience, with memorable characters, classic rock songs, and a lot of fun and heart. Director George Lucas (STAR WARS) wanted to make a movie depicting the last days of innocence in America in the year 1962, when teenagers cruised town in attractive cars and listened to music that was actually good, and before John F. Kennedy got assassinated and the world succumbed to the hippie counter-culture, Vietnam, and drug abuse. The film operates on one never-ending summer's night, with four different stories which are all interwoven at different points, with characters cruising town in cars and listening to disc jockey Wolfman Jack along the way. The first concerns Steve and Lori (played by Ron Howard and Cindy Williams, before they were hits on TV with HAPPY DAYS and LAVERNE &amp; SHIRLEY). They're a couple in love, but Steve intends to get out of the small town they're living in by going away to college, and Lori is distressed about their future together. This is perhaps the most average portion of the movie.The second situation is just pure hilarity, as the geek known as Terry the Toad (Charles Martin Smith - in a really likable performance) manages to pick up a pretty blonde who looks like Sandra Dee (Candy Clark). Together they get into all sorts of predicaments while trying to buy booze, and getting their car stolen.The third scenario features a macho-guy car racer named John Milner (Paul Le Mat, years before Fonzie), who gets stuck having to cruise the strip in his souped-up dragster with the accompaniment of a 12-year-old girl (Mackenzie Phillips). Le Mat and Phillips really have a good chemistry together, and go through some humorous and heartening situations. Milner also had to contend with a new racer in town (Harrison Ford) who's trying to challenge his position as undefeated champ.Then we have Curt Henderson (played by a young Richard Dreyfuss), a complex high school graduate who has his heart set on going away to college the next morning, but finds himself in conflict as to whether or not it's worth leaving home. Dreyfuss finds himself smitten by a mysterious and unattainable blonde goddess who frequently drives by him in a white T-bird (Suzanne Somers), and also unwittingly finds himself stumbling onto the turf of a tough gang called The Pharoahs, who insist on forcing him to join their group.The ending of the film drives home the point of how these were the last days of carefree innocence. I suppose many of us will be able to identify with our own younger years, and relate to what it was like. If we're lucky, we'll also be able to recall having had a handful of such special nights ourselves during our bygone days of youth. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You just can't stay 17 forever".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saturday nights have turned into movie night at our household, which includes my wife, my adult daughter and my granddaughter. When my daughter posed the question 'what were the Sixties like', my answer included things like the Kennedy assassination, the Beatles arriving in 1964 to lead the British invasion, LBJ as President, civil rights demonstrations, Woodstock, and finally, Man's landing on the moon in 1969. It was a memorable era, and one that I have the most nostalgia for. "American Graffiti" is George Lucas' film tribute to an age of innocence before November 22nd, 1963; it's principal characters coming to terms with the prospect of tomorrow, a tomorrow that can be as awkward as a child taking his first step.That sense of nostalgia plays wonderfully today when you see who turned up in the picture. Richard Dreyfuss and Ron Howard hold lead roles, complemented by the likes of Cindy Williams, Paul Le Mat, MacKenzie Phillips and Bo Hopkins. Harrison Ford makes an early big screen appearance, and the action is all set to a wonderful era score, hosted in the film by legendary DJ Wolfman Jack. The disc jockey has a touching scene near the end of the picture with the Dreyfuss character, one in which he feigns 'knowing' The Wolfman, and promising to put Curt's message on the air to the mysterious blonde in the white '56 T-Bird.Some might say the picture has a dated quality, but heck, I think that's the point. It's a film about the Sixties, particularly the early Sixties, as the Baby Boomer children of the Greatest Generation started to make their presence felt in the world. I'm part of that Boomer crowd, and every day, THOSE times start to look better and better from the vantage point of present day. It was true back in 1940 that 'You Can't Go Home Again' when Thomas Wolfe's novel was published posthumously, and this picture explores some of the angst associated with the knowledge that once tomorrow comes and Curt Henderson heads 'back east' to college, attempts to relive youthful memories with friends and family will forever remain a futile exercise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coming of Age, American style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People will think that this film is nostalgic, which is certainly one dimension fuelled by the soundtrack, but it is more than this. Seemingly a nostalgia flick from the early 70s that celebrated the loss of innocence of the pre-Vietnam-era 1960s, this is a reminder that George Lucas was a great filmmaker before he became a victim to his own Star Wars mythology. It's really a coming of age movie, post-James Dean and Marlon Brando's Method brooding that retains the optimism and energy that was and still is at the heart of the American Dream. It's a delight to see a lot of future heavies get their licks in this movie, and the decision to cast Charles Martin Smith as the Toad was in fact radical for the time, since he was far from leading man handsome or charismatic. I think this marks the beginning of the brief reign of the excellent character actor in A roles, that ended recently with Gene Hackman's more or less forced retirement and the domination of CGI and huge budgets. This film also pioneered, perhaps inadvertently, the blurring of fact and fiction, when we see a pre-druggie and pre-incest Mackenzie Phillips playing a sexually precocious preteen. American Graffiti also shines as having one of the best cost-to-returns ratio of any film ever, showing that at some point it was still possible for Hollywood to make a great little flick without the boredom and brooding darkness of the European art house fillum that played in three venues because it won the Golden Plow award in some Bulgarian film festival. How so? Good scripting, intelligent casting, great editing (no thanks to Lucas, though). It was also pretty daring to set the film in, more or less, real time at night. Lucas knew how to light these night time scenes and give them way more energy than if they had been shot with natural light during the day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Graffiti</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Graffiti is a coming of age story set in the early 1960's. High school friends, Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard), cruise their favorite hometown strip the evening before they are to leave for college. They spend their last night looking for new and exciting adventures, while hanging out with their childhood friends. The film's theme revolves around how Steve and Curt are faced with tough decisions as they are forced to come to grips with the fact they are going to leave their family and friends the following morning. They become more self-aware and begin to understand the decisions they make on this night will change the course of the rest of their lives. The events of this single night force them to face the fear and anxiety they have about growing up and the uncertainty of life after high school.John (Paul LeMat) was the character who seemed to add to the angst Curt and Steve were feeling about leaving their hometown. He stuck out as the, coolest, toughest and fastest, yet he seemed to be the example the others kids pointed to as to why they should leave town and go to college. John reveled in his status as the cool, elder of the group and some of the other kids placed him on a pedestal. In one scene, Toad (Charles Martin Smith), who was younger than John, exclaimed John's coolness, after a John won a car race, by telling him:"You'll always be number one. You're the greatest." (American Graffiti, 1973, Lucas, G. (Director)) In contrast to this attitude, in another scene Curt had just told Steve he was not leaving town to go to school, when John pulled up in his hot rod. Steve was annoyed by this pronouncement, pointed to John and told Curt:"Do you want to end up like John? You just can't stay 17 forever!" (American Graffiti, 1973, Lucas, G. (Director))John stuck around his hometown and did not see a need to move away or do anything different. He was happy feeling like a big fish in a small pond. His attitude added confusion to what Steve and Curt were dealing with throughout the movie.Another difficulty Steve was facing was the relationship he had with his girlfriend Laurie (Cindy Williams). Laurie was having a hard time accepting with the fact Steve was going to be leaving town and going off to college. They were trying to enjoy their last night with their friends, but the fact Steve was leaving kept introducing negative emotions into their interactions. This lead Steve to reconsider his own decision to leave his hometown and go to college.As the American Graffiti story unfolded, I could see an Ironic twist developing. Steve, who in the beginning of the film wanted to get out of his hometown, began to realize the extent of the feelings he had for Laurie. Ultimately Steve promises Laurie he will not leave her and decides to stay home.Conversely, in the beginning of the film Curt was unsure if he wanted to go away to college. As American Graffiti unfolds, he begins to see the world differently when a series of events forces him to step outside of his comfort zone. Curt spots a girl he has never seen before and decides he has to meet her. He pursues her all night long, sees her several more times, but never gets to meet her in person. Finally, just hours before he is scheduled to leave, he speaks to the girl over the phone. The girl offers to meet Curt if he stays in town and does not leave for college. He declines this invitation and decides to leave for school that morning. This interaction outside of his normal social circle allowed Curt to see there was a whole new world waiting for, however, he needed to leave his comfort zone to find it. He ends up flying to college that morning without Steve. This one night changed the way both Steve and Curt viewed the world. Music and lighting are the 2 most prominent techniques used to support the theme of the film. Music from the time period is present in almost every scene. Even when the characters are speaking to one another, the music is ever present in the back ground. The music of this particular period is when rock and roll was beginning to defining itself. This specific genre of rock and roll represents youthfulness and was very prevalent in the lives of teenagers in the early 60's.Lighting in American Graffiti is very dark. Given the movie takes place over the course of a single night, this lighting technique is very effective. The dark lighting never lets the viewer forget the time frame the film takes place in. The fact the teenagers in this film stay out all night points to the youth of the characters. In reality, there is not a single reason the events of this film could not have taken place from 7:00 A.M. to 7:00 P.M. However, that time frame does not speak to the youthfulness that goes along with staying out until the sun comes up.The story of Steve and Curt is universal. American Graffiti has the ability to take "baby boomer" viewers back to a simpler time of their own youth when they were on the cusp of becoming an adult. All high school graduates are faced with the difficult decision to either stay or leave their hometown. This decision will dictate the path they take as an adult.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The More I View This Film, The More I am Convinced It Is Lucas' Masterpiece, and He May Never Top It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly, George Lucas will be best remembered for the Star Wars and Indiana Jones' franchises which transcended mere cinema by creating a kind of world fueled by SF Fandom. However upon multiple viewings of American Graffiti, I am convinced that Graffiti is really Lucas' best effort, and certainly his best offering in terms of character development, honest dialog, and nostalgic sensibility. Star Wars, the first and second movies retitled Episode IV and V, and Indiana Jones 1 and 3 are certainly Lucas' most visually stunning and entertaining movies, and ground-breaking in that they gave Science Fiction and Fantasy an entirely new audience beginning in the late 1970's. Simultaneously, American Graffiti was the sleeper hit of the early 1970's at a time when the film industry desperately needed new voices.Studio executives of the time were bewildered by film audiences' tastes. Initially, the idea of a film about young people of the late 1950's and early 1960's was categorically dismissed, especially since it had been pitched by the director of THX 1138 which had bombed miserably at the box office a few years earlier. But the studios were also reeling over such box office disasters as "Paint Your Wagon" and "Doctor Dolittle", which were much larger risks than THX. On one hand, the studios were afraid to take any kind of risk, but they also realized that being in the film industry is essentially about constantly navigating unchartered territory. Just like dating, there are no "sure things" in film. What they didn't know was there was a new crop of young movie-goers who had driven cool cars while cruising for girls in the 1950's and early 1960's, all the while listening to a new kind of music called Rock 'n' Roll. This young person's subculture, which predated the counter-culture movement of a few years later, had been scarcely acknowledged, let alone celebrated, by anything cinematic.Sometimes the best material can come from a relatively simple basic premise. The essential "plot" (if plot it can be called) of Graffiti is so straightforward, it seems like it couldn't possibly be successful. Graffiti is about a single night in 1962 concerning five high school friends about to embark on adulthood. For one last night, the go out cruising while listening to the sublime music of the era, two years before the Beatles hit the American pop scene and on the eve of the counter-culture movement which probably would have been almost unimaginable at this moment in time. Most of the characters drive in cars from the era, and the cars themselves become characters in a sense. Most of the action takes place on the streets of a nameless American town in which young people, both young men and young women, are simply trying to have a good time.The film is a series of character-driven vignettes concerning Curt (Richard Dreyfus), Steve (Ron Howard), Laurie (Cindy Williams), John (Paul le Mat), and Terry "The Toad" (Charles Martin Smith) having a night on the town in an out-of-the-way suburban area of California. (In fact the story was supposed to take place in Modesto, CA (Lucas' hometown), but because of logistic problems, the production was moved to Petaluma, CA.) Accompanying them on their escapades are two elements entrenched in the eyes and ears of the era: their cars and their music. Every scene has a different hit song from the period being played, something almost unheard of except for possibly "The Graduate". The music echos through the streets as if every one in the town is tuned to the same radio station being DJ-ed by the immortal Wolf Man Jack. Curt has earned a collegiate scholarship but is unsure about his future, and then he sees in a T-Bird, the ideal woman of his dreams, played by Suzanne Somers, mouthing the words "I love you". Steve and Laurie are in a relationship threatened by the possibility he might leave for college; Laurie still has another year in High School. John and Terry the Toad are lovable losers who seem like they will live and die in this town, unless they radically change who they are. John does own a cool car but he gets stuck with having to drive with a pre-teen girl. He is then confronted by an outsider, Bob played by Harrison Ford, who challenges John to a race. Meanwhile, Terry the Toad who probably is not as successful with women as Toad from "The Wind and the Willows" meets a somewhat flirtatious blond named Debbie. He drives in Steve's car, an Impala, and pretends it's his. There is no way to describe why this film works as well as it does. The acting is right on the money, the dialog seems completely natural and not scripted. The scenes were shot with real cars that were really driving, bringing an end to the era of the phony-looking back screen that was used in movies all the way up until this time. While all the actors are first-rate, my personal favorite is actually Charles Martin Smith as Terry the Toad. For me, he and Candy Clark as Debbie almost steal the show, although all the different vignettes are compelling and mesmerizing.As there are no downsides to this film at all, a near-perfect cinematic experience, the only downside is that after the third Indiana Jones film, Lucas seems to have lost his edge in writing. His characters in his more recent offerings, particularly the last three Star Wars films(which are actually episodes I, II, and III) seem flat and lifeless, and his dialog cliché and uninspired. Where did he lose his edge? The fine writing he exhibited in Graffiti seems to be from a different hand if not a different person. Lucas of the 2000's was not the same as the Lucas of the 1970's and early 1980's. Maybe by becoming such a mega-player in film, he lost the talent of his younger and hungrier days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this recently on DVD and liked it so much I decided to add it to my personal collection. While I think it was a little slow-moving, that was clearly on purpose since the time period was much more slow-moving than present day America. Ron Howard and Cindy Williams did an excellent job as the bickering, clearly in love couple who faced the possibility of separation when Steve went off to college, and Rixchard Dreyfuss turned in a very promising performance considering that his career had just gotten started.In general, it was just reflective of a more innocent time. Today John Milner would have been arrested immediately for cruising with the underage Carol, and even Toad's getting alcohol for himself and Debbie doesn't seem all that bad when you consider that in a more modern film he'd have likely been looking for drugs instead. Times were a lot different then, and even though my answer to 'Where were you in sixty-two?' is that I wasn't even alive I know enough history to say that a lot of things have changed for the worse.Good acting, good cast, great music, and unlike with Grease the principal actors actually look like teenagers. (I actually love the movie Grease as well, but Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta did not look seventeen!) I look forward to watching this again and again in the future once I get my DVD copy of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Lucas takes us back in time with his cult-classic 'American Graffiti'. Lucas, mostly remembered for making 'STAR WARS' and the legend of it... but believe me guys, Lucas has made some amazing stuff in here, that surely translates as one of the greatest films! 'American Graffiti' is a study of the cruising and rock and roll cultures popular among the Post-World War II baby boom generation. The film is a nostalgic portrait of teenage life in the early 1960s told in a series of vignettes, featuring a group of teenagers and their adventures in a single night in late August 1962. Lucas brings style, rock and roll, dances and an attitude in 'American Graffiti'.Some films don't bore and this is one of those rare gems. The screenplay is so perfect and inspiring, that each writer gets in the mood of holding a pen right-away. Lucas brings in 10-odd characters that are wonderfully marked, placed and executed. Lucas's direction is flawless, amongst the best I've ever seen! The Soundtrack is EPIC! You're back in time and you're loving it! Performance-Wise: Candy Clark steals the show in a role that earned her a Academy-Award nomination. She is fantastic. Richard Dreyfuss is terrific. Paul Le Mat is bombastic. Ron Howard is exceptional. Cindy Williams looks cute, and her performance is a topper as well. Harrison Ford leaves a mark. Charles Martin Smith stands out. Others are perfect.On the whole, One of the finest films ever! A LANDMARK! Mr.Lucas, thanks for taking me back in time! 60's, wow!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No one should ever erase this Graffiti, its a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard) are close friends in a medium-sized California town. Its 1962 and they are on the verge of high school graduation. Therefore, they want to "cruise" the strip one more time with two other friends, John (Paul Le Mat), the fastest dude with a souped-up car, and Terry (Charles Martin Smith), the clumsy dweeb with a heart of gold. But, naturally there are underlying issues. Steve and has been fighting a lot with his girlfriend (Cindy Williams), for she doesn't want Steve to go to college on the east coast with her brother Curt. As a junior, she worries this move will break them up forever and, after all, she is a head cheerleader to Steve's class president gig. Curt, too, feels something is missing and when he spies a beautiful unknown blonde (Suzanne Somers) on the strip, he decides to spend the night chasing her. John is a powderkeg of worry as well, since he knows he can't be king of the cruise forever and he has no great future aspirations or talents. Lastly, Terry is just finally trying to get a gal to look his way and when he meets a lovely platinum gal (Candy Clark) he thinks his ship has come in. During the course of the night, John gets stuck with a very young teen passenger, Carol (Mackenzie Phillips), Curt gets sidetracked with a local gang, Steve fights with his gal, resulting in her riding around with a handsome new guy (Harrison Ford), while Terry has trouble buying booze for his new love interest. Is this going to be a memorable last night? You bet! This film, a first big winner for George Lucas, is spot-on in capturing the essence of life for a 1962 American teenager. Just before the Vietnam war sobered everyone down, life was a carefree journey of cruising and hanging-out. Wait, really? No, maybe not, for despite the joy and laughs in this adventure, there is an undercurrent of insecurity, jealousy, and rivalry that can and does exist anytime, anywhere. The young stars, all of whom are terrific, got there first big breaks in this one. Dreyfuss, Howard (well, he was already famous as Opie), Williams, Smith, LeMat, Clark, Somers and especially Phillips and Ford, do memorable work and moved on to more Hollywood glory. As for the sets, costumes, camera work, script, and direction, it would be difficult to locate any film that has all of its elements working together for such a whopping success. If you have been doing the Rip Van Winkle dance for 40 years, wake up and get this very funny, very touching, very winning flick without delay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't Disappoint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"American Graffiti" is, in a sense, not a new concept. The fifties and sixties were littered with movies where teenagers cruised around, got into trouble, and it culminated in some kind of an action-packed final confrontation, often enough it was a climactic drag race as in Graffiti. Most of these movies were pretty terrible and remembered only because they were mercilessly mocked in an episode of "Mystery Science Theater 3000".Graffiti though, despite having a capsule plot that is indistinguishable from those clunkers, is one of the great achievements in film history. What exactly makes this movie so good, then? I have to say it's because we very quickly care about the characters. This is accomplished simply enough - they are archetypes, familiar types of people we can all relate to, sometimes quite personally. There are the two guys heading off to college and a bright future. Steve seems happy with the decision, and is so ready to move on that he tells his hometown girlfriend they should date other people. Curt is ambivalent and leaning towards staying home, despite not seeming to have any particular reason to remain, as Steve does. John is the popular, savvy drag race king who is bitterly aware that he's being left behind as high school is over and he isn't heading to college. Terry is the geeky loser whose friends look out for him, and although the role starts out one-dimensional, depth is happily added as the movie progresses. There's a beautiful simplicity in the way we know these character's life stories and can relate to them within a minute of their appearance on screen. Part of it is the acting, part of it is the naturalistic yet poignant writing. The bottom line is that George Lucas makes us care about these guys, whereas with most movies like this from a decade before, we just felt like laughing at the leads. Once we care about the characters, Lucas is careful to give them a night full of amusing adventures and misadventures. Their experiences are triumphant and awkward at the same time, which is just perfect. The movie takes place over the span of one night at a crossroads in the lives of 4 young men. It's only right that things are exciting yet confusing, because that's just how life is when you're 18.The movie also has a great deal of nostalgic appeal, of course, and although for me, the answer to the movie's tag-line "Where were you in '62?" is "not even born yet", I still love the ambiance, the time capsule quality of the movie. Of course, the music is a big part of this, but there's also the cars, the goofy slang words (this is boss!) and just that general nostalgia for the time period that pervades the whole movie.For me, "American Graffiti" compares well to its contemporary "Mean Streets" which is similar in feel in many ways but lacks Graffiti's intentional nostalgia and tidy package of an ending. Graffiti also stacks up well against its 70s nostalgia counterpart, "Dazed and Confused". It's not that one is any better than the other, they're just both great nostalgia pieces on the time period they fixate on. If you've liked one you should like the other, I think.Graffiti is at its best when you feel like (or wish you were) in the car with the kids. It's all stuff you more or less went through if you had a typical suburban upbringing in America at some point in the last 50 years, and the movie does an exceptional job of capturing that. Although it all takes place on one night in 1962, it's surprisingly relevant today, and more modern viewers should track this one down. It's a lot more than just "some movie George Lucas made before Star Wars".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Graffiti is a movie, set in the 50's, about a group of friends that spend their last night together riding around the town. Most of them will still be together, bu they have to say goodbye to a good friend who is going off to a distant college. This friend also has only one more night together with his beloved girlfriend. During their drive they run into several antagonists. They challenge some of these antagonist to race them. These scenes are pretty unrealistic but only make the movie more appealing and fun. This movie has great characters, and a great soundtrack. I loved all of the songs they played in the movie. Those old doo wop songs created the perfect score for the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looking Backwards 1973-1962</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was a deserved success and a revolutionary approach in film making. It integrated songs into the story and created a product that was greater than the sum of its parts. It observed the classical unity of time, place, and action. The small town where it is set may now be as obsolete as 25 cent gasoline. Downtown small businesses are mostly gone. Its simple story is really a glorified version of 1962 memories, which were not likely the "happy days" shown, except in retrospect. There were a lot of changes since 1962. The story is about some high school students who are graduating. Some will go on to college and have a bright future possible in those times. Others will remain and work in middle-class jobs like small businesses. No mention of the agriculture in that area. There are a few hard cases who will meet the police in their professional duties. The 1960s represented the best years of their lives for most people, as measured by the wealth of ordinary people. The story plays upon the ignorance and lack of experience of teenagers, compared to what they will know in a few years. Education isn't always taught, it often must be learned. The entertainment comes from the seeming naive comments from teenagers who find themselves in tight spots. Its filmed from a teenager's viewpoint, adults appear as obstacles or in the background. Its locale appears before the Federal and state highway systems eliminated isolated rural areas with two-lane blacktops. A follow-up film was made showing many of the characters years later. Some are married with children. "Its a Wonderful Life" compressed people's lives into one film. Could a third sequel be made? Yes, but it would not be a success because it would remind people of realities best left unmentioned. The early 1970s were not "happy days" after the devaluation of the dollar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lucas' masterpiece is still the best film of its sort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw "American Graffiti" I dismissed it as visually striking but empty. Several viewings later I have come to appreciate it as Lucas' masterpiece and one of the best films of the 1970's, a film with a real sense of maturity and understanding of this phase in life, and one which features so many colorful and interesting characters who all feel real or relevant even today. "American Graffiti" is so much more than just a nostalgia piece, and remains far, far superior to the many movies it inspired, which ARE empty and lack the substance and strength of character this had. Even the acclaimed ones like "Dazed and Confused" are exposed for what they really are when compared to this film.Haskell Wexler is credited as a visual consultant on this film, and given that I cannot find any information on the credited cinematographers (who are only credited on one other film) I must assume that he had a lot to do with how this film looks, as it does seem very much like his work. It really is absolutely gorgeous, and given how hard it must have been to light the sets where the film was shot, completely on location, quite a remarkable aesthetic achievement. It's stylized, but not in a manner that makes the film look improbable or unrealistic, and it is one of few American films from the 1970's which consistently looks beautiful, where one can pause the film at any point and find an evocative or beautiful image.George Lucas was still a good director at this point, of course, and he tells this story remarkably well. I don't think there's anything here that I would have done differently, and it is almost unquestionably his finest achievement as director. Even when you take away all the great shots in this film there's still a rich and well-told story. There have been numerous films like this, chronicling the experiences of a group of seniors just after or just before the end of high school, but none even begins to approach how perceptive and intelligent "American Graffiti" is, and how well it captures the emotions many of us felt at that age."American Graffiti" is a special film that is unlike any other although it has been copied many times. It is not just great entertainment, it is a film that captures human nature like few others, and one that is as striking on an emotional level as it is on a visual level. A simply outstanding film.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious nostalgic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my personal favorites of all time, "American Graffiti" proves to be one of the most hilarious and entertaining films I've ever seen. With no real plot, it gives us nothing more than an inside look at a 1960s graduating high school class's last night cruising the town before officially becoming adults. Although they are probably just a little exaggerated, we probably laugh at most of the material in this film because we know how funny it could be if it happened in real life. Ron Howard, Charles Martin Smith, and Richard Dreyfuss were all excellent as some of the film's main starts. The film also features a young Harrison Ford (before he proved himself to be a good actor). There's not much to say about this film, since the laughs come from a bunch of simply random elements of the film. Perhaps it's each characters reaction to each situation that makes the film so fun to watch. The ending adds a small touch of drama and sadness to the film, but the movie is a far greater portion of comedy than the latter. What a masterpiece directed by a pre-Star Wars George Lucas. "American Graffiti" is one of the most enjoyable films ever made. Not the Best Picture of 1973 (that was rightfully earned by "The Sting") Nevertheless, this one is not to be missed.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Chewy, Blondes Are Not This Much Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Lucas hit upon a classic theme, 1950's nostalgia in 1973. When folks wanted to forget about being a modern teen, getting drafted, and wanted mindless fun this movie did it. Lucas got this inspiration from his own teen years as he turned 16 in 1959. This meant that while he would later draw on Ben Hur for the Star Wars saga, he first achieved success here drawing on his earlier childhood.The brief introduction of Suzanne Summers &amp; Harrison Ford in this movie were not noticed until years later. Wolfman Jack on the other hand got a great boost from this film and became an icon of his own. Ronnie Howard was already a big name from Andy Griffith. This movie would boost him into the Happy Days.This film is our look into the 1950's age that Lucas remembered oh so well. This film does it so well that you almost forget the 1960's ever happened &amp; we all grew up. The sexual innuendo from this would carry on for Lucas. Chewy, get into there, I don't care how it smells. Just let me turn on that radio dial &amp; spend another night with the Wolfman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this yesterday, and I thought it was great. I am a big fan of Lucas' art, and I think Indy 4 was the best movie of the year. I had been looking forward to seeing his first major picture, and it really was great. The use of 60s music is just awesome. After the first half hour I was mesmerized like I had been sucked into another world. We can really get to know all the characters like it was our own friends, and the story is certainly excellent getting all the pieces together in the end with a very touching ending. Look out for Harrison Ford and Richard Dreyfuss in early roles. There are also a lot of references to American Graffiti in Indy 4, by the way. I will not mention them here, but it is obvious that you can draw references to other projects by Lucas - even to the computer game Maniac Mansion which also portrays a lot of young people who are quite similar to the characters of American Graffiti.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Lucas's first good script and last (?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, the first Star Wars film is a masterpiece for many reasons, but none of them are the clunky dialogue in the script. George Lucas is known for, along with his special effects and Star Wars films, awful scripts. The most recent Star Wars films are so poorly written they make me cringe, and this is George Lucas's only good script to date, possibly because it wasn't entirely written by him. "American Graffiti" is a low budget classic that really makes you feel like you're in 1962, and by the end, you won't want to leave.Here we have four stories about teens graduating high school, each one different, each one surprisingly good. There's Curt (Richard Dreyfus) who's confused if he wants to go to college or just stay home and go to junior college. After some turn of events, he ends up with a gang of hoodlums. Steve (Ron Howard) said the wrong thing to his girlfriend and is trying to patch things up. Terry (Charles Martin Smith) is taking care of Steve's car when Steve goes away to college, and he picks up a good lookin' chick, which results in many comedic situations. John Milner (Paul Le Mat) is a drag racer trying to pick up chicks, but he gets more than he bargained for when he ends up with the 13 year old sister (played by a young Mackenzie Phillips) of a female acquaintance of his. All four of these stories take place over one night, and they all level each other out nicely.All the kids give good performances here. Some are stereotypes, but they are likable stereotypes that break out of the mold and become more than one dimensional characters. The sub-plots are genuinely funny, and in some ways this actually reminds me of two later movies rolled into one. This movie is like John Landis's two films "Animal House" and "The Blues Brothers" packed into one good movie. It has the rowdy teens, and fast cars, and it has the cool 50's and early 60's music. The situations these characters face are often imitated in more recent films. For example, in "Superbad", an underage character trying to but alcohol almost gets away with it, but the store is robbed. Here, the character gets away with it, and the store is robbed...it's like the same scenario.I know my review contained a few comparisons to other films, but with a great teen comedy like this, all you can do is compare it to imitators, and this comes out on top. Perhaps a young George Lucas was inspired to (co)write this good script, or perhaps he just happened to strike lightening, something his writing would not do again. Prove me wrong Mr. Lucas! My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 110 mins. PG for language, sexual innuendos.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Graffiti has been a personal favorite for years. I don't know why exactly, I just have always loved this movie and probably always will. George Lucas has created an underrated classic. American Graffiti is overshadowed by Lucas' later pieces including Jaws and Star Wars and Indiana Jones.The cast was picked perfectly. Richard Dreyfuss stars as Curt Henderson, the victim of circumstance and protagonist here, who is questioning college life and looking for the girl in the white T-bird. Ron Howard co-stars as Steve Bolander, the prom king, and popular guy in high school who is leaving with Curt for college in the morning. Paul Le Mat is excellent as John Milner, who is my favorite character. Milner has the fastest car in town and can't seem to outgrow teenage interests and nightlife. Charles Martin Smith plays a great Terry "the Toad" Fields, the klutzy, unlucky nerd who tries hard to get some action using Steve's car. The music was excellent. You hear a wide variety of 50's and early 60's rock playing on the radio in the foreground or background. XERB is playing on every car all the time in American Graffiti, with Wolfman Jack as the DJ. There is also a very early appearance by Harrison Ford as Bob Falfa, the mysterious guy driving a 55 Chevy looking to run Milner out of town. With a great cast, an interesting plot, and great music, American Graffiti is a definite classic and does indeed deserve much more praise than it gets. I give it a 10/10. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Where were you in '62?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It wasn't until 1988 that your humble reviewer emerged into this world, and yet I can now declare, with complete conviction, that I have experienced the early 1960s! George Lucas' second film, following the science-fiction 'THX 1138 (1971),' is a wildly entertaining blast-from-the-past, a delirious dose of nostalgia that recreates an era when life was apparently so much simpler. President Kennedy had not yet been assassinated, the Vietnam War was still three years away, and teenagers occupied their time by eating at the local diner, cruising around in their vintage automobiles, and looking for young women to woo. Lucas' trip down memory lane, inspired by his own teenage years, obviously struck a chord with audiences of the 1970s, his low-budget picture becoming a considerable financial success, and being nominated for a respectable five Oscars {including Best Screenplay, Best Director and Best Picture}. The film's influence continued to stretch across the decades, inspiring similarly-nostalgic TV shows such as "Happy Days (1974)," and ensuring the development of the director's next project, the legendary 'Star Wars (1977).' The events of 'American Graffiti (1973)' unfold on a single hot summer night in 1962, as four recently-graduated small-town students waste away the hours of darkness in their hapless attempts at young romance. The four leading men each boast a distinct personality, their clear-cut characterisations highlighting the apparent simplicity of the era in which they lived. Steve Bolander (Ron Howard) is an eager, intelligent young romantic whose fondness for his girlfriend Laurie (Cindy Williams) makes leaving for college a difficult decision; Terry Fields (Charles Martin Smith) is a bumbling, completely-uncool wannabe whose recent acquisition of Steve's car gives him added confidence in interacting with girls; Curt Henderson (Richard Dreyfuss) is a bright and promising student looking for a reason to remain in town; John Milner (Paul Le Mat) is an ultra-smooth rebel with a reputation for having the fastest car in the region, though his unplanned rendezvous with a chattery, thirteen-year-old girl reveals a tenderness that he didn't know he possessed.George Lucas created 'American Graffiti' on a modest budget, with filming taking place primarily at night over a period of one month. Francis Ford Coppola, fresh from his success with 'The Godfather (1972),' agreed to produce the film. Though the original cut, later described by editor Verna Fields as "one hell of a picture," ran for an epic 165 minutes, it was rejected by Universal Pictures and sliced down to a more audience-friendly length. Nevertheless, 110 minutes is more than enough time to experience the fashion, lifestyles ? and, yes ? the music of 1962. The incredible rock soundtrack, featuring more than forty well-known hits from the period, blends effortlessly into the action of the story, and the radio show of disc jockey Wolfman Jack becomes a character of its own. The main actors and actresses deliver convincingly natural performances, with special credit going to Richard Dreyfuss, who plays the bright but restless Curt with a contemplative earnestness. Also look out for an emerging Harrison Ford, whose drawling Bob Falfa is so out-of-sync with the rest of his career that you can't help but chuckle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great film from a young George Lucas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A period youth drama set against a virtually non-existent plot would seem a little thin to go by, luckily the brilliant direction, appropriate music and sympathetic actors make American Graffiti an undying classic. Like THX-1138 before it, it possesses a kind of innocence and purity that Lucas' post Star Wars films perhaps lacked.What the film does best is have brilliantly varied cast of characters and several good plot lines going around simultaneously. As for the drama side of things it's really difficult to compare it with a more traditional adventure film like Star Wars and it's really not entirely comparable with the more esoteric and artistic THX.The point I'm striving for is that I'm a person who isn't the biggest fan of period pictures, I don't like drama and I especially hate teen-flicks. While this film fills the criteria for all three I was able to watch it without getting bored. Watching the movie is a brilliant experience and should not be missed by anyone.</fullReview>

You can certainly see the seeds of that galaxy far, far away in this ensemble piece about a night a long time ago in a small town not so far, far away, but it's still got an original trilogy vibe. It could almost be the Tattoine Years, with Ron Howard an embryonic Luke Skywalker, Paul Le Mat Han Solo, Richard Dreyfuss C3PO, Charles Martin Smith R2D2, Bo Hopkins Chewbacca, Wolfman Jack Obi Wan Kenobi and Harrison Ford Greedo. Thankfully there's no Jar-Jar this time out (well, maybe Mackenzie Phillips), but there's a lot of time spent cruising Mos Eisley in landspeeders. In its day its huge profits certainly led to as many ripoffs as Star Wars, but none managed to tap into it's surprisingly edgy indie, almost nouvelle vague vibe without pushing the darkness or exploitation elements too far. At times it's almost like a Californian version of Fellini's Il Vitelloni.The key to the film's success is its understanding of what its like to be stuck in a small town yet also afraid to leave it at that point in life when you're suddenly aware of the real threat of failure. So, instead of dealing with any of the big issues on the back of their mind, it's various characters distract themselves with trivia, the film to-ing and fro-ing between them as the night gradually turns into day, all linked by the simple but brilliant device of having all the characters have the same radio station on in the background with Wolfman Jack as a half-heard Greek Chorus, binding the stories together like the Force ? okay, enough with the Star Wars analogies already. Paul Le Mat, the one who didn't get a sitcom, directorial career or Thighmaster infomercial deal out of it, gets the best of the script as the doomed boy racer facing up to the fact that he's strictly small town, although there's enough left over to give everyone in the cast their moment in the sun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it first came out in '73 at the prodding of my then girlfriend, who had seen it a week earlier. I was 26 at the time and just the right age to appreciate its nostalgic value. In '62 I was a freshman in high school. I remember dragging main in Salinas, California, which was not that far from Modesto, where this film was shot. It was truly a voyage down memory lane. It reminded me more than anything of my high school graduation night. Lucas did a masterful job, in my opinion anyway, of capturing the true essence of a teenage night in California during the early 1960's. As some commenter's have iterated in here: This movie was the defining moment of the Age Of Innocence. Vietnam was ahead as well as the accompanying social unrest and other things which would forever change the landscape and fabric of this nation. It truly was a trip down memory land then and even more so now 34 years later. American Graffiti is a classic and will never be duplicated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was in the second grade. Or just about to start the second grade in the summer of 1962. But this reminds me of my own high school years (I graduated in 1975). I can truly identify with Curt. I didn't want to leave high school because I was kind of the "big man" in town. I was also chasing phantom girls, maybe not blondes in T-birds, but I was a hopeless romantic. It was eerie. It was as if George Lucas had looked over my shoulder and wrote my life's story in that movie.Yes, folks, this is George Lucas before STAR WARS, and this is another darn good story he wrote. This movie makes you want to laugh and cry at the same time. Anyone who has ever lived through that period will cry over times and places lost forever. Even though I was very young, I remember that time period well, so much so that I want to freeze frame it and go back to it knowing what I do now. And George Lucas gives us a poignant, sometimes funny, sometimes painful look at the last summer of our innocence, before Viet Nam, before political assassinations, and before everything just went into a tailspin. The little pictures and captions at the end kind of wake you up to reality, like a slap of cold water in the face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genuine surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember that there was quite a bit of hype in the Uk about "American Graffiti" when it came out -- maybe a general nostalgia for the 1950's. In around the late 1970's it was re- released on a double bill with "Dracula". Have to be honest I wasn't that keen on seeing it.Well I can only say I was genuinely surprised at what a well observed film it is.A final night out for the guys and girls in Modesto.There is an array of characters that we follow through the night into day break and you end up liking them all.The ending has a wow factor -- the kind that makes your hair stand up on the back of your neck. Haskell Wexler's photography intermixed with Walter Murch's brilliant editing takes you right to it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie reaches out to people of my generation and holds them in an unrelenting trance until the final credits roll. Being a guy who used to drag race and cruise the main street for hours on end, night after night, I can vouch for it's authenticity. We'd cruise around in a never-ending search for girls, parties and other guys with whom to drag race. I can recall joining in the long lines of hot-rods and family sedans that would wind their way, like a long twisting python, to the paved concession road that doubled as a drag strip. When I look back on the era, I shudder to think of the danger that was involved in such commonplace and everyday activity. But at the time, it seemed a mundane and innocuous way of breaking the tedium of the late teen years. Suzanne Somers makes her film debut as the lovely mysterious blonde in the white T-Bird. It seems that at every stage in our lives, there's a beautiful and mysterious blonde in a T-Bird who inhabits our dreams.A great movie for anyone who wants to remember the way it really was when you were a teenager of the 1960s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie celebrating the '60's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, George Lucas must have really love the '60's! This entire movie is an nostalgic trip and homage to the charismatic '60's. I mean, if you want to see how life of the American youth in the '60's was like, you should really watch this movie.The movie its story follows a group of friends that spend their last night together in town as high school graduations. After this all their lives will change and they will each head into different directions with their lives. For the last time they do want they want and simply enjoy their youth and the innocence of it. The movie has multiple story lines as it follows multiple individual characters during that one night. Every character experience something different and also learn some important life lessons in the progress. It makes the story well written and developed and all of the characters likable and interesting, although they are very stereotypical. It also of course helps the movie that they are being played by some great actors.The movie features lots of actors that at the time were still very young but now are very 'big'. Ron Howard, Richard Dreyfuss and Charles Martin Smith but also Harrison Ford in a small but very cool and likable role. A kind of role you wouldn't expect of him now days. Also look out for Kathleen Quinlan and Joe Spano in some small roles. So real great casting in this one! Every actor delivers a very realistic and likable performance.The movie features lots of stereotypical nostalgic '60's elements, such as drive-ins, cruising the strip, drag races etc. The movie is good looking with some nice looking cars and production design. It really helps to set the right mood for the time period the movie is set in. Also of course the very present musical-score consisting entirely out of memorable rock 'n' roll hits of the era helps to give you a real '60's' feeling, even if you weren't even born at that time (such as myself by the way).The movie is a great mix of nostalgic '60's elements and 'coming of age' story lines. It makes "American Graffiti" an unique and pleasant viewing experience.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant teen movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw this film on video, and I have to say I wasn't disappointed. George Lucas was just four years away from making STAR WARS and here he shows what a great storyteller/director he already was. It was apparently based on Lucas' own teen days. I watched it this film with my brother and when I mentioned that fact he stated that Lucas was probably the nerd, like Terry the Toad. That sounds reasonable. I was glad that Terry got himself a girlfriend though.It's great how the different plots with each character are examined in great detail. Over the space of one night, the characters get into various different adventures. I liked the bits with hot-rodder John Milner, owner of 'the fastest car in the Valley' as he befriends a frustrated twelve-year old whom he is tricked into giving a ride to. Richard Dreyfuss spends most of the film trying to find a mysterious blonde beauty who drives a white Thunderbird, and falls in with a bad crowd as he does so. But he escapes the gang and, with the help of DJ Wolfman Jack, he gets his life in order. The performances are all great. Mackenzie Phillips is initially annoying as the twelve-year old, but becomes sympathetic when she tells Milner what her home life is like. A young Harrison Ford appears as an up and coming drag racer who challenges Milner to a race. He doesn't have much to do, but we can already see shades of Han Solo in him. Both Ford's Chevy and MIlner's Deuce Coupe are the kind of cars you'd kill for. Bottom line: American GRAFFITI is a classic, not to be missed!</fullReview>

The film deals with the Californian high school graduates having fun one late summer night in 1962. If you have not seen "American Graffiti", I suggest you see it right away!

Paul LeMat and Makenzie Phillips are great too. It's accurate, funny, and smart. I like that it doesn't try to explain anything. The movie just lets you ride along with the characters on a summer night. The Vespa,Toad trying to buy alcohol, the puke scene, the goat murderer, "My dad says he's a Negro." All of these are priceless. The ending is bittersweet, maybe a shadow of the war in Vietnam and the unrest ahead. The only negative was pointed out by a friend in college; it's WASPish. Otherwise it's perfect.</fullReview>

This film wants to take you on a cruise, and I really felt like I was along for the ride. That is how closely we can identify w/these ppl.

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would rate this as one of the top ten greatest American movies of all time. Why? Because you will never find another movie which even approaches it in: (1) accuracy; (2) acting; (3) music; (4) mood; (5) humor; (6) photography; (7) dialogue; (8) direction; (9) sound; (10) subtlety; (11) cars. I grew up in that time. From the movie, everyone remembers the outrageous cop car axle breaking scene, or the liquor store holdup, or the climactic drag race, but I think of the subtly beautiful and razor sharp authenticity and naturalism of the scene of Curt and his old girl friend talking in the back seat of the car. The easy familiarity of Kurt and the two men in the back room of the arcade. John Milner and Carol strolling through the junk yard. The older girl at Mel's diner who likes the Ron Howard character. The teacher and female student standing so closely together in the darkened school hallway. The pain and anguish of Terry. The conversation between Milner and his buddy and girlfriend at the drive-in. Kurt sitting atop a car watching TV, and the blurred gray shapes which appear around him, which turn out to be the Pharoahs circling him like sharks. The liquor store proprietor. You could go on and on and on. This movie is so much more significant than your typical "teen" movie.Lucas has created a masterpiece for the ages. A truly unique time portrait taken on one summer evening during an innocent era in the history of a great country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In light of his more recent work, it's hard to remember a time when George Lucas could be considered a great director. Well, during the 70s, he was, and for proof, you need look no further than American Graffiti. It's a low-tech, achingly human film about love, heartbreak, growing up, and rock and roll...the kind Lucas couldn't direct nowadays to save his soul. The cast is like a who's who of the biggest television and film stars of the 1970s, and even some of the actors who have been somewhat overlooked with the passage of time (such as Paul Le Mat and Charles Martin Smith) turn in outstanding, nuanced performances. While the Star Wars films may have overshadowed this gem in the public's mind, check it out, and wonder what could have been had Lucas continued to direct movies with the same passion and humanity he displayed here...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One measure of a great movie is to ask yourself, "will I watch this movie over, and over again." The answer to George Lucas' American Graffiti (1973) is a resounding "yes." This film will live forever. Great acting, comedy, action, script, and music. And to have Dreyfus and Ford together as young actors in one of their first films. George Lucas is brilliant in making a film flow smoothly with multiple story lines, and soulful background music with the superb Wolfman Jack keeping us on track. Add top performances by Ron Howard, Cindy Williams, Charles Martin Smith, and Candy Clark (academy award nominee). This film has a personality of its own and is a predecessor of films like Saturday Night Live &amp; Grease. And the answer to the question is yes, I'll watch American Graffiti over, and over, and over!</fullReview>

Who would think a film about fast cars, the early 60s, and Post High School Pre-College (not to mention a great soundtrack) would be a great film? Whoever sees "Grafitti". I can quote the ENTIRE film! That is how truly affectionate I am about this masterpiece. There is only one other film like it,"Dazed and Confused". But, even Dazed is not as great a film as this. The only other film I can think of that is like this is "Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da" (a more modern adaption). But none of them are as great.9 out of 10P.S.: "Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da" Is a film I plan to make, but I assure you It will be like "Graffiti".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Graffiti is not a film that grabs you right away. In fact, there are parts of it that are downright boring. But look further and realize that this is really what teens, about to graduate high school, were actually like in the 50s and early 60s. It was an era when the automobile was something to be treasured. It gave you status and said a lot about you as a person. It was a time when drive-in diners were everywhere and outdoor movies provided privacy to be with the one you thought you loved. Phrases like, "that's boss" and "going steady" were common language for young people then. This film is void of gang fights, gun violence, and running from the law. It is how the "average teenager" spent a Friday or Saturday night. Very soon, the world would change drastically beginning with the death of a president and our involvement in Viet Nam causing America's to be divided like no other time in our history.American Graffiti is something to be savored folks.There will never be another time that was so magical. So jump in the back seat of that classic Chevy and come along for a great ride.</fullReview>

My wife is not impressed by this movie and I can't see why! Lucas was able to pull some of absolutely great performances from some very young actors. This movie should be used in high school history classes for its authentic look at a way of life that seems to have vanished from America. Or has it?

		<shortDescription>A group of friends spend the last night of summer together in 1962</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AMERICAN GRAFFITI ( rating, * * * * * out of 5 )Where were you in '62? This is the burning question the posters and advertising asked us on the film's release. Well, I think I was being potty trained while feeding Lego pieces to the dog.Living through this era is not a prerequisite necessity to enjoy 'American Graffiti'. To enjoy 'American Graffiti' you need to remember a time in your life when things were free and easy, and when just hanging out was the coolest of all.Writers George Lucas, Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck, and director George Lucas (yes, he of 'Star Wars' fame and fortune) bring us a film that is simplicity itself. It's the last night of summer in 1962 and a group of teenage friends are about to embark on life's journey, but not before spending the night together, a night they will never forget.This movie is chock-full of integral elements that made the 50's so cool. The cars, the songs, the lingo, the dress and most importantly, the attitude. Rock and Roll music incessantly blares from every car radio, juke box, corner store and diner. In fact the film contains no original music at all - the soundtrack is one long trip down memory lane. From the Beach Boys to Buddy Holly, from Chuck Berry to Bill Haley and the Comets.George Lucas recreates this era perfectly by including such refinements as endless cruising, street gangs with cool jackets, drag racing, a sock-hop dance, a drive-in with waitresses on roller skates and the most important of components, Wolfman Jack.His wild howling and frantic DJ banter links the songs and provides the perfect transitional tool to get from one situation to the other. He even makes a cameo appearance in a nice scene with Richard Dreyfuss. Other cast members include Ron Howard, Cindy Williams, Paul Le Mat, Harrison Ford, Charlie Martin Smith, Mackenzie Phillips and Suzanne Somers.It's not the story that drives this film, it's the wealth and depth of characters - people who we really care about - they are all someone we know - someone we have loved - or they just remind us of ourselves. They all touch our hearts through moments that are funny, serious and heartfelt - moments that are sincere.For me the stand out performance was that of Paul Le Mat's. His portrayal of John Milner, drag-race legend and all round cool guy who refuses to grow up, is absolutely riveting. He manages to be profound and ultimately fatalistic about his future and the choices he makes. A delicate balance to uphold, but Le Mat manages with a deft sense of thoughtful awareness.The enigmatic scene between Le Mat and Mackenzie Phillips where he takes her on a guided tour of a car wreckers yard while explaining all the fatal drag-race crashes, is absorbing on all levels and chillingly prophetic.All in all there's everything to like about this film. The final drag-race is very cool and the ending is tinged with a bitter sadness. What else can you ask for in a movie?George Lucas has been elevated to God like status for creating the 'Star Wars' legend and subsequent madness. But for me, it's 'American Graffiti' that sets him apart from the flock. If this humble little film made in 1973 was to be his only achievement, then George Lucas would still be a major talent that would hold a special place in cinema history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable, intention comedy by George Lucas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Lucas is most famous for making the Star Wars trilogies and producing the Indiana Jones series. But between his first sci-fi film THX-1138 and his big hit Star Wars, Lucas made a comedy film (excluding the Star Wars prequel), American Graffiti which was nominated for a number of Academy Awards.Set in the early 60s, American Graffiti tells the story of four friends before they go their separate ways on summer night. They is Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) who is having doubts about going to university on the other side of the country who is searching for a blond beauty driving a white Thunderbird and ends up getting mixed up with some greasers. Steve (Ron Howard) is also going to university and in the middle of an on-off relationship with his girlfriend Laurie (Cindy Williams), starting with him breaking up with her at the start of the film. John (Paul Le Mat) is a hot-rod racer who accident picks up a young girl, Carol (Mackenzie Phillips) and ends up getting challenged by a rival racer (Harrison Ford). And finally there is Terry the Toad (Charles Martin Smith), who is given a car by Steve and ends up trying to impress a attractive young woman, Debbie (Candy Clark), simply by lying about everything about himself.American Graffiti is considered one of the great car films, showing iconic classic cars in all their glory. There is also a really good soundtrack of late 50s and 60s song, fitting for the film.It is a film that shows an idealistic version of the 60s, set in a white, wealthy, middle-class small town where teenagers have nice expensive cars, have no really issues and any delinquency they get up to is minor and tame. The late 50s and 60s was a period of post war affluent in America: people were becoming wealthier and having more disposable cash. It was also a period where teenager culture grew and divided childhood and adulthood.The film itself is really a series of a events rather then a narrative structure, they is no real aim in the film. Curt is possibly the closest thing we got to a main character who is has a real decision either go to university on the other side of America or stay, be safe and find a girl. Steve is a jerk, he breaks up with his girlfriend because he wants to screw around at university and then in a later scene pressures her into having sex. John is your typical bad-boy with a heart of gold: he is annoyed with Carol at first but he slowly likes her and feels sorry for her. And Terry is your typical movie nerd, who is bullied, used and abused and is socially awkward: but he is optimist and wants to get with a pretty (properly the first girl who has shown any interest). John and Terry are the funniest characters in the film: they have the funniest lines and the funnier scenarios. Terry particularly is in a scenario many young men have been in, trying to impress a young girl and buying alcohol underage. One of the funniest jokes was expertly parodied by The Simpsons.I do have to question this world the characters live, where it is okay for men to pick up young girls in their cars, a girl allows her younger sister to go with a much other man, a man obviously looking for a girl to have sex with and these teenagers are out all night and their parents do not question it? I am also surprised that American Graffiti has a PG rating because there is a bit of swearing, but I assume this was because the PG-13 and 12 ratings were created.George Lucas was able to make a fast paced film after a slow start. The driving scenes are well done, Lucas is a man who knows how to make action sequence. The jokes and humour is actually good and some of the issues are try to life. This is also the best dialogue Lucas has achieved, but that is possibly because he was not the only writer for the film. He knows how to create an atmosphere and despite the night setting, he visuals are strong: Lucas knew how to use the headlights and neon lights of the setting and you can still tell what is happening, compared to some more modern films.Overall, it is an enjoyable film and it is interesting to see Lucas making a more grounded film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"American Graffiti" still ranks as the best "teen" movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I noticed one reviewer (from Australia) who just didn't understand why "American Graffiti" still has such an impact on audiences. I guess being from another country and continent has its limitations when it comes to understanding America's youth culture. "American Graffiti" is a serious movie about an era in American that was about to change forever. Although it's based in 1962, it's really about the end of the 1950s and the Age of Innocence during the Eisenhower years. Vietnam, JFK's assassination and the violence of the 1960s are all just around the corner, and the cast of characters in this film represent the transition. "American Graffiti" has many comic overtones and there are plenty of hearty laughs sprinkled throughout the film, but they all serve to mask the seriousness of the main plot which involves the precarious future of the four main leads (Ron Howard, Charles Martin Smith, Paul LeMat and Richard Dreyfuss). Set during one crucial late summer night in a small California town, Steve and Curt (Howard and Dreyfuss) are supposedly leaving in the morning to attend an unnamed Eastern college. There are irresistible forces pulling them to remain; Steve's girlfriend Laurie (Cindy Williams) and Curt's new fantasy love (Suzanne Somers in a white-hot Thunderbird). Terry the Toad (Smith) is also in the mix as the nerd of the group who just happens to meet the new love of his life in the form of rebellious Debby (Oscar-nonminated Candy Clark). Hot-rodder John Milner (LeMat) is the unacknowledged leader of this quasi-band-of-brothers mainly because he's the tough one of the group and the oldest. The foursome's misadventures all intertwine on this evening with telling results regarding their futures and the paths they have chosen. As the credits unfold at the end, each character's fate is juxtaposed on the screen for the audience to ponder. Their pictures are in the clouds, and like the era they represent, they are soon gone forever."American Graffiti" is still arguably director George Lucas' greatest work even if he'll most likely be best remembered for his "Star Wars" epics. The movie certainly hit a nerve upon its release in 1973 and is one of the most profitable films in history. The results Lucas attained on his shoestring budget of less than $1 Million will never be duplicated. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture and made another fortune upon its re-release several years later. Many of the young actors in the film went on to sterling careers, including Harrison Ford who had a minor part as Milner's nemesis, Bob Falfa. The Rock and Roll soundtrack that accompanied nearly every scene in the film is a classic in its own right, and the songs stick with you long after the final credits roll off the screen. Simply put, "American Graffiti" is one of the greatest movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoughtful film with first rate ensemble acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Lucas's second film as a director is much more accessible that his previous effort, THX 1138. It is engrossing and draws you in for the whole story, despite the steady pacing. This is because Lucas focused much more on the story of the characters, rather than the technical aspects which frequently distracted the viewer in THX. Nevertheless there is still aspects of the film making that are experimental choices, notably the choice of film format, shooting in Techniscope. Also, like THX, Lucas also elected to have a group of personnel heading up the photography: Lucas himself, Haskwell Wexler (who helped light some of the outdoor sequences), and lighting cameramen Jan D'Alquen and Ron Eveslage. This unusually large collective, not headed by a typical director of photography, nevertheless worked extremely well. The photography is all the more impressive bearing in mind it was filmed in just 28 days entirely on real locations, without the access to purpose built film studios. The atmosphere set up is entirely appropriate, albeit the cars do seem to be lit more stylishly than the actors! But the cars, are, after all, a key backdrop to the story.Written by Lucas,Gloria Katz &amp; Willard Huyck, the script captures the atmosphere of the time very well. There seemed to be a lot of scenes that were ad-libbed and/or improvised, which together with the way its filmed, give it an immediate and reality based quality that further enhances the film. The character's motivations are interesting at the start of the story, but it's fascinating to see the characters' plans evolve, or even completely change in one night. The humour is subtle and unforced, and kudos has to go for Lucas for an approach to directing that is ideal for this material. He seemed quite content for the actors to hold centre stage, albeit evoking an optimistic atmosphere, which is poignant with this story set immediately prior to the effect Vietnam would have on the nation's psyche. In fact, the film's ending is powerful and entirely appropriate, even if it took just a little too much time to get there. Its a shame that the this ending wasn't properly acknowledged or appreciated with the decision to make another film. Art direction and editing are solid. Lucas trail blazed the role of the music supervisor by foregoing a traditional soundtrack and writing the a draft of the script with specific songs in mind. Apart from the notable absence of Elvis Presley (budget limitations?) the musical sources work brilliantly and further enhance the atmosphere.Acting performances are very naturalistic and improvisational, with strong performances all round, so I won't single any one out, as the whole cast were very good, though the stories ultimate focus seems to be on the Curt character, with Richard Dreyfuss being first rate with an interesting and refreshingly realistic take on his character.Overall a very enjoyable, accessible and thoughtful piece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The soundtrack is the best thing about this movie. Oh yeah, and the bitchin' cars don't hurt.Otherwise, the plot is sssllllooowww. This movie drags along. Don't get me wrong, the nostalgia associated with it (even at the time it was made) is great, but the action (if I can even use that word here) is definitely lacking.This is one of those films that launched a career for virtually everyone involved. Even proved TV actors (Dreyfus, Howard, Ford) first found real success in the movie industry with American Graffitti.Maybe I am so used to seeing movies with so many hot rods in it have more racing or chase scenes, but the one small 30sec. one we are treated to at the very end is just not satisfactory enough for the oil in my veins.I am not an expert on this period, but the look of the characters (greasers, preps, girls on rollerskates) seems to remind me more of a mid - late 1950's scene, not an early '60s. Even the soundtrack would seem to suggest that. Of the 41 tracks, only 11 of them were written or released after 1960, and one of them "All Summer Long" by the Beach Boys was released in 1964, two years after the movie was supposed to have taken place. The remaining 30 tracks all came from the '50s.Good to watch on a lazy afternoon one day when you don't have much else to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Memorable Movie With Buckets of Heart and a Fascinating Theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All right, Star Wars fans, prepare to hate me. I think "American Graffiti" is much better than "Star Wars" (at least the original 1977 film). I understand why George Lucas is more connected to that than this ("SW" changed the way films were made, and "AG"... was about a bunch of teenagers), but this film deserves much better.You all know that it's a story about four teenagers on the last night of summer in 1962. You know about the soundtrack, with Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry and other greats. You know it has Ron Howard and a whole bunch of people with whom you're already familiar. But do you know these things: it has great cinematography, fantastic acting from an ensemble cast with absolutely no weak links, and a perfect sound scheme that blends the dialogue with the music in an interesting and practical fashion-- did you know that?Take it from someone else who *loves* movies-- this is why they exist. It's a movie about love and decision, friendship and fun, about which dreams you have to let go and which dreams you should keep chasing. It's also meant to connect viewers to a bygone era, but never at the expense of the thoroughly human moment. I can say with confidence that "American Graffiti" is much better than both "Happy Days" and "Grease", against which it is constantly measured, and that it remains Lucas's (and one of Coppola's) masterpiece. However, most of the people who like this movie will end up hating the 1979 sequel, but you should still watch it-- it deserves a fair chance. And maybe it does end up disappointing, but then look back at this landmark original-- how could it not?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Precendent Of Teen Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before someone decided to give George Lucas a wad of money and heaps of technology, the grand-daddy of Hollywood blockbusters made his cut with early classics such as this 60s themed teen comedy. Featuring the niftiest cars, the grooviest music and a whole host of stars-to-be American Graffiti set obvious movie trends, stemming from earlier works such as Rebel Without A Cause (one of the characters is obviously a James Dean clone) that would be followed up by later classics of the genre such as Amy Heckerling's Fast Times At Ridgemount High and Richard Linklater's Dazed &amp; Confused. Stylishly shot Lucas' film certainly looks the part, capturing the best that the late 50s and early 60s had to offer. Among the film's wide arrange of wonderful sites are the central diner, where all the waitresses serve you on skates and cars pull up in the parking-lot style drive-in, ordering through the ever-muffled microphone. All the characters listen to the same radio station, operated by the enigmatic "Wolfman" almost offering a chorus to the film's many intertwining plots and narratives. A lot of the narrative is told from the cars, ranging from John Milner (Paul Le Mat)'s Ford Coupe racer to Bob Falfa (Harrison ford)'s '55 Chevy. Characters will talk to each other on the road, either cruising for dates or swapping the dirt on other people. IT keeps the story interesting and entertaining. Not to mention making it look better. Some of the cameos are wonderful: checkout Harrison Ford's racer cowboy Bob Falfa, who is constantly on the coattails of John Milner, goading him about his racing skills. Stylish, funny with a serious edge beneath the colour American Graffiti may not be as revered as many of it's predecessors, but certainly holds enough style, groove and set-pieces to make every bit as watchable today as it was in 1971.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1962 in Revue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1962 was a time of change for America. The music was changing, the clothes were changing, the world, and the next generation of young adults, the "baby boomer's", are ready to go off to college. It was before the British Invasion and before the US got involved in Vietnam. Their were late nights cruising around with your favorite girl waiting to here that song on the radio. It was the time period of George Lucas's breakthrough picture.In Lucas's American Graffiti, we go back to one hot summer night in California where we join a group of friends for what may be their last night together for a while. It is especially restless for Curt and Steve (Richard Dreyfuss and Ron Howard) because they don't know whether or not to go onto college or not. Steve's girlfriend Laurie (Cindy Williams), Curt's sister, is not too pleased when Steve says that it's OK to "see other people" while he's away. For Curt, he spends the night looking for a blonde driving a white T-Bird that appears to say "I Love You" in his direction, but he can't be sure.The other half of the group is out trying to just have a good time. Steve gives his friend Terry "The Toad" his car to take care of while he's away at school. Right off the bat, Toad thinks he can just pick up any chick with wheels like that. He ends up seeing this platinum blonde by the name of Deborah (Candy Clark) and the two spend the night together, one neither of them will ever forget.John Milner (Paul Le Mat) is known for his tough roadster, the best in the valley. He patrols the streets looking for action, in particular a guy named Falfa (Harrison Ford) who is looking for him. Instead he cruises around with Carol (Mackenzie Phillips), a young teenager who hops into his car at a stop light. The two must try to get along or else she'll get him in trouble.Filmed virtually entirely at night, the movie has a very real aspect to it. The characters are like regular people with hopes and dreams that we all go through. We all want to leave home yet there is a part of us that wants to stay, a real coming of age story. Lucas incorporates not only a great script and a great story, but he uses the feel of the era. The music goes along with the mood of the story at that moment. The dialogue is straight out of that time period. The movie itself is a time capsule. American Graffiti is one of the first movies to have an entirely rock and roll soundtrack, with no music written for the picture what so ever. Having original music would have ruined the movie's appeal. His creative way of telling a story is very unique. But he wasn't the only one to emerge from the 1970's. There was Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, and many others. It was a breakthrough age and Lucas truly stood out.This was his second feature length film, following the success of THX-1138, the movie based on his student film Electronic Labryinth THX-1138 4EB. He would later go onto make Star Wars, one of the highest grossing movies of all time, which lead to five other sequels and prequels. He also wrote the Indiana Jones trilogy.American Graffiti isn't just a movie, it's a tribute to what life used to be. To what the country used to be like. Lucas gives us a great film to enjoy for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A blueprint for soap operas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Graffiti is a clever, but nonetheless, souped-up soap, which has inspired, and thus become the 'blueprint' for contemporary soaps, such as Happy Days. By this, I mean that the film, like most soap operas flit continuously from scene to scene without really advancing forward to anywhere specific.American Graffiti, like Happy Days takes a post-modern, nostalgic look at a bygone age; in this case the 1960s' white middle-class America, which it then no doubt distorts for commercial reasons if nothing else! Here in American Graffiti, there is a concentrated focus on the lives of four young adolescent men. This leaves the roles of the women and girls - which is exemplified in everyday life - as secondary, support roles, which serve the purpose of putting emphases on the importance of the male characters and their roles. Indeed, the women in this film are portrayed as emotionally weak and needy, particularly of the young men, who are shown here as having all the advantages of opportunity to excel, by advancing themselves via higher education, and new life experiences.While the lines are deliberately cheesy in this film, the actors pull them off very well. By pulling off cheesy lines, the young actors in this film illustrate their range of talent. I am only hesitant that it is by giving young actors cheesy lines to make them into more convincing adolescents, that it will have the effect of stereotyping teenagers, and portraying them as irrelevant, and corny young people with nothing important to say. This would have implications for Western democracy would it not? Meanwhile,although I am not a great fan of the music in this film, it did serve well as a sound track which is necessary, not only for telling the viewer what era the film is set in, but to create an ambiance which is essential to the film. And, it is ambiance as opposed to plot, and character development - which are not really relevant to the objective of this film - which makes this film work, especially in a sentimental way.Overall, a film worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film perfectly captures high school life and its bittersweet ending. The characters are all so recognizable - the jock, the tough-guy gear head, the frustratingly virtuous girlfriend, the boyfriend who can't wait for the virtuous girlfriend, the insecure guy who doesn't fit in, the easy girl and, of course the confused aimless guy with lots of potential and serious questions about whether that potential will ever be tapped. I could say that Kurt's character was like most of us coming of age in the fifties, sixties and seventies (I don't profess to know what its like to grow up now, and I shudder to think), but I think we can all relate to most of these characters. I've been the popular guy (Steve), the brainy guy (Kurt), the hood (Milner &amp; the Pharaohs) and the dork (Terry). I dated the good girl who wasn't so good but not quite bad enough, the girl who was willing, but who's sexual experience came at a social price that her boyfriends would never pay. This movie shows the point at which all that changes. With few exceptions whoever you were, whatever you did in high school would change dramatically afterward and you could feel it coming. College offered a chance to remake yourself in a positive way, maybe the beginning of a great career or just finding the group of people that you could feel comfortable with, who wouldn't question your actions or ridicule your personality. Likewise, staying home offered other changes such as joining the work force, getting married or just hanging around like you did as a high schooler but without the social acceptance. Whichever choice you made, doubts and fear permeated your feelings toward the future. The ending music to American Graffiti is the Beach Boy's 'All Summer Long', a sweet song with a slight regret about the return to school in the Fall, is made deeper and much sadder in the context of the ending of the freedom and innocence we all have before we have to face the adulthood and the knowledge that there will be no more Summers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someone nostalgic for diners,chrome and neon in general,this will suffice. It is rather disappointing not because it came from George Lucas, who went to fame and fortune with the Star-Wars Trilogy. This movie was made on a limited budget in Petulama CA, where the hamburgers and shakes were skated to the hHotrod classics from a neon diner. George Lucas, was never a director to portray the characters like Coppola would have done. In fact this movie was offered to Coppola to produce, but he opted out for credit and percentage. A movie produced for a $2 million went on to fetch more than $7 million for George Lucas.There would have never been "Star-wars" if it not for this movie. Yes, this movie is a classic for its times, as much as "Saturday Night Fever", was for the jaywalking disco-dancer in New york, but if you compare it to the the Godfather,Bugsy,Goodfellas,this movie is all-chrome no glitter. What made the movie a moneymaker and a success was the splendid cast that was handpicked by Coppola,Kurtz and Lucas. They were all fresh, with budding talent that emerged into great careers and it was evident with Dreyfuss. The movie is nostalgic for the the era but hyped for today's standards.</fullReview>

Now, looking back, as a high school graduate myself, I can sympathize with the characters who are unsure about the future. I felt the same way when I left high school. Also, It had a great cinematography and I like the fact that a lot of big stars got started here. This was Harrison Ford's first movie, and of course he ended up in a lot of Lucas films like the Star Wars trilogy and the Indiana Jones movies. So I really like this one.

		<fullReview>In the days before George Lucas was laid up in his Skywalker Ranch thinking of how to make even more money out of the Star Wars brand he was, amazingly, a very different film maker. (Before percent points on lunch boxes took over his life, maybe one of the top ten directors of all time.)American Graffiti is all the evidence anyone would need.The film is really about nothing, that is its secret weapon: A lot of college kids, cruising around Small Town California circa 1962. Every Small Town cliché character is given at least one outing: The town bully, the over-groomed college boy (and his clean-cut g/f), the town nerd, the hip DJ, the boy racer, the town's dim (but nice) blonde - need I go on?It all happens on one night (another signal that we are in clearly in movieland) and ends by telling us what happens to them (in bubble text no less!) when the Small Town bubble finally bursts. Although we are not told what happens to the town's dim blonde (Candy Clarke), because she doesn't count - not even to the film makers. Yes, we are in a world before Vietnam, AIDS and mass unemployment when the worst thing that could happen to you was to be laughed at by your peers, have spots or be punched in the belly by a leather jacketed goon. When rock music blasted from every building and car (to help sell the soundtrack album) and there was always a sexy girl (or guy) to keep you company. Like so many world's - it probably never really existed anywhere or at any time - but there is enough truths, of sorts, for you to accept it as "real".They tried to re-create the magic in More American Graffiti (1979), but without Lucas all we had was clichés without magic, rather than clichés with.</fullReview>

Something resembling style alternates with something resembling plot, but there is never a melding of the two. "Maryjane" (1968) is a far better film on a similar subject, yet it has been utterly forgotten and is not on DVD, as it should be. "American Graffiti" is mere bubble gum wrapped in cotton candy, trivial pop anecdote, posing for the sake of posing. The older I get the more exacting my taste becomes. I would now give a negative review to "Rebel Without a Cause". Like "American Graffiti" it is too glossy, too colorful. Reality is not a used car commercial.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a lot of college and university films out there lately and I thought: ?Why not see an old one.' I mean the new ones are basically just plain rude (though that does not mean they are not fun). I just wanted to see how that sort of film was made in the 70's. Besides that, the fact that it was successful and that it has a great cast and crew (Lucas (writer &amp; director); Coppola (producer); Dreyfuss and Ford (actors)). All this quality really did not disappoint me. It was a fairly good film, with a couple of laughs and a good story, although there was not much of a story. It is basically a film, that follows the good and the bad things that happen to 4 guys in a night in a town. Pretty good for the 70's. One thing is unsatisfying though: who is that BLONDE???7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the movies that started me on my great adventure in what I call "folding," what you might prefer to think of in other terms.On the surface, this is what it seems to be: an evocation of a car-centric teen culture that was already disappearing in 1973, and is now either completely gone or transmuted into a branch of simple consumerism. Its very well made, and since its a reference to things past, its even more powerful now than 30 years ago. That's three times longer than the distance from when it was made to the period to which it refers.When I saw it, I wondered why it worked so well, and I believe it had something to do with the way the episodes are linked. Sure, they're linked by cars, but deeper than that they are linked by the shared world they inhabit served up through the car radios. All the stories are built on this spine; all the references to ideals are ideals that come through the radio.Here's what I subsequently learned: one of the writers used explicitly what I am calling folding to give the thing power. Just as we are expected to let the film seep into our world and tie together episodes we carry ? and just as this film is intended to supply small stories as target stories for life... so is the radio show within the story. Its designed that way, so as we see the radio show influence, even create parts of the world for who we see, the movie automatically inherits that role, more deeply for us.Its why we had to have that episode about the blond in the T-bird, unapproachable, and finally left behind by the "smart guy" who ? in order for the folding to work ? becomes the writer-in-LA, who presumably pens what we have seen.Its a simple example of the technique. Oh, there are complex elaborations, like the business about Wolfman Jack not being "real" but in tape.Powerful, still powerful.The writers wanted to include the women in the report on futures at the end, so here goes.Carol tried serial marriage, laconic suicide, and lazy adventure. She's a substance abuser, and has been since two years after we see her. She still has the gearshift knob and appeared with it in a porn video in 1984. When clean, she is a highly sought speaker on lucid feminism, and has three bestsellers.Debbie attached herself to four successful artists, each of whom left her on their success. She is currently working as a cocktail waitress, living in Los Angeles and active in the cat rescue program with the local SPCA. Debbie has lupus. She has a new name and is estranged from her three children.Laurie married young, stayed in town, had a successful career with the city and is the unhappiest of the three. Her husband is in real estate.The girl in the Thunderbird became a shill for stupid products on TeeVee.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie's Appeal Is Lost on Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I'm just not the right age to fully appreciate the nostalgic tug of this film, but I've never warmed to the charms of "American Graffiti." I usually like movies with loose, improvisational styles, which "Graffiti" certainly has. But here it feels more like pointless meandering than it does hip improvisation. The film stars a number of actors whose faces would become familiar but who were as yet unknown: Ron Howard, Richard Dreyfuss, Harrison Ford, Cindy Williams, and notably Mackenzie Phillips, who gives the funniest and most outrageous performance of the group. Fans of 1960s music and hot rods will also get a kick out of the soundtrack and the souped up cars these kids cruise around in, whiling away the hours before life -- and particularly the Vietnam War -- takes them in separate directions.Many lament the fact that George Lucas went on to make the "Star Wars" series when he could have instead made more films like this. I don't know. I for one enjoyed "Star Wars" a hell of a lot more.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Graffiti</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to agree with my film professor when he claims this movie is George Lucas' best film. The story is so tight it's hermetically sealed. Four friends after graduation are only one night away from leaving each other to go on with the remainder of their lives. It's up to them to decide if they're ready to go yet or not. What makes this movie appealing to many is its soundtrack. Taking clips from the top 40 charts of the 1960's and placing it alongside hot rodding muscle cars really sets this movie in a period and truly asks you the question on the poster "where were you in '62?" Again, this is the kind of solid movie-making that allows the director/writer to go on and do whatever else they want to do in the industry. It's like a golden ticket into the studio system, and for Lucas it was his chance to rebound from the failure of THX-1138 and get back on his feet to make Star Wars. After that it's the gravy train and as many remasters of your movie as you want to make because people are going to buy it, no matter how many times you jerk them around. O, Lucas, how thou art what thou despised as a film student. Picked this up at the University library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Graffiti is one of my favorite films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw American Graffiti in 1973 when it first came out and I really liked it. But my esteem for the movie has grown over the years. I still find something new to enjoy in it each time I watch it. I mainly like the movie not only because I remember all the background music by heart, but also the movie is exceptional and memorable because it has good dialogue with many humorous one-liners. The malapropism by Joe, the leader of the Pharaoh's, "Rome wasn't burned in a night!" is a classic; the deadpan face line by Curt to Steve at 3:00 AM when Steve inquires to where he is going, `I have,. a dental appointment."; Curt to Steve and Laurie while in her car after he sees the blonde in the T-Bird who has just whispered to him through the closed window, `You two have no romance, no soul! Someone out there roaming the streets wants me, Steven hang a right!' Terry the Tiger's pickup line to Debbie, "Hey did anybody ever tell you, you look a lot like Connie Stevens"; Falfa's gum-chewing girl to Milner after Falfa guns his '55 Chevy and it roars,"Ain't he neat!"; Debbie's longing car comment to Terry, "...I just love tuck and roll upholstery."; Carlos of the Pharaohs protesting to Ants the Pharaoh as they struggle to get in the '51 Mercury, "Hey man you can't call shotgun all night!" or the howl of the jesting DJ on the car radio, `Hang on, we're gonna rock and roll ourselves to death!". The list goes on. The dialogue keeps you interested within each scene while the major theme of the four teenagers occurring in a non-linear fashion forces you to question the nights ending while at the same time not wanting the picture to end. And to all this add the glue of the music on everybody's car radio and the ever present DJ voice and the result is not only a potent nostalgic and semi-historical film, but a fabulous tapestry of music, acting, dialogue, cars and directing from the genius of George Lucas. I realized after doing a little sleuthing that there is an interesting time-age characteristic in the 10-year window that exists between the time settings of the movie, 1962, and the time that the movie was shot, 1972. Two of the major characters and a few of the minor characters were actually teenagers themselves during the late '50s and early '60s and grew up with the music and the times just as George Lucas did. At the instance of the film in 1972 Cindy Williams and Richard Dreyfuss were both 26 years old each playing a character 8 years their junior. Candy Clark, who plays Debbie, was also 16 in 1962. Harrison Ford and Bo Hopkins were both 30 at the time of filming, placing them at 20 years old in 1962. An odd time-age inversion is that in the movie John Milner, played by Paul LeMat, is 20,"the aging teenager" and therefore the oldest of the major teenage characters. But in 1962 he was only 10 years old and 20 in 1972, one of the younger members of the Graffiti cast. And of course the grand old master George Lucas was a mere 28 at the time of filming placing him younger or as old as many of the people he was directing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before George Lucus did Star Wars, this was his big film. One can see why 'Happy Days' was made, after watching this film. 70's flash back TV, just like 'That 70's show' is today. This film and 'Dazed and Confused' go over memorable High school events outside of school. The script, probably, based on real life events; the film's events cut too close to be fiction, maybe a little Jazzed up, but stories passed down over time. The story goes full circle, and ties in how events reflects an individual's character. This is a must see on cable, if you have not seen it 10 times before. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable piece of nostalgia with a great soundtrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is the last night in town before Curt and Steve head off to college and they decide to spend one last night cruising the strip and reminiscing about good times. However while Steve struggles to convince his girlfriend that they should see other people while he is away, Curt starts to have doubts about whether or not he should even go out to college or not. Meanwhile their friends Terry and Milner both have different problems as they cruise around the strip with the different female company they have.Despite being too full of action to accurately portray any night hanging around town, this film is still a nicely nostalgic affair that is slick and enjoyable with a solid soundtrack. The story sees us following several different threads and it is to Lucas' credit that he manages to make them all work, the editing between them never damaging the individual threads by being too early or to late to move in and around the night's events. The stories may not be that deep but they work on the level that this film is operating at; it is nostalgic and slick first and foremost. Lucas' direction helps this and he deals well with having the majority of the scenes played out in and around moving cars.The cast are very much waiting to become stars and it is funny watching it now with hindsight. Dreyfuss is relaxed and personable in his character and his scenes are easy watching. Howard is too much like his Happy Days character to make it easy for him to move away into something else here but he is still OK. Le Mat may have not hit the jackpot in the way everyone else did but he is still effective and has good chemistry with those around him, preventing him just being a hotrod thug. Smith gets good comic mileage out of his character and his scenes were amusing if simply written. Support from Williams, Clark, Phillips and Ford is all good enough and adds to the ensemble feel of the film.Overall a nostalgic and entertaining little movie; no great shakes when it comes to depth of character or plotting but it does the job with a great soundtrack to boot. The action is well controlled and edited between to keep everything moving forward, even if you never get that into any one thread that much. Worth seeing for the warm nostalgia and to remind yourself that George Lucas once made films that weren't video games.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good but not great look back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before taking us all to a galaxy far, far away George Lucas brought us a story that hits much closer to home. American Graffiti is the story of one crucial night in the lives of a group of small-town California teenagers in 1962. It may seem odd that by 1973 one could already make a nostalgia piece about the 1960s. But that is what Lucas has done and it works because as the events in these young people's lives take place the world is very rapidly changing all around them. By 1973 it was easy to look back at the early 1960s as being a much more innocent time, one we very well might wish we could return to.American Graffiti takes its cast of mostly unknowns (most of whom would not remain unknown for long) and gives each character his or her own story to tell. If forced to pick out one character as the lead you'd probably have to go with Ron Howard's Steve, the outgoing class president set to leave for college the next morning. Other key characters include Steve's buddy Curt, as played by Richard Dreyfuss, who is supposed to go to college with Steve but is beginning to have his doubts as to whether he should go. Cindy Williams plays Steve's girlfriend Laurie who is none too happy to be left behind as her boyfriend departs. Charles Martin Smith gives a great performance as hapless Terry The Toad who will have his own adventures with the beautiful Debbie, played by Candy Clark. Harrison Ford has a small but key role as the new guy in town. Mackenzie Phillips does a fine job as Carol, a young girl who would desperately like to hang with the older cool kids such as John Milner, played by Paul Le Mat, who has the fastest car in town. Ah yes, the cars. The cars and the terrific period music are just as much the stars of the movie as any of the actors.Over the period of one night all these characters will be faced with decisions which will in ways, some great and some small, shape their lives. It is very much a movie about coming of age as our characters make the awkward transition into adulthood. Some do it more gracefully than others. Each of their stories is interesting in its own way and all the acting performances are fine. But with the story going in so many different directions at once something gets lost. At times the film struggles to move forward as we're constantly shifting from one character's individual story to another. There are a number of great character studies here and it's fascinating to see these people grow right before our eyes in the span of just one night. However the film probably would have been much crisper and a little more entertaining if the plot was a little more focused. Three or four stories would probably have worked better than seven or eight. Then again all the characters are fascinating in their own way and the acting is so good it would be a shame to have lost any of the performances. Eventually everything comes together and the film is left with what could have been a perfect ending. Unfortunately, it's marred by an unnecessary postscript where we get more information than we need or quite frankly want. Some things are best left to our own imagination. But I guess you make do and appreciate American Graffiti for what it is and not what you might wish for it to have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An atmosphere of the 1960s attitudes and values is set up well in this film, and there are some themes of maturity at hand, but otherwise there is little to compliment, unless one was there and can comment on nostalgic value. For a comedy, it is not very funny, nor amusing, with a few gags but no real jokes. For a drama, it is all a bit too disjointed to cut deep, with many different story-lines all over the place. All in all, the film is merely just a display of different events showing teenage angst and spirit, as opposed to a film that tells a solid story. Dreyfuss is fairly good, and it is satisfactory viewing, but it does not come recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Corny but classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Graffiti is really the sort of film that can be regarded as a classic, without its actually being particularly great. It's entertaining, and it makes you laugh, but it's very corny at times, none of the elements are particularly well done, in fact the only reason it's so famous is that it's a clear sign of the times both in which it was made and in which it is set.The various stories it tells about four friends at life's crossroads in the sixties, and the events that befall them on one particular night, are all really quite good. They're amusing and well-paced (for the stories they're trying to tell). The characters are developed in a fairly shallow way, but developed nonetheless. One gets the impression that they're just fairly shallow characters. I think the definite positive of this film is it doesn't actually have a low point, but at the same time, it doesn't reach any blistering highs either, it's really just a simple, fairly comic narrative. Entertaining, but not brilliant.So overall, despite occasional hammy acting or corny line, American Graffiti is definitely worth a look. A sign of the times though it is, it still gives you a good time and a good feeling all these years later. ***1/2 / *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thirty years later and 'American Graffiti' doesn't look all that good. With hindsight it looks like this movie was in the right place at the right time, with many people wanting some safe, rose coloured glasses nostalgia to offset the bad taste of Vietnam and Watergate. I can understand that, and it's not at all surprising that this movie was so successful at the box office. But that doesn't mean that it was/is a great movie. It's actually pretty average. George Lucas' debut movie, the avant garde SF film 'THX 1138' is still the only movie of his I can find much enthusiasm for. A protege of Francis Ford Coppola, he was at one point slated to direct 'Apocalypse Now'. It's fascinating to speculate just how different his career might have been if that had eventuated. Instead after this bit of fluff he retreated into his overblown multi-million dollar kids movies the 'Star Wars' series. He's one of the most financially successful directors in cinema history, but apart from that, who cares? 'American Graffiti' stars Ron Howard and Cindy Williams went on to TV success with even more watered down versions of this 50s/60s nostalgia. Richard Dreyfuss really lucked out and became a big star, at least for a while, though I could never understand why. The most interesting actors in the film are Candy Clark, Paul Le Mat and Charles Martin Smith, underrated actors who never became household names but went on to do some fine character work. Harrison Ford's bit part seems to excite some people, me I'm much more interested in Peckinpah regular Bo Hopkins, who plays a gang leader who forms an odd relationship with Dreyfuss. 'American Graffiti' is full of some great oldies, and that helps the movie immeasurably, but in the cold light of day, this slight, inoffensive movie is quite forgettable, and I really fail to see what's supposed to be so great about it. Personally I'd much rather watch 'The Wanderers'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1962 in a small town in California four friends - Curt, Toad, John and Steve - celebrate their last night before Curt and Steve are due to leave to go to college. They go cruising, pick up girls, hang out and have various misadventures while trying to work out what to do with their lives.This amazing movie truly captures the spirit of what life was like for young people in America in the early sixties; rock-and-roll radio, chrome-covered tailfin cars with bench seats, sockhops, burger joints, jd gangs, hotrod races, fights and heavy petting. If ever an American movie was a timepiece, this is it; although it was made only ten years after it's set, that world was already long gone in the post-hippy, post-Vietnam early seventies and the exquisite recreation of it is breathtaking. However, there's a problem for me, which is simply that I can't get into it. The teenage angst / leaving home theme is universal I guess, but the world is so specific and so far removed from the world I grew up in (in Europe in the eighties) that I just can't identify with it. This is probably why the movie was a huge hit in the US but not really anywhere else. I need a coupla old time songs to evoke mood in a film but this one has forty-five - the music is a barrage of constant noise, deliberately designed so you can't escape it. The movie was hugely influential on the teenage comedy subgenre, but as with all such movies the characters are a bit thin; Toad and John are too obvious as putz and tough guy respectively, Steve is a wimp who can't think of anything but his girlfriend, and only Curt has any brains. That's not to say the cast are bad because they're all great, particularly Dreyfuss, LeMat and Clark, and one of the film's kicks is to see so many young actors who went on to such distinguished careers. In the end though, despite its incredible look, daring style and great originality, this is a film which I simply can't get into. What's really fascinating about it to me though is the what if question about Star Wars; if it hadn't been such a phenomenon, is this the kind of evocative drama Lucas would have spent his career making ? He grew up in small town California in a place called Modesto, where the movie is ostensibly set, although it was filmed mostly in San Rafael and Petaluma, and there are obvious autobiographical elements to it. Don't miss this film if you are a petrolhead - the 1932 Ford Deuce Coupe, 1958 Chevy Bel Air, 1958 Ford Thunderbird and 1955 Chevy One-Fifty alone are worth the admission, and cult film fans should check the license plate of LeMat's Deuce Coupe. Written by Lucas, Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck, produced by Francis Coppola and followed by a little-known sequel, More American Graffiti (also starring most of the original cast) in 1979.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the baby-boomers were teens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a time when today's baby-boomers were teenagers, and they loved to meet in huge groups some place downtown, to start from there cruising the strip all night long. I graduated from high school in 1963, these guys from American Graffiti were about the same age. If you look now at those years, everything seems antique, and what you feel is amusement and nostalgia. But in those remote years everything seemed cool and the mood was enthusiastic. We loved to dance, and on Saturday nights the dance was in the premises of our high school, in the gym or cafeteria. We were trying to impress the girls, usually we were screwing up. The local DJ was a god, the classmates from our band were the best in town. The rock was king, and life was just beginning. I remember I spent with my classmates a whole night at a restaurant, smoking and dancing, and when we left it was that unique moment of predawn, when darkness has just disappeared and light hasn't come yet. Only a couple of seconds, no more. This movie is exactly about that moment, when innocence of teenage makes room to adulthood. It's only once, never again. And you remember it for all your life. We were so young, and our future was looking so great! Why has everything passed so quickly?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty much Happy Days by George Lucas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I guess I was wrong when I said that the only movie George Lucas made was Star Wars. I know that he has made at least two other movies, this and THX 1138. American Graffiti is about the final day of summer in a small, unnamed American Town. It is unnamed because is probably reflects that this could be any town in America. The opening of the movie looked a lot like Happy Days, though this image quickly disappears as the movie continues. American Graffiti is based about a group of teenagers, two who are preparing to go to college in the morning. Another has been given a car by his best friend to look after while he is in college, and one who cruises the streets to the town looking for people to race. The night life of this town reminds me vaguely of Port Pirie (a town about three hours drive North of Adelaide). Every Friday and Saturday nights the teenagers jump into the car and drive up and down main street, and have earned the name Mainies. The movie is set in the 60's and is supposed to be a retrospect of this era. I don't think it is really, rather it deals with the personalities of the people and their journey to adulthood. Everybody in the movie experiences a change in their character and come out of the night different than when they entered. Steven (Ron Howard) is confident that he will go to college and dumps his long time girlfriend because of it. Unfortunately this backlashes against him as he realises that he cannot simply let go of her. He spends the night chasing her and trying to repair the damage, yet his arrogance always overwhelms him and destroys the relationship even further. The biggest event is when he watches the race where the car she is in goes off of the road and rolls. Steve suddenly realises how delicate life really is and that he simply cannot let go of her that easily. It is because of this that he decides to remain in the town for a year. What I liked about Steve is that it was a complete opposite of Richie Cuningham, the character that Ron Howard is famous for. When I first saw the character I thought that it would be a clone of Richie, but he is not. Richie was a nerd in happy days whereas Steve is the big man around town. People generally didn't respect Richie whereas people respected Steve. Most importantly Steve was an arrogant person demanding his girlfriend's loyalty and respect, while I can not remember Richie Cuningham being arrogant. Then there is the hoon. He begins driving around the town looking to pick up a girl. When he does it lands up that she is very young. She wants excitement, he simply wants her out of the car, yet every time he gets rid of her he suddenly realises that he simply can't let her go. It is not because he is in love with her, but rather he is responsible for her. Thus it goes from looking for a way to dump her to looking for a way to get her home. This guy, who has never shown an ounce of responsibility in his life, is suddenly learning that he has to be responsible. The change in him is much different to that of Steve because it is slower, but we see it by the end of the movie. At the start he is convinced that he is the fastest driver in the valley, but by the end he is beginning to have doubts. Even though he won the race, it is because the other car flipped, not because he was any good. He isn't happy that he won, but rather he is looking for away out. The car flipping hurt him as well because it revealed his irresponsibility to him. Then there was Steve's best friend. He is also going to college, but he is having doubts. He doesn't really want to leave the town. He has roots in the town and he wants to remain, but the pressure is for him to leave. What roots he has are shallow. He does not have a girlfriend and spends much of the movie wondering around by himself looking for a phantom woman. He gets involved in a gang and is accepted by them, but he does not want to tie himself down to them. He wants the lady because she is the most beautiful thing in the world, but he can never find anything out about her. She is a myth. She speaks to him at the end of the film over the telephone, but he cannot tie her down to anything. Instead she represents the truth behind his character. He is as much of a drifter as her, he does not want to tie himself down to anything, but rather have options open. Even though he doesn't really want to go, he tells everybody that he probably is, and thus in the end goes. My problem with the movie was the continuity errors, and there was a big one. The scenes seemed to switch from night to day and thus you were never sure of what time it was. At one time, there was a lot of light in the country and I thought it was dawn, but then it switched back to the town and it was night. I would expect that a director like George Lucas would pick up something like that. Still, the movie ran quite smoothly otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Films Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"American Graffiti" is just a wonderful movie. It is perfectly constructed, the four stories intertwining seamlessly, the acting is marvellously natural and the music brilliantly complements the action.It is a very simple film but extremely touching and true to life. It can be wonderfully funny and is also deeply moving. It is a nostalgic look at teenage life in early 60s Califonia but it's more than that. It's a movie about growing up, moving on and making decisions about the life you want.There are moments in all are lives when we realise the time has come to move on, that some period of our life is now over. We leave school and start University, we leave university and get a job, we realise that a casual romantic relationship has grown serious and each of these occasions means an end to an era of our lives and there is nothing we can do to make this not so. We can decide to change direction but we can't decide to go backwards or to stay still.That is one of the things "American Graffiti" is about. Two of the boys in the film have reached the end of an era of their lives and they must decide what to do next. It is not just the boys though who are coming to the end of an era, it becomes apparent that at the same time the more universal era of innocent Rock-and-Roll and cruising is coming to an end (the film is set in 62) as well.The plot is minimal, not very much happens, but the film has so much depth and so much scope. It is very precise in setting yet the themes are so universal. I can't imagine it ever seeming dated.So, yes, this film is amazing and if you haven't seen it do. Also if you get it on DVD there is a very good making of documentary that comes with the film - it will shock you how difficult it was to get this film made and released.The sequel film "More American Graffiti" is not as good but is fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Teen flick filled with cliques, fun, mischief, hormones, and street cruising it will take many back to the teenage years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"American Graffiti" now considered by many a classic, yet to me is nothing more than a fun teen flick about a group of high school students that tells a coming of age story. It will take many back and remind them of their teen years, as they see things in the film like making out in the backseat, drive ins, cruising the streets and talking to passengers from car windows. Good job by George Lucas to capture a unique take on high school teens during a summer night, really this was just a stepping stone before his big later blockbuster "Star Wars". The music played during this film helps carry it along as it sets the mood and tone so well of the 60's time period. The characters have traits of all typical high schoolers ranging from behavior types of nerds, brains, snobs, and jocks. This was some of the earliest work also for many future stars like Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, Cindy Williams and even Harrison Ford as a street racing cowboy. Also catch and listen to Wolfman Jack as a radio announcer during the film. To sum it up an okay teen flick that will have the viewer remembering their teenage years somewhat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the movie that made him famous, George Lucas portrays several teenagers in Modesto, California, in 1962. Various things happen to them, and they see all sorts of things. Of course, the movie's other stars are the songs that make up the ultra-cool soundtrack. With a total of 45 classic tunes, this movie is a great time from beginning to end. You'll never forget the prank that Curt Henderson (Richard Dreyfuss) has to pull with the police car.Maybe some people might complain that the movie didn't really have much purpose, but that's too harsh; the point was for everyone to have a good time. And boy do we! With the soundtrack, plus great performances by Dreyfuss, Ron Howard (billed as "Ronny" for the last time), Charles Martin Smith, Paul LeMat, Cindy Williams, Candy Clark, Harrison Ford and Wolfman Jack, "American Graffiti" is a wonderful romp even today!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall Lucas does a good job capturing the spirit of the early 60's. I am a big sucker for nostalgia when it comes to movies and Lucas did well.However, the movie which has some great scenes in it, is nothing to scream or be amazed about. It is low on plot, and the things that happen to some of the main characters (when the movie does decide to focus on them) are pretty ordinary. The actors do well but there is nothing special in their performances that make them stand out. Of course people will enjoy this film if they want to pick out all the stars who either made it big (like Harrison Ford) or those who ended up in 70's TV sitcoms.I did enjoy the movie but not immensely..Rating 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people love this film and consider it to be a brilliant classic. At the risk of offending them, I'm going to have to admit I don't find this movie to be particularly brilliant at all. I respect everyone's right to their opinion, but if you're like me, you'll wonder why there's so much buzz about this movie at all.First of all, I'm not sure what is so brilliant about this movie when all it amounts to is watching several characters wander around doing whatever enters into their heads. Nothing really happens, and the many different story lines never really interact. There are so many different things going on that it's hard to follow what's happening, and there's no compelling reason for me to want to care what these characters are doing. It's really just an aimless film without any point. What's so brilliant about that? Personally, I thought it was pretty boring. I wouldn't watch this again, and I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone.On the other hand, you may like this movie if you are nostalgic for the early 1960s, or if you want to catch a glimpse of some young actors early in their careers, or if you'd like to see a 1973 version of a teen drama. It just wasn't all that great to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American GRAFFITIA very early George Lucas film. I had heard about this but never seen it before. It was OK for its time.The movie is about a group of teenagers who have just graduated and it is their last night in town before they go off to college.The movie runs along quite smoothly. There is not a lot happening to be honest. It is about the relationships between these kids with their friends and girlfriends. There are some very nice cars in it, and even some car street races. These were shot very well and were really entertaining. Especially the final crash! There are so many different things going on during this time. The whole film is set during one night which is a nice touch.You have Curt who can't decide if he wants to leave for college as he is having second thoughts. Curt is played by Richard Dreyfuss. Richard did a great job like always. I think Richard is a great actor and should make more movies. He has already made so many classic films. Steve is Curts friend who is going to college with Curt. Curt is happy to be going to college and wants to spend one final night with his girlfriend before he leaves her behind? the problem is, Steve doesn't really know how to talk to her and things do not go as smoothly as he hopes. Steve is played by Ron Howard. Ron was OK, but he is not the best actor. He did make me laugh a few times though which was great. Ron is a much better director than he ever was an actor so I am glad he found his feet behind the camera after Happy Days? although I did love Happy Days when I was a kid.Other cast members were Paul Le Mat, Charles Martin Smith, Cindy Williams, Candy Clark, Mackenzie Phillips, Bo Hopkins and a very young Harrison Ford. The cast was quite good. There was not anyone that was that bad. There were a few moments in the film that I thought the acting wasn't brilliant, but back in 1973 when this film was made, the acting was a completely different class than it is now.The soundtrack to the movie was brilliant. I love the old songs that were played throughout the movie. I think it is possibly the perfect soundtrack to the era of the film. I have always thought the 60s looked awesome. If I could travel through time I would visit the 60s.The action sequences were OK and the story was OK. I have seen similar movies to this and they all pretty much are similar to each other, but I still enjoyed this.I will give this 6 out of 10."Your car is uglier than I am!"For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Graffiti</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen many teen movies, but this classic 70's one is a great film for both stars, writing and directing credits. The most basic plot of this story seems to be that all the key characters are driving around when they could be at a final party before leaving to get on a plane. The actors that play these key characters have become big stars in their own rights, and they deserve it after their great youthful performances. These include Curt Henderson (Jaws' Richard Dreyfuss, nominated for Golden Globe) who is searching for a particular girl while hanging out with what seem to be thugs, Steve Bolander (A Beautiful Mind director Ron Howard) is trying to patch things up with his girlfriend, John Milner (Golden Globe winning Paul Le Mat) is having to look after a 16 year old and she can get annoying, and Terry 'The Toad' Fields (The Untouchables' Charles Martin Smith) seems to have finally found someone that likes him. Also in a couple of scenes is the man that the film's Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director George Lucas would eventually cast as Han Solo and Indiana Jones, Harrison Ford as Bob Falfa. Some great moments of comedy and some sentiment, my favourite character was probably Terry. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Supporting Actress for Candy Clark as Debbie Dunham, Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Story and Screenplay Based on Factual Material or Material Not Previously Published or Produced and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Supporting Actress for Cindy Williams as Laurie Henderson, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy. It was number 43 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, and it was number 77 on 100 Years, 100 Movies. Very, very good!</fullReview>

Director George Lucas has made a special Kennedy era film with actor Harrison Ford. I was asked by American Shadow President Jack Kennedys artificial intelligence to contact Ted Kennedys artificial Intelligence and this is what I heard from Moon 165 honest.

It depends on your opinion of Lucas, his writing, and his cast.The cast is mixed, the men mostly overreact. I found Ron Howard to be the worst in the bunch, perhaps it's from this Lucas influence that Howard's been making empty junk since this. Perhaps Dreyfuss matured the most.Verna Fields' editing great; I have never been disappointed in it. It's obvious why Spielberg relied on her for JAWS. Just watch this for her contribution alone.After Star Wars' silly excess of fantasy and poor pacing, Lucas has had his head stuck in a Samurai-influenced fantasy land. He still does.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material</fullReview>

Good look at several actors on their way to stardom. Ironically, the memorable performance are by Le Mat in a pre-Fonzie Fonzie role and Clark as the smart/dumb blonde, neither of whom made it big. The short Wolfman Jack segment is also inspired. On the whole, though, suffers from later Lucas maladies - too full of itself and too overdone. And it really hasn't aged so gracefully, but in fairness that's partly because of all of its cheap imitators. At one time I would have given it an 8 or 9, now I just throw it a 7 and deem it not frequently rewatchable.</fullReview>

Within an almost two hour-long torture in which the characters are as flat as they could possible be, Lucas show us how mediocre film maker he is by not displaying any knowledge about cinematographic language at all, a still camera, boring shots and a soporific story that should have ended before the first 10 minutes.

		<shortDescription>Great Music Cannot Save Mediocre Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is SOME good chemistry to American Graffiti, and that is its awesome 60's soundtrack. It makes the viewer really experience the drive-in's, malt shops, cruising the streets, and looking for romance in the time period. Great stars like Harrison Ford, Ron Howard, and Charles Martin Smith round out the cast in a "before they were stars" ensemble that make the movie worth seeing.....once.See American Graffiti for the music and the cinematography that really captures the essence of teens growing up in the 60's. However, the movie has a huge problem. In trying to follow all of the little plots and subplots about the characters, the viewer does not draw a sense of emotional attachment to them. The script is ambiguous as if the producers said, "Let's do some research on what teens did on those 1960's summer nights, take a group of five or so unknown actors (at the time) and put cameras on them forcing them to act and react to the time period around them. The music tries so very, very, hard to make this film a nostalgic classic. However, the problem is that these main characters don't have anything special to say or do. Their lives are almost too ordinary, reflected around a time of social, economic, political change, and turmoil.There are several opportunities for the film to take on more serious tones. But the quality actors are forced into soap-opera type situations of romance, drinking, and cruising. The talents of these actors was not necessary for this movie because the story is so basic, "Teens cruise California post-high school graduation looking for fun, sex, and booze before leaving for college." That's American Graffiti in a nutshell. The pacing is S-L-O-W. However, a surprising (shocking) ending to some will make viewers think. Unfortunately, it appears that this moment was tacked onto the film for emotional impact. The problem is it comes too late in the film to care. The soundtrack is the best part of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Time of Innocence and Boredom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As another reviewer put it, American Graffiti is "a retrospect of the good times that people had when everything was innocent". And that summarizes my problem with this film - I dispute this commonly accepted vision of that time period.I recognize that American Graffiti was considered ground-breaking, and that it is very clearly captures the view that America in 1962 was, metaphorically, a teenager on the verge of growing up and losing its innocence, just like the kids in the movie (which introduced many talented young actors). In the 11 short years from 1962 to 1973, when the film was made, America had changed in ways that are hard to even comprehend.Lucas utilized dozens of pop songs from the period of 1955-1962 to evoke that by-gone era, vividly capturing how much the culture had changed. The old-time rock 'n roll style had essentially vanished by 1973, after The Beatles, the British invasion in general, psychedelic rock, heavy metal and other diverse musical styles came on the scene. By comparison, if a movie was made now (2008) and tried to evoke a time period 11 years ago, would 1990's music (Nirvana, Green Day, Backstreet Boys) sound so starkly different from today's music that it would sonically conjure up an entirely different Epoch? I don't think so.Thus, the use of 50's pop music aptly serves to illustrate the point. However, Lucas also beats us over the head with this music. Everywhere in this film, a car radio is on in the background, reminding us (over and over and over and over) about the "good times, great oldies" of the 50's. Since I don't particularly love this music, the incessant nature of it drove me nuts.But my biggest complaint with this film is the myth that America in 1962 was a time of innocence which was destroyed by the Kennedy assassination, Vietnam, and the emergence of the hippie counterculture. I think this Boomer-generation myth only tells THEIR part of the American story. Sure, the 1950's may have been an idyllic time of innocence for white suburban kids driving around in their big gas-guzzling Chevrolets. But what was it like for Blacks suffering from Jim Crow, gays and lesbians who were forced to hide in the closet, non-conformists of any kind, political victims of McCarthyism, etc. Was it "Happy Days" for these people? When I listen to 1950's music, I think about how pop and rock music improved so dramatically in the mid-to-late 1960's (thank you, John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, Mick Jagger, James Brown), and, similarly, I think America itself improved during those tumultuous years.Therefore, while I acknowledge that Lucas captures his PERSONAL vision of this by-gone era very well, I don't accept the Boomer myth that this was an innocent time, or the so-called "good old days". Rather, 1962 seems dull, insular, small-minded, stifling in its conformity, and all-around LAME. Likewise, American Graffiti is quite boring.Although if listless boredom is the point of it, then it was extremely well-done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess I'm also not a real George Lucas fan. Never cared for Star Wars. And I don't care for this movie as well. American Graffiti seems to appeal to nostalgic baby boomers who grew up during the 50s and 60s. Biggest problem is that the movie has no real plot. It just seems to drag to no end. There are several groups of stories, with little relation to each other. Graffiti generally centers around familiar teenage scenes with high school aged buddies cruising around town picking up girls on a Friday or Saturday night.Although Richard Dreyfuss probably gave the most credible job, it still doesn't compare to Jaws, which I think is the best performance given by anyone I've seen. Paul Le Mat did a fine job as well. I liked his interaction with drivers of other cars while cruising around. However the rest of the cast is pretty annoying (particularly Mackenzie Phillips) with rather hammy performances and mediocre dialogs. The cinematography was generally pretty decent, though there were some "night" scenes obviously shot with blue filters. If you like early 60s nostalgia, flashy cars, and high school punks, this movie may be for you. Otherwise take a pass. If you like movies with a teenage setting, I suggest you check out The Heathers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why it took me so many years to see this supposedly classic movie. But now that I finally have, I can't see why it was regarded so highly. Perhaps the nostalgia factor had meaning back in the 1970s, though Kennedy was president and the setting was little more than 10 years earlier.I loved the cars, and some of the music was good, though a lot of music was louder than what I care to listen to. Wolfman Jack was wonderful as a radio DJ. The best part of the movie was watching a nerdy kid try to impress a girl with a fancy 1958 Impala that wasn't his, but Ron Howard's. And Mackenzie Phillips showed promise as a bratty kid. But this movie was little more than a good time, not anything groundbreaking that appeared (to me, at least) to be starting a nostalgia movement. And it certainly wasn't squeaky-clean like 'Happy Days'. References to sex and bad language were both frequent.SPOILER: My one favorite scene came close to the end when one of the teen characters visited the radio station and found out that Wolfman Jack was actually on tape and there was no one there but a guy who had impressed the Wolfman but didn't have that talent. Or did he? That guy looked a lot like Wolfman. The actor playing him had talent. In fact, we see as the teen leaves, he was in fact Wolfman, speaking into the mike.</fullReview>

It seems that George 'Warwick "Willow" 'Wicket' Davis' Lucas liked to drive cars, avoid school, listen to rock in roll Muzak and get into various scrapes with girlies. Of course George 'Never see me and Spielberg in the same place' Lucas's favourite past time was defacing local establishments with graffiti. George 'Short Round' Lucas and his gang would scrawl such witticisms as 'Nerds suck!', 'Berry Rulez OK!', and 'I have visited Lola's pants' all over buildings and walls. Theu would ruthlessly organise 'hits' on certain places: homes of teachers and enemies, toilet walls (sometimes not with paint), and alleyways. 'The Fonze Is My Daddy', 'School is 4 fools', 'LOLZ! I fragged sum Noob's Ass on Halo 20 timez ROFL!' and 'George "we cannot agree to this Treaty, Senator" Lucas Waz ere!' also make appearances. It's all very funny and perplexing.George 'Strike Me Down' Lucas directs his first feature feelim here and gathers together a cast of unknowns who would go on to remain unknowns, with the possible exception of Harry 'Son' Ford. It was quite a success for George 'Akbar' Lucas, earning him a lovely first pile of money and an Academy Award nomination. The film has an authentic 50s feels as all the characters have funny names like Curt, Chad, 'Steve' and Flapiddy Sshlap. The cars and clothes and musics and hair cuts are all fairly accurate proving that Gunga Lucas was about in those days and observed everything from his mother's basement. We watch the lives of these characters over a few years, some race cars, some race tractors, some die, some go on to have successful careers. Of course the most successful career prize would go to George 'I killed them all, even the children!' Lucas. With the money he made from this he made, after a brief 3 year holiday to Jamaica, the greatest film trilogy of all time- Star Warp! Best Scene: When two main characters are having a game of Turkey in their cars, and the bad guy spins out and crashes. The hero, based on George 'ooh my, R2!' Lucas, leaps over the front of his car and punches out the bad guy. A blue flash takes over the screen and he is suddenly transported to another place, in the arms of a naked lady who kisses him. Just as he wonders what is going on a burly man bursts into the room with a shotgun- 'Daddy!?' she cries. 'Oh boy!' replies our hero. George 'no to Jabba Wanka' Lucas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Graffiti (1973 Universal) Showed Boom Time 50's As The 70's Bust Began</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Graffiti (1973 Universal) is a nostalgia movie about the 1950's done "on the cheap" with mediocre actor performances and mediocre writing, but held together with the glue of "Top Of The Pops Chart" songs from the middle 1950's and a motif of "cruising 50's cars of fame" (Edsels, Mid-50's Chevys, big Cadillacs, Corvettes, even a Studebaker with an engine hood shaped like a bullet).George Lucas directed and wrote the screenplay, and also introduced later superstar Harrison Ford in the role of "Bob Falfa," a one dimensional stud type Harrison Ford continued to play for the next 40 years with great commercial (but no artistic) success. Bruce Willis and later Calif. Governor Arnold Schwartzenegger both did the same, as the 1973 Calif. Governor Ronald Reagan had also during his movie star years....one dimensional crowd pleaser stud types.Nostalgia part of the movie includes gas stations manned by service attendants who actually pumped gas for customers not required to leave their cars, and fast food hamburger stands where service staff visited cars with trays of tasty, individually prepared food at low prices. Pretty girl waitresses wearing sexy short skirts and roller skates.American Graffiti (1973) was set in a small city in central California, not quite rural, but not LA or San Francisco and/or environs, either. People in the movie were "rubes" and painfully naive, and supposed to be likable for those reasons.We see four teen ager couples each depicted in alternating sequences, two well acted and interesting (well written script work), two badly acted and boring (bad script work).Actors Paul LeMat and MacKensie Phillips steal the movie with a portrayal of a 12 year old "underaged" (sort of) girl and a perpetual teen ager type early twenties boy long ago dropped out of high school who meet and spend several hours "cruising" around the downtown area of the California small city where the movie takes place. These two are innocent and impudent and the best actors in the movie. Writing for their sequences is also the best in the movie.The young girl is played by MacKensie Phillips who went on to become a famous television star (her father was John Phillips of The Mamas And The Papas 1960's singing group).The James Dean type boy is played by Paul LeMat, who sadly did not become a big movie star after this movie and his great performance. Too bad for movie audiences because he had star quality and a character wonderful to behold.The John Milner character in American Graffiti (1973 Universal) was as good as the Rick Blaine "Bogie" character in Casablanca (1943 Warner Brothers) starring Humphrey Bogart. The Milner character was a noble, but alienated man, interesting, intelligent, and fiercely independent.LeMat's "John Milner" character could have become as famous as Humphrey Bogart's "Bogie" character had it been recognized and managed well ....but that didn't happen.Instead, we got More American Graffiti (1979) as a very bad follow up movie, and LeMat's character was never heard from again..American Graffiti (1973 Universal) is OK in many ways.....not wonderful, but a fun mediocre movie showing off fun mediocre aspects of mass USA culture of past times.It's for people like me who were kids when Elvis and James Dean were young....now we're all eligible for Social Security pensions.------------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

		<shortDescription>Not much happens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 'American Graffiti', not much seems to happen. Just people drive around in cars, talking, talking about relationships, but it does have a few amusing moments, including a nerd trying to impress a girl and get some liquor, and Richard Dreyfuss and a police car, but overall, a boring film where not much happens. I am a 13 year old, so you may think I am too young to comprehend the film, but my father agrees with me on the the fact that it is a bit boring and not much happens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classically Crappy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't care what anyone else says, nor who says it; this film is total crap. It tracks four separate stories, all of which have nothing to do with one another, all the while a ceaselessly loud soundtrack blares throughout the entire movie. There is no story, no strong message, no significant plot whatsoever. I was thoroughly bored out of my mind. American Graffiti aims at a very narrow audience: Teenagers who love cars, 50's rock music, and girls. For the rest of the world that's NOT like Geroge Lucas, the film holds no particular appeal. I simply don't get why it's being hailed as a classic. Because it was the first film to document completely irrelevant stories and use music from original records? WOW. Big deal. So if I shoot an entire film in a purple tint, will I be hailed a genius too? Just because it's different doesn't mean it's good. Just because you can make a film about four irrelevant stories doesn't mean you should. American Graffiti is the epitome of George's student films made at USC (which I have also seen). Weird, pointless, and "artsy." Luckily someone on his Star Wars production team thought of making the Jedi's sword glow and someone else advised him against using the "Kyber Crystal" as the central power in the world and said he should use a mysterious "force" instead. Otherwise, what would Star Wars have been? Probably what American Graffiti is: crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was way 2 dark 2 win may sympathy. Sometimes, no, most of the time I couldn't see what the hell was goin' on. Maybe some actors got sick during the shoot and George Lucas decided to film the scenes with people who looked liked them...when all the lights were out. Sometimes I got the feeling I was 'watching' a radio-show. Not in the last place due to the soundtrack that never stops. I like George Lucas, I love Star Wars, but this movie just didn't do it for me. Dazed and Confused deals much better with the subject. Mind you, I'm not American, so it might be that much of the Americana and nostalgia only appeals to Americans. Maybe not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Then, Even Worse Now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know a lot of people loved this movie, right from the start when they first saw it in the early 1970s at the theaters. I hated it then, and I hated it 25 years later when I gave it another chance on VHS. It was even worse now because you added "dated" to this list of negative adjectives describing this movie. Stories about teenage jerks are not what I call entertaining. The only thing worse than the usual "coming of age" movie is one that involves the kids of the 1960s, the worst decade in American history.Ron Howard and Cindy Williams played pretty decent kids but nerd-looking Charles Martin Smith and friend Paul LeMat were super annoying. I didn't appreciate the language in here, either. I didn't expect The Mickey Mouse Club or Opie from Mayberry, but six usages of the Lord's name in vain in the first half hour along with a bunch of other profanities didn't turn me on to this "comedy." I also didn't get any laughs, either. Was this supposed to be a comedy? I hope not. Nothing much happens anyway, just the life of these dorks who drive around all night trying to impress bimbos. Wow, this is "deep.".The only enjoyment I got out of this film was listening to the voice of "Wolfman Jack," the legendary rock deejay.</fullReview>
