		<shortDescription>Mumbles And Mumbles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well it was certainly very artistic and certain parts were just gorgeous. However there is not much more to recommend Macbeth. The worst part to me was how the dialogue was spoken, or not spoken since it was mostly whispers and mumbles. Just mumbles and mumbles. Shakespeare's prose just begs to be enjoyed but here I couldn't understand what they were saying half the time.Also they seemed to have no idea what to do with the talking parts and just tried to invent weird action scenes to go with them that felt out of place. Too theatrical is how I would describe this film. It tries to be realistic and set in historical times, but it just makes the theatrical stick out more in awkward ways.Performance wise there is nothing to complain about as everyone did a great job. Overall there are sparks of brilliance here but I just get the feeling that the makers gave up before reaching the goal and the final product is hence mediocre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Stunning And Savage Epic Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantastic adaptation of Shakespeare's iconic tragedy, Justin Kurzel's drama is a stunning and well-crafted epic, featuring some unforgettable performances from Marion Cotillard, Paddy Considine, Sean Harris and of course, Michael Fassbender in the role of the savage tyrant, Macbeth. Joining the other great Shakespearean masters such as Olivier and Branagh, Kurzel has created a brutal and ambitious depiction, caught by the awe-inspiring cinematography of Adam Arkapaw. Featuring glorious locations across the bleak and wintery Highlands of Scotland, 'Macbeth' is a film adaptation that even the great playwright himself would be proud of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marion Cotillard and Michael Fassbender excel in Justin Kurzel's thrillingly savage interpretation of the Scottish Play.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the shortest, sharpest and most stormily violent of William Shakespeare's tragedies, "Macbeth" may be the most readily cinematic: The swirling mists of the Highlands, tough to fabricate in a theater, practically rise off the printed page. So it's odd that, while "Romeo and Juliet" and "Hamlet" get dusted off at least once a generation by filmmakers, the Scottish Play hasn't enjoyed significant bigscreen treatment since Roman Polanski's admirable if tortured 1971 version. The wait for another may be even longer after Justin Kurzel's scarcely improvable new adaptation: Fearsomely visceral and impeccably performed, it's a brisk, bracing update, even as it remains exquisitely in period. Though the Bard's words are handled with care by an ideal ensemble, fronted by Michael Fassbender and a boldly cast Marion Cotillard, it's the Australian helmer's fervid sensory storytelling that makes this a Shakespeare pic for the ages ? albeit one surely too savage for the classroom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>peaceful candles on violent faces - rough vision of emotions deep - motion matched the poetry - of wondering thoughts to keep.a master piece combining theatre - excellent acting and visual art - authenticity in dress and location - even Shakespeare would take heart.Michael Fassbender made Macbeth, raw yet vulnerable which solved an issue I always had with this character. How can a strong war lord completely losing it? He portrayed Macbeth in a such a way that made me feel, that he truly (twistingly) believed it was also for survival and not just for simple ambition. He solved it for me.At the same time, I always thought of Lady Macbeth as a conniving, over-ambitious gold-digger. She still was yet at the same time I saw a strong person who helped surviving despite her pain and loss. Marion Cotillard's acting was so pure and emotionally complex, awesome.A Scottish friend who loves his country's history, was pleasantly surprised regarding the relative authenticity of highlander living and praised the costumes: no tartan, but Roman type with leather/metal battle uniforms which would be likely correct considering that Macbeth lived in the 11th century.The music was powerful, supporting the Shakespearian lines, subtly giving them more impact. @Sales: subtitles would be useful even for people whose first language is English ... although it would reduce the magnitude of this visual spectacle. This films was everything I was hoping for when seeing the trailer. It was a piece of art with moving pictures and words. Even if you don't like Shakespeare, it's an amazing film. A very high 9 score !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted so much to love this movie! A stellar cast, wonderful source material, what could go wrong. What went right was the visuals; the film looks great. Locations, costumes, cinematography, all are just splendid. But all that is spoiled because most of the time you can't understand what the actors are saying! Other critics commented on this issue but I went anyway, hoping they were wrong. They weren't. And there is simply no excuse. I've seen all these actors in other roles and they know how to enunciate quite well, so what went wrong? It's Shakespeare, people! The words matter! Now, I don't know if this was sloppy sound editing or deliberate obfuscation, but the result was that a movie that worked magnificently on every other level was totally spoiled, a disappointment to viewers and I'm sure an embarrassment to the cast and, I hope, the filmmakers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping, Intense, Beautifully shot, with Unforgettable Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HAIL MACBETH, HAIL MACBETH, HAIL MACBETH.WOW, that was a gripping, intense, beautifully shot film with unforgettable performances and has to be the best retellings of not only 'Macbeth' but all of Shakespeare's plays on screen. This movie did an incredibly amazing job at sticking to the source material whilst also incorporating a visually stunning cinematic style. It has a very interesting cinematic style using slow motion effects and sped up film in order to capture the emotions that the characters are feeling at every moment. I was in awe at how beautiful this film was, the wide shots of the landscapes were incredible whether there was something going on or nothing at all. And i don't know where the cgi in this film was if there was much at all because it all looks so incredibly real and grand and it only adds to the scope of the film. The movie's amazing cinematography is accompanied by many amazing performances including two of the best performances this year. Sean Harris and David Thewlis were standouts in their supporting roles as Macduff and Duncan and really displayed some of their best performances but the show was stolen by the two leads. Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard as Macbeth and Lady Macbeth were absolutely mind- blowing and amazing and encapsulated these characters as perfectly as you could get. They did incredible jobs at playing these extremely complex personalities and led me to see only Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, forgetting their previous roles. They pull of their monologues so well that you are fully engaged in what they are saying and can see that what they are feeling is not only expressed through what they are saying but just from the expressions on their faces. And Lady Macbeth's most iconic scene/monologue was represented so perfectly that it was one of the best and most gripping scenes in the film. The Oscar race is heating up and Fassbender and Cotillard have to be the front-runners for Best Actor and Actress, truly amazing. Having read the play a little while ago i was able to still recall many of the key events and know mostly what was coming up next. So hearing plenty of familiar lines from the play and seeing these scenes was incredibly rewarding. And reading the play i feel helped to follow along with what is happening at all times. But for someone unfamiliar with the story of Macbeth i think it might be a little hard to follow at times. This is definitely not a film where you can look away for even a minute and still know what is going on. If you miss a few lines of dialogue or zone out during a scene, when you zone back into the film you will probably be lost. The Shakespearean dialogue is probably going to be a barrier for people to understand and if you can't understand that dialogue you really won't like this film. But as i was saying i felt that if i hadn't read the play i would have been quite lost during the film. If you aren't paying careful attention and reading into even the most subtle of hints some scenes will seem random and you'll have no idea what is going on. So i think this is definitely not for general audiences who just want to relax and check out a film, it requires a fair amount of attention. So in the end, it is beautifully shot, intense, extremely well acted and a great adaptation of this incredible play. Maybe not for the general audience but any fans of the source material or lovers of film should love this movie. - 8.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complete and utter disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. What a complete and utter disappointment. From the moment that I saw the rumours and the pictures popping up around the web that Michael Fassbender was to play Macbeth, one of the most brilliantly written characters of all time, I was all over the place of excitement. The imagery looked stunning and anything that Fassbender touches becomes gold. To follow it up with a brilliantly cast Paddy Considine as Banquo and, in my opinion a little too young, Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth I thought we were set for success.The opening is harrowing, beautiful and brilliant and it really sucks you in to their world. From the first moment costumes, props and carpentry look great, cinematography beyond beautiful and it really sets the mood. For nothing.What follows is a drawn out, slow-paced, pretentious interpretation of the text that loses it's insanity and rhythm completely. Now I'm all for revisioning and reimagining, and there's a LOT of room for that in the play Macbeth, so I was excited, but utterly disappointed.It's an orgy of meaningless violence in slow motion, topped off with so many close ups of blood and vomit that doesn't serve a purpose, sprinkled with, what I can only imagine being a directors "vision" with complete disregard of his actors talents.The "redeeming part" is it's beautiful imagery, but everything else pushes this movie down to the very bottom of my list. To cite Macbeth himself, "It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a muddled effort that fundamentally misunderstands the play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not sure what I just watched. Every scene was cold and lifeless. Lady Macbeth could not decide if she were Scottish or English.... mostly she was just shell shocked and incapable of any emotion, particularly the passion she should have for her husband. Macbeth's castle, where he is supposed to defend the king, is worse than a poor Mongol's circle of yurts. Any wandering cow could have passed the tent entrance and gored the king to death.The most important scenes are turned on their heads for no apparent reason and to the great diminishment of the work. The dagger doesn't float. It is carried by a ghost over to the king's bed. The King's ghost skips the feast perhaps the most important scene in the play - clearly spelled out by the bard. No ghost occupies Macbeth's chair. The director favors having a less important ghost at a side table, thereby removing the force of King Duncan's presence and the cause of Macbeth's madness. The most intriguing prophesy in all of Shakespeare - Birnam wood moving to Dunsinane- - it goes up in smoke, literally. The forest doesn't move, so there is no reason for Macbeth to fear failure, yet he falls anyway, which makes it a pointless and inaccurate prophecy. So why not cut it out? In the end Macbeth is replaced (as king) by a child killer. Good does not prevail. The new king takes up a sword and goes chasing a child across the moors, despite the fact that Shakespeare goes to great lengths to establish Prince Malcolm as an honest and mild virgin. The film is beautiful, in many respects, but it is a scandal to say it is Shakespeare's play - or that it is good.Roman Polanski did a version that was true to the play. This version felt like Peter Jackson took over and tried to make it more-better.We are not amused.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was done, was done well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The world of William Shakespeare can be a tricky road to navigate, especially if you are not educated in his tediously difficult language that arrogantly lies in waiting, sprawled across the pages of his many plays. If you are neither a Thespian or English Literature Graduate (which I am clearly not), you will struggle to understand the famous playwrights narrative. It just might be easier to learn French or German at the local community college than it is to painfully study what Shakespeare is actually trying to say. I have seen just a handful of the Elizabethan era writers work; the tragic love story of Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar and the very puzzling comedy, A Midsummer Night's Dream. Each time I came away scratching my head, my feeble brain trying its best to piece together the events that had actually taken place. Through all the confusion, I still found myself enjoying the fragments of dialogue and story that made sense to me. This is why I was drawn to another of Shakespeare's great tragedies, even though I knew I would be sitting through nearly two hours of theatre without the use of subtitles.Macbeth is a well known story of ambition, murder, rage and tyranny but what I was looking for in Justin Kurzel's interpretation was a connection that an uneducated sloth like myself could get from a tale that had four hundred years of retelling. I wanted to feel the characters emotions and I wanted to visualise their world. I wanted to be able to identify Macbeth's tragic blind ambition and lust for power. More importantly, I wanted a tangible belief in the story being presented to me.Kurzel knows his audience well because he has directed one of the greatest Shakespearean plays ever put onto film. The brutal and bloody world that Kurzel has visioned, creates an authentic and powerful atmosphere that never deserts the viewer, allowing the famous story to illustrate itself effortlessly across the screen. Half the battle is won. Accompanied by an outstandingly appropriate score sets the scene for a film that would not look out of place amongst the very best movie releases this year. The eerie and sombre acoustics help keep the audience fixed to their seats as the savage tragedy of Macbeth unfolds in all its brutal glory.Michael Fassbender (Macbeth), plays the character to perfection and it is his performance alone that makes it easier for the common man to understand Shakespeare's historic language. Fassbender is thoroughly engaged in his role and every word he delivers oozes emotion. Marion Cotillard is equally impressive as the conniving Lady Macbeth. Cotillard was an interesting choice to play the femme fatal, but she has proved here that she can rise to any challenge. This performance is a very colourful feather in a exceptional cap. Her Lady Macbeth helped me to realise that she became somewhat of a victim to the King she had created. "What is done, is done." I am quite sure that she didn't envisage her warrior husband to become the tyrant that he became. Adding to the list of superb performances is Sean Harris, the vengeful and savage Macduff, who is hell bent on ending Macbeth's reign as the Scottish Monarch. Great little cameos by David Thewlis (King Duncan) and Elisabeth Debicki (Lady Macduff), along with brilliant visionary direction by Justin Kurzel will give the uneducated hordes a chance to witness one of Shakespeare's masterpieces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was lucky to see this in a cinema where no one spoke during the entire duration of the film (a rarity I find nowadays) - it may be because people were holding their breath in anticipation of what was to come next. Wow. Had me transfixed the entire way through. Those familiar lines no less haunting for the multiple times my eyes have seen them and my ears heard them. Some clever interpretation of the original text including additions that were only spoken of in the original play script. Some purists might not like these additions and interpretations but I found them equitable to the original. Fassbender was amazing. Understated where needed, alternately a powerhouse. I can and will watch again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely" (Lord Acton), in Shakespeare's Scottish play of assassination, set in scenes of blood and mud.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Elizabethan play-write William Shakespeare staged plays of great historical events. Necessarily limited by the stage-setting, these were the masterpieces of carefully crafted words and speeches that we now consider as Shakespearian English. Thus this reviewer considered the film version of Shakespeare's Scottish play as perhaps being too wordy and stagey to go and see. However, I was beguiled by the trailer, that seemed to suggest lots of action and battles. Alas, this was not to be. However, this dull, but worthy product, is a fine showcase for Shakespeare, Scotland, and the performing thespians of the film.This Scottish-themed film does open up on the battlefield. There are some interesting scenes as the warriors prepare for battle and the battle itself is shown well. (A later battle also has some interesting two-sworded battle scenes). During the battle, witches appear, and make a prophecy about the King of Scotland. The film tells the story of an attempt to fulfil the prophecy and of the aftermath of that attempt.The male lead is played by Michael Fassbender and the female lead playing opposite him is Marion Cottilard. They are superb in their roles and must have actually suffered hard for their craft. Location shooting for the film was in the Isle of Skye in Scotland. This reviewer has paddled in water there, and can assure readers that even in the height of summer, it is like putting your feet into buckets of ice. Yet, we have Mr Fassbender in water in a scene, and Miss Cottilard, far from her native France, is seen scampering about barefoot and lightly dressed. Bravo! it should be said that there is little sight of the summer in this story. There are many, many, scenes of bleak mountains and bogs and moorland. The climate is cold and wet, with swirling fogs often covering the rough terrain. The scenes are in fact very bleak and compare with those in the Viking film 'Valhalla Rising' (2009).Elizabeth Debicki, who also appeared in this year of 2015 in 'Everest', here does a standout scene, as relevant to us now as it was in the era it was set in. Sean Harris, who like Michael Fassbender, also appeared in Prometheus (2012), here delivers a brilliant and powerful performance. There is a scene in the 1995 Scottish film 'Braveheart' where William Wallace is floored in shock when he encounters the English champion. Here, in this film, Sean Harris, similarly has his emotions plunged to the depths, more than once. His acting is superb throughout the film.David Thewlis seems to have an ability to really inhabit his roles. The source material, (book), for the film 'Seven Years in Tibet' (1997) seems to show he got the part just right. So too, for his OTT role in the 2010 film 'Mr Nice' which again matched the source material in the book of the same name. In this year of 2015 though, his performances have seemed more subdued but still true to the source material. I found his portrayal in 'Legend' to be fascinating. Here, in this film, he takes a part and makes it very believable. The part he plays is very like one today and he seems to play it like that too. There are some obvious differences too in that role of course, but that is the essence of the plot of this Scottish film. We also get good supporting roles from Paddy Considine, David Hayman and Jack Reynor.Much of the location shooting is on the Isle of Skye in Scotland, though I did spot Bamburgh Castle too. Ely Cathedral is also featured. The cathedral scenes are spectacular as are the castle interiors, however the bulk of the film is shot in realistically grim surroundings. Our thespians spend most of their time wallowing in blood and mud, and the climate and terrain are both as gloomy and grim as the storyline. The use of hand-held cameras does detract though. As do some of the special-effects that take us out of the moment.This film is a good introduction to Shakespeare and his Scottish play. Political students can learn lessons from this story today, just as they can from 'I Claudius'. For those interested in the subjects of assassination, conspiracy, politics and statecraft, then the writings of the Renaissance Florentine statesman and writer Niccolo Machiavelli may also be of interest.This film of the Scottish play serves as a good way to engage a modern audience and as such has been a worthwhile project. 9/10.</fullReview>

Cotillard too, she was just so good, she made Lady M very believable, so manipulative.Great performances from the supporting cast too, Sean Harris in particular, that guy has got something.The locations were superb, beautiful and hugely dramatic, so fitting to the big production.The music was excellent, I loved it, I'm not sure if it was the Cinema's issue, but on a few occasions the dialogue seemed muffled, and was difficult to make out.Excellent, 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to Make a Bad Film out of a Great Play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shakespeare's "The Tragedy of Macbeth" should be a superbly cinematic play. It is relatively short by Shakespearean standards, has a straightforward and gripping plot, contains some of Shakespeare's greatest dialogue, includes a strong supernatural element which should stimulate any director's visual imagination and provides two magnificent roles, one male and one female. And yet there has never been any really compelling film version to compare with, say, Olivier's "Henry V", the James Mason/Marlon Brando "Julius Caesar", Zeffirelli's "Romeo and Juliet" or Branagh's "Much Ado about Nothing" or "Hamlet". Most of the numerous feature films based on the play were made during the silent era; about the only previous sound versions I can think of were Orson Welles' from 1948 and Roman Polanski's from 1971. Olivier had plans to make a filmed "Macbeth", but these came to nothing.Justin Kurzel is the latest director to have a go at the "Scottish Play". His main ambition seems to have been to root his film in historical reality, although pedantic historical realism is, I always feel, not necessary in Shakespeare. It was certainly not something Shakespeare aimed at himself. The real Macbeth, King of Scotland between 1040 and 1057, would have been an obscure figure in one of the most obscure periods in British history were it not for Shakespeare's play. We do not know a great deal about him, but we know enough to realise that the play is far from historically accurate. It contains a number of anachronisms; at one point King Duncan refers to cannons, which would not be invented for at least another two centuries. Macbeth is the owner of a castle, although castles as we understand the term would not be introduced to Britain until after the Norman Conquest.Kurzel seems to have been trying to recreate the eleventh century; for example Macbeth's home is not a stone-built castle but a mere wooden stockade surrounding a few modest buildings. Any impression of architectural realism, however, is undermined when in later scenes the action takes place against a backdrop of Romanesque (about a hundred years after Macbeth's period) or late Gothic (around four hundred years too late) architecture. He also seems to have interpreted the words "Dark Ages" absolutely literally as for most of the time the action is taking place against an atmosphere of Stygian gloom, either at night or (as the three witches would have put it) through "fog and filthy air".Now it is certainly true that "Macbeth" is a play in which many key scenes do indeed take place at night or in foul weather and in which images of night, darkness, gloom and tempest are used to describe or emphasise the "dark" deeds which make up the plot. It is not, however, simply a play about darkness. It is a play about contrasts- light versus dark, good versus evil, the just exercise of power versus the unjust abuse of it. It is also a play about kingship, and in the Middle Ages kings were figures of great power and authority, who would have expressed that power though outward displays of great splendour. It is no accident that Shakespeare often uses the word "robe" as a synonym for authority; Macbeth has not only usurped Duncan's throne but has (metaphorically at least) stolen his clothes.It therefore seemed to me that the unrelieved gloom which pervades the film, and the use of such dull, uninteresting costumes, represented failure of visual imagination and a distortion of the themes of the play. There was no attempt to differentiate the good characters from the evil ones, no recognition of the fact that different scenes within the play have differing atmospheres and no visual imagery to suggest that the throne of Scotland was something worth fighting for.The acting was no better than the direction, with the possible exception of Marion Cotillard who did enough to suggest that she might have made a decent Lady Macbeth in a better production than this one. Michael Fassbender in the title role, and some of the other actors, speak their lines far too naturalistically, despite the fact that Shakespeare's plays were written in a formal, poetic blank verse which was never intended to be naturalistic even in the early 1600s. It was also difficult to hear what some of the characters were saying. Special mention- for all the wrong reasons- must go to Jed Kurzel, presumably a relative of the director, for his horrible, whining musical score. When I reviewed Baz Luhrmann's eccentric but nevertheless watchable "Romeo + Juliet", I wrote that you can't go far wrong with Shakespeare, at least not if you stick to the major plays. This "Macbeth" shows just how wrong I could be. Justin Kurzel has managed to achieve the difficult feat of making a dull, boring film out of one of the greatest plays in the English language. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm no Shakespeare expert. I really love Roman Polanski's Macbeth which was a cinematic master piece, IMO. This latest attempt has failed so miserably. It felt like a hack job done by a bunch of amateurs. The screenplay was unbelievably AWFUL! The characters were flat as a runway and without distinction from one another. Most of the cast looked totally out of place. The wide shots were great but the close-ups were really dim and gloomy looking, in a pretentious way, which worked negatively towards building tension, demonstrate emotion and electrifying the audience.There were no tension, no emotion and no one was electrified. I feel bad for these ppl that had to work so hard off a POS screenplay. You could tell that the director was way over his head. What's up with Fassbender mumbled his way through out and his eyeliners? Lol. It really felt like a TV-movie with all the pretentious special effect. The witches looked like some feminists with facial scars. There was no story-telling! Just bad monologues done by overrated actors. Honestly, it felt like an episode from those Vikings shows. When will these over-confident hacks realize they don't have it and stop wasting everyone's time. Smh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This new adaptation of Macbeth got excited me weeks before and when I saw the cast, Fassbender and Cotillard, I got excited even more! Because they are just great and I am a fan of both. However, from the first minute, the film couldn't catch the viewer's attention fully, because it lacks emotion, depth and thrill. This is not an exactly drama film, because there is not much of it. You can see this even in the first battle of the film. A pretentious way of film making just to be seen poetic and artistic. The movie visually looks beautiful at some moments, but those images serve nothing. Fassbender and Cotillard make us surprised by their "low key" performances, so please don't expect any kind of tour-de-force acting from them. If you do, you are seriously disappointed. In the film, there is no character depth at all and the dramatization of the events was totally ineffective. For example, a character is portrayed evil, but you have no idea or clue why he or she is evil? A character is portrayed brave, but you have no idea, why he is such a brave man? It is mostly because there is no tension which should increase gradually like Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece Throne of Blood. As expected, this is not a "war" film. If you expect a Kingdom of Heaven like film, then you are seriously disappointed. I had not any problem with unusual monologues/dialogs in the film, but some may find it hard to follow. It doesn't ruin the reality of the film which is a success. Especially, in the second act, the film becomes more pretentious with the over the top and "poetic" visuals and just leaves you with no emotion. This new Macbeth is a film lacking heart and soul in the material caused by its pompous narration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT: unforgivably, irredeemably DULL...Shakespeare can be played and interpreted many ways, fine...but there's no excuse for this flat, one-note -- and I don't just mean the monotonous, dirge-like score -- utterly tedious, tiresome mess. (this movie could give "miserable-ism" a bad name.)OK, the dead baby opening is a brilliant stroke...congrats to somebody for making visual something only hinted at in the play -- but it all goes downhill from there -- and not fast. "tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow" really does "creep" in a very petty pace."macbeth" has so many pulpy audience-grabbing elements...it's an operatic funhouse of witches, blood, murder, omens, pitched battles, visions. swordplay and ruthless ambition...boisterous and violent and pitched to a frenzy at points...in short: FUN! -- so why is this misconceived and woefully misbegotten production so hopelessly mopey from the first frame?...and all melancholic remorse for its entire insufferable length?..fassbender has no feel for the language, the less he says the better...cotillard comes off better, but only because her face is so powerfully expressive...and the burning woods of burnham are the only heat on screen. (hey, Scotland's blasted heaths are kinda foggy -- we get it!)wish 0 stars was an option...(or even negative numbers)...BLCCGGGGHHH!...a curse on the (so-called) film-makers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oddly unemotional retelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During Scottish civil wars, nobleman Macbeth and his friend Banquo receive prophecies from witches: they tell Macbeth he will become King. Macbeth's wife pressures him into making this prophecy come true by murdering King Duncan. He does so, but the assassination causes him more problems.Shakespeare's tragedy of predestination has been filmed many times before and, here, stars Michael Fassbender as Macbeth and Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth. I was expecting great things from a film of a play I know well and love. And I got some great things, principally the look of the film which is truly bleak. I loved some of the visuals presented here.But I wasn't terribly impressed with much of the rest. The determinedly Scottish accents mean that the dialogue is very often difficult to make out. Some of the performance and directorial choices are truly puzzling - Sean Harris' reaction on learning of the murder of his wife and children was strangely dispassionate (by contrast, showing their brutal murder directly at Macbeth's hand was very effective), and the decision for Lady Macbeth to deliver the "Out damned spot" speech in rather gentle fashion, while very much not washing her hands, was utterly mystifying: her descent into madness made little sense as shown.In fact, the overall impression I got from most of the performances was emotional distance. This story, and the dialogue in which it is told, is visceral but, apart from some of the action, this film is not. The actors are all first rate, so the blame for a rather dispassionate reading of a classic play must lie with director Justin Kurzel. I highlight one major exception: Fleance's reaction to Banquo's death was wonderful.The music, heavy with celtic pipes and, especially, groaning cellos, is intrusive, distracting, and composed by the director's brother. I did not feel it improved the film in any way.Overall, I was pretty disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scottish Play reduced to a garbled Glaurfest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly, this film is a real pig's breakfast - Noggin the Nog meets Once Upon a Time in the West!The scenery is bleakly magnificent, but Kurzel succeeds in making it look more like a wet weekend in the Greenland of Erik the Red than 11th Century Scotland. Battles take the form of mud-wrestling with daggers in Braveheart warpaint. Michael Fassbender and most of the rest of the cast toy with versions of mumbled Lowland demotic. Sadly, nobody seems to have told Marion Cotillard, who delivers her lines theatrically in mannered Shakespearean English, hurriedly gabbling her way through her first crucial scene as if she were worried about missing her bus. Sean Harris seems to base his performance as Macduff on the insight that his character's name rhymes with gruff.As a mere thane, Macbeth appears to live in a flimsy shanty town in the middle of a Highland peat bog. After he becomes king, he and his missus are able to move into an elegant castle in the high Norman style. 'More than enough motive for murder there I would have thought.On the positive side, Lynn Kennedy, Kayla Fallon, Seylan Baxter and Amber Rissmann make a good job of the weird sisters, steering well clear of cackling crone clichés. And David Hayman puts in a good performance as Lennox, a man careful to stay on the right side of power.But overall, it's a big disappointment. Orson Welles and Akira Kurosawa have both made much better jobs of filming the Scottish play.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly awful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you take the Shakespeare out of this mess, you would have an amateurish "sword and sorcery", pot-boiler movie which would (and should!) be laughed at.Re-insert Shakespeare (who must be disturbing his own bones by turning in his grave in Stratford-upon-Avon)and you have one of the most mangled versions of "The Scottish Play" that has been my misfortune to sit through.Briefly: scenes chopped, changed but not for the better; significant events simply skimmed over or missed; scenes invented and gratuitously inserted (e.g. the daft opening scene); lines entirely stripped of their power; lines entirely missed out and not for any particularly good reason. There is nothing wrong with interpreting Shakespeare and (say) missing out scenes and lines to give a vision of the meaning of the play as the director sees it - e.g. Olivier missed out nearly 1,000 lines of Henry V in his 1944 film production of Henry V (not a film that I personally care that much for but it was effective and did not do a violence to the play). However Justin Kurzel's effort strikes me as the production of someone who simply did not understand his material.The casting was frequently dire, Marion Cottilard was simply miscast as Lady Macbeth she may be many things but this was a step too far for her in my opinion. Malcolm was, in effect, a bit-player, mostly shorn of the small role he has; there are too many other examples. That said, Michael Fassbender gave an almost creditable/credible performance as the eponymous hero but he had a mangled text to work with.The Scottish accents were a curious mishmash of the genuine (i.e. the role was actually played by a Scot) and the dreadful made up, modern-day "Glasgow" accents that the BBC seems to trot out when it wants to do something about Scotland and show it elsewhere. That said, the diction was very poor - we certainly do not need declamation a la Henry Irvine but having lines mumbled in a hoarse "tough guy" whisper (a la Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry) was neither helpful nor illuminating.The choice of locations was quite bizarre - some were very good and atmospheric - conveying extremis well but others were, it seems, simply plucked at random from something like the Lord of the Rings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missing Macbeth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am baffled by the positive reviews this film has received. I have seen many Macbeth adaptations and live on stage and this film portrays none of the raw human emotion that makes the play great. Instead we are subjected to a self congratulating aesthetic that might look visually visceral, misses the point of the characters. Sorely disappointed with Fassbender who usually has such depth was monotonous and dull. The concept of a historically realistic setting was a good one, but the execution left much to be desired. Shakespeare aficionados will notice the alterations and cuts made to the text, which I can't help but wonder the point of since the missing scenes would have aided the character construction a lot. I'm fine with artistic license but why remove the overtly pagan aspect yet retain the witches as true characters rather than figments of Macbeths mind? There are so many better versions of Macbeth out there, I don't see any value in this one at all. In short, this Macbeth is well worth a miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fatuous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the strongest features of this version: the locations, photography and production design, are quite outstanding the overall impression is less than memorable. It is afflicted by a meddling director, changes that serves little purpose or revelation in the end, and all the normal problems of cinematic adaptations of Shakespeare.A major defect is the music which constantly scrapes ? telling us that all things are seething with malignancy. It does, however strain the nerves like a dentist's drill, and is just as annoying. In essence that is the flaw with the whole thing, and certainly the first hour which is dour and dreary, though not in a good way because it's so simplistically portentous and saved only by the scenery and the light.The actors manage quite well, even if they speak in a very mannered sotto voce. In itself this is a weakness as it leads through most of the film to a vocal range that is very narrow. This pitch is evident between Macbeth and his wife as though all relationships are marked by the same register and it is necessarily identical between all parties. Paradoxically this approach leads Macbeth to be nearly unchanged from the beginning to the end, which is not how the play deals with the character. The important "Tomorrow?" soliloquy is rendered lame by the continuity of the low voice which preceded it and so this speech is no different to the rest.The typical problem of all cinematic adaptations of Shakespeare is apparent here. The two forms, poetic drama and cinema are anathema to each other. The former requires words and once they are edited it's not Shakespeare but an etiolated revision, replaced by montage and glances; which compared to a great text, are of very little consequence. Kurosawa's Throne of Blood was another prism by which to see this drama but it was only cognate in the same plot and story, not the language, and stands in the same way as his superb Ran is to King Lear.There are several film versions of this play and now there are more filmed staged versions to view and to compare. This particular version looks quite pointless by comparison. It has made some changes, cut some parts, removed the small portion of vulgar humor which relieved the glowering doom, but in the end, it is rather fatuous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I managed to struggle through about half of this. Probably it would have been wonderful if I happened to speak Shakespearean English. Unfortunately, like everyone else on the planet except a few English professors, I don't. I cannot imagine American viewers taking to this film. Not only is the English regional, but it is written in the original dialogue, which makes it pretty much impossible to understand what's going on. The cinematography is superb, the actors look stunningly authentic, the acting appears to be faultless - but even if it had subtitles (it doesn't) it would be incomprehensible. Why, oh why, did the producers not render it in a more modern form of English? They must be mad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is the first time i criticize a movie for having its shots too well built they're too well composed, too well shot, too well crated, they all feel like a thing of their own and not like parts of a whole. that completely destroys continuity and the sense that you're watching a straight forward movie. it's actually like you're watching a two hours slide show of great artworks, they'll probably give great desktop wallpapers, but that's about it the first and third acts use too much slow motion, which ruins what could be great scenes, but are already damaged due to my previous comment this was my biggest problem with it, but it's a big problem, directing and editing went completely over board with this one and missed its essence, trying to bring something new to the table with a horse that has been beaten to death already the dialogue is what we should all already expect, and it delivered: dull, flowery, fancy Shakespearian crap. why don't people get that it does not work anymore? it's not believable, not convincing, it should most certainly be revisioned. the story is good, i like tragedies and this one is already very well encrusted in our culture and history acting was good, nothing out of the ordinary, but good, so was the score conclusion: flowery nice images trying to pose as stylistically revisionist version of a classic, do not recommend</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like everybody else,I went to the theater with high expectations for this movie!...and we all know what happens when we have high expectations,don't we? It went through the whole film as a phony imitation of what it could have been if,well intended,or wanted by the director.I can't claim that I am an expert in the old bard's plays-English is not my first language,and I am a Latin American girl,saying this to imply my lack of sound knowledge in Sheakespeare's plays.But I do love films,and been seeing them for almost 60 years now.That would count,at least for me,in being moved by some quality work. They say European directors are countable for everything in a movie,and in the American ones,would be the producers.How that would that apply in here? I feel like calling the director responsible for the tragedy he created!Yes!Because he had lots of talent in hands,but he decided not to demand a better job from the best boys...are they not who look for all the main details in a film?Again,I am a Latino girl,but that kind of castle,is out of the right time in history!!!Am I just raving?You know when you see a nice cake and you try it,and it is just tasteless?That's this Macbeth,unfortunately.When I saw Fassbender's war painted face,I could not wait any longer,but going to the theater...I feel like not only I,but we should be reimbursed.Espetacular Scotland's scenery counted,or otherwise I would have given it a star,or maybe two;seeing the great performers,also counted.But,then,you have the director!I found the performances cold,out of touch,repressed by both Cotillard and Fassbender,and I know they are fine actors!But if you ask me,there was one(1),just one scene that moved me:when Lady Macbeth is dead and Macbeth says that part of the monologue!"...tomorrow,and tomorrow,and tomorrow..."Fassbender is an actor that maybe has believed in fame that he has acquired...he forces himself strongly,like in 12 Years of Slavery,and in that time he was crazy about the Oscar's winning!Is he totally immersed in Hollywood's vanity?He needs to ...study more,perhaps?Now,he is easy on the eye!!!that I can't disagree,and he has the potential for big deliveries,if..:he decides to leave his vanity aside!Well,it is a film that probably was made in between schedules,with great names!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sustained brooding crushing dread! From the superb cinematography of the perfect landscapes to the masterful performances of the principles this was a truly memorable cinema experience. We can only guess at what Shakespeare's reaction to the 'miracle' medium of cinema would be but I suspect, technology shock aside, he would have been moved by this splendid interpretation of his work. Fassbender and Cotillard are perfect. The decision to use the Black Cuillin on the Isle of Skye is inspired and the landscape becomes a star of the show too rather than just a background. I have witnessed some unfortunate 'adjustments' to Shakespeare's text over the years (principally in the theatre!) but the departures here fell naturally into place and felt by no means awkward. A stunning achievement by all concerned. If this film is not highly feted at awards time I'll eat my tartan!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hell Is Murky and So Is Scotland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Macbeth is a beautifully shot but in many respect weak adaption of Shakespeare's play. Although the major performers give it their best, they are undermined by at times odd choices in staging by the director. The result is pretty but ultimately underwhelming.On one hand, the Scottish play has never been more beautiful. The cinematography makes excellent use of lighting, fog, smoke, and more fog. Scotland has never been gloomier, nor have battles looked more ominous. The excellent camera work is complemented by good use of the landscape of the Scottish highlands.The acting, while not mind blowing, does the material justice. Michael Fassbender embodies Macbeth's descent into madness, slowly transitioning from reluctant killer into bloodthirsty tyrant. Although her performance is less showy, Marion Cotillard does well with her role as Lady Macbeth. She is helped by some changes from the original play that make her shift from ruthless killer to guilt ridden maniac more plausible.However, this is undermined by some odd choices in direction, which range from distracting to outright ruining scenes. For instance, whenever a character is talking, the camera zooms into his or her face, to the point that it borders on self-parody. Moreover, in some scenes the overall murkiness is overdone, as in the climactic fight between Macbeth and Macduff where it is hard to tell what is going on through all the smoke.One especially poorly executed scene is the banquet where Banquo's ghost appears. When Macbeth talks to the hired killers, he practically announces the murder to the entire room. While the convention of the stage whisper works in the theater, it makes no sense in a cinema production and renders Macbeth's attempts to feign surprise at Banquo's failure to appear comical.In the end, this flawed execution undermines the beautiful camera work and effective performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shakespeare's classic tragedy is acted with celebrated lead performances from Michael Fassbender , Marion Cotillard , Sean Harris , Paddy Considine , David Thewlis , among others . Macbeth (Michael Fassbender) , the Thane of Glamis , and his underling Banquo (Paddy Considine) have put down a rebellion and are to be rewarded by their overlord , King Duncan (David Thewlis) . On their way to their castle they meet three witches and a little girl who prophesy that Macbeth will soon rule , but his kingdom will be short . They are dismissed as crazies but their prophesies come to pass . Consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his astute spouse , his equally murderous wife (Marion Cotillard) , Lady Macbeth (she is often referred to as "Lady M") , he subsequently murders his king and takes the throne for himself .Notorious as well as big-budgeted adaptation of the Shakespearean classic marked by unflinching violence , realistic design and fatalistic atmosphere . A magnificent recounting of Shakespeare's Macbeth in which all the fire , doom , vengeance and ambition of his text come brilliantly to life . Although Shakespeare's Macbeth has little to do with Macbeth , the King , the real Macbeth was one of Scotland's better kings . Very well made film that contains stunning fight scenes , lots of mood , grisly killings , fine acting , breathtaking battles and being compellingly set in a barbaric society . Realized in cold and thought-provoking style that it bears remarkable resemblance to the Shakespearean original . However , some aspects differ from the original source material , as there would be only the three witches without the child and the infant , as Banquo's ghost would sit in Macbeth's seat during the banquet ; moreover , the movie subplot of Macbeth's dead child would be completely omitted as well as the famous beheading executed by MacDuff , opposite to the movie . This movie is an incredibly detailed vision in its own right . Main cast offers awesome interpretations . Michael Fassbender gives a fabulous acting as a demonic leader receives a prophecy from a trio of women that foretell one day he will become King of Scotland . Extraordinary support cast , such as Paddy Considine as Banquo , Sean Harris as Macduff , David Hayman as Lennox , David Thewlis as King Duncan and many others . Colorful as well as evocative cinematography , though dark , by Adam Arkapaw . Being filmed at Bamburgh ; Roman Polanski's Macbeth (1971) was there also shot . The motion picture was well directed by Jed Kurzel who also composed the thrilling score . Before directing this film , Kurzel worked as a designer of a stage production of the play in which his wife played Lady Macbeth . ¨Macbeth¨ (2015) results to be , in fact , a worthy continuation of various renditions based upon Shakespearean classic play , these are the followings : Macbeth (1948) acted , directed by Orson Welles with Jeanette Nolan , Dan O'Herlihy , Roddy McDowall , Robert Coote , this is a low-budgeted retelling with cheap sets , a three-week shooting schedule and an attempt at Scottish accent ; Macbeth (1976) with Eric Porter , Janet Suzman ; Macbeth (1990) with Michael Jayston , Leigh Hunt , being produced as part of HBO's Thames collection ; Macbeth (1971) by Roman Polanski with John Finch , Francesca Annis , Martin Shaw , being first movie made by Playboy Enterprises , it was torn apart by critics and originally rated X . Furthermore , a Japanese adaptation : Throne of Blood (1957) by Akira Kurosawa with Toshiro Mifune , Yamada , Shimura , this is Kurosawa's masterful rendition that transports the story to medieval Japan and the world of the samurai .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shakespearian tragedy is where a character, so full of potential, makes a bad decision and their life falls apart from then on. The audience feels so upset by the waste of that potential. This film is a Shakespearian tragedy on an epic scale.For those expecting a modern version of Polanski's classic, you'll be sorely disappointed. Polanski it is not. The battle scenes are poor versions of the series Spartacus, the actors mumble their way through, delivering in a monotone, and they have changed the story so much, it is pretentious to call the film Macbeth. I didn't think much of The Last Kingdom but this film makes that series look brilliant. Even Polanski's 1970s special effects with the dagger are way better than in this 2015 production.Some of the scenery is spectacular but that's about it. If you want to see a classic version of the Scottish play, watch Polanski's version.</fullReview>

Brutal and sensitive, cruel and caressing, he handles the verse effortlessly, the fights viciously, and he radiates a huge wattage of charisma. He and Marion Cottilard make a convincingly sexy couple. She is not obvious casting - usually the role is the province of more steely performers. All the same, she makes a success of it, forceful in the electrically effective banquet scene, and touchingly melancholy as she drifts into the deep depression of her mad scene.The supporting cast is terrific, the technical side superb, the score by the director's brother mesmerising. I have a couple of quibbles: the emphasis on interiority makes the pace feel insufficiently varied, and so much close-miking gives the impression that too much of the text is whispered. But on the whole this is a bravely envisioned, powerfully acted movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most recent of the many screen versions of the Scottish Play, this is a truly abysmal adaptation of one of Shakespeare's finest works. Justin Kurzel's direction is appalling. He seems to be more interested in artistic gimmicks such as the pointless and distracting slow motion in the first battle scene and in showing blood and guts than in the raw emotion and psychology of the play. It is an exercise in flash over substance, which comes across as pretentious. It is as if he is trying to convince us that he is a great filmmaker. Well, it succeeded in convincing me of quite the opposite, I'm afraid. Not only that but the film looks cheap. At one point, I was worried that there was something wrong with the DVD as the camera work was so shoddy. Sadly, there wasn't. I could not help comparing the would-be affecting battle scenes to the powerful and gritty ones seen in Kenneth Branagh's version of "Henry V" and I could also not help finding them wanting. All I kept thinking was that it would have been considerably better if Branagh, my favourite living director, had been given the job. Rumour has it that he is considering his own version and I really hope that that's true.The shots of Scottish scenery are nice but so what? I could easily just go back to Scotland (where I lived for a year) and see them in person without suffering through this. Kurzel's direction is utterly lacking in energy, style or flair and, if he understands the play, there's not much indication of it on screen. Although if you like fog, you're in luck. Presumably this was intended to make the film moody and atmospheric but it is merely another entry in its litany of failures. This is the 24th Shakespearean adaptation that I have watched since January 2015 so I am a bit of an aficionado of the Bard's work. I am afraid that this is the worst Shakespearean adaptation that I have ever seen. I was not enamoured of either Orson Welles' lacklustre 1948 version or Roman Polanski's creepy and off-putting 1971 version but I preferred both of them to this. Macbeth is one of my favourite Shakespearean plays but I have yet to see a screen version that does it justice. I'd sell my soul to be able see Laurence Olivier's unmade 1950s version which would have starred himself and his then wife Vivien Leigh. Richard Burton and Sean Connery's unmade versions would have probably been worthwhile as well. This version, however, is a masterclass in how not to make Shakespeare for the screen. I can't remember the last time that I was so utterly and bitterly disappointed by a film.Shakespearean adaptations live or die on the strength of their cast and this one suffers from poor performances from otherwise good actors. The film stars Michael Fassbender in an atypically bad performance as the Thane of Glamis and later of Cawdor whose vaulting ambition propels him onto the throne of Scotland. Fassbender makes for an extremely uninvolving Macbeth and he often seems more bored than anything. He is completely unable to convey the character's inner conflict, self- doubt or lack of strength and is particularly weak during the crucial "Dagger of the mind" and "Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow" soliloquies. I would have much preferred to see his "X-Men" co-star James McAvoy in the role and not just because he is actually Scottish. Marion Cotillard is better but only marginally so since Lady Macbeth is nowhere near as compelling or even interesting a character in the film as she is in the play. The only other film in which I have seen her is "Midnight in Paris" and I thought that she was wonderful in that so I was shocked that she was mostly boring as one of Shakespeare's best characters. The supporting cast includes Paddy Considine, David Hayman, David Thewlis, Sean Harris, Maurice Roëves and Jack Reynor but only Hayman and Harris are particularly impressive or even memorable and then only in small doses. Seylan Baxter, Lynn Kennedy, Kayla Fallon and Amber Rissmann play the Witches but you would not know that there was anything the least bit supernatural about them in spite of the fact that was rather what Shakespeare was going for. Presumably at the (poor) direction of Kurzel, most of the actors mumble their lines rather than enunciate clearly. Another bad idea poorly executed. I will say this about Kurzel though: at least he's consistent.Overall, this is a simply deplorable version of a fantastic play. If I were Shakespeare, I would want my name taken off it. After Duncan's murder, Lady Macbeth says what's done cannot be undone. Well, I wish that I could find a way to undo watching this travesty. There's an old saying in Hollywood: "You can make a bad film out of a good script but you can't make a good film out of a bad script." This may not be a Hollywood film but it is a textbook example of the first part of that aphorism. This will undoubtedly be one of my Bottom Five of 2016. At the moment, it is No. 2 after the Chinese film "Pingguo", which was unleashed on the unsuspecting English speaking world as "Lost in Beijing". Hopefully, unlike Duncan and later the title character himself, the film "Macbeth" will not be usurped.</fullReview>

It is about some idiots, running in shirts through the frozen hills trying to do bad things to each other. There is no motivation attached to any single piece of this story, making it all totally useless. However, I gave it two stars. The first one is for the ending scene - the one and only in the whole that actually tries to give something to the audience and refers directly to the essence of the play.

		<fullReview>I found it a rather strange choice of material, most people I know are haunted by School lessons, being made to decipher Shakespeare, most often Macbeth. Not a film many would wish to see I would have thought but I went as I like Fassbender, a strong character actor, fantastic as Steve Jobs. As Macbeth he performs well, as do his peers. The problem with this production is it's very much a film you need to be in a particular kind of mood to enjoy. It is particularly dark in tone, the material as we all know is rather bleak. It's the kind of film i'd deem heavy, some of the dialogue at times was a little difficult to pick up. A film I'm sure will be the stuff of nightmares for School children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Shakespearean play put to film yet !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My most favourite film ever, and I ask a lot, not since the Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford have I been moved so much, my only sour note was the film was too short, I could have indulged a little longer, especially the banquet scene. The soundtrack was sublime, the cinematography was on the level of Roger Deakins, (therefore the best), acting was outstanding from all quarters, location was exact, costumes were breathtaking, reminded me of my favourite designer Alexander McQueen. It had the right pace for the time in history too, my mind, body and soul were transported back to my ancestors, and all the way through I had spine chilling goose bumps. Thank you so much cast and crew ! ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Five Word Review: Extraordinarily Acted Gritty Shakespearean Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Shakespeare's most famous (and quotable) tragedy has not had a major big-screen adaptation that has stayed faithful to the play in many a year. Justin Kurzel's film attempts to provide a definitive cinematic version of the iconic play with this gritty, war-based work of drama starring Michael Fassbender (Oscar-nominated for "12 Years a Slave, 2013) in the eponymous role and Marion Cotillard, who won the award for her role in Edith Piaf biopic "La Vie en Rose," 2007. As a quick word of warning: if you've not read any Shakespeare, then I'd advise you not to watch this film. Rife with Shakespearean language told through coarse Scottish accents, this is not a story easy to follow for those unfamiliar with it. Having studied the Scottish play in school, I can bring you up to speed if you're unaware - Macbeth is a Scottish thane (equivalent of a lord) who sees a premonition of witches after winning a battle. The witches' prophecies trigger a spiral which sends Macbeth beyond sanity. And a character-based war drama is, in my opinion, the perfect direction to go in for a Macbeth adaptation. I always thought in school of what a good film Macbeth would be if made with sweeping battle scenes and a rough, gritty take on the tale. This is what Kurzel does, to great success. The first thing to note is the acting. Easily his best role (which is saying something,) Michael Fassbender portrays the flawed deterioration of the eponymous protagonist with gravitas yet often relatable humanity, even as his deeds become more and more ghastly (a scene with stakes is especially hard to watch.) It will be interesting to see how Fassbender's upcoming performance in Danny Boyle's Steve Jobs biopic compares to this. An Oscar nod is almost inevitable; it would be a travesty for him not to gain a nomination for this. Marion Cotillard is not to be over- shadowed in a role which would require a considerable lack of talent to play badly. Luckily the French actress has that talent in spades and at first she brings to the table hardened resolve before the true extent of Macbeth's madness is revealed and her acting changes accordingly with an impeccable change-over.Also good is the haunting score and stunning Scottish scenery, bleak yet beautiful in a cold, austere way. The supporting turns from David Thewlis as King Duncan, Sean Harris as Macduff and Paddy Considine as Banquo are also all fantastic. In addition the ending is unexpected, but in a good way.There's little bad to be said about the technique that went into the process of making Macbeth. The only things which detract are the admittedly shallow complaint that the dialogue, and therefore the story, is often hard to understand due to the coarse accents and antiquated language. This does sometimes have the effect of ruining scenes due to being taken out of it trying to understand the speech. Also, the slow motion is used rather poorly. Too much to be used effectively, with the slow motion lingering a little too long mid-battle, but not enough to be part of the visual style like Zack Snyder's 300. However, apart from this Justin Kurzel's Macbeth is a masterfully made film that may not win over those unfamiliar with the source material but will be a true treat for fans of Shakespeare and cinema. 79/100.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stellar visuals and weighty performances make for good Shakespeare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being completely bowled over by Adam Arkapaw's visuals, I was unprepared for the crushing weight in the performances of Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard. The former, who is admittedly my favorite working actor, impressed me with both his intensity and his restraint. He could have opted to play Macbeth's insanity in a wide eyed bat-dung homage to Mel Gibson's Hamlet. Many actors are overwhelmed by Shakespeare and, as a result, deliver turgid dribbling performances. Whereas for the most part Fassbender's Macbeth seethes and intensely eyes the object of his anger. Marion Cotillard absolutely killed it as Lady Macbeth. Even if this Lady Macbeth was much changed from what we're used to. In earlier adaptations, and I believe the original source, she was much more manipulative. It was almost as if she forced Macbeth's hand. That's not so in Justin Kurzel's interpretation. Here the two are equally yoked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An important Shakespeare film.My best "Macbeth" still remains the Orson Welles version, followed by Kurosawa's "Throne of Blood."Why is director Justin Kurzel's version important? This version's visuals (cinematographer Adam Arkapaw) and music/soundtrack are fascinating (though at a few times in the film, the music goes overboard by increasing its volume). The overhead shots of the kings on the throne, the near final sequences of Macbeth's end in red fire and smoke are Kurzel's masterstrokes. The screenplay's variation of the three witches, complete with the young child, is another first. In fact, all children, specially Fleance, in this version acquire a major space that no other version of Macbeth allowed.Marion Cotillard is amazing always. Fassbender is not the best Macbeth--others have been a lot better. The music of Jed Kurzel is notable, more so the sound management most of the time, though not always. Now, is the music composer Kurzel related to the director Kurzel? Both are Australians with the same surname.The lack of bagpipes in the music was odd. So also the several Christian crosses that one does not often see in Shakespeare, unless it is essential, as in "Romeo and Juliet." This Macbeth is different in more ways than obvious. The Special Effects department needs to take a bow as major contributors. Methinks, the Australian element surfaced in this British/US/French production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bitter Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was genuinely looking forward to this movie. Fassbender as Macbeth? Many had doubts but i thought... sign me up! Nope. Nope. Nope! Cinematography wise, I have no complaints. The eerie landscapes of Scotland, the costumes, the hair and makeup. The misty battlefields. The music. It all came together nicely and captured the essence of the period. But it was boring. Pretentiously boring because...this is Shakespeare! This is Shakespeare writing about Scottish people and their struggle during a time of bloody wars and this movie just...dulled it up. What's with all the whispering? Where's the passion? Tension? The brutality of it all? The fire? I know Macbeth, I've read and re-read it. It is a dramatic story of rage, tyranny, lust and struggle for power. It is gripping. It is the type of story that rips your heart out of your chest and makes you look at it and deal with it. This movie is not Macbeth. It is nothing more than a mediocre attempt to squeeze out some money and fame. In short, they bit more than they could chew (maybe that could explain all the mumbling). Pity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plays are live performances and suffer imitations films do not. Wardrobe and location changes, special effects and camera angles that show us things rather than tell us things are the best tools used in filmmaking. You know the phrase "A picture is worth a THOUSAND WORDS?" Whoever made this left the thousand words in and didn't rely on filmmaking techniques to do the story telling. It is like someone filmed a live play and I'm watching the recording of a live play. This comes complete with eloquent speeches delivered by everyone at all times. Even inappropriate ones. This play was not adapted well to a film and it's just plain excruciating to try and watch. Read the play or watch a live performance as no amount of editing can save this. Next time use more pictures and a few thousand less words.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the film should either have been word to word completely based on the play (by Williams Shakespeare), or the changes made should have been a lot better. One prime example of the latter that comes to my mind is the Bollywood film 'Maqbool' (2003). The changes made in it that differ from the original play, 'Macbeth', make it an even better as a film, and is my most favourite film ever based on any of Shakespeare's play.One flaw that I can point to is, Malcolm, the son of the slain king, flees despite being an eye-witness to the murder of his father. Surely he could have screamed and shouted on the spot, gathered all the king's servants etc. and avoided himself being killed by Macbeth (as did the latter threaten) and, at least could have got it crystal clear on the spot as to who murdered king Duncan. Instead of all this, prince Malcolm flees, settles in another country and never returns! The murder scene and the whole conspiracy surrounding it was best depicted in the aforementioned Bollywood film.Secondly, either Lady Macbeth should have been shown to have committed suicide, as the original play depicts, or her should should have been depicted due to some serious causes. Showing that depression, guilt or hallucinations alone caused her death seemed a bit overboard. This too was brilliantly depicted in the aforementioned film: she suffers from guilt and depression before dying, but her death was caused due to Maqbool/Macbeth having picked her up from the hospital in a very weak condition, straight after a delivery.All the criticism aside, the film overall was still quite good. The performances by everyone were solid. Still, despite it being the film that I most desperately wanted to watch in the last three-four months, it did not entirely live up to my expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whatever happened to Shakespeare? He is almost completely lost in this pretentious whisking away of any meaning and poetry of the play by complete obfuscation of the language, the very flesh and blood of any Shakespeare drama, here mumbled in the beards or wheezed half way while most gets stuck in the throat, as if diction suddenly was anathema and banished. All previous Macbeth adaptations for the screen that I have seen have been better, and they were at least four. Things are made even worse by the fact of the alterations, the important part of the porter (peeing in the gate) has been obliterated, the murder of the family of McDuff is turned into a grotesque exaggeration like a blasphemy of the play, and McDuff's war trick in the end with the wandering forest, the very top of the play, is substituted by an intentional destructive forest fire. The battle scenes are grossly exaggerated and turned into artificial ballets made worse by slow motion, and there is little to save the film except the marvellous landscape scenery, magnificent all the way through, and the after all good acting, despite the fact that the actors are not allowed more than to mumble. Sorry, this was an indecent corruption and humiliation of the theatrical art of Shakespeare. What a marvellous film it would have been, if Shakespeare had been kept alive and allowed to shine in his language in these true landscape settings of wildest Scotland!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>McMacbeth - Best Comic Interpretation of Immortal Tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, to start with, there were a few good things about this movie. Mainly, the lush landscapes, and the individual performances of the actors with what they were given. And it's great to see a revival of interest in this masterpiece of a play.But beyond that, many of the choices made were so laughable that it's hard to see this movie as more than a joke. It's almost a fast-food version of what Macbeth should be instead of a juicy steak: a parody of the play. And if that's the case, I would either prefer a real action movie, or a better version of Macbeth, such as the Roman Polanski version or the BBC version with Nicol Williamson. Especially check out the samurai version Throne of Blood.So what was so bad about the movie? Alright, fasten your seat belts (see/read the play first before reading this review, as spoilers abound):* During the scene where Lady Macbeth is convincing Macbeth to kill Duncan, they seem to start doing you-know-what. When that's done, he says, "I am settled." This is when I realized it's better to view the film as a comedy. * Malcolm witnesses the murder right after it happens, making it obvious who did it. Why wouldn't he go tell the others? Granted Shakespeare's plot is itself a bit thin, but this is really stretching it. * Macduff pukes after seeing Duncan's dead body!!! He also generally hams up his dialogue, like when shouting, "Murder!" and later "He had no children!" * Time is taken up for that, but famous lines are left out, such as, "Wake Duncan with thy knocking, I wish thou couldst" and later "Something wicked this way comes" and "Double, double, toil and trouble" * I am not kidding about this one: during one dialogue, Macbeth slips his hand under Lady M's dress!!! * They cast Fleance as a little kid, yet he outruns the murderers!!! * They leave out the witches' prophecy of Banquo's line of kings, so that it doesn't make sense why Macbeth should be mad at the witches. To make up for that, after Macbeth curses the witches by saying, "Infected be the air whereon they ride!" they have him cry "Woo hoo!" so that it seems like a compliment. * During the "Out, damned spot!" speech, not once does Lady Macbeth scrub her hands. She just stares into the camera and gets weepy. * When "the Queen, my lord, is dead" is announced, Lady M is right there in the room and doesn't look dead! MacB picks her up and starts acting romantic, which arguably misses the point of the scene--he is supposed to be desensitized to human emotions at this stage. * They don't chop down the forest!!! Instead, Macbeth burns it! It's not called "Burn 'em wood"! How did it come to Dunsinane, unless by way of smoke? The burning actually makes the climax less visually stunning, because everything is tinted orange. * Finally, there is a point where Macbeth could easily kill Macduff during their fight, but he doesn't.All in all, I'm glad to see Macbeth being brought to the big screen again, and I commend the filmmakers for trying new things. But when there's a lot of money to spend and acting talent of this caliber is brought together, it's really important to try to make things perfect. This is especially true in light of the fact that, "if we should fail" it'll be a while before Macbeth can be brought to the big screen again with the same "sound and fury".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are going to the Cinema to watching Macbeth you just need to know one thing: Macbeth is a Tragedy written by Shakespeare; so you are going to see an ancient theatrical Tragedy on a screen. This is a good film in optical of the Drama, but you will dislike it if you are going for watching war, battle and fighting. I think Fassbender and Cotillard played very good their role, they are sublime in this film, because they have to explain all the Drama with only words and facial expressions, like they are in Theatre and not in Cinema. The dialogue are intricate, they speak like Shakespeare write the Opera, so metaphor and turn of phrase, you need to keep concentrate to follow all the dialogues.

		<shortDescription>The Madness of King "Macbeth"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the beginning, Captain Macbeth and kinsman to the King is cursed with the witches' prophesy telling him that he will be King. How that for a dramatic foreshadowing? And it is a curse. His desire to be King, a test of his prowess, will make and undo him. Why does Macbeth want the Scottish crown that wears so heavy? Why does Lady Macbeth lust after it so? What is the benefit of being queen? Is it just so, that all men lust for power and all powerful women lust for men with power? The play, and thus the film, offers little explanation. And unlike King Lear, there is no fool character to reflect the king's madness, only other lords and kinsman afflicted with the similar madness. The acting is uneven. Fassbender does well with the material, but he doesn't live up to my expectations. Cotillard as Lady Macbeth fails to impress. She does little to convince us that she is pulling Macbeth's strings and when Macbeth does his worst deeds, her madness and guilt over those actions missing the mark. What she expresses is a weak sadness, not the guilt and shock of an accomplice. Whether it is is the direction or the acting, Lady Macbeth often didn't strike true. In Kurosawa's version of Macbeth, "Throne of Blood", Lady Macbeth is a clearly conniving, manipulative terror. In this version, not so much. I like the more diabolical Lady and the more clearly falsely grieving version of the Kurosawa adaptation. And I understand how extremely unfair it is to compare anything to the master of cinema, Kurosawa. Macbeth was played only slightly better. Fassbender is unable to really honor and show the true bloodthirsty nature of character. He holds back, seeming to think that by holding back on his psychopathology, that it shows a complex character. It doesn't. It shows an unwillingness to commit. In the scene where he grieves his choices, he is much more powerful. Sean Harris, on the other hand, plays the complex Macduff to its fullest. Harris shows incredulity at the actions of King Macbeth, a confused anguish over the king's vengeance, while at the same time demonstrates a hatred and purpose. On hearing of his lost family, Macduff states that he will " dispute it as a man" but he will also "feel it like a man." And Harris/Macduff does just that. His recognition of his fate is the most powerful scene in the film. I like the way the film treats the witches as spirits and not as demonic as in other portrayals. That leaves room for the real manipulators of Macbeth, his wife and his unconscious and barely subsumed desire for absolute power, to come to the fore. His lust for power is barely hidden under a shroud of honor and love, and it only takes the lust of his future queen to bring it out. At its best, "Macbeth" is a tale of honor, country, family and megalomania. At its worst, the film is a confused jumble of motivations that are seldom clear, except in the case of Macduff. It didn't help that director Kurzel couldn't decide whether this version of the play should be more cinematic or theatrical, using elements of both and not always successfully. The best moments are on the moor, though one would assume the play favored the bedroom scenes between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. Their chemistry was fine, but Cotillard in no way convinces us that she could manipulate Fassbender to do anything but bed her. Aye, there's the the rub. My mind is too modern to accept such simplistic motivations, and it will take more than reading words on a page to get me to accept the premise. Rating: MatinéeIt looks great in the Scottish and Northern English countryside. The sets and costumes are well done and even the Scottish warpaint, often a distraction in other films of Scottish warfare, is both powerful and subtle. The film is visually appealing, and despite its uneven performances, there is enough worth watching on the big screen. Peace, Tex Shelters</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The delivery robbed it of its relatability</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>///*** Minor Spoiler ***///OK, maybe it's hard to argue that there is a level of relatability to be had with a story about a mad king who usurped his cousin and systematically ordered the assassinations of all contenders/opposers to the throne . . . not your average Saturday night. However, as a British man who as studied and enjoyed the works of Shakespeare (though I'll admit that I've not read Macbeth), I found that the voices of the characters were lost through poor delivery. At first I thought that maybe the language is too strongly Shakespearean for us to easily understand now, but then again I've enjoyed multiple renditions of Romeo and Juliet, of Much Ado About Nothing and other classics. This made me re-watch them to make sure that my grip on Shakespeare wasn't slipping, but I found again that I enjoyed them, and yet I never engaged with Macbeth, though his story is utterly compelling and full of drama. It felt empty, as if the actors didn't know what it was they were saying, and therefore the emotions that we read to understand the difficult dialogue was either misinterpreted or missing altogether.I'm going to watch it again to see if it was just the initial viewing, and I'd advise reading Macbeth before seeing the film, as that may be where I'm going wrong, but on initial review I think the actors didn't convey the correct emotions with their dialogue and on- screen actions, thus making it a disjointed experience and robbing it of emotional relatability.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently saw Macbeth with Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard and directed by Justin Kurzel and is easily my number 1 film of the year so far. While the Shakespearean dialogue may be hard to follow at times, it doesn't matter as this film is a visual masterpiece and not only i the way of shot types but also in the use of colour (which the end scene uses in a truly jaw dropping sequence). The cinematography in Macbeth is truly something to marvel at and is perfectly accompanied by magnificent performances from the 2 leads and also the rest of the cast. Fassbender was born to play this role and portrays Macbeth in a powerful and emotionally engrossing way and Cotillard is a beautiful and faultless Lady Macbeth (she has a great monologue in one scene which gave me goosebumps). Another element that I loved was the score, wonderfully haunting and powerful and matches the scenery and setting of the film. Overall, Do. Not. Miss. This. It is spectacular and I've probably hyped it up too much now but what ever its great. If I had to fault it I would saw that there are some iconic lines from the original play that aren't used in the film which was disappointing but it probably wouldn't have fit with the tone so maybe it was for the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very good, within the constraints of 113 minutes. (Maybe should have been called 'The Essential MacBeth' or even 'MacBeth: The Highlights' ;-) Great for those without the stamina or education yet to handle the 'real thing', and the film medium suits the private conversations and soliloquies much better as the actors can speak with more subtle feeling. That said, whispering in a Scottish accent is never going to provide the clearest enunciation. Those unfamiliar with the text may struggle to comprehend occasionally, but hey that's Shakespeare for you ! Marion Cotillard does not disappoint, Fassbender retains his crown and there's good support from among the current cohort of serious British actors: Paddy Considine as Banquo; Sean Harris as MacDuff and David Thewlis as Duncan; also from some past the zenith of their careers, as well as a sprinkling of up-and-coming talent.

		<fullReview>Studying Macbeth at school, I recall not being convinced when an army camouflaged itself with trees to bring Birnam Wood to Dunsinane thus enabling the witches' prophecy. For me, it always conjured an image of the Dad's Army platoon on manoeuvre in an English wood with twigs in their helmets. I doubt my rejection of this plot device ever caused Shakespeare to turn in his grave.Nonetheless, director Justin Kurzel seems to share my misgivings. In an innovative way he adapts the text to improve greatly this scenario; it is cinematically spectacular while simultaneously bringing with it the portent of death. No spoilers, but it's a highlight of a film which is very well-paced and quite deliberately, with this exception, relentlessly dour in its approach ? no glamour, no humour. The cinematography is subdued, the acting understated. It couldn't be further removed from Olivier's glorious Technicolor Henry V which, for me, remains the greatest screen Shakespeare. But the film has successfully found its niche and is a very worthy successor to the great adaptations of the mid- twentieth century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Macbeth, a Thane of Scotland, receives a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland. Consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his wife, Macbeth murders his king and takes the throne for himself.This is by far the most visually stunning film I have seen this year. Adam Arkapaw (cinematographer of True Detective season one )is gifted at painting visceral and truly hunting images that stick with the viewer long after the credits roll.Much credit must go to director Justin Kurzel, he adapts Shakespeare's masterpiece in a way that ejects a raw edge while also keeping the desolate and captivating narrative of the play. The way in which he handles the battle sequences is jaw dropping and every shot is like a painting. This is a film that requires multiple viewing and is more a work of art than an entertaining piece.The cast is terrific, Micheal Fassbender gives a powerhouse performance as "Macbeth". He captures the characters' inner turmoil and decay into madness in a way that left me utterly speechless. "Lady Macbeth" is played by the incredible Marion Cotillard, she portrays the sly, manipulative character with the supreme talent she has. Supporting roles are also perfectly cast with Sean Harris being my personal favorite as "Macduff".The score of the film is also particularly striking and composer Jed Kurzel is able to condense the desperate power struggle into an unforgettable score.The only issues I had with the film was that some monologues are extremely repetitive. This may benefit a live production of the play, but for a motion picture it simply slows it down. They at times took me out of the film. These monologues may also struggle to connect with audiences as they can become difficult to understand and unriddle.However this film is an achievement, with powerful performances, unique visuals, an unforgettable soundtrack and visceral directing Macbeth really is a work of art and my personal favorite adaption of the play. I am going to give it a 9.1/10.</fullReview>

If you either enjoy theatrical performance or cinematic epic, this is not going to excite you.Macbeth is a serious tragedy. It confronts issues such as anxiety, ambition, political intrigue, the corruptive nature of power, consequence, temptation, equivocation, the divinity of legitimate kings and so on. This film tells the story with very little emphasis on any of that.

		<fullReview>Justin Kurzel's fresh take on the classic Shakespeare drama boasts two breathtakingly good performances from Cotillard and Fassbender, which is more than enough to overcome the unnecessarily flamboyant direction.For someone who isn't at all into any of Shakespeare's classic tales, I was intrigued with this project for merely two reasons; Marion Cotillard and Michael Fassbender. Not only was I enthralled by both of their turns, but I enjoyed the different take on a story that has been redone so many times. Kurzel chose to take a much more visceral and experimental approach with the storytelling, and for the most part, it works. It took me awhile before I became accustomed to Kurzel's style, but it proved to create more of an emotional backbone to what is already a heavy story.Fassbender, who has found such a nice balance in starring in blockbusters and indies, gives another astounding performance as the troubled title character. He effortlessly demonstrates Macbeth's confidence while also adding in vulnerability to his paranoia. If marketed more, this could have been another nomination for Fassbender. On the other-hand, Cotillard also had her hands full with the meaty role of Lady Macbeth, but she holds her own with Fassbender, constantly nailing the difficult Shakespearean dialogue.As previously mentioned, you do feel a strong presence of Kurzel's visual flare here and I think there is valid argument to make that it tarnishes some aspects of the story. For the first 30 minutes or so, the choppy editing and strange visual cues Kurzel uses didn't enhance my viewing experience. It wasn't really until I dug my teeth into this particular interpretation of these characters that I began to care for the stylistic storytelling.Overall, it's not a usual adaption but nor is it one that I would want to sit through more than once. It is, however, a visceral experience (unlike many Shakespeare adaptations) led by two Oscar caliber performances.+Cotillard and Fassbender are powerful+Kurzel's style grew on me-Takes time to get going7.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fassbender is mesmerizing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the movie has its fair share of flaws (quite a few), Fassbenders performance almost makes up for all of them. Also Marion Coutilard of course, she is amazing in this too. So if you don't mind the movie being shot/spoken in Shakespeare English, you will have a very interesting movie on your hand.I'm also not too familiar with the Macbeth story in detail anymore (have to re-read it), so I can't tell if the movie does steer away at moments or leaves something out. But as it is, it does a good job and while it can not be considered the best Shakespeare adaptation, it still does the job, which comes down to the actors being as convincing as they are</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shakespeare's classic tale hits the big screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes "Macbeth" such a legendary story isn't due to its creepy and engrossing story line that takes its characters through a thunderstorm of chaos, but rather what it did originally, that is exploiting pride and power and what it does to the mind. Shakespeare's epic tragedy hits the big screen from director Justin Kurzel in a somewhat disappointing fashion. Kurzel hits the mark with the production and costume design, setting up ancient Scotland in fantastic uniform. What Kurzel fails to do is adapt it fully enough. Unless you didn't graduate from high school English, the story is relatively iconic. Macbeth, the Thane of Glamis, receives a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland. Consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his wife, Macbeth murders his king and takes the throne for himself, leading to war and blood. Michael Fassbender, one of the hottest rising stars as Macbeth, and French actress Marion Cotillard as his mischievous wife, give great performances who were born for these roles. The only issue "Macbeth" has is that the writing is too similar to the playwright. In fact, it is nearly word for word what Shakespeare originally wrote centuries ago. What this does it make it hard to fully understand and hear what's occurring on screen, tending to lose track of what the story symbolizes and take away the entertainment value from the film. Despite this problem, "Macbeth" is a triumph of production and surely the strongest screen adaptation of the play to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bloody yet bloodless Macbeth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version of Macbeth has plenty of violent scenes, yet the performances themselves lack blood- by which I mean, passion and feeling. This is a version of Macbeth so lacking on enthusiasm or effort that it's puzzling as to why it was made and why the filmmakers thought it was necessary. The lack of imagination is first apparent on our first look at the witches, who are just... women. Their appearance is meant to be otherworldly (indeed, in the play they have beards, though I've yet to see a production of Macbeth that keeps that detail), but in this film they're anything but. And they mutter lines, hailing Macbeth, that should be said with a little fire. That's just a taste of what Michael Fassbender gives us as Macbeth. He's learned his lines, but apparently saw no need to act them out, speaking monotonously and saying things that don't match what we see. He refers to his hair unseated and his heart pounding- they're not. He tells Duncan he will be joyful while frowning. When debating whether to kill Duncan, he shows not a trace of fear or conflict. After Duncan's death, he says he wishes for death, but no one would believe him. Upon seeing Banquo's ghost, he says he is white with fear- he's not. Later, he calls a servant cream-faced- but he's not.Marion Cotillard does much better as Lady Macbeth. When we first see her reading the letter, her voice, unlike Fassbender's, actually varies accordingly to what she is reading. But there's not enough of her in the film, and the other characters lack any interesting traits. Our spirits who mislead Macbeth are supposed to be a severed head and a bloody fetus, but here they're just ordinary people. And plenty of the action lacks imagination as well- showing Duncan's murder, and having Duncan wake up just before, is ripped off from Roman Polanski's 1971 film. See Polanski's version instead- because a monotone Macbeth equals a botched Bard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brave attempt by largely unknown director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Fassbinder, Paddy Considine and David Thewlis are three of the world' best actors whether on stage, film or television, all of whom have well-deserved acclaimed credentials, so it is hard to imagine why Justin Kurzel's Scottish Play seems so dull and tired. Does the curse of the title apply only to performance on the actual boards of a stage, or does it apply to any performance? Because maybe that might explain why one of the bard's greatest tragedies comes across as flat and boring. Perhaps some forgetful novice mentioned the original title in passing, innocently dooming the entire production to best forgotten monotony. The only service that this version of Macbeth can do for the world is to, perhaps, introduce those who knew nothing of Shakespeare to his work, because, otherwise, it is simply a bad though brave attempt.Fassbinder and Considine, in particular, seem to be in a constant state of near exhaustion, much as if they had come rushing in from their real jobs to give their best effort after a hard day's work somewhere else. The choice to have them constantly mumble their way through diction that is provenly brilliant lies with the director and that choice is a shame. Its effect robs the audience of the essential progression of Macbeth from once trusted ally to embittered and murderous traitor, not to mention the later necessity to appear completely possessed by his own megalomaniacal arrogance. In fact, Kurzel's effort seems to have fallen victim to the current popularity of zombies, so lifeless and empty as the main characters appear. Cotillard's portrayal is so unsympathetic that the horrible dark sadness of Lady Macbeth's complete mental decline comes across as merely a slight variation from an original selfish airheadedness. Here, again, the responsibility lies with the director to inspire and monitor the performance of his actors so that the audience becomes aware of the role and its place in the plot. Instead, the only sadness of Cotillard's performance lies in its lack of credibility. One could well imagine that her very first reading of every scene happened the night before the next day's filming.The relief in the film's duration lies in the competent and robust performances of supporting cast members, such as Thewlis, David Heyman and Sean Harris, to mention just a few. By comparison, it is discomforting to witness the waste of the talent and skills of Michael Fassbinder (consider his performance as Bobby Sands) and of Paddy Considine (consider any other role he's ever played) by reducing their roles to those of passionless mumblers.While it is obvious that actors reprising such roles as the main characters here are tasked with will by necessity work to avoid turning in a performance copied from a previous actor's work, Fassbender and Cotillard could have done themselves a service by paying a little more attention to both Polanski's and Orson Welles' versions of the same material. Then again, those versions are the work of directors whose prior careers show ample evidence of a brilliant originality that Justin Kurzel has yet to present.I would suggest waiting for the DVD or other subsequent non-cinema version, to use as part of a Macbeth marathon. By itself, it's just a brave attempt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film with a summary-plot. To be fair to it, one has to say that it took someone of the stature of Shakespeare to raise this story above its folklore background and into well-known tragedies. But come to treatment in film there is little to pen out from worriers mumbling one-liners,Star Wars styled witches, frozen silent terrain, blood, and more of it. In case you don't follow, let alone stomach, the gritty action, they continually reverted to extra-slow motion, CSI-style sliced scenes - but in swords and daggers instead of bullet, and loud bangs and screams. A blooded warrior lifted up, his boyish-blooded face zoomed out from the crowded scene then the camera wonders off lazily to other parts of the scene just to return to the warrior while he is being butchered. The result is wasted effort of very talented actors and actresses and the good intention of dazzling cinematography. The result an unconvincing hodgepodge of tricks and tropes that washes out quickly like those witches that pop in just to fade out in the desolate prairies. Call it the Curse of Macbeth!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MacBeth mumbles and stares off into middle distance for nearly 2 hours.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Shakespeare wrote his plays, he was writing for crowds of restless commoners who craved entertainment. He wrote captivating, expressive poetry for colorful characters to speak in telling magnificent and moving stories. Unfortunately, Hollywood directors have entered a new era of movie making where excessive lip movement or speaking above a mumble is out of style. Anyone who has seen the Mockingjay Trilogy will know what I mean. The words being mumbled seem to be incidental to the opportunity to film long lingering stares, someone standing in a field being wistful, a shot of horses grazing, curtains blowing in the wind, someone standing on a hillside being wistful. Meanwhile, time is passing, the audience is waiting for a story to be told but we are faced with more and more self indulgent cinematography. Everything that happens in this movie happens very, very slowly. Shakespeare didn't need clever cameramen, nor did he see any theatrical value in ten minutes of silent pondering.To make the experience even less pleasant, the sound track is someone playing a cello with only one string. When I say "playing" I mean whining like a petulant child, an unending drone that expresses nothing. The sound track is awful. As for the witches, an integral element in the story of MacBeth, they were about as interesting as suburban Wiccans at a baby shower. Once again, mumbled words through barely moving lips on expressionless faces made them seem more bored than chilling as they should be. If you want to see MacBeth, try one of the versions that came before this silly attempt to be clever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most uninvolving movies i have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Macbeth" (2015) is a shockingly uninvolving movie. Given the A list cast, some nice movie craftsmanship here and there and some nice settings, this movie is beyond boring. If there weren't short synopsis in the beginning, i probably wouldn't understand what was going on at all. The story here, based on well known material (but honestly not for me, i haven't read it nor heard about it much), is not the worst thing in "Macbeth" - it is the screenplay (which i don't know if is accurate to the material) which lacks anything that would resemble to interesting movie. Dialogs (or more like monologues) were highly uninvolving, and this movie at running time 1 h 45 min. is very, very, very (and did i say VERY) slow moving - it drags like hell. I somehow managed to sit though this mess in like 4 or 5 days, watching it like max 15-20 min. a day and hoping to see something that resembles a movie, but unfortunately it wasn't here.Overall, "Macbeth" was a shocking experience for me. This movie should be used as a torture devise for those who don't read reviews which says "STAY AWAY FROM THIS STUFF!". You have been warned.</fullReview>

Iambic pentameter does not sound right when spoken with a heavy Scottish borough. While I do not expect the actors to sound like Scotty on Star Trek, I found it almost unbearable to listen to. The assonance, couplets, and alliteration gets lost and you go from "So foul and fair a day I have not seen", to "sue fool un faraday I hana see".What happened to the Porter scene?

		<shortDescription>Hugely disappointing -- for anyone who cares at all about Shakespeare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all the really good, not to say rave reviews of this film I, who, like countless millions, think Shakespeare was a marvellous writer, was really looking forward to seeing it. My disappointment was total. Let me say first what I have no problem with. I have no problem with the fact that they obviously had only a small budget. The scenes were almost all shot outdoors, on Rannoch Moor or somewhere similar, in the mist. The costumes were fairly cheap, raggedy looking things, but why not? We are talking about mediaeval barbarians, and Scottish ones at that (no offence intended). I do not even have a problem with them pulling the play around a lot, chopping it up a bit and re-stitching it, provided they keep some sort of sensible narrative going. I do not really have a problem with them adding an extra scene, character, or line here or there, provided they keep the sense going. No, what ruined the film for me, made it very painful to watch from almost the outset and unremittingly thereafter, and what required of me an iron resolution to see the debacle to the end ? which I needed to do if I was going to write a review ? was the appalling handling, most particularly by the two lead actors, of Shakespeare's lines. Almost all the time Fassbender and Cotillard appeared to have little or no understanding of what the lines actually meant. She delivered most of the lines in a hushed, sibilant whisper, he in an uninvolved monotone. I do not ask that they should perform like Laurence Olivier or some such, but at least they could bring some inflections to the lines, bring out the meaning and make them interesting. These two seemed to have no intention behind their sotto voce recitation other than to get to the end of the sentence as quickly as possible. The fact that there was scope for some decent speaking should have been demonstrated to them so clearly by the excellent performance of their colleague, David Thewlis as Duncan. There is a man who, with his theatrical training, knows exactly how to handle Shakespeare, whether on stage or, as here, in front of the cameras. There were also one or two good performances in smaller parts, particularly from some genuinely Scottish persons, including an elderly actor, whose name I cannot give because I never discovered what the name of his character was. The long and the short of it is that your wonderful film stars are quite hopeless at speaking Shakespeare, particularly if they need, for artistic reasons, to speak quietly. They have not had any training in supporting the voice when speaking quietly, so that it comes out as a low growl, a whisper or a hiss, or a mixture of all three. This was what put me off right at the beginning, the Lady hissing and shushing through lines, which were virtually unintelligible. You get the same sort of thing in the world of music, where pop singers need all manner of electronic support as they alternate between whispering and screaming. A good example of what happens if you try to sing when you do not know how to support the voice was given by Anne Hathaway in the film of Les Miserables. How she could have received any praise for this effort, as opposed to her dramatic scenes, quite baffles me. The last part of her pathetic solo (pathetic in both senses) was no more than a hoarse whisper. She is, of course, not to be blamed for this, as long as neither she nor anyone else thinks of her as a singer. So, with the two lead performances flat as a pancake and largely unintelligible, how can I give the film any stars at all?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Justin Kurzel's adaptation of the Scottish play features interesting visuals and fine performances. The movie captures some striking images, with mist-draped moors and battlefields soaked in a nightmarish red light. It does "look good" in the simplest, most earnest meaning of the phrase, although it lacks the exquisite movement and composition of Kurosawa's Throne of Blood and Ran or the ingenious way Orson Welles' Othello played with architecture.Fassbender is forceful and charismatic - a strong turn with moments of sheer brilliance, like the mirthless, desperate laughter he delivers when uttering the line I put in the review's title. Cotillard is powerful as long as her Lady is ruthless and manipulative, but gets sidelined when she spirals into madness. Harris and Considine are excellent in supporting roles.For the standard of cinematic adaptations of the Bard I would call this moderately faithful, but there are a few dubious choices. Here Malcolm flees to England after discovering a still bloody Macbeth next to Duncan's corpse, which reflects very poorly on him and makes little sense (why would the Thane spare him at this point?). Macbeth's last stand also feels too much "tragic hero" and not enough "villain protagonist"; he essentially commits suicide and is given a curiously dignified ending. It is true that, in spite of his deeds, Macbeth is meant to engage, to an extent, our sympathy... but he is not supposed to be Brutus.Macbeth and his wife losing a child (the movie opens with his funeral), on the other hand, is a reasonable interpretation of the source material - see the Lady's "I have given suck, and know" (1.7).As far as Shakespeare on the big screen goes, this is, overall, a respectable effort. If in the future Kurzel will handle other plays, they will be worth watching.7/10</fullReview>

Did anyone else feel that this painful tripe was so transparent in it's futile attempt to be 'trendy' and deeply significant? Artistically, (and I use that word loosely), it was a mismatch of sound and vision - from the silly pretend blood daubing virtually every male forehead, to the mistake of purchasing too much quilted material by the costume department. On a plus side, it would make a great stomping ground for male grooming products. The ultra close-ups of a male beard actually growing were unsurpassed.Throw a couple more shrimps into the cauldron, Bruce.</fullReview>

Evidentally Kow-Towing to the sound and fury of the ANONYMOUS crowd, these movie-producing fat cats should have their pants sued off by Bill's heirs for copyright infringement. Not only do these MERCHANTS OF VENICE appropriate Bill's title, but the script for this flick is stolen in one fell swoop, virtually line-for-line from what Bill wrote for his Globe Theatre in London a few years back. But I suppose what's done is done. However, if you have significant cataracts, DO NOT TRY TO SEE THIS FLICK, because you won't be able to! Apparently to save on the budget required to film MACBETH on director Roman Polanski's scale, most all of this latest film of that name takes place in a murky haze which perfectly captures the heartbreak of cataracts. If you already suffer from this tragic condition, watching this MACBETH through your set of double cataracts won't be any easier that trying to perceive it from behind Niagara Falls! The Weinsteins also skimp on castles, resorting to tents for the first half of this story. Most who remember Polanski's version will be stunned to hear that there's not one naked witch in sight here, as the union scale for nude actresses was far beyond the scope of this low-budget effort. Though 99% of Bill's dialogue is mumbled incoherently here (no doubt the Weinsteins skimped on microphones, as well), we do learn that "The Thane of Fife had a wife," who doubtless was as burned up as anyone else over this MACBETH!</fullReview>

One is that he will be Thane of Cawdor and another is that he will be King of Scotland. When he is elevated to Thane of Cawdor he starts to think that their predictions have some merit. Encouraged by Lady MacBeth he murders the current King, Duncan, and is made the new King. This power emboldens him, resulting in a murderous purging of the Kingdom of anyone who may be a threat to him. Meanwhile the opposition forces are beginning to gather...A good adaptation of the classic play. Dark, haunting and reasonably fast-paced - Hardly the recitals that sometimes pass for Shakespeare-based movies. Good production values too.Great work by Michael Fassbender in the lead role. Solid support from Marion Cotillard as Lady MacBeth, Sean HArris as Macduff, PAddy Considine as Banquo and David Thewless as Duncan. Elizabeth Debicki also appears, as Lady Macduff, but does not have much screen time.On the negative side, there is an element of style over substance to the movie. The director tries too hard to be "arty" - jarring editing, slow motion shots, odd settings - and this does detract from the quality of the movie a bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brutal and beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Justin Kurzel's Macbeth is ferocious. The film has things to say about the play, and it says them with such insight that Shakespeare's Macbeth ? a work so famous its mere nickname has a dedicated Wikipedia page ? is once again made unpredictable and raw.The film is faithful to the Scottish Play from first to last, but this is no straightforward adaptation. Instead, the movie interprets the work and does so beautifully, not bending or construing the original narrative, but rather taking up the uncertainties and hints already present in the play and weaving them together into a compelling and persuasive modern take on a much-told story: Macbeth, an 11th century nobleman, meets three witches who predict that he will become king of Scotland. Spurred on by his wife, Macbeth assassinates the current monarch and then crumbles under the psychological cost of murder.But Shakespeare's tragedy itself is full of ambiguity and open questions, not the least of which is the murder itself. The witches have proved themselves to be reliable, so it is certain that one day Macbeth will rule. Then why the urgency to kill the king and 'catch the nearest way'? The film succeeds due to the visceral, emotionally stirring explanations that it offers. A brief line in the play alludes to Lady Macbeth having once had a child, and boldly, the movie begins with the funeral of the infant in question. Fassbender and Cotillard proceed to give wonderful performances as a couple who still love one another, but are struggling to fill the emptiness that has arisen between them. There is a new-found poignancy in Lady Macbeth's assertion that she feels 'now the future in the instant'. These are more than ruthless villains driven by ambition ? they are people who can see no other future, and who are fighting for meaning in a life 'signifying nothing'.And then there is war, ravaging Scotland, and Macbeth the soldier, forced to kill. There are echoes of Apocalypse Now in the film's treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, and the way humans respond to violence. 'I wept,' says Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now. 'I wanted to tear my teeth out? and then I realised? my God? the genius of it!' A similar idea is palpable in the way Fassbender's Macbeth is simultaneously wounded and enraptured by his own acts of brutality.Shakespeare's Macbeth, like one of its most famous lines, is full of 'sound and fury'. To this verbal and thematic intensity Kurzel adds striking cinematography and gorgeous visuals, themselves smacking of significance. This is, however, both a strong point and a problem. The movie overwhelms. The images complement the dialogue for the most part, but there are times when script and visuals both seem so deserving of attention they distract from one another ? and before one has time to consider either, the movie has moved on. The pacing is relentless. There are no pauses in the action, and hardly any shifts in the mood. The joking porter of the original play, coming on stage to provide the audience with a welcome break, has been cut out completely.Had the film let its images linger on screen for a little longer, and taken things a little slower, it might have been less intellectually and emotionally exhausting. As it stands, it does not allow enough time for one to consider the ideas it puts forward, which is a shame, precisely because the insights it delivers are so worthy of consideration. Ultimately though, Macbeth is a brutal and beautiful movie with a persuasive point of view, and two exceptional lead actors. Its atmosphere lingers, long after the final credits stop rolling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This version of the play represents opportunity squandered. An excellent cast is wasted on this vision of the play that takes too many liberties with the source material: rearranging scenes, dropping characters, and perhaps trying to be too historically accurate to the setting rather than the stage production. While the Scottish Play isn't exactly a yuk-fest comedy, the director has wrung every last drop of levity out of the script, leaving it unnecessarily bleak: where's the porter, cursing as he stumbles out of bed to answer the midnight knock? Where's the badinage between Lady Macduff and her son before the murderers descend? Where's the exchange between Malcom and Macduff, when the prince tests Macduff's loyalties? And where in the heck is Donaldbain? My most strident complaint, expressed by others here on the review board, too, is the delivery of the lines. The intensity and emotion are there, thanks to a superb set f actors, but sometimes the script requires volume (and not just during the slow-mo battle scenes. Every single line in this thing is delivered like a couple having a lover's spat in a library: fierce whispers and swiveling eyeballs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Macbeth, great soldier with PTSD.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this on DVD from my public library. My wife chose to NOT see it, not her kind of movie. It is helpful to view the DVD "extra" first where the director and the actors discuss their approach. And basically it is presenting Macbeth as a man suffering from PTSD after all the wars, and this is responsible for his actions. He even says "My head is full of scorpions."It is also helpful to view it with subtitles on, otherwise much of the dialog is difficult to comprehend, especially with the language usage it was written in.Macbeth is a Thane, a landowner under the sanction of the King of Scotland. He is also a great soldier and given credit for winning the King's battles in the Scottish wars. But he is confronted by three witches who say he will become King.Michael Fassbender is really good as Macbeth, so consumed with the idea of becoming King that he will stop at nothing. And his first act is to murder the King at night and blame it on those assigned to guard him. Equally good is Marion Cotillard (one of my very favorites) as Lady Macbeth who even more than Macbeth himself seemed consumed by the idea of the power that come with all that.I will admit that I am not a fan of Shakespeare and I have not seen any other adaptations of Macbeth, but I enjoyed this one, it is very nicely acted and filmed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Camera is the Star Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like Shakespeare, or Macbeth, be warned: this is not that. This is a visually stunning film, with a wonderful score, a number of exquisitely choreographed scenes, some stunning acting by minor characters, tremendous witches, haunting scenery, some moments of brilliance, lacklustre performances by Lady Macbeth and Macbeth, and total (and annoying) inconsistency of accents and setting. There's a wondrous sex scene early on that was not followed through on later, when we needed it again on steroids; the madness is silly and everything is too slow; yet the surreal, colourized imagery, with its strong hints of IS and desert warfare and suicide bombers gone mad, is arresting. Too bad it wasn't more consistent. The camera is smarter than the actors or the script here. The madness in general is unanchored and a bit banal, and Fassbender only looks in control when whacking. He smiles too much, and has never heard that there is such a thing as poetry, or that this is that. Still, Banquo and MacDuff are tremendous. There are a couple of really annoying things, though. First, there's an attempt to make every interpretation new, even when it's a terrible, non-narrative stretch of disbelief, so stretched that it snaps. Lady Macbeth outing her spot looks like play acting, for example. I laughed out loud, it was so pop psychology. Nonetheless, for all its missed beats, what it hinted at and failed at, is magnificent, but, really, it's too much to ask for a production of Shakespeare in a non-poetic age to be be poetic, but without poetry Shakespeare makes no sense. This doesn't. The good stuff is good, though. Go for Banquo and the photography and the witches and for what might have been if the whole thing had been given to the camera crew early on. Moments of brilliance are rare enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a noble Thane in Scotland, who is told by three witches that he will become the king of Scotland. He embarks on a journey to make the prophecy come true, shedding tears and blood along the way.I have to say this is a very good adaptation of Macbeth. The lines are original Shakespearean lines, delivered with conviction by Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard, who are both interestingly not Scottish or even British. The film emanates intensity throughout, because of the intended battle scene at the beginning, followed by the gripping delivery of the plot. The final scene is in an environment of reddish dust, making it so intense and stylish. I enjoyed watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best thing about this movie is the music. It brought a great enthusiasm to me while trying hard to stay focus with its rather slow pace. I thought this movie would be depicted in an epic way like Troy or The Lord of the Rings. Well, it turned out to be so theatrical and close to boring. The war scene is made in slow motion, made me remember that part of Kung Fu Hustle. Why did you do this? Is there any particular reason? I expect it to be epic. Because I understand why Kung Fu Hustle did the slow motion, for the movement in Kung Fu is so fast. Maybe they tried to give the audiences a moment to capture every movement better.I really didn't get the conversation between King Duncan and his staff while Macbeth and the other are busy killing in the field. Honestly, I haven't read Macbeth yet. So I need to check the internet for better explanation, especially why Macbeth is so obsessed in becoming a king while he knows that Duncan is a kind-hearted king. But, once again, thank you so much for the music. It is superb, as well as the casts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mmm....Polanski has ruined me for any other adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I'm off to the RSC in Stratford upon Avon to see "Hamlet" this week, so I have been getting myself in the mood for the Bard by watching adaptations of his plays. My friend put this on and was raving about how good it is, but I'm afraid I found it underwhelming. Visually very monochromatic, costumes too "samey" and did not really like the nod to "Braveheart" with the facepaint. Too many slow motion scenes. HUGE sections of dialogue missed out and what was there was often mumbled, difficult to follow. I have no problem with the Scottish accent but this was hard work. Found it disappointing, the witches didn't do it for me, neither did Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. And the "Burnam" wood bit was not what I expected at all, my friend liked it because the ASHES come to Dunsinane, and I suppose that is a new twist, but it wasn't for me. Ah well, I wanted to like it, will try to sit through it a second time, but not convinced, I found it dull. I think that Roman Polanski's 1971 version has ruined me for any other adaptation of this play, I love that version and put it on straight after sitting through the 2015 one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragedy without the drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not a bad movie at all, beautifully shot and acted, and the filmmakers' studies in Shakespeare's play have led to many interesting choices, such as exploiting, for instance, Freud's old idea that the tragedy of the Macbeths derive from their childlessness. This idea is carried through with great consistency; the child Macbeth loses in the opening of the film is directly linked to the destruction of the Macduffs who are likewise burnt in Kurzel's film. The dialogue has been taken apart and put together in interesting ways, such as King Duncan's fatal announcement of his son's succession which has been moved to the Dunsinane party while the king is drunk. The Weird Sisters are the kindest witches in the history of the play. Rather than trick the protagonist into mischief, they inform him, with much sympathy, about his unalterable fate. A lot of the dialogue is missing, though, and for a reason. Fassbender's Macbeth suffers from a post-traumatic stress disorder which renders him emotionally numb. In Kurzel's film, Macbeth starts out at the point at which Shakespeare only lets him arrive in Act III: "I am in blood/ Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more/ Returning were as tedious as go o'er". This means no deliberations or vacillations before the murder of Duncan, no fear of reprisals, no feelings ? which, by the way, makes his wife's reproach, "Why do you make such faces?" in the Banquet Scene seem out of place, for Fassbender makes no faces at all; he is dead pan for the duration of the film and seems to be courting his own destruction near the end. This, I think, is where the film fails as a version of Shakespeare's "Macbeth." Since it starts with the real tragedy, the loss of Young Macbeth (who also haunts Lady Macbeth's Sleepwalking Scene), the film has nowhere to go. Lastly, it irked me a bit that the soliloquies were not done in voice-overs, for everything else fails to work on film, methinks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superficial Treatment of a Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film adaptation of "Macbeth" failed to engage due to the overwhelming understatement in Shakespeare's text. The actors mumbled their way through Shakespeare's brilliant verse and imagery. And the cut-and-paste treatment of the play truncated the great speeches and scenes. This was a Cliff's Notes version of "Macbeth." On the positive side, there was some great location filming with isolated, barren landscapes that evoked the true sense of medieval Scotland. But the restrained performances of the leads played by Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard made the film an exercise in overly subtle responses to a concatenation of violence. Where was the emotional life in this brutally violently narrative of history? Yet another curious artistic decision was the treatment of the supernatural. Once again, the filmmakers downplayed Macbeth's interaction with the Weird Sisters, as well as the banquet scene where Macbeth is visited by the Ghost of Banquo. It was as if the director was afraid that any histrionics would destroy the credibility of the character relationships.Viewers would be advised to revisit the acclaimed film version of "Macbeth," as directed by Roman Polanski in 1971. The artistic choices were broader and more creative, and Polanski had a way of making everything clear from Macbeth's visit to the witches to the botched assassination of Duncan to the descent into madness of the two protagonists. The more recent film never delved into the next to discover Shakespeare's profound insights into greed, power, and political assassination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Blunder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie MacBeth (2015) was an unintentional blunder by director Justin Kurzel, who has previously directed The Snowtown Murders and a short by the name of Blue Tongue, and featuring the stars Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard, and Jack Madigan. Although the ratings were favorable, with an average 7.1 on IMDb and respectable 71 on Metascore, there was a single intentional element that utterly ruined the film for me.One of the most notable things about the film were a number of beautifully framed, and shot, scenes of both Scotland and England ranging from Bamburgh Castle to the Isle of Skye. For all of the well shot scenes in the movie, of which there are many, and the emotionally charged acting, the film greatly failed to live up-to my expectations in one of the most key aspects of any film, the script.Although Shakespeare's MacBeth was undoubtedly a well-constructed play in it's own time, the original text of the play cannot, in many cases, hold the attention of a modern audience that isn't specifically going to the film to watch the play. Much of the sentence structure and wording makes very little sense unless read side-by-side with a modern translation/interpretation of what Shakespeare intends for the viewer to understand.This shortcoming of the play's text is quite obviously translated to the screen. On my first viewing, where I abandoned the film halfway through, I was almost entirely unable to understand the vast majority of the dialogue being spoken as it was, as far as I am able to tell, almost a direct reading of the original play in many scenes. Thankfully the acting and editing, along with some prior knowledge of the story, allowed me to somewhat follow along until the frustration from being unable to understand the dialogue itself forced me to stop the film.Though the dialogue was incomprehensible in many parts, the movie made great use of long periods of the type of silence where there is still background music/noise, but where there is no dialogue. The main motivation to use these periods of silence, in my opinion, is due to the fact that the actions of the actors truly speak louder than anything they could have said. One scene in particular begins as MacBeth slowly walks towards the sleeping King with the inferred intent to kill. When MacBeth stands over the King and they both stare at each other, like they both know and accept the hand fate is about to deal, represents one of the best moments of silence in the film. The silence manages to convey the thoughts of each character, and the progression of the story, without a single word. If you were to continue watching the scene, even more examples of how the film manages to show so much emotion through a montage of shots, echoing the early Russian montage experiments, including MacBeth furiously stabbing the King, MacBeth's wife praying, and spooked horses.In conclusion, this movie was well made, has beautiful shots, good acting, a well-known story, and one of the worst scripts I've ever had to endure. I do not recommend watching this film, unless you're a masochist or a fan of Shakespeare, and I will personally never watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Macbeth 2015</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this is not quite as good as Roman Polanski's 1971 version, it's definitely worth watching.The acting is excellent. The right people were chosen for the roles, especially Sean Harris who is the ideal Macduff. Marion Cotillard gives us a superb performance (perhaps best ever as Lady Macbeth). Michael Fassbender does a credible job as Macbeth. One major weakness is the cinematography, which was poor by times. There is lack of a detailed background in many scenes. During the final fight between Macbeth and Macduff we just see a reddish fog and some vague figures in the background. And where was the Great Birnam Wood? Some scenes were filmed in better locations, so there is no real reason they could not have used some of these places background for the "empty background" scenes. Visually Polanski's classic is much better.That being said, overall this version of Macbeth is very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>lot of familiar, but perhaps not enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the Scottish play, so I was really looking forward to Macbeth. Besides A Midsummer's Night's Dream (both live and big screen versions), Romeo and Juliet (courtesy of Baz Luhrman, and its homages) and the small part of Julius Caesar we covered for my GCSE, my exposure to Shakespeare is embarrassingly limited. The trailer I saw one week earlier (before the superb "The 33") was so promising. Unfortunately it quickly became obvious why Macbeth is not as frequently revisited in the theatre as other more familiar Shakespeare plays. The language was just too inaccessible and despite the action promised by the trailer and the 18 certificate in Malaysia (Why? The Hunger Games has more graphic violence) it was spread too thinly amongst the monologues. One of my ESL friends fell asleep, the other could follow along me easily than me thanks to the Chinese and Malay-language subtitles we get in Malaysia. Sure, Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard and the Scottish landscape all looked incredible. But for the 2015 audience it would have been appropriate to reinforce the story with visuals (think Speed Racer, but maybe toned down a bit). To be fair, MacBeth did channel the battle scenes of 300 (and Braveheart), and elements of John Wool or other Asian kung fu epics with red smoke and silhouette, (and perhaps unintentionally, Star Wars and the Hunger Games -Princess Leia and Effie Trinket through Lady MacBeth's hair and makeup, and Game of Thrones ? did anyone else things the wyrd sisters were Craster's wives?) but it wasn't enough. Perhaps Marion Cotillard is too nice a person for the role, but unfortunately her performance was overshadowed by her compatriots much more moving performance I saw the week before in "The 33".</fullReview>

Apart from being hard to follow Shakespeare's complex phrase formulation, the action is null and the spectator looses the interest quickly. The atmosphere though is very well achieved. The coldness and roughness of the middle age is very well represented. Regardless the initial criticism of the movie approach, the casting and the acting is not too bad. The performance of the actors is realistic and shows their real skill.

		<fullReview>There has been different adaptations for Macbeth, like Akira Kurosawa's "Throne of Blood" or the horror like adaptation of Macbeth by Roman Polanski. This 2015 version by Justin Kurzel leans more towards war, hierarchy and brutality. If your an audience member that enjoy poetry, art and plays you might enjoy this one. But most mainstream audiences might get bored with this one. The theater audiences main complaint was how they try to transition the Shakespeare play exactly. My main gripe was the editing and the transition of the scenes and storytelling. It just felt like a lot of in-depth portion was either missing or rushed at times. The acting in this is good for the most part although the portrayal of Lady Macbeth by Marion Cotillard seems to be off. It's not the actresses fault since she really brought her A game, but it just seemed like she was a bit of a miscast. She just lacked the lethal and ambitious edge and lacked the empowered woman aspects to her character. She just looked feeble throughout the whole thing. I know the director was trying to go with a more artistic direction and the movie is stylish and the cinematography near the end is pretty cool. But the movie itself as a whole just wasn't all that satisfying.6.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While, this movie might have the sound and fury, there were some things that needed a little more work. Despite that, the movie was still alright</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As usual with well-known stories like Macbeth, there are an absurd number of ways, this classic play can be portrayed. While, the play will always be timeless, the adaption of that play into movie form might not. Sadly, I don't see it, with this film. While, this movie is nowhere near as good as director Orson Welles' 1948's version or even Akira Kurosawa retelling of the story in 1957's Throne of Blood. Director Justin Kurzel's version of Macbeth was still beautiful, haunting, and bloody enough for a well-made adaptation of the William Shakespeare's 1606 classic tale of betrayal. I have to rank it as the third best adaption of the bard's original text; just somewhat beating out, Director Roman Polanski's 1971's version. Although the play is not an accurate portrait of the real life, historical king of Scotland since William Shakespeare took a lot of liberties with the source material, 'Holinshead's Chronicles', a best-selling popular history book of the time. Still, Shakespeare's epic tale of madness being retold here, was faithful enough to the play, to gain a lot of critics support, but not accuracy enough for historians. Like the original play, 2015's Macbeth tells the story of a man, Macbeth (Michael Fassfender) being consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his wife, Lady Macbeth (Marion Cotillard) to murders his cousin king, Duncan (David Thewlis) and takes the throne for himself. As he grows more powerful, his personality become more and more paranoid and cruel, until the day, he alienated all those supporters that help him, gain power, forcing their hand into yet another betrayal. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, unlike other critics that praise the acting in this film. I have to say, for me, it was below average. Don't get me wrong, Michael Fassbender really shine in the gory action scenes, but despite that, I really didn't like, his mostly monotone reading of the lines. He really didn't do a good job, dramatize of the damaging physical and psychological effects of Macbeth that well. If anything, he seem cold and distance from the beginning as if a non-human, robot than a straight up good guy turn bad. He sounds like dull audio book, most of the time. I was really hoping for more an in depth emotional turn. A good example is how you don't see, much of his guilt, during the aftermath of killing his own King and friends. In my opinion, Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth was a better actor here, than Fassbender. At least, she shows more a little more emotional than her couther-part. One thing, that I like about her, here is that, her French accent wasn't so thin. You can barely, hear it. However, like the rest of the cast, she was a bit boring at certain scenes. Don't get me wrong, I love the use of Old English, being spoken here; I just don't like, how nearly all of the characters actors didn't put any emotional to it. Just think, if they did! You would have somebody in the level of a 'Laurence Olivier' here. Another thing, that I didn't like, about the film is the pacing. Some parts, really takes forever, to get anywhere. Then other parts, are just way too quick. It's a bit uneven. I also didn't like how the film cut everything related to comic relief, including the porter at the gate and large chunks of the Witches' dialogue. The movie wouldn't be, so gloomy to watch, if they kept those. While, it sounds like I found the movie to meh. There were some parts, I did like; I like that the film was filmed on location in the Scottish Highlands. Every location was well-shot. The add-on effects of slow motion, blood &amp; gore, and the spooky fog makes it seem so eerily. I also love the film uses carefully-researched 11th-century costumes for this film. This movie's look reminded me, of a mixer of 2010's HBO TV Series 'Game of Thrones', 2004's film, King Arthur and 1996's film, Braveheart, in how vicious, medieval times were. Another thing I like, is how they got mostly Scottish actors; to performed here. It adds to the feel of the film. I also love, the realistic portrayal of the supernatural here. I love how the three witches, are just three widows of a recent battle. I love how Macbeth has Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, which gives a new context to his visions. Another thing is how I love about the film is how, they kept some things, the same as the play. The twist that William Shakespeare has always establish, here in the story will always be wonderful. Overall: While, there were some flaws, 2015's Macbeth is still epic and cinematic, enough to be worth seeing, if you're a huge Shakespeare fan. So check it out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Blood Soaked Tapestry of Macbeth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Fassbender can play any role you give him. Honest. 'Macbeth' is just further proof of that. Based on Shakespeare's play of the same name, 'Macbeth' is the tale of a man consumed by greed and power who murders his own king so that he can claim the throne for himself.'Macbeth' is not my type of film and yet I found myself won over, in spite of its notable pacing issues which drastically slow the film down in its second act. It's the high calibre of acting that works so well here. Fassbender consumes himself in the role and equally impressive is Marion Cotillard who plays his wife. Watching them hatch their plot and crumble when it fails is riveting. There are even a couple of bloody battles that bookend the film and for my money are worth the price of admission alone.Still I haven't mentioned the powerful poetic dialogue. Yes it is Shakespearean dialect and by its very nature is hard to understand and grasp at times. But in a strange way that makes it all the more interesting to watch and given time it grows on you and you come to appreciate the film for everything that it does right. Is this a faithful adaptation? Having had no previous knowledge about the play I could not say. Yet I know it's a fine and well-crafted film.'Macbeth' is a dark tale and as such the score in the film reflects that. Jed Kurzel brings a sad and symbolic soundtrack that signifies what power does to men and how it turns what was once good and pure into evil. From a visual standpoint 'Macbeth' is a sure fire winner. It possesses a cinematic beauty to it, one that the medium of television would be unable to bring forward.'Macbeth' is a poignant tale of a good man gone evil. If the dialogue is hard to understand at times and the pacing brings up issues it rarely matters; because the film is far often than not engrossing and Fassbender does justice to the source material. All Hail Macbeth!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MacBeth is a known tale, even though I've never read it, which instead of degrading the film through pre-existing knowledge, actually surprisingly enhances it. It's dark, gory and pretty artsy as well, which adds to this excellent adaptation of a Shakespeare classic. If there was one thing negative to point out it is that the middle act does take sometime to get over and a few scenes which feature are pretty unnecessary. But with that said, the beginning and end are truly amazing and heart racing. Whilst adapting Shakespeare novels now seems overdone and clichéd l, this is an essential retelling that will go down as a classic. There is not too much to fault with this version and that's what makes it truly remarkable.</fullReview>

A lot of people have complained about her accent - but she was the only major character whose voice was so clear that I could follow everything she said. Michael Fassbender's was very effective as the deranged king. I only wish I could have understood more of his conversations. Shakespeare does not have to be done like this. I have seen several films of his plays where I could follow the dialogue as well as any other film.

		<fullReview>MACBETH is one of my very favourite Shakespeare plays. It has all of the gruesome violence and tragic outcomes that one expects from a Shakespeare tragedy, and there are not one but two outstanding movie adaptations of the play that have gone down in history as classics (Kurosawa's THRONE OF BLOOD and Polanski's MACBETH). The good thing about Shakespeare is that he always lends himself well to new adaptations of his work, so I was intrigued by this new, low key effort.I shouldn't have bothered. As directed by SNOWTOWN's Justin Kurzel, MACBETH is a miserable viewing experience and one of the worst Shakespeare adaptations I've had the misfortune to sit through. It's an incessantly arty production in which Kurzel seems to be constantly trying to capture the perfect shot. His low key and sombre direction worked with the horrifying SNOWTOWN, but on MACBETH he feels completely out of his depth, missing the gravitas of the play and the genuine drama and horror of many of the scenes.The opening battle sequence is one of the worst filmed I've witnessed. Kurzel has got hold of one of those irritating ultra slow-motion cameras and uses it copiously, much like those annoying BBC cameramen at Wimbledon. The battle is a disjointed, badly-edited mass of random acts of violence and participants who look like they're on the highlights reel of a rugby match. It's awful, pretentiously awful stuff, and I very nearly switched off at that point.I stuck around to see typically strong performances from Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard negated by the decision to have them mumble their dialogue, leaving the viewer straining throughout to make out just what they're saying. The casting director has done a sterling job of assembling a fine squad of actors so it's a pity they're all wasted in this incessantly dull and unlikeable film. Kurzel's attempts to recreate mass battles of the likes of BRAVEHEART (a notable influence) on a tiny budget are also ill advised, leaving MACBETH looking like nothing more than a high school play. My advice? Stick with one of those two versions of the story I mentioned earlier in this review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The play's the thing but not here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the film finished I asked myself where was Shakespeare's Macbeth as the text had been gutted and the main actors delivering the lines in a flat monotone distilling any passion and energy.Director Justin Kurzel has taken a graphic novel approach in this blood thirsty play, it is less 300 but more Valhalla Rising as Scandinavian moodiness is over produced.The film starts off promisingly as it sets out its stall with an exciting battle sequence that calls to mind Braveheart but at a lower budget, drawing in the crowd who may not normally take to the play but the Bard's words never arrive and when they do, the actors seemed to be embarrassed by it.There are some nice visual touches and interpretative flair but the finished product does not feel like Shakespeare's Macbeth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I simply don't have the words to describe the depths of pretentiousness and sheer purposeless-weirdness that this movie sinks to.EVERY interaction between EVERY character in EVERY scene is made into a SENSUAL act. Macbeth meets the witches? Let's make it SENSUAL, and have one of the witches PUT HER ARMS AROUND MACBETH AND SPEAK TO HIM WITH HER FACE THREE INCHES FROM HIS AS IF THEY'RE FREAKING PASSIONATE LOVERS! (This was probably the most bizarre bit of direction given by J Kurzel in a movie full of bizarre bits of direction.) Macbeth murders Duncan? Oh yeah, let's make it SENSUAL. Oh and good luck understanding any of the mumble-whispered dialog. I guess to have the actors at the volume people normally speak at in conversation wouldn't be SENSUAL enough. Oy.Justin Kurzel, my god, what in the world were you thinking? If you are even one percent as pretentious as your movies would lead me to believe you are...wow.As for Michael Fassbender - loved him in the Steve Jobs Biopic but I don't know if I'll ever be able to take him seriously again after seeing this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful cinematography, mediocre everything else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally got around to watching this Amazon and StudioCanal produced rendition of one of Shakespeare's most iconic plays. The best way to describe this version - the third I have seen - is as "Shakespeare meets Game of Thrones." Not surprising they took this approach seeing the success of that dark fantasy series. Unfortunately, as with Game of Thrones, what results is something dark, violent, and ultimately less than satisfying.First, this production needs to be applauded just for staying in an appropriately medieval setting, as opposed to all the anachronistic versions floating around out there that move the action to 20th Century Eastern Europe, the Victorian era, or some other inappropriate time period for the subject matter. What is more, this production should be applauded for the wonderful cinematography by Adam Arkapaw. This is a beautifully shot movie that uses the Scottish Highlands to wonderful effect in creating Macbeth's nightmarish reality. Truly excellent work here.Sadly, that is about all good I can say about this interpretation. My first gripe is that Shakespeare's play has been so truncated here that it loses much of its emotional impact. Not only have some key scenes been completely removed, but other sections has been so compressed that at times they just don't make much sense. For example, in this version Macbeth's decline from nobility to regicide is so swift as to be bewildering. Again, even though this is the third interpretation of Macbeth that I have seen, I found myself getting confused at times because the story was jumping around so much.Secondly, the acting is mediocre at best. While Michael Fassbender has shown himself to be a very good actor in other films, here he sleepwalks his way through the story as Macbeth, delivering his lines with all the enthusiasm of someone terribly bored and disinterested in the material he has been given. To call his performance "one note" would be, frankly, giving it too much credit. Then there is Marion Cotillard's Lady Macbeth. Unfortunately for the film, Cotillard lacks the sufficient gravitas to be the scheming shrew who was Lady Macbeth. Adding insult to injury, her role has also been so truncated that it might as well not even be there. Instead of being the impetus for Macbeth's fall from grace, she comes across as little more than an indifferent opportunist who is seen to inexplicably swing from craving power at any cost to being bored and then completely disinterested by subsequent events, something that makes her later suicide something of a non sequitur. I suspect this blah interpretation of such an iconic villainess is due to a politically correct impulse to moderate her character. Whatever the reason, this production is severely hampered by thoroughly lackluster and idle performances from key characters.The last nail in the coffin of this film is the dreadfully slow pacing. I understand that the director was going for a suitably nightmarish approach, but what arrives here is less nightmare and more snooze- fest. Between the droning music and the endless slow motion sequences, I was almost ready to kill Macbeth just to end my suffering. Tone it down, fellas.Take all that, and add is some needless sexual groping and moaning (no doubt to please the GoT crowd) and a clichéd close-up of Macduff vomiting (an odd thing for an experienced soldier to do after seeing some blood), and what you ultimately have in this version is...well, much ado about nothing. You can seek out much better versions of this play (such as Roman Polanski's 1971 version, and even the more recent Patrick Stewart version which is solely marred by its 20th Century setting).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something Awful This Way Comes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to hand it to director Justin Kurzel. It takes a special kind of talent to reduce one of the greatest plays in the English language to the near-incomprehensible mess we see here on the screen.First, I guess, you begin by expunging half of the dialogue. (Who cares about stuff like plot or character motivation or coherence, anyway?) Then, you direct your actors to deliver most of their lines in either breathless whispers or marble-mouthed mumbles. (Since you apparently don't understand Shakespeare's language, why should anyone else?) Then, you make sure that your brother's score continually drones on in the background, competing with what dialogue remains. (Did you hope that lots of strings would disguise the fact that there is no real emotion happening up on the screen?)However -- and this is key! -- now that you're done stomping Shakespeare's verse into the dirt, make sure you throw in a lot of foggy moors, raging fires, moody lighting, slow-motion battles, overhead shots, and hand-held camera moves so that people can be tricked into thinking they are seeing something "artistic" and worthwhile.On paper, this film had so much potential. In actuality, it turned out to be nothing but an abominable waste of time and resources.My advice: Skip this piece of crap and watch Polanski's infinitely superior version instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great but Difficult to Follow Plot and some Great Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Macbeth is based off of the William Shakespeare play under the same title and follows a knight called Macbeth who receives a prophecy that one day he will be king of Scotland. He eventually becomes tired of waiting and sets out to murder the king and succeed him, and ultimately faces both the rewards and consequences for his actions. I love the story of Macbeth. I think that the plot is really good. It's interesting and it could be awesome if done right. Unfortunately I'm not a fan of Shakespeare, or at least how he writes. His stories are interesting, but when you can't understand a single word it makes it hard to truly appreciate how good his plays are. I've been wanting a Shakespeare movie adaptation with more modernized language, and unfortunately this wasn't the one. It keeps the same dialogue as before, and thus I ended up relying almost completely on visuals and the fact that I read the book and had what happened explained to me every two pages. If I hadn't had that I wouldn't have enjoyed this movie at all most likely. The characters are decent. Again, it's hard to understand what their saying, but if you do there's a lot of internal conflict going on, and it is pretty cool actually, particularly in the character of Macbeth. One thing that I especially liked about the movie was the acting. Michael Fassbender was good for the first and third act, but for the second he was phenomenal, especially in a particular scene in a dining room. I knew Fassbender was a good actor, but I've never seen him in any performance where he's knocked it out of the park as well as he did here. Unfortunately he switches right back to just good acting for the third act, but his character goes from confident to scared to a "Well, I made it this far, guess I might as well" kind of character throughout the movie, so he loses that sort of insanity at the end that he pulled off so well. Overall Macbeth is just decent. The plot is great but poorly presented, and Michael Fassbender does a fantastic job for about 1/3 of this movie. He's really the only redeeming quality of this movie, other than the visual aspect, which was quite good too. The first hour is pretty slow too, and it takes a while for the story to pick up. In the end I wouldn't really recommend this movie, but it definitely wasn't bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of Macbeth is brilliant, by far my favorite of Shakespeare's plays. The lines, the dialogue and soliloquies are also top notch. Polanski's Macbeth is one of my favorite films, if not my all time favorite.The cinematography here is amazing. The soundtrack is wonderful (I bought it). The scenes are so beautiful; the action is so awesome, thrilling yet artful. The casting is also very good.All the components are great, all the ingredients are there, but the film is less than the sum of its parts.The biggest flaw is the mumbling and inaudible/unintelligible parts (I watched the film with English subtitles for friends that struggled with Early Modern English), but that's not why the film is merely good. Improve the quality of the speech and it's still less than the sum of its parts.The film is not thrilling, not haunting, not exciting. It's too theatrical. It cannot escape comparisons with Polanski's film, which felt like a psychological horror film.The acting feels theatrical and feels fake - you're watching someone playing a part rather than a king struggling with his thoughts. The delivery of the lines feels like the actors memorized the lines very well, but not for a moment did I feel that these are Medieval-era Scots that actually speak like that.I feel that this could've been a great movie had it had another story altogether. The story of Macbeth, normally a positive, ruined this film's potential, with lines and language that killed the realness of the acting and the story having no surprise to most people. All the ingredients (except the story) were there for a great medieval film instead of yet another Macbeth interpretation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your enjoyment of this particular movie, will rely heavily on a few things. 1. You have to appreciate Shakespeare. 2. You don't mind a slow pace and heavy dialogue and 3. Your familiarity of the Shakespearean language. I'm not trying to scare anyone off. This is an amazingly well shot, well acted and in my humble opinion, one of the best versions of Macbeth put to screen I have ever seen. Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard are the backbone of this film in their roles of Lord and Lady Macbeth, I felt so much, for the almost eternal sadness that seemed to surround them. The visual style of this movie is also very bleak (reflecting the inner turmoil of the peeps on screen), with only a few scenes where there seemed to be color and light. The costumes and scenery fit very well into what I've always considered, a horror story and the themes of grief, emptiness, greed and its destructive nature are all present. My main (really only) complaint is a big one and honestly this prevented me from enjoying what could've been a truly strong movie. The language. Don't get me wrong, I can handle Shakespearean dialog, but it HAS TO BE pronounced properly! I honestly couldn't understand a lot of what was being said. Not because of the words, but because of the way they were said! I don't know if it was because of their accents, but Fassbender especially ate up his dialogue and I had to turn the volume up and pay close attention to catch the details. Maybe the fault lay with Sound Editing. Either way, it spoils what could've been a truly solid movie. I can't recommend this for everyone as I'm certain the average movie watcher is not gonna like this movie. Please don't expect this to be Magneto in 12th Century. But for the more discerning lover of film, even if you aren't familiar with Macbeth (my favorite play of WS BTW), there is so much here to appreciate and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shakespeare is not the easiest material to translate to silver screen, it's quite complicated even for native speaker and the narrative is told mostly on poetry. Luckily for Macbeth, the movie has talented cast and astounding visual to present a tale of treachery. It's fluid in delivery, varied in meaning and the contrast of sultry voice and brutal war game is beautifully appealing.First and foremost, it's a gorgeous display throughout. There are not many movies which shift between styles so easily, the colors look vivid even in the most morbid events. This also works in a continuous narrative, akin to flipping across chapters as the tint alters from dawn till dusk. The view of carnage is also shown in its fullness yet lacking no delicate effort.Michael Fassbender as Macbeth is probably the best lead one could hope for. There are glints of his Spartan time, although he doesn't falter when the movie demands an elegant banter. The acting is definitely different that most, it's an acquired taste as characters tell their pleas with underlying or double meaning. This is certainly not the kind of straight full blown carnage typical war movies would offer.While it has its perks of being artistic, it can be unapproachable even if there's attempt to make it the contrary. The dialogues are expectedly ancient, some words might have different delivery than we have today. Furthermore, the delivery itself is often either too rapid or too quiet, maybe both at the same time. Alas, this can be remedied by investing in subtitles. As it deals with heavy narrative the pace can stutter to make room for admittedly poetic exclamation.Macbeth is certainly vibrant in his vainglory, as his tragic rise is witnessed in grand visual, yet the archaic style might prove repelling for those unaccustomed to it.</fullReview>

Macbeth of Michael Fassbender has the entire force, vulnerability and anger, fear and faith , being the hero and the traitor and the victim of dream. Marion Cotillard has the right nuances for a Lady Macbeth out of clichés and ordinaries solutions. the air, the land, the meeting who change the life of the than of Glamis, Banquo of Paddy Considine, the friend who becomes the second victim of few words, the noble Duncan, the scenes of fall, the photography , each is remarkable. because the ambition of Justin Kurzel is not to make another Macbeth but to show the heart of the tragedy, its air, its truth , its roots. and the work is great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William Shakespeare's style of writing, whether its reading chapters in his books, or listening to dialogue in the umpteenth telling of Macbeth, makes me feel stupid. Thankfully the story of Macbeth has been told plenty enough times to understand what's going on, and everyone in this 2015 telling more than make up for its insolence. The story as a whole is dark, horrifying and wicked. Macbeth, played by the impeccably flawed Fassbender, loses the plot when his wife, the sinister, manipulative Marion Cotillard, pushes him to kill the king of Scotland (David Thewlis). There's one battle Macbeth cannot win, and that's against the demons (or witches, in this case) that continually torment him. There are hints of Game of Thrones and The Lord of the Rings in there, dappling into the realms of fantasy through the eyes of Macbeth. This is gritty, dark stuff from director Justin Kerzel, a Shakespeare adaption that's not as hard to digest as originally thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Overambitious Art-house Flick That Will Enthral Some &amp; Frustrate Others.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no denying that the latest film adaptation of one of Shakespeare's most celebrated plays is ravishingly beautiful to look at, is more or less faithful to its source material in content and features committed performances from both Michael Fassbender &amp; Marion Cotillard but the Shakespearean dialogues, woeful pace &amp; experimental nature turns it into a cinema that will divide its audience.Based on William Shakespeare's play of the same name, Macbeth follows its titular character who, after a bloody battle, is approached by witches who tell him that one day he will become the King of Scotland. Blinded by ambition &amp; coerced by his wife, Macbeth brutally murders his highness to take the throne for himself but soon becomes paranoid &amp; turns into an imminent threat for his own kingdom.Directed by Justin Kurzel, the issue I have with this picture is that the Shakespearean language its cast have to utter becomes annoying real soon and is more suited to the world of theatres &amp; opera than a film celluloid. Others may admire it for the same reason but I was having facepalm moments after the first 10 minutes. The main plot, however, closely resembles the material it is adapted from despite its lavish presentation.Cinematography is a definite highlight for the camera makes wonderful use of warm colour palette, lighting &amp; shadows is pure wizardry, images are captured in splendid detail and the visual design is sumptuous to look at. The opening moment did feel like the cameraman was drunk and had trouble in keeping the device static but it's a smooth ride afterwards. Editing could've paced it better while the background score only works in bits n pieces.Coming to the performances, Macbeth features a fine cast in Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard, Sean Harris, David Thewlis &amp; others. Fassbender's rendition of Macbeth is impressive on a visceral scale while Cotillard is effortlessly enchanting as Lady Macbeth. Their expression is simply spot on but just like the film's stupefying photography, the Shakespearean accent they try so hard to nail is unnecessarily distracting.On an overall scale, Macbeth is an overambitious art-house flick that will hypnotise its viewers with its rich, colourful &amp; vivid imagery yet there are going to be few who'll find it a chore to sit through due to its sluggish pace, poetic conversations, empty spectacle, half-baked characters &amp; tedious narration. Definitely not a film for all, Macbeth has a lot in store for art-house enthusiasts or fans of Shakespeare's tragedy but other than its spellbinding images, it was a vapid experience for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a literary student I always considered Macbeth as one of the strongest plays to be found among the Shakespearean tragedies. After reading the play in class and watching Kenneth Branagh 's magnificent and breath-taking performance as Macbeth in National Theatre Live : Macbeth afterwards--which still stands as the best after seeing this--I realized how symbolically and psychologically intriguing and strong Macbeth was as a Shakespearean tragedy. The story of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth is unique and the play is a literary masterpiece with heavy symbolism. Of the movie, I should initially tell you that it is not your typical history-adventure movie where you get to see a lot of sword- action and yet it is charming enough to take you away with great visuals of Scotland alongside the tragic story of Macbeth. The film uses the original dialogues from the play which made it tons better in my eyes. The synergy between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth is masterfully reflected on the screen. I must say that I am particularly amazed by Marion Cotillard's performance as Lady Macbeth; she was simply perfect. Overall, a visually stunning adaptation for those who loves the play. See this if you like the play as you cannot possibly regret it!After all, ''Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more.

		<fullReview>Now, call me uncultured or whatever, but I have never seen or read the actual play. I'm of course familiar with many of the plot elements of it, to the point that I knew where much of the film would go. Saying that however, I didn't expect such a melancholy, quiet film. I had especially heard much about Cotillard's portrayal of Lady Macbeth and how she did a different take on it. First of all, I would really appreciate if those who are very familiar with the play would tell me how faithful this adaptation is and how different the portrayals and everything are.While I've always had somewhat of a problem with Shakespearean adaptations in terms of the prose, I found that this film's reliance on its visuals really compliment the story and its themes and really brought a perspective that I wasn't really expecting. It has a lot of style, but I think it worked well as it did. The cinematography and directing here are really strong, and there's such a firm grasp on every aspect of the film. Did it leave me cold? Somewhat, but I expected it to. I think what really helps it aren't just its technical aspects, but the really fantastic performances by Fassbender and Cotillard. It seems like both performances have been very divisive on here (again, I would appreciate if anyone wanted to elaborate or talk about why they liked or disliked them), but I thought both stayed in the vein of the film's poetic tone. I certainly do understand if, due to the film's extremely low-key approach, it may have been underwhelming. I personally thought both actors gave powerful, intense performances in the different way that one would be accustomed to.I wouldn't say I've seen countless of Shakespeare adaptations, but from the ones I have I would say this is my favorite. Certainly worth it for the acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The proof that Shaekspeare will never get old. The umpteenth adaptation of the great tragedy by the Bard is another great vision of his work, unique in its own yet appropriately elaborated and adapted, despite the fact that it is more good storytelling than great cinema.By that I mean that the filmmakers didn't find a way to make the narrative deeply compelling and thrilling as I know it, it lacks that adrenaline punch that for me made Macbeth one of the greatest things ever studied in school. It is a very cold staging of the tragedy that doesn't really make for an absorbing cinema experience per say.Still, the power of the themes, characters, story is so superlative and so out of time it is hard to resist being engaged with Macbeth. Put on top of that Fassbender owning, and I truly mean, owning the role of Macbeth, Cotilliard giving Lady Macbeth a fantastic portrayal and a supporting cast making even the secondary characters stick out.Moreover, a visual style and staging that is unique and new, photography that can be liked or disliked but has to be recognized for its technical flawlessness. A soaring score that perfectly encapsulates the horror on screen. Justin Kurzel really comes out as a victor here, because his choices can be appreciated or turned down, but he clearly emerges as a having a true vision. I did not appreciate the depressing bleakness and anxiety he injects here, this is a little too depressing and maddening. It really got dark to points were I didn't even think it to be necessary. I would have left that behind for some more snap to the film, a little more active drama, which the movie has, but unfortunately not enough and regretfully so since those were the parts I really enjoyed.But you won't hear me complaining about this movie anymore since the passion and energy it has, whilst they might require a little too much attention to grasp, are totally deserving of admiration and respect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is there anything Michael Fassbender can't do? Marion Cotillard equally stunning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"MacBeth" (2015 release; 113 min.) is the latest big screen adaptation of the William Shakespeare play. As the movie opens, we see a small child's funeral (turns out to be the child of MacBeth). After the opening credits, we are given a very brief synopsis as to the overall situation, with MacBeth being loyal to the King, and it's not long thereafter that MacBeth leads the troops in a decisive battle. Meanwhile, we get to know Lady MacBeth, who has grander plans for her husband. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie version of the famed Shakespeare play is directed by little know Australian director Justin Kurzel (his brother Jed composes an outstanding orchestral score, and I noticed in the movie's end credits that Justin is credited with playing the drums in the score). Kurzel gives us a very stylish and visual interpretation of the play, with stunning photography from start to finish, pure eye-candy, The early battle scene is nothing short of epic, with at times ultra slow-motion photography for further effect. Michael Fassbender, whom we just saw recently as Steve Jobs, now incarnates MacBeth, and he brings a heartfelt performance. Is there anything this guy can't do? His list of recent performances is nothing short of daunting (MacBeth, Steve Jobs, Frank, 12 Years A Slave, Shame, and of course X-Men). He is one of this generation's leading actors, period. The minute Lady MacBeth comes onto the screen, I thought to myself 'this face is familiar'. It wasn't until 10 or 15 minutes later that I suddenly realized "holy cow, it is Marion Cottilard!". She plays Lady MacBeth without any trace whatsoever of a French accent, in perfect. It is nothing short of stunning to see her incorporate Lady MacBeth (check out her monologue late into the movie, as she is tortured with guilt and shame, it will leave you in tears). Speaking of language: it took me a good 10-15 minutes to get used to the early 17th century English language of Shakespeare's era, and even then, I will readily admit that quite a few of the lines simply bypassed me. If the DVD version comes with subtitles, you probably will want to take advantage of that. The movie was shot on location in England and Scotland. Have the Scottish highlands looked ever more beautiful? And the use of the spectacular Banburgh Castle will leave you in awe. Bottom line: eve if you are not a fan of Shakespeare as such, you will likely be taken in by this latest adaptation, if nothing else by the photography and the lead performances from Fassbender and Cotillard."MacBeth" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The early evening screening where I saw this at on Friday evening was attended quite well, frankly to my surprise, as I had figured that demand for this kind of movie would be limited. But I'm glad that I was wrong on that account. If you are in the mood for a highly stylish interpretation of "MacBeth" that features stunning performances from the lead actor and actress, you cannot go wrong with this. "MacBeth" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Modern Take but still with enough originality to make it work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Fassbender plays the mentally deteriorating Thane of Glamis, who is told by three witches that his destiny lies in becoming the Scottish King, in Shakespeare's classic play of corruption, greed and blood letting. Marion Cotillard plays his wife the Lady Macbeth in a role where she puts in a fair amount of passion.This is directed by the extremely talented ? and original ? Justin Kurzel ? who brought us 'The Snowtown Murders'. The battle scenes are a work of art and the themes of stylish horror (almost) are kept going through out the film. The plays real strengths though are the verse in which it is delivered and so Shakespeare purists will not be pleased with some of the treatment seeing 'The Bard' as sacred. I was only let down by the whispered lines that I had to strain to hear. The acting though was all excellent and almost painful to watch? which is the point here.It is though not 'easy watching' and requires full commitment. This could have been better but it is still an endeavour worth praise and it is worth a viewing if only for the great acting and the stunning cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good version of a great play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Macbeth (2015/I) was directed by Justin Kurzel. It stars Michael Fassbender as Macbeth, and Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth. This is a serious attempt to make a excellent movie from one of the world's greatest plays. It succeeds on some levels, and fails on other levels.Naturally, director Kurzel "opens up" the drama by using shots of the barren moors and desolate shores of Scotland. He has chosen two highly talented actors to play Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. Fassbender is brilliant. I would never have thought of choosing Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth, but she's a great actor and she does a wonderful job. Kurzel's handling of the three weird sisters is outstanding, although for some reason he adds a young girl to the group. Some of the things I think Kurzel did wrong involve changing Shakespeare's play for--to me-- inexplicable reasons. For example, one of the great theatrical scenes in the world is Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene. Orson Welles got it wrong--the scene takes place in a shapeless, formless cave. (But Welles didn't have money for a proper set of a room within a castle.)Roman Polanski got it right--a room in a castle, with the maid and doctor in attendance. (OK--Lady Macbeth is nude, but the scene is played for madness, not sexuality.)Kurzel turns this great scene into a soliloquy. It doesn't work. This is an example of Shakespeare's genius betrayed. We need the maid and the doctor because someone has to witness the scene and recognize what Lady Macbeth is unwittingly telling us. Why change it when it works so well?Similarly, one of Shakespeare's most horrific scenes is the slaughter of MacDuff's family. This scene is perfect, and shouldn't be tampered with. Kurzel shows Lady MacDuff and two of her children captured, and then burned alive while MacBeth is watching. The scene as Shakespeare wrote it is fine the way it is--horrible but realistic. It has worked for 400 years. Who decided we needed something better?Finally, the sound quality was such that some of the dialog was unintelligible. Everyone has some trouble understanding some of Shakespeare's lines, but at least you should be able to hear them. (This wasn't just my problem. After the movie, several people commented about this, as did some reviewers.)We saw this film at Rochester's Little Theatre. It will work better on the large screen than the small screen. This version of Macbeth is certainly good enough to seek out and watch. I was frustrated because it came so close to being a historically important version, but didn't quite get there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having never watched the play by Shakespeare, I had high expectations for the film adaptation of such a famous and acclaimed piece of art. I was immediately impressed by the beautifully somber photography, the enchanted Scottish landscapes and the brutality of the fights. However a major unexpected hurdle awaited me: without subtitles, a difficult whispered diction and a strong accent in a long-gone form of English, I found myself often lost in the dialogues, which distracted me from following the course of the plot. I've managed to catch up with it further on, but this loss prevented me from fully appreciating this film. Overall: great costumes and cinematography, OK/good performances by the lead actors and soundtrack, lack of a better understanding of the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Cinematic Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly we need to consider the sheer bravery of attempting to translate a classical adaptation of Shakespeare onto the screen with such close adherence to the original script. We also then need to understand that in an industry where Fast and Furious sets the standard for popularity, this film took a huge risk.And what a fantastic job it did indeed. The director exhibits an excellent understanding of Shakespeare's verse. This creative analysis of the script enabled a couple of new interpretations of some classic scenes which come off as both modern and devastatingly poignant as a result.The magnificently psychological subtext of Macbeth is also elaborated with skill and intellectual sensitivity. Certain choices of plot emphasis, the rearrangement of the chronological order of some verses and the angle of approach to the many linguistic metaphors was in every instance warranted and successful. The director was brave enough to take new and original turns in the adaptation and yet was never tempted to do something drastic for the sake of it. Ultimately this is very high quality.This film cannot be judged by whether or not you understand what's happening. The director tries to assist the audience as much as possible, with the help of excellent acting, but nothing is spoon- fed. If you have no understanding of Shakespearian verse or drama then you may not be able to access this film as much as you'd like. It's definitely not for everyone, nor was it intended to be.Surely a classic of film making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of the play. I've watched it in many different takes, theatre, studied the play, cinema, television, animation, opera and the Japanese 'Throne of Blood'. Each interpretation brings something new, not all work but this one definitely does.MacBeth is a fabulously complex and multi-layered story of greed, Realpolitik, superstition, fate and so much more. The director gives some great original interpretations of the play in a way I've never seen before, and it works brilliantly, I was surprised.The parts are played to perfection by the ever impressive Michael Fassbender &amp; Marion Cotillard. I can't speak highly enough of them.We have the great dark and grey tales been loving shown in its correct settings in a rugged Scotland, far better than the modern settings you get from some directors.This is excellent, and possibly one of the best interpretations of this incredible story that I have ever seen. Only issue is that if you're new to the tale you won't get it all. Shakespeare is not easily interpretable, and really those familiar with the play will be those who most likely enjoy it the most.Recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Australian screenwriter and director Justin Kurzel's second feature film which was written by screenwriters Jacob Koskoff, Todd Louiso and Michael Lesslie, is an adaptation of a play by a renowned English 17th century poet which is inspired by the life of a real person surnamed Findlaich. It premiered In competition at the 68th Cannes International Film Festival in 2015, was shot on locations in England and Scotland and is a UK-France-USA co-production which was produced by producers Iain Canning, Emile Sherman and Laura Hastings-Smith. It tells the story about a Scottish general who was approached by three clairvoyant witches who through their whispering voices communicated to him that he would become King of Scotland, and the third witch said: "There to meet with Macbeth." Distinctly and precisely directed by Australian filmmaker Justin Kurzel, this quietly paced fictional tale which is narrated interchangeably from the main characters' viewpoints, draws a majestically literary portrayal of a becoming autocrat whom instigated by his and his wife named Lady Macbeths' underlying grief and prospects, begins, whilst increasingly forsaking their hearts, reflecting upon committing the ultimate crime to realize their maniac visions of themselves as sovereign an their future. While notable for its cinematographically and mysteriously atmospheric milieu depictions, masterful cinematography by cinematographer Adam Arkapaw, production design by Australian production designer Fiona Crombie and costume design by English costume designer Jacqueline Durran, this narrative-driven, dialog-driven and monologue-driven story about a man's and woman's mind and the deconstruction of them created by the written words of a master of ? which was made more than a millennium after a Scottish son and father named Cináed mac Ailpin (810-858) became the first King of Rioghachd na-h Alba (800s-1700s), almost nine centuries after a French author named Marie de France became the first poet in the Kingdom of France (843-1792), almost eight centuries after the Treaty of Perth (1266) and three decades after a twelve-year-old boy, in a literary work, was told by one of his family members: "As wild beasts they came out of the night - ?! They killed your brother, and your father the Jarl swore eternal vengeance! Blood revenge is your inheritance Sigurd Dragonslayer." where the protagonist utters to his accomplice: "To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself." the acute frames turns into transcending paintings with mystical atmospheric depth, the Scottish highlands tells of powers far greater than humankind and cinema is stretched beyond the ordinary, depicts a substantially perspicacious study of character and contains a great and timely score by composer Jed Kurzel.This philosophical chamber piece which is set in Kinrick o Scotland in the 11th century a millennium before an English singer named Florence sang: "? to keep my issues drawn ?" and a protagonist wishes she could unsex herself as she thinks that men have no feelings, is impelled and reinforced by its cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, rhythmic continuity, distinctly poetic dialog, question: "What is that noise?" answer: "It is the cry of women, my good ?" comment by M: "Thou wast born of woman. But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn, Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born." and the ingrained acting performances by French actress Marion Cotillard and German-Irish actor Michael Fassbender. A grand scale narrative feature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it will not please everybody, Kurzel's treatment of a familiar story is little short of spectacular, gripping the spectator emotionally and visually.There have been many treatments of the semi-fictional yet inspiring Shakespearean saga of ambition and corruption, with famous actors and directors from the earliest days of cinema. In 1971, Polanski injected new life in the tale by depicting the grimness of the early Scottish landscape and the violent and brutality of events from the play. Although Polanski made an effort towards faithfulness of the words written by the Bard, bringing a grittiness to the screen that could hardly be achieved on stage, Kurzel in one sense goes a stage further, completely accepting that cinema is a different medium and that faithfulness to the spirit of a story can be fulfilled in many dimensions.From the very opening scenes, before hardly a word has been spoken, Kurzel uses visual images of desperate conditions, a child's death, a youngster preparing for war, to heighten our emotional sensitivity. When spoken words begin, there is little attempt to 'make Shakespearean English understandable' in the normal way. True to the story, he uses heavy Scottish accents, forcing the viewer to follow what is happening visually, and the emotional journeys become a tsunami.Superb acting shows Macbeth as an initially good, loyal, man, the three witches not as bat-boiling hags but as sincere, folklorish women, and the future Lady Macbeth as devoted, loving and kind (if a bit misguided). All this fits with reasonable history of the period and the story generally. The unsophisticated Macbeth is loyal to his king, but allows his wife (who wants him to succeed in life) to influence him against his better judgment. Her unravelling, as she witnesses the monster that her husband has become (at her bidding) is a transformation effected by Marion Cotillard in one of the most remarkable female performances of the year.As long as you have a passing idea of the story, it is easy enough to follow by focussing on the emotions of the characters. There is no need of the usual cinematic markers of overblown heroism and evil deeds to delineate good and evil (although there are plenty of evil deeds as well, some of them clothed in sweetness and piety). We can see for ourselves, in the subtle expressions and choices, as a pure heart becomes corrupt, and as evil takes root until the person no longer knows themself.The contrast between the old king and Macbeth in power also touches on broader themes: that leaders can embody things that all men and women aspire to, such as honesty, recognition of others, kindness and a better future for all. When these are lacking, most people no longer love and identify with their king but merely think of staying alive, being a bit better off materially, or going home to their family.Kurzel finds novel ways of dealing with the big supernatural events that strike us as entirely credible without the use of special effects and even manages to add a new interpretation to the famous 'Birnham Wood'. The stunning climax might suggest modern day lessons of tolerance over the heated Scottish independence question; and the final footage is used not to amaze in typical blockbuster style but to tear at one's heart and guts as we consider the horrors visited on innocent men and children by the unleashed greed and ambition that was as unstoppable as it was unintended.One cannot make a film like this which breaks the mold without upsetting those that seek straightforward entertainment. Yet this is, in some sense at least, Shakespeare: those that only go for battle scenes and the story on a plate may leave feeling distinctly unsatisfied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually striking, but frustrating for non-Shakespeare lovers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a visually striking and hugely impressive adaptation of Shakespeare's classic tale. Whilst the screenplay remains faithful to the original by retaining Shakespearean dialogue, the original direction by Justin Kurzel allows for an often mesmerising display that is more often than not the most interesting part of the entire film.So, before we get into that, let's talk about how Shakespearean this really is. In short: very. If, like so many us, you are a hater of Shakespeare thanks to years of it being rammed down your throat at school, this isn't going to be as engrossing a watch, because you'll likely be consistently confused and frustrated by ye olde dialogue.However, the story itself is a classic, and whether you are a fan of the bard or not, it's a very gritty and dark tale that can be very interesting at times. Macbeth's rise to power is often haunting to watch, of course helped by Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard's performances, as the two attempt to usurp the throne of Scotland for their own ambition.This film in particular is extremely violent and gritty. The various battle scenes feel like you're watching 300, with an onslaught of blood flying around, yet with such artistic direction that it's almost dream-like.The directing by Justin Kurzel is definitely the most impressive part of this whole film. His visual style turns this more into a loose-feeling art-house picture more than a classic Shakespearean tale, as he turns battles into warped dreams, monologues into very intense sequences, and makes an overall visually striking film.What's more is that the score here will also really get you mesmerised in the film. Again, even if you're struggling to cope with the Shakespearean dialogue, the eerie and unnerving music that plays almost incessantly throughout this film will have you hooked, as it really helps to create a more fearful atmosphere, likening Macbeth's ascent to the end of days, furthered by Kurzel's often apocalyptic-looking directing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrific Shakespeare adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Macbeth seems to have come and gone with little fanfare, but this is a rather excellent movie. It's a fairly faithful retelling of the play with Michael Fassbender as Macbeth and Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth. The most notable change is its unexpected side-lining of Lady Macbeth, and this is also its biggest mistake. Cotillard feels wasted as a result. The film excels the most with its depiction of Macbeth himself as a damaged warrior full of angst and grief. Thus, Macbeth is an unexpectedly sympathetic character in this version, which adds to the film's strength. It's perhaps not a film you'll want to see again. Brutal, rage filled and joyless, this is one hugely depressing movie and does get pretty harrowing at times. It's not a strikingly different adaptation like 1996's Romeo and Juliet. It's a faithful cinematic interpretation of the play which unleashes the full force of the play's emotion on the audience. There aren't many rays of sunshine here. This is full-on, ferocious stuff and this approach will put some viewers off.The lines are a bit too quiet at times, and can be difficult to understand. This is a problem, but the film leans heavily on its visuals to tell the story. And what visuals they are. Every frame is a painting here, and the cinematography is utterly mind blowing. As a piece of visual storytelling, it's brilliant. While it's pretty heavy, the film is effective and emotionally powerful, and it does convey the themes of its masterful source material. One to see on the big screen (Although this was box office bomb so sadly most won't), this is overall a very well constructed and executed adaptation. This interestingly seems to have divided people's opinions a lot. The film has a polarising quality, but I firmly see it as an excellent movie, and one of my favourite films of 2015. Easily one of the best cinema experiences I had all year, this is one brutally intense and powerful movie that isn't easy viewing, but does its source material proud and provides an amazing visual experience backed by excellent acting.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shakespeare En Plein Air</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Australian director Justin Kurzel directs Shakespeare's magnificent drama (as adapted for the screen by Jacob Koskoff, Michael Lesslie, and Todd Louiso), moves the action outside of the claustrophobia of a stage castle and into the breathtaking majesty of the land of Scotland and the result is an epic film populated with some of our finest actors of the day who are able to deliver Shakespearean poetry with the finest seasoned Shakespeare actors of the day. The result is a dark look at a story we all know and the changes in scenery create a dramatic turn of stance in the way we interpret Shakespeare's brilliant drama.Brief synopsis: 'Macbeth, the Thane of Glamis, receives a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland. Consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his wife, Macbeth murders his king and takes the throne for himself.' What this quick dollop of a plot synopsis fails to render is the extraordinary altered viewpoint that Macbeth is not simply a ruthless power hungry man driven by his equally power obsessed wife, but instead is a man whose battle time and the mass killings for which he is responsible have created a PTSD personality change that is gripping and very moving to watch his descent into his fate.Michael Fassbender continues to grow and impress as one of our finest actors of the time and he delivers the poetry of Shakespeare with eloquent and raw dignity. Likewise, Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth is inordinately impressive ? a very fine portrayal by an exceptionally gifted actress. The cast is uniformly fine ? Paddy Considine as Banquo, Brian Nickels as the Thane of Cawdor, Malcolm as portrayed by Jack Reynor, David Thwelis as Duncan, Sean Harris as Macduff, et al. The glorious cinematography is by Adam Arkapaw and the eerie musical score is by the director's brother, Jed Kurzel. The only criticism this viewer has is the need for subtitles in order to hear and understand the perfection of Shakespeare's words. This likely is the reason this film did not do well in theaters. It should have been considered in almost every category for Oscars and it's omission points out the sad state of all award consideration. Perhaps 'Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow...' A wholly brilliant film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shakespeare Would Approve</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Justin Kurzel and Michael Fassbender's Macbeth won me over in the second half of this film. The first half reminded me why so few of Shakespeare's plays are tackled on film - being a chore to understand who's who and what's going on, and with the audience trying to come to grips with the language, the entertainment side of things can disappear into a black hole. If you don't know something about the play and characters beforehand, you've got to concentrate hard to know who's talking to who, and what they're talking about. Then comes the language. Unfortunately, Shakespeare's cleverly coined phrases and metaphors, meter and poetic imagery isn't easy on the ear for two hours at a time. But don't let that stop you enjoying what else is going on.The good thing is, Shakespeare wrote to entertain the masses as well as the hoi polloi, so his something-for-everyone storytelling talent transcends many of our limitations in watching it. Not many film makers take the Shakespeare challenge on, and those that do often suffer the consequences. After a somewhat ignominious start, Kurzel's Macbeth gathers momentum. It does an excellent job of transporting it's audience into a rarified entertainment atmosphere. From the time of MacDuff's gruesome discovery of King Duncan's bloody body, Fassbender is allowed to nail the sense and sensibilities of the language, allowing us to piece together a digestible picture of his Macbeth.Prior to this, the mix of language and film imagery struggles for coherency. The heightened imagery of the language, at odds with the naturalistic scenes and film performance of the actors, threatens to make Shakespeare appear (to the uninitiated) to be a story telling charlatan. What Shakespeare structures in his writing to make work on stage is left floundering against the vast panorama of nature, visual selection of the camera, and actors acting naturally. Kurzel has tried to edit the play and story to accommodate this. In the first half, I felt that creates more problems than solutions for the audience. Having performed in this play (MacDuff &amp; Duncan) professionally, I knew what was meant to be going on but, as I said, coherent revelation and story telling wasn't coming off the screen. Anyone who has worked with Shakespeare's text soon learns the major lesson is to trust Shakespeare. Kurzel inadvertently makes the mistake of trying to compromise for the medium he's working in. The result is that the glue that is Shakepeare's language has nothing to stick to. Shakespeare pots his characters and works his scenes in a fashion so as the language becomes part of the storytelling. Film, along with being a visual medium, is a naturalistic form. It's not friendly or synonymous to theatrical, poetic device, which Shakespeare's characters and language stem from. In this case, the coherent story doesn't really get going until Macbeth and Lady Macbeth's introspections allow us to focus on the language and with that, the chance to piece things together.Something rather unusual happens then. Time stretches as we're consciously drawn into the character's bind, by the language. After his first half story modifications and '300' like production values, Kurzel doesn't muck around with Shakespeare's set pieces in the second half. And it is this allowing of the intended theatrical device and structure in the story telling which lets the language do its job. Fassbender knew exactly what this opportunity was about, and his second half performance shows it. Fassbender passes the test of acting craft in not only handling the language, he surrenders to letting Shakespeare do the work. Marion Cotillard, as Lady Macbeth, does a commendable job opposite Fassbender but, while handling the language, seems to understate Lady Macbeth's dramatic descent into madness under the eye of the camera. This is a pity for such a talented actress, and a short coming on the part of Justin Kurzel's direction. I found myself zoning out at those times that I should have been having a strong reaction to her suffering her fate. And again with David Thelewis's rather staid King Duncan. Kurzel hardly sets the circumstance for him to be seen as benevolent and thoroughly beloved by his subjects. Our feelings toward the 'deep damnation of his taking off' (murder) by Macbeth becomes almost extraneous when it should be emotionally pivotal for us. Visually, the effort in setting scenes is thorough and quite glorious. This despite the fact that medieval Scotland was a dour existence. Coupled with religious and occult practices and superstitions, frequent battles and skirmishes with invaders and neighbours, the rotten weather alone depicted in this film would be enough to make you appreciate a short life. Kurzel and a dedicated cast and crew, and Shakespeare, do salvage gripping entertainment from the jaws of early troubles. Then, the storytelling and characters stand well in their own right. I think Shakespeare would approve of the audience getting into this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"They say blood will have blood." MacbethAny production of Shakespeare's Macbeth will ring with that bloody certainty, and contemporary ISIS-like dictatorships confirm that what begins with violence will end with it. Director Justin Kurzei has made a tragedy known by most high school students as real as any battle scene they have seen on YouTube.Visually this Macbeth is dark and smoky outside so that villains like Macbeth (Michael Fassbender) and Lady Macbeth (Marion Cotillard) emerge with hell or at least be comfortable with its worldly manifestations in fear and blood, red and gray. Equally stark are the interiors, dark and minimalist to convey hollow temporary power. Visually the film is a creative take that fully uses cinematographer Adam Arkapaw's considerable talents.As for the bard's language, no one can improve on it, and Kurzei pares enough of it away to keep the essential speeches intact while lamentably to allow the visual to dominate. Fassbender is often in close up speaking quietly but with eerie nuance, such that I have a new appreciation for the character's poetic and tragic nature, a companion appreciation to my two favorite interpretations by Orson Welles and Kenneth Branagh. The way Fassbender slowly moans the iconic Tomorrow speech is as if I had not heard it before. His measured, low volume is just right for the melancholic doom of the sentiment.While I admired Sarah Paulson's wicked Mistress Epps in Steve McQueen's 12 Years a Slave, no facsimile can ever approach the insidious charm of Lady Macbeth. Marion Cotillard plays an effective power broker cum sexual temptress, a powerful combo for such an attractive and talented actress.Notice Lady Macbeth's sexual ministrations while Macbeth gives forth poetically. The irony of these two murderers making love while he rhapsodizes is a rich new take on an ancient Clinton motif, where Hillary could be thought of as a non-violent manipulator and Bill, well, a political and sexual Olympian.Macbeth is a visually stunning work whose elimination of swaths of dialogue to fit the battlefield scenes bothers me a bit. Equally so, placing Lady Macbeth at scenes such as Lady Macduff (Elizabeth Debicki) and her children being burned at the stake takes too much license for creative license.In the end, it's the bard's words that anchor any interpretation:"Life's but a walking shadow. Honor. Love. Friends. But in there's death. Curses." Macbeth</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blisteringly Nightmarish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some say the movie with the Mother of all twists is The Sixth Sense (1999). Then the Father of them all must be William Shakespeare's Macbeth, written way way back in 1606. It didn't just have one monumental twist, it had three. This is my favorite cautionary tale of how the love for power can corrupt the most righteous person. The play has many visceral layers and each time I teach it in schools, I discover something frightfully new. As I plumped the depths of murky hell, I gratefully clawed back into the light. This is one of the world's best stories and I sometimes feel it is the blueprint for telling all great stories. But do we need yet another film adaptation? Do we need to wake Shakespeare up from his eternal rest for this? O for Goodnesse sake, quake thee absolute yea! (But there are some caveats. Later on that)Australian director Justin Kurzel's vision for Macbeth is one of tone and mood. He has distilled the essence of Shakespeare's most enacted play in any form and translated onto the big screen with a huge soundscape and an implosion of monochromatic colours. If you want to know how a waking nightmare feels like this is it. Watching this feels like taking a stroll in hell. Every frame is carefully shot to illustrate a paean of pain and madness. Kurzel knows the story all would know, so narratively he is even handed and allowed the nightmarish tale to unfold itself. Under his unique vision there is no gloss, nothing and no one is romanticized, all the characters are distilled to a single motivation, an entity resigned to the supernatural forces at play. Everyone seems resigned to play out the game, no one wants to break out of their state. The theme of puppets and the puppeteers comes to the fore like a stab to the heart. I was glad the hellish journey to hell was over but I was utterly lost why I felt like I needed to stab something (I did stab something after that - a piece of chicken chop. Thankfully not the two idiotic PRC women sitting behind me).The performances by Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard are frightfully spellbinding. Their soliloquies performed with venomous aplomb. Making us fall in love with Shakespeare's exquisite turns in phrases is not Kurzel's aim. He was more intent on making the madness real for us. Macbeth's despairing complaint about life: " ... it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing" hits a spot in my heart I never thought existed, and Lady Macbeth's painful "Out, damn'd spot! Out, I say!" is poignant and as the shot pulls out we actually see who she is lamenting to. My heart broke.Kurzel's Macbeth though blisteringly visceral and gut-twisting in its vision, doesn't say anything new or reward the faithful. It is an unwavering and outstanding adaptation, but unlike Kurosawa's Throne of Blood (1953) and Vishal Bhardwaj's Maqbool (2007), it doesn't breathe new life into the tale. 30 minutes in you will already know what you will get: an unsentimental retelling of an old favorite. It does tweak a few scenes remarkably well like how the film opens and how its relevance is made so pronounced through Lady Macbeth's final soliloquy. I particularly also enjoyed the three witches scenes which play up the nightmare angle. Overall, the film is intense and depressing to a fault, unapologetically so. I am grateful for the moody experience but I wouldn't want to relive it. One visit to the murky depths of hell is enough to last a lifetime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hail Macbeth !"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beautiful adaptation of one of Shakespeare's most famous tragedies.The cinematography and the battle scenes are breathtakingly gorgeous. Fassbender delivers once again a knock out performance : He was indeed born to play that part.Watching him transitioning from a brave warrior &amp; moral man to a paranoid &amp; lunatic king was quite something . Cotillard was also sublime as the doomed Lady Macbeth : Shakespeare's dialogue for a french performer must have been quite a challenging task but she's succeeded quite admirably.So big extra kudos to her. Let's not forget the excellent supporting cast : Thewlis, Considine , Reynor and especially Harris &amp; Debicki ( in a short but poignant performance). All led by Kurtzel fearless direction (need to see Snowtown ASAP). He has truly created a dark,visceral &amp; well-crafted epic. And in my opinion , the dialogue was quite accessible as well. That being said , I still slightly prefer Polanski's version ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Macbeth features a unique, painted in blood and buried in the mist, absolutely original and brilliant direction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nominated for Palme d' Or in Cannes Film Festival this movie features a unique, painted in blood and buried in the mist, absolutely original and brilliant direction by Justin Kurzel (Snowtown), that should be nominated for Oscar. Michael Fassbender is fantastic, he doesn't play Macbeth, he is Macbeth! He should also be nominated for Oscar but he is going to lose to himself (Steve Jobs). The classic and great theatrical play is translated into a movie in a way that Shakespeare would be proud, but beware that old English language is used all the time and everyone speaks like a damn poet, which will surely tire even the most patient audience. Also, having a great French actress like Marion Cottilard talk in 1600's English proves to not be the best choice and therefore her performance lacks persuasion, especially compared to Fassbender's. If you expect another "Gladiator" or "300" movie, don't watch this movie. This is not a typical blockbuster but a quality title that will not be widely appreciated.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original Take on Macbeth - but falls short of Polanski's masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prior to seeing this Macbeth, the undisputed greatest adaptation in my opinion is the Polanski/Finch version, so I use that as the benchmark to judge this version.Where this film excels is the wonderful cinematography, though it's done at great expense of losing much of the text, too much in my opinion, and the deeper meaning of the story is lost also. Polanski never overly compromised what actually makes Shakespeare Shakespeare - the beautiful language, and to a large extent Kurzel does. Fassbender's lack of time spent on the stage doing Shakespeare shows and he isn't always spot on with his timing of Shakespeare's Blank Verse and he lacks the mastery and elucidation that an experienced Shakespearean actor like Jon Finch had, where his crisp and cutting voice pours meaning into every word.Whether it was lack of experience performing Shakespeare or how Fassbender/Kurzel intended it, is hard to tell, but the upshot is that Macbeth here is presented as a severally depressed man from the beginning and struggles to generate any emotion. He speaks in a constant monotone and rather mumbling way for the majority of the play. Portraying Macbeth in such a way, while original, actually defeats the deeper meaning of Macbeth, as the point really is that, at the beginning of the play, he is a perfectly happy person, has just won a great battle for his King, has good friends like Banquo and a lovely wife and castle - or tent in this adaptation! And then all this changes when he receives a prophecy by some witches and stops behaving rationally.Often, I felt Fassbender was trying to fight against what the actual lines were to force them into his interpretation. For example, in the latter part of the play, when Fassbender's Macbeth says: "I 'gin to be aweary of the sun, And wish th' estate o' th' world were now undone." It doesn't actually carry much weight because it seems he's been aweary of the Sun since the beginning of the film. Whereas in the Polanski/Finch film, it's full of power because of the emotion he'd shown before. And many great lines and scenes were not included in this version because the emotion displayed by Macbeth wouldn't make sense with how Fassbender plays him.The whole part of the film before and after the murder scene is pretty poor in my opinion, though I'd have to watch it again to be able to say for sure what happened, as it seemed the "dagger scene" was said in the presence of Malcolm, who seems complicit in it. But it was all rather confusing to be honest, with a massive amount of dialogue removed and other lines rearranged.From quite early on we get another repeated problem I feel - of characters important to the play having their lines so drastically cut they often become little more than extras. Polanski got the editing down of the text spot on but Kurzel overdoes it I think. Martin Shaw's Banquo in Polanski's film is a major presence, as is his endearing relationship with Fleance, himself given enough screen time to truly become a part of the film and even a song to sing in front of the King, whereas Paddy Considine's Banquo is little more than an extra and I don't think Fleance actually says a word.I thought Marion Cotillard was the pick of the actors. I think in part this was due to her not even attempting to do a Scottish accent while trying to get Shakespeare's lines just right, something some of the other actors struggled with - at one point Sean Harris sounded like he came from three different parts of the UK in the same sentence. Though I think he really came into his own later on in the film and gave a powerful performance.Where I think this version came good was the last half an hour or so. The final breakdown of Lady Macbeth is a very powerful piece of film and the scene with the burial of a child at the beginning helped explain her character. I.E. The ambition she showed for Macbeth to kill Duncan comes as a replacement for the emptiness she feels no longer being a mother - and she hoped becoming Queen would fill that emptiness, though it doesn't of course.The news of her death is done in such a way as to catch those familiar with the play off guard. "The Tomorrow and Tomorrow..." speech is delivered well by Fassbender and we perhaps see the payback for his "depressed and melancholic" Macbeth when he finally breaks down emotionally and picks up and holds her.In many ways Fassbender's Macbeth goes on a polar opposite journey to Finch's and personally I prefer the latter and found it more powerful, and the "Towmorrow and Tomorrow..." speech as done by Finch accurately represents the journey Macbeth went on. I.E. That the prophecy by the witches created a delusion that there was a purpose to his life and that he had a destiny - this can be a good thing and inspire people to become things they otherwise wouldn't, but it's more than likely it will end up causing them to make increasingly irrational choices, which is what happens to Macbeth and he destroys all that had been good in his life, and his tyranny destroys many other lives too. And this moment where he realises that he's actually no-one special at all and life is essentially meaningless is one of the most powerful created in all of literature and spans across the centuries and still has resonances today, where many people still succumb to this notion.The end was excellently done, with an original take on Burnham Wood coming to Dunsinane, and the finale of the fight between Macbeth and Macduff against a backdrop of fire was spectacular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shakespeare in all his brutality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, another of Shakespeare's very popular plays has once again been brought back to the big screen (I wonder what number this is, though I can only think of four others that I've seen). Honestly I could write a lot about the play itself but the problem is that I'll simply be going over old ground, particularly since I've written, well, three other reviews on the same play (but on different movies ? neither of them which, surprisingly, are the Roman Polanski version that has Macbeth's head flying up into the air at the end of the film). Anyway, while I could talk about how this play is what I call an inverted action film (namely that it is told from the point of view of the bad guy) or how the seed is planted into Macbeth's mind at the beginning of the film and instead of resisting it he lets it grow until it consumes him, I think it would be better to talk about this version of the story instead.While I knew that it was coming to the screen, it had fallen to the back of my mind and I would have completely missed it if it wasn't for a couple of lovely ladies at church who posted an invitation on Facebook. It took me all of five minutes to adjust my plans and to reply that I would be there with bells on (which is why I'm writing this review on the train with my battery power getting ever lower ? it's a shame there isn't a power point that I can use, though I'm sure if I look hard enough I can probably find one ? I better take my power cord with me to work tomorrow and charge my laptop up when I'm there).Anyway if there is one word that describes this film (and my friends all agreed with this take) and that is that it is brutal ? very, very brutal. In fact Kurzel brings to light the absolute brutality of this play. I am even wondering if Shakespeare imagined that this play could be as brutal and Kurzel created it, but then being quite familiar with many of Shakespeare's works I probably wouldn't be surprised if he did. The thing with this version is that Kurzel captures the barbarity of medieval Scotland. In fact he takes us back to a world of wooden huts and untamed lands, of barbaric warriors, and of the vast, empty, and mountainous regions that lie to the north of England. To the English (and even before them) the Scots were always pictured as brutes ? this is why the Romans built a wall across the island. In fact when Roman Britain fell to the barbarians, the barbarians came from the north. This is a far cry from the cultured and sophisticated Scots that we know today.Another thing about this film was that it was slow. We are not moving amongst the intrigue of the courts of a civilisated society. We are out on the fringes, in the barbaric wastes. It is here that the mists constantly obscures everything that we do, and where the woods drift towards us in the form of smoke from a fire. The land is empty and uninhabited, and the lords of the land live in wooden huts surrounded by tents. This land is beyond the provinces, and it is here that time slows down to a crawl. People don't manoeuvre themselves to the top by playing people up against each other, they get to the top by brutally murdering the person they want to replace.This brings to mind the actor who played Macbeth ? Michael Fassenbender ? he was brilliant. I have seen him in a few movies in the past, but in Macbeth he truly captures the brutal and animalistic nature of the Macbeth whose murderous act has driven him to the point of insanity. On one hand he is a fierce warrior who's only characteristic that helps him maintain his humanity is his loyalty to the king. However, once he plunges the daggers into his victim all semblance of humanity suddenly vanishes and all we are left with is an animal who viciously attacks anybody and everybody who he sees as a threat. This is contrasted with the character of Lady Macbeth, who is a lady of intrigue, yet living in a barbaric world. Her sophisticated political manoeuvrings do not work in such a world, as she discovers when Macbeth brings the bloodied daggers to her after the murder has been committed.The final thing that I wish to raise is how Kurzel subtly manipulates the film so that we are unsure whether we are seeing Macbeth's madness or reality. Is he thinking and speaking to himself, or is he speaking out aloud to everybody in the room. His court stands petrified of him ? he is a madman and he shows it, however Kurzel takes us into his delusional mind where he sees enemies all around him, and stoops as far as to murder innocent children.Not a film for the faint hearted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Traditional Macbeth story with its own flare and gorgeous cinematography.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing."It is about damn time we have gotten a Shakespeare adaptation that's worth talking about. And let me tell you, Macbeth IS worth talking about. I've always been intrigued by the story of Macbeth. The dramatization of the damaging physical and psychological effect on those who seek power just to be powerful is something many can relate to or have experienced. Not in the way of killing to be King, but something smaller and relative. So when I found out who was involved in the movie I automatically became intrigued. Let's face it the last few attempts of adapting the story Macbeth haven't exactly gone very well, or any of Shakespeare's plays for that matter, although Polanski definitely made a solid effort. (Hahaha. I say effort because yeah, I totally could have done better &#x1f602;). Anyway tangent averted. Then when I found out the director was nominated the Palme d'Or, basically the highest honor at Cannes film festival, my excitement spiked. After finally viewing it I can see why. The direction in this movie is flawless. I mean, everything fits perfectly, the tone never shifts and is consistent throughout. Every scene advances the story into the right direction and the cinematography is gorgeous, which I'll get to in a moment. I was definitely a huge fan of the way the movie's narrative structure takes hold and its advancements in the story. As I said every scene does advance the story but not by leading into one another and more so just skipping to certain points. It works like a play would, jumping from act to act. It was more a story focusing on the main points. First is the battle where he meets the witches. Then the scene where kills King Duncan. Leading to his reign as King. Then to the death of Lady Macbeth. And finally ending with his death. It's a narrative style that makes sense to the story and a way of leaving out all the pointless scenes that would just add pacing problems. Thus making the movie a suitable length. I would have likes a little more screen time for Marion Cotillard and really utilize the character of Lady Macbeth. I also wish Macbeth's descent into madness was focused on a little bit more, they touched the surface but they never really delve deep. Just 2 minor nitpicks that could have been avoided. Speaking of the length of the movie. It clocks in at 113 minutes and let me tell you it was one of the fastest 113 minutes of my life. An hour had passed and it felt like it had only recently started. When a movie can do that you know it's doing something right. Now onto the cinematography. This, The Assassin and Sicario so far are the three most beautifully shot movies I've seen all year, and we probably won't see better. Not only are the shots of this Scottish landscape breathtakingly gorgeous but the angles on which they are filmed are just phenomenal. When it comes to the basic landscape it's nothing we haven't seen before with movies such as King Arthur, Kingdom of Heaven etc. but it certainly has its own flare that sets it apart. I'm speaking specifically of the final battle, literally one of the most stunning scenes I've seen in a LONG time, and I've seen Mad Max: Fury Road. The colors used and the angles it is shot has it drenched in atmosphere thematic or, poetic, to the situation. Just watch it, you'll know what I'm talking about. There's not really much to talk about when it comes to script and performances. Fassbender was electric as always and Cotillard really brought the emotion and impact of her atmosphere, we could feel the grim and dark world she had become a part of. The screenplay was also fantastic very poetic as you'd expect but it really fits the situation. Nothing ever felt forced or out of place. It has the basic Shakespeare dialogue. It's spoken in old English, not modernized, something most recent adaptations fear or doing. So I give praise for balsiness and effort. To sum up real quick. Beautiful landscape cinematography, originality in the directors style, although it follows the typical Macbeth story Kurzel really made it his own. Spectacular performances and immense atmosphere. Definitely one to watch when it reaches theaters near you. And if you had any doubts on the upcoming Assassin's Creed movie erase them. We might finally get the video game adaptation we all deserve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hail Macbeth! Hail Fassbender!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Macbeth, the timeless play by William Shakespeare, is retold once more in film, this time in the hands of director Justin Kurzel. The "laws" of cinema establish that such classic pieces get new adaptations every five years or so, inevitably subjecting these rehashes to the "make-or-break" category.The film opens in a battlefield and viewers are immediately sucked into the murky-as-hell world of the eponymous protagonist, Macbeth (Michael Fassbender) ? who we first see sporting muddy war-paint on his face. From the heavy use of stylized slow motion, the movie clearly establishes that this is not just a war film. If you haven't had the chance to be acquainted with Macbeth, be warned that, like most of Shakespeare's plays, this is a tale of serious tragedy and not for general audiences seeking the medieval entertainment exemplified in Gladiator or 300. It is much more sublime; an emotionally exhausting, slow-paced war drama more akin to a painting in a way that it demands a fair amount of attention for one to appreciate its true worth.Following the pitched battle, Macbeth and his confidante Banquo (Sean Harris) encounter a trio of witches and a little girl speaking of a prophecy about the future King of Scotland. From hereon, the plot revolves on Macbeth's attempt to fulfill that prophecy and its aftermath, as his political ambition consumes him like an incorruptible poison obliterating his sanity.The strength of Macbeth lies in its sense-appealing cinematography and the performance of its lead actor (Hail Macbeth! Hail Fassbender!). His impeccable and primeval performance of a tyrannical maniac descending to full-blown lunacy and desperation surpasses that of his ruthless slave master in 12 Years a Slave and the metal-bending antihero Magneto in X-Men. Paired with an emotionally-complex Lady Macbeth (Marion Cotillard), we are presented with a twisted and treacherous couple hell-bent on committing themselves to a circle of violence for power.Read full review here: www.filmpolicereviews.com/reviews/macbeth</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visually breathtaking vision of the classic tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what's a film that's sure to delight the eyes and tickle the ears of Shakespearian fans the world over, Australian director Justin Kurzel has for his 2nd feature film (following on from the grizzly Australian crime classic Snowtown) showcased a love and a care for one of the great Bard's most beloved tales that remains faithfully in tune with its source material to at times its own determinate but also showcases the up and coming directors incredible visual flair and ability with actors that will likely see him prosper in the industry for years to come.Kurzel's Snowtown was a gritty, grungy and downright dirty retelling of one of Australia's most notorious mass murderers and while Macbeth is much larger in scale, the realism mixed with a sense of the otherworldly that was prevalent in his 2011 debut is on show once more here in the stunning backdrops of rural Scotland that at times feel drenched in the surreal.A downright masterful opening that throws the viewer into a brutal and bloody battle or soldiers wondering through the waterlogged moors of the countryside with a blood orange haze of nearby fires raging about them, Kurzel and his cinematographer Adam Arkapaw (another standout Australian export) have created something truly special here and with a moody provocative score from Kurzel's brother Jed, Macbeth is one of 2015's most astutely produced features.Front and centre to this immaculately designed drama is another powerhouse performance from Michael Fassbender who seems custom made for the world of Shakespeare. Thriving on the multilayered character of Macbeth, a man driven to insanity and battling his true nature, Fassbender is outstanding and is arguably one of the best seen incarnations of the famous solider who became king. With solid support from Marion Cotillard as Macbeth's equally tormented wife Lady Macbeth and character actors such as Paddy Considine, Sean Harris and David Thewlis, Macbeth's cast is universally excellent and almost make the ye olde English dialogue work.While Shakespearian faithful will be twirling their perfectly pointed moustaches with delight, the often jarring and hard to decipher nature of much of Shakespeare's wordsmithing is at times to much to bare and while it's commendable that the filmmakers here backed themselves and their cast in to deliver, moments of emotion and tension are often held back by dialect that is both hard to deconstruct and difficult to take in over one viewing. At the heart and soul of Macbeth lies a rather uncomplicated narrative and it would've been a relief to see the story treated so in a scripted sense considering what's lost here through frustratingly jarring dialogue.A constantly impressive feature that is often stunningly well filmed and acted, Macbeth is a seriously well acted and directed drama that suggests Kurzel could well become one of Australia's finest filmmaking exports and with his next film the potentially franchise starting Assassin's Creed with his Macbeth stars Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard, it's highly likely that those in Hollywood are thinking the very same thing.4 tension riddled dinner banquets out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Hail, Kurzel! All Hail, Fassbender!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this postmodern rendition of William Shakespeare's Macbeth, Justin Kurzel excels as a dashing experimentalist and Michael Fassbender gives a performance of a lifetime claiming the tormented hero utterly his own.The problem with adapting a Shakespearean drama is that it has probably been read, performed, interpreted, represented, and redefined a gazillion times before, and to think you can positively contribute to the huge, already existing Macbethian discourse is an extremely challenging endeavor. Moreover, your audience have the upper hand; they know the story and almost all the lines by heart and could academically lecture you on the tiniest of details. But this didn't seem to dishearten Australian director Justin Kurzel from adopting a f*ck-it-I'm-gonna-do-it-my-way-whether-you-like-it- or-not attitude to carry on with this risky business. Kurzel made some cinematic decisions that he knew he would most likely be crucified for (already many film critics didn't miss a chance to do so as soon as the film was released); nevertheless, his dark, bloody, visually overwhelming adaptation shocked me but with no doubt satisfied me on every possible level.The visuals play the major part in setting the film's tone and ambiance, and you can call Kurzel's shots overtly pretentious and unrealistic all you like, but what's wrong with that? The film wears the badge of pretense proudly. Isn't Shakespeare's sophisticated language pretentious? Kurzel uses his images as a poet uses words and translates Shakespeare's poetic brilliance into emotionally engrossing visuals, almost to an orgasmic effect ? I didn't want some of the long shots to go away because they were so consuming and beautiful to look at. Kurzel is not ashamed to use visual pastiche by borrowing elements from Frank Miller and Zack Snyder and, consequently, turning Macbeth into the most unlikely comic hero of our time.However, if I ever choose to call the film a 'contemporary' adaptation of Macbeth, the visuals would not be the only reason. The screenplay adds something uncannily ominous to the Shakespearean melodrama that directly pertains to modern consciousness. The stress on meaningless violence, brutality and war brings to memory recent events of killings and decapitations. Also, how children are represented as agents of death and threat is a colossal point of departure from the original text. The film opens with a shot of a dead child and a few seconds later we realize it is Macbeth's son's funeral. The infamous three witches are accompanied by a preternaturally looking little girl. A boy who gets killed during war becomes the recurrent apparition that encourages Macbeth to kill Duncan. Lady Macbeth sees a waking vision of her dead child stained with blood. Banquo's son becomes the threat that lingers after the film ends. Children have always been the literary epitome of innocence and subverting this image to the extreme opposite to express fear, guilt and menace is a relatively modern concept. This kind of thematic distortion is reflected in the narrative's time line which disruptively keeps moving forwards and backwards to add to the overall sense of confusion and distortion.Now let's talk acting.Usually, playing Hamlet, Othello or Macbeth is any actor's dream opportunity to toot their horns for a while. Few are those who do away with the generic melodramatic performance and play those characters with regard to the unique perspective of the work in question. Those are the ones I call smart actors and Michael Fassbender is definitely one of them. This Irish-German talent has read the subtext of his role and fully understood Kurzel's vision that his Macbeth reveals a new dimension of the iconic tragic hero I have never seen before. Fassbender's Macbeth is a Macbeth of postmodern proportions; he is no longer the beloved noble hero with one tragic flaw that brings about his demise, but a hero with many opposites. He is attractive yet most of the time covered in dirt and blood (physically and figuratively). He is gentle but in a cruel, detached way. He aspires to build only to destroy. I got the feeling that this Macbeth is not driven by blind ambition but by vengeance and a lurking desire to ruin and deconstruct a universe that has betrayed him ? the opening funeral scene gives us a glimpse of how he came to be like that.Fassbender is very much in control of his emotions that not in one scene did I feel like something has been exaggerated or played down. The Macbeth I know goes through a journey of self-loathing and regret that leaves him a total wreck; on the other hand, Fassbender's Macbeth is already disillusioned and wrecked beyond repair. You can tell how dark his inside is from scene one, something which makes him all the more intimidating and incomprehensible. I left the cinema truly wondering what kind of pain and darkness Mr. Fassbender had to summon up from his soul to play that part (sounds melodramatic I know, but I really mean it).Two other people who are equally stunning are Marion Cotillard and Sean Harris. Cotillard has both the innocence and the venom to play Lady Macbeth to perfection, and Harris, with enough maturity and experience up his sleeves, turns the nondescript Shakespearean Macduff into an emotionally and physically powerful character that stands out as Macbeth's antithesis.One final player that invisibly contributes to this harmonious equation and should never go uncredited is the gripping music. Composed by Jed Kurzel (Yup, Justin's brother), the film's original score weaves the ominous atmosphere into existence and completes Macbeth's dark world. Just listen to the first 10 minutes of the soundtrack and you will feel that the music is literally mourning and wailing over Macbeth's eventual destiny.By all means, go watch it and leave your prejudices at the movie theater's door.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very enjoyable film that sets a new bar for interpreting Shakespeare's works. I would like to think that when W.S. originally penned this play that this is what he had in mind.The pace is fast and intriguing with little wasted time. Character motivations are firmly established. Fassbender is enigmatic and compelling in the role of Macbeth. For anyone who has ever struggled with the so called "importance" of Shakespeare this movie reveals the depth of his insight into the human condition. Unlike many other interpretations of his plays this one cuts us to the quick and does so immediately and relentlessly throughout the film. It grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until Macbeth himself lets out his final words.Even if the language bores or intimidates you, WATCH IT! You will surprise yourself by how much you like it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning Grandness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Macbeth (2015) is as straightforward as a film adaptation of a Shakespeare play gets. Although the production and cinematography is undeniably rich and stunning, the real highlight is still the tragedy and language of the play. To those who are looking for a grand epic as the promotions suggested, it might disappoint them, though again it's all visually stunning, the movie doesn't let the action and warfare be just action and warfare. Just like the story, it's all about the tragedy, the cruelty and consequences. And it does them right with a perfectly bleak and grim tone, anyway. With performances that really spice up the scenery, Macbeth is an impressive piece of cinema.The movie mainly starts with a battle, but the real focus of that bombastic start is the atmosphere driven by the violence happening, even if they eventually won the war. Then Macbeth found three witches denoting that he will be king. This leads him to ambition and this ambition turns poison until he fulfills it as a tyrant. It's basic stuff, but again, as a Shakespeare play, it's all about the language. The visuals speaks through evident bleakness, but the dialogue speaks through madness. And it's actually quite effective, compellingly shows how their world crumble and so forth.The film allows the monologues to define these characters and the recipe for that is the leading actors. Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard seem they are born to be in this material; Fassbender brings the complexity of Macbeth while Cotillard brings the madness that she nearly steals the show. The supporting are also quite impressive filling up among the leads. The direction is downright stunning. Sure, it's basically just allowing for the language to flow, but the visuals just looks tremendous. There's a sense of grandness within this production, while the redness of the backdrops just fits on how harrowing things may get.Macbeth isn't the most overwhelming approach, again it's just too straightforward, but the story still is impacting enough, staying faithful on the text of Shakespeare. It embraces the mood, it focuses on the theme; if anything, the acting and the production is what makes it special, bringing grandness on the dialogue presented. To those who may be seeking for an epic, chances are there fights that is good looking, but then they aren't particularly action scenes. They're drama and really tremendously delivered drama. And that's how simple as this adaptation get.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By my humble opinion this is the best Shakespearean movie adaptation so far. Beautifully directed and edited, with a stunning cinematography, really haunting score and two magnificent performances by Fassbender and Cotillard, this undeniably cinematic experience is a mesmerizing adaptation of Shakespeare's classic tale of ambition, fear, guilt and madness. Even the slight changes in the story (particularly part with the "moving" Birnam Wood)have no negative effect and outcome on the final product. It captures the true spirit and the poetic greatness with remarkable eloquence. This adaptation definitely takes the prize from the Orson Welles version from 1948., and even Roman Polanski's movie from 1971.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gorgeous cinematography and color work. Gripping performances that are at times startlingly straightforward. Michael Fassbender carries a bleak, deathly weariness in his eyes, broken only in fleeting, manic moments that hint at the man war undid. Both he and Marion Cotillard play their familiar characters in a refreshingly unfamiliar way.There are more than a few subtle and respectful twists, alterations, or additions to the original text which elevated the film from being mere rote adaptation to being a really good film in its own right. Almost across the board, these directorial touches lend surprising depth to an already rich story. The last third in particular was enrapturing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Macbeth" is an excellent adaptation of Shakespeare's classic play about madness for power.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Shakespeare! I really do! I don't understand all of it, but I love it! The Bard's timeless themes and insights into human nature still ring true 500 years after his death. His sense of tragedy, drama and humor still entertain. Then there's the language, as beautiful as it is challenging to most modern ears. Many stage, screen and film Shakespeare adaptations have tried to make his plays more accessible by translating them to a more up-to-date way of speaking and some of those adaptations have been excellent, but there's no substitute for the real thing. It helps if you know enough history and literature to understand what you're hearing, but even if you can only catch a line here and there, if you're watching great actors and they're working for a great director, you should be able to follow and enjoy most productions of Shakespeare. A very good example of this is 2015's "Macbeth" (R, 1:53).Wait a minute. I doubt this is the situation of anyone out there, but just in case, if you happen to be reading this review aloud inside a theater, please stop now, go outside, turn around three times and wait for someone to invite you back in. And for the rest of this review, every time you come upon the name of the play, just be sure to refer to it as "The Scottish Play". Got it? Good. Onward and upward.The play "Macbeth" was probably written around the middle of Shakespeare's career as a playwright. It's the shortest of his tragedies, perhaps indicating that the version we have today is an abridged version of the original. Possibility due to its brevity, but probably owing more to its compelling story, the Scottish play has been one of the Bard's most popular. Struggling theaters have often turned to it as insurance against financial ruin (even though some of them went under anyway, possibly fueling the superstition to which I eluded in my previous paragraph). The play's action (with more fights and combat than most of Shakespeare's plays) and its popular themes of the desire for power and the price we pay for our decisions have entertained audiences for five centuries and spawned nearly 100 films.In the 2015 film version, previous Oscar nominee and future Oscar winner Daniel Fassbender (yeah, I just predicted something there) plays the titular anti-hero, and Oscar winner Marion Cotillard plays the scheming Lady Macbeth. Macbeth is a general in the army of the Scottish King Duncan I (David Thewlis) who is in the midst of fighting a civil war. After winning a major battle for his king, three mysterious women (witches) approach Macbeth on the battlefield and prophesy that he will get a promotion (which he finds out about right after this encounter) ? and that he will be king! When Macbeth returns home and tells his wife about the prophecy and that Duncan will be their guest for one night, she encourages Macbeth to kill Duncan and claim the crown. Macbeth is conflicted, but ultimately agrees.Macbeth steals into Duncan's tent and brutally stabs him, then Lady Macbeth disposes of the two daggers her husband used in the murder, framing the king's (drugged) guards. Duncan's son, Malcolm (Jack Reynor), discovers his father's body and flees in fear. This makes him look guilty of something, so after Macbeth kills the king's sleeping guards in a fit of mock rage, he is crowned King of Scotland in Duncan's place. As hard as Lady Macbeth tries to assure her husband that "it's over", it's anything but. Macbeth's lies compound and his murders multiply as he struggles to hold on to power ? and his sanity.This "Macbeth" is an excellent adaptation of Shakespeare's play. Writers Jacob Koskoff, Michael Lesslie and Todd Louiso stick very close to their source material, in the film's language and its major plot points. Fassbender and Cotillard are perfectly cast and wonderfully matched in the main roles. They seem to actually live the lives of Macbeth and his Lady as they use every intellectual, emotional and physical tool they have to make these characters real. Throughout the movie, the actors are framed and the script is supported by the confident direction of Justin Kurzel, the amazing cinematography of Adam Arkapaw and the magnificent score of actor/composer (and the director's younger brother) Jed Kurzel.I admit that I didn't catch some (a lot) of the dialog, but I appreciated the movie more after I read a summary of the story. (I'd advise anyone who doesn't know the play, but is thinking of seeing the movie to do the same. What you might lose in terms of surprises, you'll make up in overall appreciation of the film.) Still, I would have liked to understand more of the dialog on first viewing and I think that there were ways to accomplish that without losing the beauty of the language, but this adaptation is outstanding either way. It would be unfortunate if the characters speaking in old English kept anyone from choosing to see this film, which excels on multiple levels. "A-"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to Scotland, 16th century.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Local forecast call for partial clouds, pretty much threatening I'd say. Visibility is once again hampered by fog and wouldn't suggest a walk nearby Dunkan's (David Thewlis) palace. His General (Michael Fassbender) curses and murders everything, that gets on his way and seems capable of blocking the prophecy of his destiny. He and his Lady (Marion Cotillard) ignore the exit-polls and succeed, where others have failed. In order to secure the election victory for the crown, they kill and stab and decapitate. Thirsty for power, glories and blood, the diabolical pair is about to experience a king-sized fall.The thing that impresses you the most, in this Shakespearian cover, is how effectively, does the use of authentic language, work. I really think that it makes the words, sound still more worrying and barbarian, than they are. Mad Fassbender and First Lady Cotillard are exceptional in their roles and couldn't be more excited to see them work again with this director (the trio is expected to return next year, for the Assassin's Creed adaptation).Justin Kurzel has done an impressive job here. He slows down the bloody Braveheart action and boldly devotes his movie to the tragedies. Don't misunderstand me. His Macbeth is still harsh and graphic. But is also as fragile, as sexy and as emotional as it should be.for more: https://safekryptonite.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a big Shakespeare fan but the performances are great! 3/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: I was expecting this movie to be a modern day version of this all time classic but the director chose to stick with Shakespeare's words, which got on my nerves from the beginning to the end. I'm really not a fan of Shakespeare's writing but I heard great things about this film, especially the main characters acting but I personally fell asleep through most of this film. The action scenes were impressive at the beginning but as soon as they opened there mouths, I lost total interest. Its a shame, because Fassbender and Cotillard are great and there chemistry is extremely believable but the whole "thy" "thee" language just wasn't for me. When Macbeth starts to lose his mind, especially when he burns the bodies and loses his wife, there is a sense of intensity which I slightly enjoyed. With that aside, I did find the pace quite slow and the long, unnecessary speeches made it seem like it was never going to end. Anyway, this movie was definitely made for a specific audience in mind but I personally didn't enjoy it. Boring!Round-Up: I've become a bit of a Fassbender fan since his great performances in Haywire, Prometheus, the X-Men franchise and the weird and wonderful Frank, which was definitely out of his comfort zone. His performance in this movie was extremely intense and amazing in places so, although I didn't enjoy it, that is definitely not due to his commitment to the role. He is due to star in Assassin's Creed later on this year after the release of X-Men: Apocalypse and Weightless with Christian Bale so he is definitely showing that he can star in various types of movies. Everyone is waiting for Alien: Covenant, which is due to be released next year and because of the popularity of his character in Prometheus, I'm sure he will be making an appearance in the Ridley Scott classic. Anyway, this is the first major release for Australian born &nbsp;Justin Kurzel, who is due to direct Assassin's Creed. He certainly got the most out of the actors and his interpretation of Macbeth is true to Shakespeare's writing but you need to be into that type of dialogue to enjoy this movie. It did look authentic and the costume department done a great job but it's just not my cup of tea.Budget: $15-20million Worldwide Gross: $12.6millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/war movies starring Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard, Paddy Considine, David Thewlis, Jack Reynor, David Hayman, Sean Harris and Brian Nickels. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a film soaked in blood and the wonders of Fassbender and Cotillard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The things that Justin Kurzwel's new film of Shakespeare's Macbeth are the sense of place that feels so authentic as to bordering on documentary-level, which is then off-set by the surreal, hellish sense of color (various shades of red make this so vivid as to be piercing to the senses at times), and then the performances, which are authentic to the point of feeling like these actors could leap off the screen.Surely if you haven't seen the adaptations by Welles or Polanski, or still the best Kurosawa's Throne of Blood, see those first. But it was playing near me in the city, it has Michael Fassbender digging so deeply as well as Marion Cotillard in the titular role and Lady Macbeth respectively that you feel like they almost forget they're acting in these parts, and thus it was a foregone conclusion to see it (David Thewlis also has a few good scenes as a certain obstacle in Macbeth's path). Luckily it's directed and presented with a firm degree of darkness and intensity, and while it may be SO much of a dirge into the dirt and heavy Scottish accents that you'll pray to get sunshine outside the theater, it's some strong art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Physical presence over spiritual drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Justin Kurtzel, the Australian director of Snowtown, tries to predetermine the Macbeths' unassuagable grief for a dead child becoming vaulting ambition, with them burying a dead child at the solemn start of the film, without embedding this in the drama. Macbeth goes onto burn later on McDuff's children and wife with his own hands. Fassbender and Cotillard are stars with charisma on screen,there are many close ups of their sexual chemistry.The Scottish landscape is a key player in this moody drama, one of harsh exteriors,foggy,cold,bleak,dank, containing the shimmer of violence. This approach is very much an invention, cutting the text to 25%.Macbeth and Banquo encounter 3 witches after putting down the uprising against Duncan (Thewlis),who predict that Macbeth will become King. The Macbeths decide to murder Duncan. Cotillard's Lady Macbeth is played with reigned-in delicacy, invoking spirits before candle-lit pictures, she seems to be withdrawn., sidelined. The battle scenes are like a slowed-down slaughterhouse ( a nod to Welles's Chimes at Midnight?) with hack-and-slash, interspersed with a roaring tumult. The supernatural elements are down-played, so the witches are very real, appearing out of the mist or as quiet observers at a funeral or appearing at moments of crisis; similarly the spectral dagger is held by the dead boy from the battlefield, who is swallowed by the smoke. Banquo's ghost is a living presence at the banquet among the guests.Kurtzel gets the Scottish-accented cast to mutter rather than declaim, he wants the verse to arise out of the context it is in. But what is apparent is that the meaning of the verse is lost in the fog of the film, whose visuals are superb:the camera sways, as if blown by the wind in an unstable world. If you are aware of the Welles's version or Polanki's, you will feel sorely let down. Usually verse taps into the inner lives of the characters, as it maintains the thrilling momentum, but here you get Fassbender reaching for the gestures of sociopathy, giggling, brooding,grinning. Go with a good memory of the text or you will be confused what they are saying. That could send you to sleep. The give-away is "based on Shakespeare's Macbeth",gutted.No energy,no flow,charismatic style over substance, where were the words and poetry?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First of all, this is not a film, it's an experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Shakespeare's classic tales has been brought to a whole new level, as we enter the real dark world of Macbeth and the pain, guilt, and bloodshed forged from this mind blowing masterpiece. A soon as the film begins we are in the middle of a battle. We're not watching it, we're in it. The heart pounding sounds of the soldiers, the marvellous editing, makes the audience feel in the battle as you hear the fighting commence.Michel Fassbender gives a breath taking performance with power, and passion, along with an excellent cast behind him. With such passion in their tone, we instantly listen to the poetic dialogue especially from the voices of Fassbender, Harris, and Debicki. The music within the film is so powerful and moving it creates the exact atmosphere that we are thinking, and creates the dark and tragic themes of the story. There are also moments that are so beautiful, such as the battle scenes which you just admire.Although we do not see the manipulative Lady Macbeth as in the original story, and we have Macbeth as a much stronger and fearful character that has no weakness, at all. All been said, this is still a brilliant adaptation.This is an absolute must see, even if you have to drive to another town to see it. This is a 9/10 and strongly recommended to all Shakespeare lovers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning, average adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although stylistically brilliant, Macbeth does little to propel itself beyond the simple label of a good adaption. The swooping cinematography, extreme close-ups and arty use of colour and smoke are visually stunning and the best aspects of the film. The acting is sublime too, with Marion Cotillard playing a typically evil Lady Macbeth and Michael Fassbender portraying Macbeth's dark character arc with vigour and intensity. There is not a bad acting performance in the film - equally impressive is the rugged moorland scenery of Scotland, reflecting the bleak tale. Thankfully the original dialogue is used, although rough accents at times obscure the language, whole scenes are omitted and the Shakespearean words are difficult to follow. Unfortunately this is enhanced by the pacing, as the story seems to develop extremely slowly, causing me to feel lethargic and lose patience with the ancient dialogue. Layers of mud and warpaint mask the character's faces, making it difficult to tell one war-wearied Scotsman from another; and there is the ghost of a young man who appears, throat slit, at tense moments for no apparent reason. The music, although scant, is sorrowful and emotive at the right moments. Naturally, the story of Macbeth is centuries old - but the success of recent medieval-period shows/films (Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings) makes me feel that this adaptation lacks innovation in its narrative and use of bloody violence.Macbeth's high-brow technical aspects (intricate camera-work, masterful set-piece layouts, and use of colour) elevate it slightly beyond an average adaptation. However, if the number of people who walked out of the cinema is anything to go by, it is more of a critical success than a public one.</fullReview>

I did love the cinematography and from the very first scene in the film, it did make a good impression. Despite the language barrier, I was constantly appreciating the scenes visually.The good thing is after that first quarter of hiatus, I grew increasingly inclined to the story and couldn't help but witness how great and perfect Micheal Fassbender and Marion Cotillard were for their roles!

		<fullReview>2015 has been a very good year for movies, and Macbeth was one of the top two, along with Chi-Raq. Both are visual and aural stunning master works. If you can, see Macbeth on the big screen with a good sound system. Your DVD/Netflix/TV won't capture the phenomenal film-making. But if you have to watch it at home, pipe the sound through your best speakers.What so impressed me about Macbeth, was they took it out from the stage and threw it like a witches's brew into the dank winds, slush and fogs of the surreal Scottish highlands. That location - a mixture of red shadows and heavy clouds was integral to the cinematic experience. In a cinema age where special effects are so dominant, this felt natural while at the same time - consuming.Remember, this movie is done by Australians, and they seem to exalt the environment and find the mysterious forces within it to advance the story.Also fantastic for the live cinema experience was the sound-scape of the highland winds, feet tromping through dirt and sod, the supernatural spirits, the hollow states room.The acting and the pacing were terse and unrelenting. The aspirations, plots, folly, madness and murder! made sense. (Although I confess to reading the French subtitles when I got lost in the Scottish bough). This is one of Shakespeare's most read or staged plays, and perhaps one of the best modern cinema renditions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Macbeth is one of the best films of the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest film adaptation of Shakespeares iconic play has arrived. This time the lead role is inhabited by Micheal Fassbender. Who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors working today. With every film he is in he seems to get better and better. Each role he is in he takes on perfectly. Not once has he felt miscast. 'Macbeth' is no exception. His performance in this hefty role is nothing short of superb. He is able to show the grief and inner turmoil that his character is experiencing at any given moment. It's an Oscar worthy performance that may very well be overlooked. In fact, this entire film will most likely be overlooked come award season. It's an unfortunate fact that has plagued recent award seasons. Every year there are great films, like this, that are passed over because they don't have the buzz some of the other films do. Although, this can be ignored if this film receives, at least, a nomination for its cinematography. It's clear from the first shot in the film how much effort was put into the cinematography. Every moment of this film is breathtaking. Even basic scenes of back and forth talking are gorgeous to look at. We get beautiful wide shots of vast mountains shrouded in fog and haunting close ups on characters faces. This is only made better by riveting direction from Justin Kurzel. His control over the film is awe inspiring. The film is under such tight control that the weather itself becomes a character. It displays such an impressive attention to detail. And near everything is shot on location. These vast landscapes give the film the beautiful yet haunting feel the film needs.Having the film play out outside of sound stages is able to give these actors a setting that they can legitimately react to. That being said, this film is one of the best acted films of the year. Even if it was entirely filmed on a sound stage it probably wouldn't have mattered. Cotillard and Fassbender are absolutely brilliant in this film. In a film that is heavy with monologues their honest performances are able to drive through even the hardest spots. And there are a couple of these moments. One specific sequence before the concluding fight scene is particularly difficult to sit through. In a film that cuts out a lot of unnecessary fat, this scene feels very out of place. During this ten minute spot the film screeches to halt. Fortunately, the film recognizes this and hustles into the best part of the entire film. The fight between Macbeth and Macduff. It's an impressively shot and choreographed scene that is infected with emotion. It does everything you'd want from a faithful adaptation of the play while also being separate from all the others. It's a gorgeous film that brings out the best from everyone involved thanks to impressive attention to detail from director Justin Kurzel. 'Macbeth' is a powerhouse of a film that deserves to be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Macbeth is as intoxicating a cinematic experience as one could ask for!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review was first published at www.thisisfilm.com: Oh, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife! Every single frame in Justin Kurzel's Macbeth plays bloody and spectacular homage to the ghosts of William Shakespeare's most morbid of plays. Just as I had hoped, the film is a viscerally charged visual onslaught that is every bit as intense, hypnotic and grisly as the previews promised it to be. Sure we've seen many different interpretations and adaptations of Shakespeare's tragic masterpiece of ambition, deception, murder and evil, but nothing as ferociously wicked as this. Australian director Kurzel (whose debut feature Snowtown made him the ideal choice for this project) has made a harrowing feature that is incredibly difficult viewing, therefore making it even more impossible to recommend to general audiences. What immediately stands out, is how unafraid these filmmakers were of taking the knife to the classic tale and making it their own, while still remaining respectful and reverent to the play's immortal legacy. Screenwriters Todd Louiso, Jacob Koskoff and Michael Lesslie have certainly embellished on some of the Bard's verses, inventing new scenes and adding back stories (deceased children) that weren't originally there. The script has also been readjusted to fit a conventional three-act structure. Equally as precarious, is Kurzel's choice of accent, which certainly emphasizes the 'Scottish' part of the Scottish play. While this may prove difficult for some to understand, others will applaud the effort to produce a raw and rich authenticity that the play's famed lines demand of their performers.With a truly superb supporting cast that includes Paddy Considine, Sean Harris and David Thewlis, the film soars into Awards discussions thanks to the unflinching and searing performances by Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard, who have confirmed to me their position as the two finest actors working today.Kurzel's camera, with its mixture of wide slow-motion shots and claustrophobic close ups, creates the perfect platform for both leads to demonstrate their unequaled acting range and pedigree. Cotillard's static long take, as she delivers the famed Lady Macbeth mental breakdown scene, is as expertly restrained as it is overwrought with heartbroken ferocity. Not to be outdone, Fassbender delivers believable menace and madness, as he brings Macbeth's torturous soliloquies to life in ways no other actor could do.Even when not employing the Bard's iambic pentameter, each performer exudes a myriad of emotional textures and touches, that should be examined at length by acting classes studying realism and naturalism across the globe. Aided by Adam Arkapaw's striking and scintillating cinematography and Jed Kurzel's droning and haunting score, Macbeth is as intoxicating a cinematic experience as one could ask for. The film is a brooding and unrelenting dissection of a man's downward spiral towards self annihilation. Macbeth is catered only to those who can stomach the thought of watching a tyrant slowly twisting and severing off his humanity until all who surround him have vanquished in the colorless and bloodied Scottish marshes.</fullReview>

From Fassbender and Cotillard's intense acting, the bleak yet dramatic setting of Scotland's highlands, the costumes and the haunting score were all out of this world. Now when I normally love all of the above in a film I usually find myself watching an epic piece of cinema and yet with Macbeth I feel so... Depressed! Depressed is how this film made me feel. It was so bleak, intense and Art house it sank it's grim little fingers into the pit of my soul and abused me so hard that any happy thought I had left were snatched away. Not even seeing Fassbender semi naked in wet pants couldn't give me any joy. Don't get me wrong I love to feel abused like the next person, I just like to feel either anger and enjoyment not Depression and emptiness. Ps. I Really needed subtitles with this as there Scottish accents were so strong it sounded like they were talking in riddles. "5/10 or 8/10 I just don't know" says ***the_beauman***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Regardless of some impenetrable accents, the population of medieval Scotland seem to be subject to an asthma epidemic which means it can only communicate in whispers. Very slow whispers. And no wonder Mrs Glamis is so desperate to be queen. Whilst the king lives in a huge castle which encompasses the vast Ely Cathedral with its beautiful stained glass, the most senior aristocracy dwell in one room wooden huts, worryingly lit by dozens of naked candles. Mme Macbeth's French accent would imply that she's maybe been used to something more chic. When Mac Jnr (the director's addition to the story) dies in battle, dad doesn't think to include the news in his letter home but when he arrives back at the cabin, wifey doesn't enquire as to the whereabouts of young Hamish so it's probably no big deal. Having become boss, nobody takes much notice of Mac the Knife's orders - even his wife, who ignores his instruction to get the single malt flowing whilst he confers with a murderer within earshot of the dinner guests. You can't put Shakespeare on screen without taking a few liberties and some ruthless editing but why bother keeping any of the original dialogue unless you're going to utilise it ? I want to HEAR that bitch say "Unsex me here ... Come to my woman's breasts and take my milk for gall" otherwise just cut the damn line. Kurosawa ditched all the Shakespeare text for his magnificent 'Throne of Blood'. Orson Welles and Roman Polanski stuck with it and whilst both of their films are flawed, the narrative is clear. Can those who don't know the play follow the plot in a version where Lady M's "damned spot" isn't a bloodstain but the windswept location of her old hovel and the four witches' (yes, four) predictions are often inaudible ? And why retain the lines about Macduff's wife (another Frenchwoman) and kids being murdered in his castle when we've seen them sent into hiding and then slaughtered in a forest ? I worry that people unfamiliar with Shakespeare will think it's a potentially good action movie slowed down by a lot of olde worlde gibberish. I don't think anyone has ever spoken so slowly whilst making so little sense and the breakneck speed of the author's shortest and most frightening tragedy is further impeded by lengthy shots of figures traversing landscape. Fassbender is pretty good and there's an impressive Macduff from Sean Harris (pilloried for mumbling in the BBC 'Jamaica Inn' but here the most consistently intelligible person on screen). It's visually stunning and there are several great innovations : Macbeth's slain son offers the ghostly dagger for the big soliloquy and Banquo's son, Fleance reappears at the end, adding an unsettling note. Birnam Wood.... well I won't spoil that bit as it's particularly clever. Now go watch the Orson Welles version. It even has the guy who used to play Batman's butler in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>? good retelling of Shakespeares play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the trailer for Macbeth I really wanted to see it and I must say that I did enjoy this film. The premise of this film follows the Shakespeare play where Macbeth convinced by his wife commits a crime to become king of Scotland as they both slowly start to lose their mind. I love Michael fassbender as he was truly great in this film. He did a great job of selling the humanity of Macbeth which ends up becoming a lack of humanity from Macbeth and you really buy it. Marion cottilard plays lady Macbeth and I thought she did a pretty good job, I didn't care about her character as much as fassbender and I thought she wasn't as strong as I wanted her to be. The rest of the supporting cast didn't really stand out at all which was a disappointment considering macduff and banquo in particular are big characters for the plot. The story is good as it truly shows how one act of greed can change a person and you see Macbeth slowly transition into madness. However, as I said before I don't believe they gave the character of lady Macbeth enough to do and enough of a reason to care about her story. The script is the big talking point in this film because it is all in the old Shakespearean English and at times it is really hard to understand what people are saying. However, in some of the more dramatic scenes I thought it worked pretty well. The style of this film is beautiful, all the cinematography was great and the action scenes felt very heavy hitting. Overall I enjoyed this film and if you have any interest in the source material then you should see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying I'm not a fan of Justin Kurzel's new screen version of "Macbeth". To be honest I found it something of an endurance test. This is a 'Macbeth' shorn of swathes of Shakespeare's poetry. Nothing intrinsically wrong with that; shortening Shakespeare or making him more 'user-friendly' I can deal with, (oh that Kenneth Branagh had taken the hint with his bum-numbing 4 hour HAMLET), but this is a 'Macbeth' basically comprised of nothing more than a bloody battle, (shot mostly in slo-mo), followed by one murder after another, (not since Alan Clarke's TV film ELEPHANT, about the Northern Ireland troubles, have I seen a film so given over to killing), and by stripping it down to its bare bones Kurzel robs it, not just of the poetry, but the plot as well.Unless you are very familiar with the play it becomes almost impossible to tell who is who other, of course, than the Macbeth's who are, at least, centre screen most of the time. Fassbender isn't really up to the part but Cotillard is outstanding even if her role seems to be sidelined. No-one else makes much of an impression. On the plus side Adam Arkapaw's dark, 'naturalistic' cinematography is excellent but Jed Kurzel's dirge-like score does the film no favors at all. Watching this will take more out of you than climbing Ben Nevis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Macbeth" is the newest take on the famous work by William Shakespeare and director Justin Kurzel got 2 of the finest actors from their generation to play the main characters in this one: Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard. We read Macbeth at school and I must say I did not like it at all. Then again, I am generally not too big on Shakespeare. Anyway, compared to what I remember from the book, this movie was certainly a positive surprise. I probably only watched it because Cotillard is in here and I truly adore her. Huge fan. I think from what you see and what you hear, this is a really good film. Music, cinematography, acting, costumes and makeup are all pretty impressive aspects and what can you say about the story. It's pretty legendary and certainly memorable. Initially, it seems Cotillard's character may be as evil as her husband, but that changes as the film goes on. Macbeth descends slowly, but steadily into an abyss of lust for blood and paranoia that results in uncountable deaths.The only thing I really remembered from reading the book was the murder of the King, but he is not the only one who gets it. Also Macbeth's closest friend is targeted and killed because he may have been a danger in the long run with the witches' predictions. At least his son lived. My only problem with this movies was a crucial problem, however: the language. Some may disagree, but I definitely would have preferred them to not take the Shakespearian words, but make it actually more modern, so everybody would understand what was going on. Luckily, I had subtitles and they really helped a lot. Without them, it would have been impossible to understand 50% of the dialogue probably and the meaning that came with these 50%. So, in terms of the words, for my taste they stayed too close on the book. Apart from that, it was a pretty good watch. I also liked the strong metaphoric use of the color red throughout the entire movie, but especially at the end. Thumbs up and I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm on the fence when talking about Shakespeare. I'm not in love with his work despite knowing the significance he had on English and writing in general. I can sit down and watch his movies and I can understand the language. Macbeth is something that I haven't seen any adaptation of aside from Throne Of Blood. I consider seeing that movie first spoiling myself for this one because I can't help but compare to Throne Of Blood and in almost all elements this falls short.The story, A high ranking soldier in the King's army is told by a supernatural force that he will be promoted and eventually be King. He seizes an opportunity to do so and eventually becomes a tyrant. With life crumbling around him and people running off to join the resistance against him and eventually gets murdered by his opposition.My complaints with the movie?... It's trying too hard to grab Oscars. The first couple of minutes inter-cuts them charging to the battle, the very slow-motion shot of them hitting and him in the middle of the battle staring and the witches to indicate what it is he's staring at. It just feels that scenes like this were less about telling a story and more "That awards Best Cinematography or best Editing right?!". Thankfully it does get better and I know this is a nitpick but I didn't really like some of the uses of shaky-cam. Oh and HERE is the complaint I think even film and hardcore Shakespeare nuts will agree with me on. Where was "Double Double, toil and trouble! Fire Burn and cauldron bubble!"? It's EASILY the most famous quotation of the play and when I watched it's nowhere to be seen.Okay onto the compliments. The acting is brilliant. I said almost all elements fail in comparison to Throne Of Blood but one element that doesn't is Michael Fassbender as Macbeth (although compare the two and they're neck in neck) Oh and also Lady Macbeth. I said I didn't like uses of shaky-cam but the cinematography is brilliant in this movie. The final scene in particular is brilliant. I also really liked the story and everything in this movie looks cold, obviously symbolizing the nature of the plot.I'd say if you want to see this movie, go if you know and enjoy the story. This cuts a lot out that you may barely know the characters by the end. It still has some really good elements in it but I'd suggest to instead watch the much superior Throne Of Blood instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Macbeth is ultimately lacking a clear stylistic identity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At a screening of Macbeth, an elderly couple cackled to each other when told the name of this website and asked if this film could become a video game. Perhaps Macbeth Effect I thought. This critic's mind isn't full of scorpions. It's a legitimate question about what form Shakespeare's work will take in the future, as it's appropriated to contemporary mediums like modern cinema and video games. These are competing modes and sometimes intertwined in their bid to capture the attention of the broadening mass market. In adapting Shakespeare to cinema, it's not essential to retain the original Early Modern English dialogue but to express the thematic content of the stories within distinct images because cinema is, rather uniquely, a predominantly visual medium. But Australian director Justin Kurzel, who last made the local murder thriller Snowtown (2011) before shifting to Hollywood, has struggled to translate Macbeth into a cinematic form, despite being aided by heavyweight actors Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard, playing Macbeth and his scheming wife.Full review at: http://www.impulsegamer.com/macbeth-film-review/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drop The Dead Baby</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The people who will get the most out of this new version of Macbeth are those who saw the Polanski version because they will now know that nothing could be as bad as that and people who never saw the Orson Welles version because they don;t know just how well it can be done. The thing about Shakespeare of course is that every semi- amateur thinks he is the one who has cracked it and too many times these semi-amateurs have names like Baz Luhrmann and Roman Polanski who have the aspirations to make Citizen Kane and the talent to make a road company Gidget Goes Hawaaian. Which brings us to this latest offering; again we are in the hands of someone who knows just how to improve it into a failure, beginning with something masquerading as a music score sounding as if it were cobbled together by Michael Nyman whilst in an induced coma. Then comes an opening scene which Shakespeare did not feel it necessary to include or even allude to, in which a dead baby is cremated as the Macbeths - possibly the parents - look on. If we exclude Marion Cotillard who offers by far the finest performance the whole thing is good for a tax-break only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'What is done, is done.' -Lady MacbethWalking into the cinema... How does Shakespeare continue to dominate cinema? A language of yesteryear and by- gone cultures, but the timelessness of his work continues to show how little mankind has changed over the years. The question is can Michael Fassbender carry the mantle of the greats who have taken on this role in the past? Overall Rating: 3 stars Cinematic rating: 4 stars Bigger questions rating: 3 stars Do you remember your English Literature class and the infamous line, 'Out, damned spot?' Lady Macbeth's struggle with guilt and regret that epitomises the narrative of Shakespeare's drama. Macbeth is a classic storyline that involves revenge, murder, mental illness and betrayal. For those who may have missed that week on The Bard's play, here is a basic summery. The central character Macbeth (Michael Fassbender) is a duke of Scotland and an accomplished leader of men on the battlefield. After a key victory for his king and country, he receives a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he would become King of Scotland. During the celebration of his victory, he remains consumed by this vision and eventually conspires with his wife (Marion Cotillard) to make this vision a reality. Their plot leads to a series of events that end with the assassination of the king and Macbeth's eventual ascension to the throne. Throughout the transition to kingship, Macbeth and his lady suffer through the mental anguish of their evil choices that brought them to power. Ultimately showing that what is done in secret will eventually be exposed. Michael Fassbender plays one of the most bloody and visceral of Shakespeare's theatrical creations and is exceptionally tantalising in the role. His portrayal as the tragic king is mesmerising. He effectively leads this film with the support of an incredible cast that delivers on the expectation of this timeless tale. Director Justin Kurzel (The King's Speech) provides a modern spin on this classic tale of murder and deception. Even though the slow motion sequences do become tiresome, over all, he utilises the Scottish landscape as another character to capture the look and feel of horror that comes from this story of betrayal. The material and the talent provide the needed lift for this murky journey into the depths of human emotion. For those who are not familiar with this time-honoured story, be aware that Macbeth is exceptionally violent and contains disturbing themes. The biggest challenge for this film will be breaking out of the English department at the local university and into the hearts of the general populace. It might seem sacrilegious to challenge the usage of this classic dialect, but know that the critique is not of the content of the script. The challenge is found in modern ears. People have difficulty understanding this bygone era's application of the English language. The Shakespearean wording is for the classically trained in theatrical productions, but makes for a difficult cinematic experience. Watching this drama gave off the feeling of 'enjoy it, because it is good for you. Whenever something has the 'it is good for you' label, it tends to be difficult to swallow. Albeit it is beautifully adapted for the silver screen, it might be a stretch for people to understand or enjoy the experience. Not to be misunderstood, this film was entertaining and faithful to the source material, but lacks enough of a modern spin to connect with modern audiences. Leaving the cinema... To appreciate the classic tale, it is worth knowing the story prior to entering the theatre. For the Shakespeare purists, this will be satisfying, but for the general audiences this will be hard to understand. REEL DIALOGUE: What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What does the Bible say about guilt? (Psalm 103:11-12, 1 John 1:9) 2. Can we ever find justice? (Proverbs 21:15, Romans 12:19) 3. What does the Bible say about aspiring to leadership? (Jeremiah 29:11, John 16:33)Written by Russell Matthews based on a five star rating system @ Russelling Reviews #russellingreviews #macbethfilm</fullReview>
