		<shortDescription>A really sweet and innocent comedy about a girl who babysits but has to take a tour downtown.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a really funny movie because you never really know where it's going. Basically everything that happens in it happens by accident. It's not only funny but also exciting if you aren't that old. I think it's great.It sort of reminds me about "Afterhours" (starring Griffin Dunne) but this is the family version of that movie. Anything can happen during a crazy night or so it seems. Elisabeth Shue is good in this movie and everyone in it seems to have had a good time making it. If you just want to see a cute movie which makes you feel good , or if you've had enough of over-dramatic epics , action that blows you out of your seat and bloody horror movies , check this out. It's sweet , funny , lovable and adventurous all at the same time. If you don't like it , there are more than enough of violence out there for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why does this movie have such a low rating on this site? This is such a good movie! Ok, I'll admit, the story is pretty odd, but it's still very good, and it's a great adventure.All the actors do a great job in the film. Elizabeth Shue looks as beautiful as ever and does a great job as Chris Parker. Keith Coogan does a great job as well. Other notable cast members are Vincent D'Onofrio, Penelope Ann Miller, Geroge Newbern, Bradley Whitford, and Lolita Davidovich. Also, I have to hand it to director Chris Columbus, he did a superb job with this film. Amazingly enough, this was his first directorial effort too. Good job Chris! It's always good to see where directors come from, if you didn't know, he went on to do "Home Alone", "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York", "Mrs. Doubtfire", "Bicentennial Man", and "Harry Potter: The Sorcerer's Stone", just to name a few.There are so many good things about this film! This movie's got action, adventure, and comedy. The comedy in the film is absolutely fantastic! There are a few scenes that crack me up just thinking about them. ...And there are a great number of quotable lines that everyone that has seen this movie will remember.Anyhow, I strongly suggest you see this film! I really hope that you enjoy the film if you haven't seen it already. Thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is one awesome movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Adventures in Babysitting" is a movie that I'll never forget. One of the reasons why this film is so memorable is because of the Chicago locations. For the past 25 years or so there have been lots of good movies shot in and around Chicago (as well as the suburbs) such as "Risky Business", "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", and "The Fugitive" just to name a few. But "Adventures in Babysitting" is probably my favorite movie to be made in Chicago. I saw this movie when it first came out in the summer of 1987 (a year after "Ferris Bueller" which "Adventures" bares somewhat of a resemblence to) and while I was watching the film it felt to me like I was part of the adventure. Today, this is still a very entertaining picture, and a lot of fun. Elisabeth Shue is terrific in her first leading role as Chris Parker, a 17-year-old high school senior who prepares for a big date with her boyfriend at the beginning of the film. But he cancels the date, and since she's now free for the night, she's asked to babysit for the Anderson kids. She agrees. Once she gets over there, she gets a frantic phone call from her best friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller) who's run away from home and is now stranded at a bus station in downtown Chicago. Terrified after witnessing a shooting, Brenda asks Chris to pick her up because she blew all her money on the cab ride to the bus station. Hesitant, Chris has no choice but to take the two Anderson kids Sara (Maia Brewton) and Brad (Keith Coogan) with her to pick up poor Brenda. Also going along for the ride, Brad's horny best friend Daryl (Anthony Rapp). Once they get on the expressway, things start to go wrong. Very wrong. This is where "Adventures in Babysitting" turns into a fun movie. The foursome experience car troubles; run-ins with a friendly car thief, a mob group the thief works for (who spend most of the movie chasing the kids through the streets of Chicago), and two gangs on a train; a short trip to a hospital (when one of the kids is slightly injured by a member of one of those gangs); a brief stop at a frat party; a chase to the top of a high-rise building; and a show stopping classic scene in a blues bar. And much more happens as the hapless Brenda continues to wait and wait and wait for Chris to come get her. "Adventures in Babysitting" was directed by Chris Columbus in his directing debut after writing screenplays for a couple of Steven Spielberg produced movies ("Gremlins", "The Goonies", and "Young Sherlock Holmes"). Since this film, Columbus has gone on to direct some of the biggest box office hit comedies of all-time such as "Home Alone", "Home Alone 2", and "Mrs. Doubtfire". "Adventures in Babysitting" was nowhere near as big a hit as those films, but it did modestly well. I would have loved to see a sequel to this. It would have been interesting to see what kind of misadventures were next for Chris and company. Shue, Brewton, Coogan, and Rapp all seem to be having a blast on screen, and I would too if I were up their on the screen. Even though Miller doesn't seem to be having a good time, she's a scream as Brenda (she would later show off some real good acting in "Kindergarten Cop" and "Awakenings"). And Vincent D'Onofrio (of "Men in Black" and currently "The Cell") has one of his first film roles in a very small part as the owner of a auto repair shop (where the broken down car gets fixed). "Adventures in Babysitting" is a movie that's great fun from start to finish and never lets up. This comedy/adventure is awesome!**** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For an unknown (to me) reason, when I saw this on British TV, it was called "A Night On The Town", a far inferior title than 'Adventures in Babysitting', although maybe they figured that parents would think this a children's movie...Anyway, the movie itself is charming in that way that only 1980s US comedy films are. There is an air of innocence to the whole thing, before these more conscious and overtly cynical days that we know and hate now - maybe a reason why 1980s retro is all the rage now... that, and things are cyclical.I thought the film WAS charming, although entirely far-fetched in its plot lines, although I think that was kind of the point. The characters, while not being very complicated, were warm and at least not entirely two-dimensional, and the little girl was quite cute and not extremely annoying as could have happened.Overall, I'd recommend it to hounds who love to watch 80s films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Adventures in Babysitting" is an underrated gem featuring a very strong young cast. The movie opens with Chris Parker (played by Elizabeth Shue in a very early starring role) first finding out that her boyfriend can't make their big date that night. So she agrees to babysit Sara and Brad Anderson, played by Maia Brewton and Keith Coogan (both of whom have dropped off the face of the earth, apparently, in the last 10 or 15 years). Sara's kind of a brat, and Brad has a crush on Chris. Brad's best friend Daryl (played by Anthony Rapp, who went on to appear in "Dazed and Confused" and "Road Trip"), who is an annoying wise-ass, also drops by. Things go okay until Chris gets a call from her best friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller), who says that she ran away from home, and is now stuck at a bus station in the city with no money and no way home, and of course she can't call her parents. This prompts Chris to take the kids (including Daryl) on a little trip, and of course, hilarious hijinks ensue.They have a tire blow-out, and are helped by a mechanic with a hook for a hand. Their car is then stolen, and they go to try to get it back. They're caught by the mobsters running the car ring, and have to escape (which they achieve by walking along a very thin metal beam overhead). But the mobsters catch them trying to leave, forcing them on the run and leading to one of the funniest scenes in the movie: going through a blues club, the singer stops them, saying "Ain't nobody leaves here without singing the blues." So they do, Chris leading, singing a song about their predicament. It's both cute and hilarious, with the others joining in singing back-up ("And we should be in bed!").The rest of the movie is about them being chased through the city by these mobsters, and of course, there's one funny bit after another, with some suspenseful bits thrown in for good measure. This is all hilarious, but the best scenes are the ones interspersed throughout with Brenda trying to get along at the bus station. Penelope Ann Miller truly steals the show; scared out of her skull, she has to contend with such problems as a bum yelling at her to get out of his "house" (a phone booth); getting her glasses stolen by a bag lady (the look on the bag lady's face when she puts them on and realizes she can see is priceless); a hot dog vendor who won't help her out ("Then I don't have a wiener!" he says when she says she doesn't have any cash); and a jumbo-sized sewer rat she tries to rescue, thinking it's a cute little kitty cat (because she can't see). This is probably the best part Penelope Ann Miller has ever had, and she demonstrates a surprising talent for screwball comedy.Like I said, the rest of the young cast is great; Shue pretty much began her career here, and Coogan, Rapp, and Brewton (who was also very funny on the also underrated TV show "Parker Lewis Can't Lose", which I'm dying to see come out on DVD) put in funny, though clichéd, parts. "Adventures in Babysitting" is one of those movies that just sounded kind of dumb based on the title (like "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"), but if you haven't seen it, give it a try anyway; the brilliant gags and the strong acting made it work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of those movies you grow out of, but don't stop liking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up with this movie and always wanted to be like Chris. She was so beautiful and handled the toughest situations so well. She took the deadliest situations and got the kids out of them so safely. Well, now I babysit and I'm glad I never got in the same situation, but it still made for a great and fun movie.Chris is a senior who has a big date planned with her boyfriend, but when he cancels, she is forced to babysit the Anderson's daughter, Sara. They also have a son, Brad is a couple years younger and has a huge crush on Chris and decides to cancel on his friend, Darrel to stay home with Chris. But when Chris's best friend, Brenda, calls her from the Anderson's, she finds out her friend is stranded at a bus station and can't get anyone else to help her. So Chris takes Brad and Sara and is forced to take Darrel since he won't leave them alone, they all go into the city of Chicago and end up getting a flat and get into one deadly situation after the next, even getting chased by the Mafia! This is a fun flick that I still watch 'til this day and have so much fun with. I would always recommend this also for anyone, I truly hope it is discovered by new generations. I still enjoy singing along with the "Babysitting Blues", I think I finally feel Chris's pain, after all, I'm too old to babysit. :D 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Babysitting Was Never This Much Fun For Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie in the late 1980's I thought to myself how whenever I had babysat I had had a pretty boring night stuck in front of a TV hoping the kids wouldn't wake up crying and spoil the peace. How I wish they had been more like this movie.Elizabeth Shue plays Chris Parker who is babysitting one night but due to certain circumstances ends up taking the kids out on the town in order to pick up one of her friends. What follows is all sorts of adventures involving thugs, crooks, thieves, the lot. The film is totally funny to watch and has some really good scenes in. Two that come to mind involve a fight between two gangs on a train and one involving the god of Thunder Thor (well, not the Thor you would be expecting).This is an exciting movie which was typical of 1980's movies. Boy, I wish they could make movies like that now. The 80's has got to be the best decade ever for films of all genres and this movie is just one of many great comedy films of that era. Oh and by the way, I think Elizabeth Shue is beautiful and I believe this was her best role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't want to go see this movie back in '87 with my kids, but I was dragged into it. The movie was awesome then, and it still remains a great movie. Why? The music. Anyone even remotely interested in "The Blues" as a music genre should have this DVD in their library. Not only do you get some great blues music as part of the scoring, the incidental Blues Club Scene, vintage Chicago, pulls this out of the ordinary to a slam for music lovers.And, ... how about the straggling scene after the credits, which is standard today. Heck, I'm in my 50s, and I still have to pull this movie out to hear the harp licks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cult-Movie for the Entire Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the suburbs of Chicago, the seventeen year-old Chris Parker (Elisabeth Shue) is in love with her boyfriend Mike (Bradley Whitford). When Mike stands her up and cancels their dinner in Chicago, Chris accepts to babysit the siblings Sara (Maia Brewton) and Brad (Keith Coogan). But her friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller) calls her telling that she decided to run away home but now she has repented; she begs Chris to rescue her from the bus station in downtown Chicago. Chris makes a deal with Sara and Brad and when she is ready to drive to downtown, Brad's friend Daryl (Anthony Rapp) overhears the negotiation and blackmails Chris to go with them. However, when they are on the expressway, Chris has a flat tire and she realizes that she has forgotten her purse in the house. The mechanic Pruitt (John Ford Noonan) stops this tow truck and offers to truck the car to his garage. Chris sees no other option and accepts the offer in the beginning of an unforgettable night of adventures in Chicago."Adventures in Babysitting" is one of those adorable cult-movies for the entire life. I saw this movie in the 80's and since then, it has become one of my top movies ever. There are unforgettable scenes and maybe my favorite is when Albert Collins says that nobody leaves the club without singing a blues. The 25th anniversary Blu-Ray is really a worthwhile shopping. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Uma Noite de Aventuras" ("One Night of Adventures")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Uriel's Movie Reviews - Adventures in Babysitting***1/2 (1hr 39min)(Rated PG-13)The 1987 flick from future Harry Potter and Mrs. Doubtfire director Chris Columbus, Adventures in Babysitting is a good film and it has some fun moments in it.Its about a high school senior named Chris Parker(Elisabeth Shue) in a rich suburb of Chicago, where she has just been agrees to babysit for a pre-teen girl named Sara (Maia Brewton) and his older brother Brad(Keith Coogan), with his friend Daryl(Anthony Rapp).The children's parents leave for a party and the babysitter relaxes thinking this will be another boring night, however, she receives a call from her friend who just ran away from home and is at the train station in Chicago. She is scared and wants her to come and pick her up. The babysitter cannot leave the children alone and so she takes them and one of the teenagers' friend on a wild and crazy adventure.In her pursuit to pick up her friend, they have to deal with being in a love quarrel where pistol is being fired, and then, being in a stolen car that results in gangster-like characters chasing them because they posses information about their operation.The reason why this movie is so good is that the characters are rich and come from a secluded suburban area who never had to deal with the hard life of the inner-city, and One interesting moment in the movie is when they were in a blues club and they were told they could not leave without singing the blues.This is really good, and also fun movie to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie! If it is on TV or I see it when renting movies, I will stop everything at watch this movie. I love the whole idea of the movie! I babysit all the time and the premise is honestly, something that probably could (and I'm sure has) happen to some unlucky babysitter. I was only 3 when this movie was made but it doesn't matter! Anthony Rapp's character, Daryl Coopersmith is hilarious! The cast and characters work so well together. The only thing that I find annoying is Sara, the little sister, but then again I am a babysitter and what babysitter wouldn't get annoyed with little kids when they make trouble. But if it weren't for Sara then there wouldn't be this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In My Top 10 Films Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are certain films that I never tire of and this is one of them. It goes without saying that this film has everything you could possibly want in a film and more. It has a flawless cast headed by Elisabeth Shue (Chris), Maia Brewton (Sara), Keith Coogan (Brad), and Vincent D'Onofrio (Dawson). Spoilers ahead: Here is a little bit of how the film starts out. Chris who is babysitting Sara and Brad (His Friend Daryl (Anthony Rapp) also stayed over), and they had to make a trip into Chicago to pick her friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller), who ran away from home, and they essentially go through hell trying to pick up Brenda and get back home. Some of the things they went through included being chased down by the mob (Daryl stole a copy of Playboy that has betting information, because he saw the centerfold is a dead ringer for Chris), and ending up in in an all-black blues bar, with the rule being "Nobody gets out of here without singing the blues.", so they have to singing "Babysitting Blues", which not only the owner but all the customers get into. Finding out that the guy she was seeing, is actually a creep who instead of being sick (As he claimed), was taking another woman out to dinner. She thought it was beneath her to strike back, but Daryl did not. He kicked him in the ass, and his face fell straight into a cake. Having their car break down and have to be towed to Dawson's Garage, without enough money to get the repairs, and without the money can't get home). This is a great scene, because Sara thinks he is Thor (He looks like him), and is able to melt his heart, and he gives them a break on the price. There are about 4 or 5 other incredible scenes that I love in this movie, and there is not one wasted moment from start to finish. It goes without saying I love this movie and although I have seen thousands of films, it cracks my Top 10. Saying I give it 10/10 is redundant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I just wanna say I actually thought the little girl with the Thor Fan-girl obsession was adorable. Sure she was almost slightly psychotic. But still Adorable none the less.Also that makes me a bit of a hypocrite, because when I was that age I had a major Batman obsession. 15 years later, NOTHING HAS CHANGED FOR ME! I thought it was just funny as *beep* when Vincent D'Onofrio (best known as pvt. pyle from Full Metal Jacket) played the a-hole mechanic who sort of resembled the viking god of thunder!He obviously looked nothing like Marvels version of Thor, but then again I guess he wasn't suppose to.Am I alone with the idea that it would be kind of funny if they put Vince in the Thor movie just as like a cameo or something?!Also I wish Elizabeth Shoe would have baby sat me as a kid, and taken me into the ghetto of Chi town!

		<fullReview>This has got to be one of my favourite 80s movies of all time. Which is saying something.The characters are great, you've got Elisabeth Shue singing the blues, Penelope Ann Miller and Anthony Rapp with their funny lines and characters, Vincent D'Onofrio as Thor, handsome john pruitt with a hook for a hand, and not to mention Bradley Whitford as the always dirty scoundrel. This movie has hijinks at its best. And probably my favourite beginning of a movie ever with Chris Parker(Shue)singing and dancing to "and then he kissed me". Shue is so good, although hardly passes for 17...but hey what high school 80s movie actually casted teenagers?? Regardless, I've seen it way too many times, and would recommend it to everyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.Adventures in Babysitting was overall a pretty freaking fun feel-good film from the 80s. It had it's moments of glory, and for the main part it keeps your attention with giggly antics and ridiculous situations and characters like a true 80s feel-good is supposed to. I did find it to be just a little boring at times, and a lot of the material that was supposed to be hilarious was not as funny as the director probably thought it was, but who could hate a movie as cute and lovable as this? My favorite parts in the movie are all the scenes that involve Brenda. The scene where she picks up the rat thinking it's a cat, and the scene where she tells the homeless man that he just moved were incredibly humorous. The whole film was sort of slapshtickish, and I like slapstick when done right. Not a masterpiece, but still a great time. It was cleverly written, which is something that's hard to find in films nowadays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is still one of my all-time favorites. I recently bought the DVD, and I've watched it several times since. Okay, it's not exactly realistic, but it's not intended to be. That's the whole point, so don't be afraid to indulge!!! It really takes you back to your teen years, especially if you ever babysat and wished for some excitement instead of boredom. Chris Parker (a marvellous Elisabeth Shue) is a beautiful high school senior who was anticipating celebrating with her boyfriend, Mike (Bradley Whitford) regarding their anniversary. However, the jerk (as the viewers know) stands her up with some really lame excuse and she ends up babysitting for the Andersons, who have a very curious and adorable daughter, Sara, (Maia Brewton) and a teenage son, Brad, (Keith Coogan, grandson of the great Jackie Coogan) who secretly makes puppy eyes at Chris. Brad's obnoxious best friend, Daryl (Anthony Rapp) shows up and wants in when Chris receives a frantic phone call from her best friend, Brenda (a wonderfully comedic Penelope Ann Miller), who has run away from home, only to be stranded at a downtown Chicago bus stations with some really pricelessly goofy characters. Our heroine dares to take the rugrats with her to rescue her pal, and they encounter one outrageous adventure after another. In the process, they blow a tire, meet up with an amputee truck driver, witness an assault, end up being dragged down to a automobile heisting operation, chased by the bad guys, singing in a blues club (one of the best sequences), come between a gang war on a subway, crash (almost literally) a frat party, and discover that Chris's guy has been two-timing her with an "easy chick", and end up at the Anderson's party downtown. And they do, finally accomplish their mission to rescue Brenda, while trying to beat the progenetors home!!! Whew!!! No wonder Chris decides that this is going to be her first and last job!!!! The 60s soundtrack does nothing to hurt the film, in fact, it enhances it, especially the opening track, "He Kissed Me" by the Crystals. (A moment that every girl dreams about). The situations are hilarious, with as always, the charmingly clueless yuppie parents, funny villains, and resourceful protagonists. I applauded when Daryl returned a long overdue favor to Mike in the French restaurant, and the facial expression on Daryl's face on the freeway when they are approached by "Handsome" John Pruitt just takes the cake!!! And that George Newburn, as college guy Dan, is such a cutie. Vincent D'Orinifo's appearance is notable as well. Fun, fun fun! "Oh, gee, Daryl, are you a gear-head and a sex fiend?" A laugh riot!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chris Parker is stuck babysitting two obnoxious teens, Brad and Darryl, along with Brad's younger sister Sara, after her boyfriend blows her off on their anniversary. A senior in high school, Chris feels she is too old to babysit, but what can she do? Stay at home and mope? What should have been a dull evening of watching Sara and Brad turns into a dilemma when Chris's friend Brenda calls her from a bus station and begs her to pick her up. She had planned on running away, and now she is out of money, and can't get a taxi. Of course the kids want to go into town too. And then Darryl, Brad's friend, wants to tag along as well. The trip should only take about an hour or so all together, but due to a series of misadventures, it takes all night. A really funny movie, and the actors are all terrific. Definitely a classic, in my opinion. An 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as teen comedies go, this is one of the best, if not THE best. I saw it ages ago and immediately fell in love with the movie and its characters. Shue and the rest of the cast are simply great. I saw the movie on E-bay last week and even though I'm 34 now (not really the intended target audience age) I just couldn't resist and bought it. Some bits feel a bit outdated, but that does not diminish the fun I had watching it. My favourite scene is the blues singing scene, although I like the gang fight in underground as well, particularly Chris' line. You all know which one I'm referring to. All in all, I can only recommended this movie to everyone who hasn't seen it. I don't need to recommend it to people who have seen it, because they will know what an excellent movie this is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun '80s teen comedy adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chris Parker is expecting to have a great night out with her boyfriend but things don't go according to plan; first he cancels, telling her that his little sister is ill and he must look after her; then she is asked to babysit eight year old Sara and her fifteen year old brother Brad. She hasn't been there long when she gets a desperate phone call from her friend Brenda who ran away from home and is now in the city bus station without any money. Chris can't not help her friend nor can she leave the children alone so they all head into Chicago along with Brad's friend Daryl. It should be a simple thing to do but everything that can go wrong does; they have a blowout, the car has no spare tyre and Chris forgot her purse; this leads to a run in with a hook-handed tow truck driver, a car thief, a group of mobsters and a couple of gangs! Before the film is over they will almost get shot, walk across a high girder, crash a frat party, crash the party attended by Sara's parents and Sara will end up stuck on the outside of a skyscraper!This film is a lot of fun with laughs from start to finish; the situations are obviously over the top but it should be easy enough to suspend ones disbelief and enjoy the adventure. Elisabeth Shue does a fine job as Chris although young Maia Brewton, who plays Sara, steals just about every scene she is in; no matter how scary the situation she acts like it is part of a fun adventure; more importantly she isn't one of those annoyingly precocious child characters. While they get in numerous dangerous situations there is never a feeling that any of them might get hurt so it shouldn't scare younger viewers... although I suppose some parents might not approve of the running gag concerning Chris being mistaken for the current Playboy centrefold! This actually turns out to be a key plot point when one of the boys steals a copy belonging to a mobster who has written incriminating details in it. Plenty of good teen comedies were churned out in the eighties and nineties and while this isn't one of the best known ones it is certainly well worth watching if it is on television.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An immensely enjoyable 80's teen comedy blast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sweet, perky, and resourceful 17-year-old babysitter Chris Parker (a wonderfully chipper and vivacious performance by Elisabeth Shue in her first lead role) and the three kids she's taking care of -- smitten Brad Anderson (likable Keith Coogan), Brad's perky little sister Sara (adorable Maia Brewton), and Brad's crude buddy Daryl Coopersmith (hilarious Anthony Rapp) -- are forced to venture into the dark and dangerous downtown section of Chicago to pick up Chris's gal pal Brenda (an amusingly ditsy Penelope Ann Miller) at the bus stop. The hapless quartet blow out a car tire, run afoul of an international stolen car ring, stumble into an all-black blues club where they are forced to belt out a nifty ditty called "Babysittin' Blues" (a truly great sequence), crash a frat party, and even have a scary run-in with two rival street gangs on the subway. Director Chris Columbus, working from a bright and eventful script by David Simkins, relates the busy narrative at a constant brisk pace, maintains an amiable tone throughout, and gives the picture a winningly breezy and inoffensive quality that's impossible to either resist or dislike. But it's the marvelously vibrant and endearing presence of the lovely and appealing Shue that really makes this movie hum; she's such an incredibly charming lady, with oodles of natural charisma and energy, that you can't help but root for her all the way. The lively acting from the rest of the tip-top cast helps matters out a whole lot, with especially stand-out contributions by Calvin Levels as nice guy car thief Joe Gipp, George Newbern as affable college student Dan Lynch, John Davis Chandler as creepy stolen car ring head honcho Bleak, Vincent D'Onofrio as menacing mechanic Dawson, and John Ford Noonan as helpful hook-handed tow truck driver Handsome John Pruitt. Ric Waite's slick cinematography makes the Windy City locations look suitably grimy and frightening. Kudos are also in order for Michael Kamen's frantic score and the bang-up soundtrack of get-down funky blues and R&amp;B songs. A hugely entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is fun and terrific it has good pacing and just a fun popcorn movie. All the actors were believable and the comedy was fun. Elizabeth Shue shows a large spectrum of talent with singing, dancing and great comedic timing. It is a shame that she never became a larger star as her talent is so evident. Penelope Ann Miller was terrific too and Vincent D from Law and Order CI is literally unrecognizable as he has slightly changed over the years. Overall when I watch this movie it is akin to a nice pair of slippers it is fun and comforting in the knowledge that i will be entertained. It also was a good start for director Chris Columbo and just a movie to enjoy for all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shue is the show here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Elisabeh Shue's utterly enchanting performance in the starring role is the centerpiece and main selling point of 1987's ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING, a highly improbable but richly entertaining comedy that stars Shue as Chris Parker,a high school senior, whose night of babysitting turns into a raucous night of danger and excitement for Chris and her young charges. It doesn't score a lot of points in the reality department, but for old fashioned mindless fun, you can't beat it. There is one funny scene after another here, with the scene in the blues club being a definite standout. Keith Coogan and Anthony Rapp are amusing as the two teens under Chris' care and Calvin Levels also scores as a sympathetic crook, but this distaff re-thinking of FERRS BUELLER'S DAY OFF is Shue's show all the way and she makes it a pleasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chicago means great Blues music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would have been a shame to set a movie in Chicago and not include some great Blues music. Happily, this film manages to work a Blues jam into the 'Adventures.' Even more happily, they got the great Blues legend, the 'Ice Man' Albert Collins (1932?1993) to jam with, though his name does not appear in the credits. Collins was famous for mingling with the audience while playing.They didn't try to make it all polished like Hollywood films usually do. This jam is a little raw and rough, like the real deal, like real people really improvising. They left some spots in the jam where it was appropriately apparent that this was not something these kids do every day -- or ever before for that matter.</fullReview>

Apart from the Rolling Stones song, the rest of the soundtrack is 100% Chicago Blues at its finest. I wish someone would re-release the soundtrack PLEASE!!!!! The cinematography is pretty good and the scenes show the REALITY of Chicago, not just the "pretty" parts. Most of those buildings and locales that's in this movie are still present to this day (that should tell you something about Chicago's architecture!) and can be found with a good stroll through the downtown area. Part of it was also filmed in Oak Park, Illinois (a town just north west of the city)is a nice little bucolic area where everybody knows your name(sorry).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated good family comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Chris Parker (Elisabeth Shue) is stood up by her boyfriend, she agrees to babysit for Sara Anderson. Sara's brother Brad was supposed to spend the night at his friend Darryl's, but because he has a crush on Chris, both decide to stay home with her. When Chris gets a frantic call from friend Brenda,who is at the bus station downtown in the city, she takes the children to go pick her up. But on the way, they have car troubles, then troubles with the tow truck operator, a car thief and an organized crime mob, a couple of street gangs, the thunder god Thor, while Brenda is having troubles of her own downtown. Can Chris protect the children from all of these dangers, pick up Brenda and get home before the parents do? Adventures in Babysitting is a really, really fun rollicking adventure story that (with the possible exception of a bit of foul language) is suitable for and likely to be enjoyed by the whole family. I'm not sure why it has such a low rating on this site, nor why it is relatively unknown.All the acting, from Elisabeth Shue to relatively minor characters like John Ford Noonan is great. The plot is a relatively simple one, but has enough twists and turns to keep it interesting. The pacing is good and the comedy is funny. I don't have anything bad to say about this movie, really. It has a bit of the feel of Back to the Future, though a very different story, so if you liked that, then you'll likely enjoy this one too.I see that a remake is in the works for 2010 with Raven Symone as Chris Parker and Miley Cyrus also in it. I hope that it will be as good as the original and that it brings more attention to this one.Enjoy it. It's fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Elisabeth Shue stars as a high school girl about to go on the biggest date of her life. Little did she know that when she gets stood up that she would end up on the adventure of her life...with three little kids in tow.I've always like Elisabeth Shue, in everything she's done, but I feel that kudos in this movie don't go to her, but, rather, to the director, Chris Columbus. He brought the events of the film together that should place this film in the IMDb Top 250 (and it's not!). If you've ever babysat or had a babysitter, you find yourself WISHING something like this would happen to you! I bought this film a couple of years ago on DVD and I pull it off the shelf every once in awhile. Then, within a couple of months, I see it on cable late night while working and I tell myself not to bother watching it, because I have the uncut version on DVD, but I end up watching it again, anyway. It's not my favorite movie, but it's in the top three, anyway (right up there with "Officer &amp; a Gentleman" and "Rock Star").9 out of 10 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun light entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie its strongest point is its fun adventurous way of storytelling. It makes the whole story and movie seem like one big adventure, set in a big city. The roll from the one fun and of course highly unlikely situation into the other. It makes the movie very entertaining to watch and also fairly unpredictable, in terms of you not knowing what will happen to the main characters next.The movie is filled with a couple of greatly fun moments but of course also some moments that don't work out. Luckily every moment in the movie is not really long enough to bore you when you don't really like it. The movie shouldn't had been much longer though. It all became a bit tiresome after a while and I feel the movie won't had been as effective had it lasted 2 hours.Also a great asset from the movie is its cast and especially the kid roles within the movie. Normally kid actors aren't among the most believable once in the business, especially not in these type of films but all of the actors here do a great job and they most importantly all have some great chemistry together. Also Elisabeth Shue handles her role well. It was one of her first leading roles out of her career, even before her Back to the Future film roles. Also Penelope Ann Miller shows up in a fun and early movie role.It's a sort of a shame that this Chris Columbus movie is relatively unknown. It by the way also was his directorial debut and what a fine way to start of his directing career it was!I think especially the kids will appreciate this movie and its fun adventurous way of storytelling, even though the movie is rated PG-13.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Is Awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long live the 80's! And I wish I could find old episodes of Perfect Strangers! Belke and Larry Rock! This movie was made in 87' so I was only 4 at the time. I had never seen this movie and am glad I bought it for less then $10 because I work at ShlockBuster Video and get an employee discount. I have recently been watching a lot of movies from the late 70's through the eighties and early 90's. I was a teenager in the early to mid 90's so I was very young but remember the eighties vividly. I now love Elizabeth Shue. Apparently Jodie Foster turned this role down. And God bless her she's Canadian but I'm glad she turned down the part. This movie was directed by Christopher Columbus and this was his directing debut. He also wrote the screenplay for The Goonies and was also the one who did Mrs. Doubtfire and the first two Harry Potter movies. Christopher Columbus is the King of kids movies in my opinion. I gave this film a rating of ten. It has a realistic but notrealistic, funny and adventurous plot. Nothing but action. This film was shot in Chicago and also Toronto, Ontario. I thought I recognized the old Silver Dollar on Spadina. If you are in Toronto. The Silver Dollar Room is one of many great clubs in the city's downtown. I liked how in this movie there was a lot of sketchy characters like Mr. Pruid. The nice truck driver who towed there car. Or the friendly black car thief. People who do nice and good things for others. When I lived in Toronto I remember during the SARS epidemic a few years ago I was waiting for a subway at Bloor Station and there was only one other man standing on the platform. Everybody else during that time avoided contact with other people just not to risk infection and would wear those masks like doctors wear over their mouths. I never wore one because I thought if god chooses for me to die by SARS he will. Anyways, ramble.... This guy was a kind of threatening looking character like a biker. It was so cold and I am a social whore so I started a conversation with the man. Turns out he was from my Home Town of Kingston, Ontario. Small world. One that is short on good souled human beings.</fullReview>

My brother and I grew up watching this movie and now years later I still pull this out of my stack and watch it.I love the little sister in the movie because she is hilarious. From her fischer price roller skates to her Thorn gear she is something else. I always remember the part where she embarrasses her brother about having a huge crush on their babysitter. It's so funny because he's in his teenage years where he is really awkward with girls but still tries to impress them.However, my favorite part has to be the beginning seen where Elizabeth Shue, the babysitter is singing and dancing aroung her room while she gets ready for her date.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fun, humorous movie starring Elizabeth Shue as a high schooler who gets stuck babysitting hyper, manipulative kids. While babysitting, her friend Brenda gets stuck in the city and must picked up. This is the start of a crazy, wacky, and fun adventure (as the title of the movie states). The movie, while far from being great, is a lot of fun to watch, and has a lot of funny scenes and moments. There are a few corny moments, and the movie as a whole is unbelievable, but nevertheless its just as much fun. One thing that should be noted is, that while this looks like a family movie its not really. It has quite a bit of profanity and sexual material. My rate for Adventures in Babysitting.

For Halloween one year, i dressed in ugly drag, but I had a pretty pink dress on, and a cigarette hanging of my lip. I entered a contest and when i finally made it to the stage, the MC asked what my name was, and this movie suddenly just popped in my head (not really sure why) and i simply said in a gruff voice - I'm the babysitter! - and the crowd went wild! I ended up winning 1st place from about 20 people and that was $500 cash and lots of free drinks! Too funny! I'll watch this movie every time I see it is on TV.

		<shortDescription>Ends up as a bit of a mis-adventure for the audience but there is some fun to had out of the film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scene of Adventures in Babysitting (curiously re-titled A Night on the Town for British audiences) has Elizabeth Shue's character Chris Parker dancing to an old record from the 1960s, as she gears up for a romantic evening out with a partner. It is a scene that perfectly sets the tone for the film: wacky titles, upbeat and likable song, fast edits and happy people dancing as they prepare to be with the one they love. It is a scene that not only sets up the tone of the film but it is also a scene that will come and go; a scene that the film will not revisit or so-much as even reference later on since just minutes later, Chris' bubble will be burst and she will be off down a different path.Such is the cut and thrust nature of films that rely on cause and effect as their narrative base, it is very rare for a film to refer back to a scene from ten minutes ago because something so drastic would have happened to propel the story into its next situation. I hate to refer to films made since the one I'm talking about but 2005 film Cellular is a good example of a film that presents us with one situation the hero must overcome, before leading into another and then another ? all the time not looking back; the closing half an hour of Mel Gibson's Apocalypto is another good example. But then again, I'm a big fan of those two films and whilst Adventures in Babysitting is good fun; it does not hold up as a film nor as a realistic piece of entertainment.The most frustrating thing that glares the most out of the film, for me anyway, were the inconsistencies apparent within the character of Sara Anderson (Brewton) who is the youngest member of the family being babysat at eight years old; she is also the smartest and there's your problem. Unfortunately, most of the logic in this film is replaced for good excuses to try and get laughs out of the audience. Sara is smart enough to have the dialogue to make us think she is clever but is actually foolish enough to climb out of a window on the fortieth floor of a skyscraper; her imperative inclusion to the story is once again utilised as she is able to overcome the plot point that involves being able to turn a money grabbing mechanic into a good Samaritan; this time through innocence. The third example of Sara's inability to be an 8 year old human being, or indeed the writer's inability to create an 8 year old human being is when, shortly after they have been caught carjacking by a carjacker and are hurtling along to a gangster's warehouse, Sara pulls out a chocolate bar and finds it in her heart to offer some to all in the car ? she is not terrified like her brother, his friend and Elizabeth are even if she should be the most terrified.But then we have to suspend belief to go along with the film's running gag; that these incompetent human beings can get their way out of any jam, no matter how difficult. Elizabeth is a 17 year old babysitter who has jeopardised everyone's situation at the expense of a friend although you cannot blame her; Brad, 15 (Coogan) is a kid who is attracted to Elizabeth and his friend Daryl (Rapp) who is equally sexually active, at least in his own mind and enough to want Elizabeth to rape him. But while these kids can get out of jams such as escaping a building full of gangsters who will no doubt kill them in due course, the film does not elevate itself above that level of: 'here comes the situation, here is the situation, there goes the situation' which is disappointing as there is a certain likability for all of the characters involved. Daryl may think with a body part that is not his brain on more than one occasion but he carries a degree of innocence that just keeps him from being another one of these American teenagers obsessed with women; something that does not work AS a character, IN a film.But whilst the characters remain inconsistent and the plot remains basic, the actual cause and effect situations are nothing that special either. The carjacker does not have time to deliver the kids somewhere safe before driving on; the kids actually stop half way through their escape from certain death by singing 'the blues' in a music club and they even find time to go to a student party during the course of their adventure. It's not that these events aren't interesting, they are just too unrealistic and heavy handed to warrant good viewing. If your idea of comedy and tension is to have the kids actually stop and sing to a crowd of blues fans, this is the film for you; otherwise I am surprised they did not merely barge through the barrier and continue to escape ? maybe they could've even asked for help from the musicians as they outrun the murderous gangsters.But whilst incompetence would have them go on this adventure in the first place as it is Brenda (Miller) who sparks the journey off, it is incompetence and inconsistency that actually gets them through the journey that matters. The bad guys nearer the end are not waiting for them in the garage despite having the address and would rather follow them to the third act setting than nab them there and then but glaring errors seem to be accepted by director Columbus, embraced even, as these people survive the city streets like cacti survive the blistering sun. It may not be smart nor that funny but the adventure is enjoyable in places, even if you need your brain suspended for the majority of the runtime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film directional debut from Chris Columbus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adventures in Babysitting is a 1987 Touchstone film starring Elizabeth Shue as a young girl who babysits 3 kids who end up being chased by a thief who is after them,and its up to them to escape from the thief and go back home before their parents come back from a party. I seen this about a month ago and I thought it was very good. Bradley Whitford plays Elizabeth Shue's boyfriend Mike who ditches her later on and the action sequences was very good. For Christopher Columbus's movie debut he did a good job as he would later create other films such as both Home Alone films,Mrs Doubtfire,Harry Potter &amp; The Philosphers Stone and was also an executive producer for the Night At The Museum franchise. A couple of years later this film was remade starring Sofia Carlson as the main lead charcther that Shue played.See it !!!I would love to see this movie again soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really lazy claim to make, but they really don't make kids movies anymore like "Adventures in Babysitting". Some of the dialogue is unexpectedly adult (modern fare admittedly sets that bar pretty low), and I think it still stands today as a prime example of the Big Bad City?. But it's also easy to expect overhearing sentiment and tacky plot twists in a movie like this, and the script largely avoids that. I've got respect for that, and this makes for a surprisingly watchable movie. It's a pretty good adventure into the dark and scary, and having the pretty Elizabeth Shue at the forefront helps immensely (not to mention having the world's nicest carjacker along for the ride).Good stuff.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Didn't She Babysit Me?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a perfect 80's movie. It fits right into the category that already includes the best of John Hughes' input (and what big 80's kid movie didn't he do?!) and a few others. One of the pluses is the cast. Shue is wonderful as Chris, a young girl who is trying desperately to save her friend and keep her young charges out of harm's way. The kids themselves are good. They may have some typical young kid annoyances, but they are all pretty good and make it feel like they are real kids who you actually like. Penelope Ann Miller is one of the best parts here. With her big glasses, nerdy appearance, and comical misadventures of her own in the bus terminal, she delivers many of the funniest moments.It's all inoffensive and good-natured, though I was surprised to hear a couple of F-bombs in there, and some of the dialogue is a little raunchy. Babysitting is no classic, but has lasting appeal and is a fun ride. Michael Kamen also provides a score which sounds like a "Die Hard" prototype, lending a little more weight to the adventure than would be typical. But overall, "Adventures in Babysitting" delivers real laughs while taking you on a wild ride through the wicked bowels of the city.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've Got The Babysittin' Shue's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolute classic 80's film! Definitely up there in my "Top 10" 80s movies". In fact, it's #02 on my 80s list, next to "Labyrinth" (1986). It's just one of those films I can watch over and over again... and have! I fell in love with Elisabeth Shue watching this movie, and I have to say that this movie is the best movie she's ever made and it's no surprise that she actually did win an award for Best Actress for this and good on here. She's amazing!I have often wondered why they named it "Adventures In Babysitting" in the US. Here in the UK it's called "A Night On The Town" which I much prefer. There's so many different Babysitting movies that can all be called "Adventures In Babysitting" but the UK given title for it sounds much better. THE DVD! I have to comment on the DVD artwork - it's not the best and if I'm totally honest, yes I have noticed that the clothes they are wearing on the DVD cover (especially Elisabeth Shue) are not the same as what they wear in the movie. In fact Shue doesn't ever wear a dress showing her legs but have a look on the DVD cover and you'll see different. I'm also very surprised as to why the DVD doesn't include special features. I do actually have the film on Blu-Ray now and it's the exact same as the DVD (obviously HD quality and has title music playing over the main menu which I am impressed with!) but it's a shame there's no cast interviews on this.THE SOUNDTRACK! Definitely one of the best soundtracks of the 80s and of course the opening scene to the film is just the best. Who's actually sat and watched Elisabeth Shue do the infamous dance and lip-syncing to The Crystals "Then He Kissed Me" Great opening to a movie, it's awesome and she's just stunning. This film really did make her career. I'm not sure if there has been an official soundtrack release for this movie but there should be. Every song featured throughout the movie is just classic, quality stuff.It's great to see Shue and the gang singing in the Blues club, some great words to the "Babysitting Blues" song and you can actually believe that Shue made the song up on the spot considering she gets forced to sing her way out of the club! Brilliant stuff!I thoroughly enjoy towards the end of the movie during the Edwin Starr "25 Miles" scene where they are rushing home. Again watch out for Elisabeth Shue fly jump over the couch and perfectly into place pretending she's been sat there the whole night. If I'm spoiling any moments here for those that haven't seen it, I do apologise, it's just hard not to mention the best parts of this movie. The rest of the cast are great, and congratulations to Maia Brewton on winning an award for Best Young Actress - an award well deserved. Also, I hate to break it to you, but unfortunately there is going to be a remake due in 2016 by Disney! I for one will most likely not give it a chance, you know what they say "You don't f**k with the original" just like you don't "f**k with the babysitter!" A terrific cast... a terrific film... a terrific babysitting night. Definitely a 10/10!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple, fun 80s flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 80s might be my favorite era of movies, which I realize to many movie enthusiasts, is probably a sin. I will admit that I haven't seen a lot of "classic" movies made in the 60s downward but I still try to catch up on them all the time, so I suppose this opinion is subject to change but regardless, many of my favorite movies were made in the 80s. But Adventures in Babysitting is one of those films with just a certain 80s charm that can't be entirely replicated nowadays. Is it that ambitious? No, not really. Is it very entertaining? Absolutely. It has some strange quirks and weird things that are mostly found in 80s movies because the 80s was kinda quirky and weird. (Well at least as far as I can tell without growing up in the era). The story itself is a very basic fish out of water story with a bunch of white kids in the suburbs getting thrown into crazy events in the city of Chicago that are obviously outrageous and over the top because it's a movie. Right from the opening scene of Chris Parker (Elisabeth Shue) dancing like a fool in her bedroom alone, you kinda realize this movie is going to have at least some certain charm to it. Chris is stood up by her boyfriend and then ends up having to babysit for the Andersons' children: Sara (Maia Brewton) and Brad (Keith Coogan). But a third guest comes along Darly Coopersmith (Anthony Rapp) after he finds out that Chris is taking all of them into the city when she gets a call from her friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller) who decided to run away from home like an idiot. Brenda is essentially the B-plot of the film and they cut to her character here and there for some easy laughs but it's enjoyable nonetheless. Everything essentially turns horrible once the tire on Chris' car goes flat and they then get picked up by a trucker with a hook for a hand, they get involved with a car thief, they go to a Blues club (which might be my favorite scene in the film), college parties, etc. Just about everything that could go wrong, goes wrong. The movie is simply a fun comedy with an interesting enough plot to go with it and a certain 80s charm that can't really be replicated nowadays. Besides, who wouldn't rather go see Transformers: Age of Extinction and have their brain turn to mashed potatoes instead of watching an actual fun film made in the world of Hollywood like Adventures of Babysitting? Sigh. Overall, it's a fun movie; a harmlessly fun movie with some nice quirks to it and maybe some harmless fun would be okay in Hollywood today more often (And does certainly still exist along with actual intelligent movies like the recently released Dawn of the Planet of the Apes?how did I manage to mention Transformers and Planet of the Apes in a review for Adventures in Babysitting?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When she receives a frantic phone call from her friend who is stuck in downtown Chicago at night, suburban babysitter Chris (Elisabeth Shue) must head to the big city to help. But she can't leave the kids she's babysitting so she brings them along. The night becomes one big crazy experience for Chris and the kids. Classic '80s greatness here. You take a situation that, in reality, might wind up with a bunch of young people on the evening news as rape and/or murder victims and you turn it into an adventurous lark. Love the '80s!This is a highly entertaining movie. The characters are fun and well-written. The dialogue is great. It has the feel of a John Hughes movie. Elisabeth Shue is so good in this. It's impossible not to have a crush on her after watching this film. The kids are all good, with Maia Brewton stealing practically every scene she's in. Her love of Thor was a big kick to me as a kid since I was also a big fan of Thor and all the other kids I knew had no clue who he was. The scene where she meets "Thor" for real is one of the many highlights of this film for me. Just a great movie from a great decade. You should definitely check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shue is the show here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Elisabeh Shue's utterly enchanting performance in the starring role is the centerpiece and main selling point of 1987's ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING, a highly improbable but richly entertaining comedy that stars Shue as Chris Parker,a high school senior, whose night of babysitting turns into a raucous night of danger and excitement for Chris and her young charges. It doesn't score a lot of points in the reality department, but for old fashioned mindless fun, you can't beat it. There is one funny scene after another here, with the scene in the blues club being a definite standout. Keith Coogan and Anthony Rapp are amusing as the two teens under Chris' care and Calvin Levels also scores as a sympathetic crook, but this distaff re-thinking of FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF is Shue's show all the way and she makes it a pleasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So very cute, it almost compensate for its faults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No it's not an original, in fact it follows the tradition started with brilliant movies such as After Hours and Into the Night and carried all the way to Date Night of more recent fame. The basic idea is to take an unsuspecting fairly well to do character (gender is almost not important) and whisk him/her/them away from their comfort zone. The general usage of the night is common in this sub genre. Well in this case we've got the very lovely Elisabeth Shue as a babysitter with three younger kids tagging along from the suburbs into the heart of the city's night life.So the starting point is not an original one, and neither is the plot. But Chris Columbus does what he knows best, he speeds up the story and extract every bit of charm his young stars have. And since they do have loads of charm, and Elisabeth Shue rarely looked better , it does work. Most of the characters are very undeveloped not to say shallow and cartoonish but some of those cartoons do work and the whole experience is rather enjoyable even if it's very far from a masterpiece. One big plus - everybody in it knows they're not making a masterpiece being straight forward is a plus in my book. I've seen this movie four or five times (only on TV) and always stayed through, it does say something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Adventures in Babysitting" is a solidly entertaining "everything that can go wrong will go wrong" farce that doesn't necessarily appeal to just kids. In fact, it's a little more intense than some people might expect. It marked the transition of screenwriter Chris Columbus ("Gremlins", "Young Sherlock Holmes") into directing, and stars an incredibly appealing Elisabeth Shue as Chris, a high school senior who, unable to go on a date with her boyfriend (Bradley Whitford), reluctantly agrees to take a babysitting gig, even as she feels she's getting a little old for that sort of thing. Her charge is young Sara (Maia Brewton), a kid with a fixation on comic book character Thor, and the girl's older brother is Brad (Keith Coogan), who's got something of a crush on Chris. Chris expects a rather quiet night, but is pulled into one nightmare after another when she decides to come to the aid of her desperate friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller). She, Sara, and Brad, along with Brad's obnoxious buddy Daryl (Anthony Rapp), end up pursued by psychotic criminals (led by a genuinely spooky John Davis Chandler), caught up in a gang fight, spending time at a frat party, taken for a ride by a crazed tow truck driver (John Ford Noonan), and coming dangerously close to being discovered by Sara's and Brad's parents. The good thing is just how well all of this flows - even at an hour and 43 minutes, there's no filler, just a wild story that moves from one episode to another. The true key to its success is how engaging the cast is, though. Shue does well in her first starring role, Brewton is cute, Coogan is likable, and Rapp is frequently hilarious even if playing kind of a clichéd role. The film also works as a collection of talented actors near the beginning of their careers: in addition to Miller, who has her own night of horrors while waiting at the bus station, and Whitford, there's Calvin Levels as helpful car thief Joe Gipp, Vincent D'Onofrio as muscular garage mechanic Dawson, George Newbern as nice guy college student Dan, Lolita Davidovich as an air headed gal at the party, and Clark Johnson as a gang leader. The show stopping scene of course is the one where blues master Albert Collins, in a special appearance, won't let Chris and company leave his stage without singing the blues, and they belt out a ditty about their babysitting woes. (Southside Johnny also puts in an appearance as well.) This movie is certainly never boring, delivering some good laughs and keeping up a high energy level right up to its feel-good ending. Recommended. Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a suspense-filled movie this is! I saw it for the first time tonight and found myself laughing out loud at some parts, and agonizing for the kids at other parts. My compliments to the writer. What an imagination that talented person has! Did you notice that each one of them - the babysitter and 3 kids - became a hero at some point during the movie? And the name "Thor" popped into my mind, too, when that gorgeous man came into view. "Who is he?" I wondered, because he looked so familiar. It wasn't until he smiled that I recognized him as Vincent D'Onofrio. Beverly D'Angelo lookalike Elizabeth Shue, Maia Brewton, Keith Coogen, and Anthony Rapp were also terrific. I'll have to watch it again to get the name of the character (and, thus, actor) who was the car thief. He, too, looked very familiar, like a long, lost friend, and did a wonderful job. Great movie and excellent casting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Murphy's Law Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Elizabeth Shue took that baby sitting gig for the night with Keith Coogan and little sister Maia Brewton it seemed like easy money. But then she gets a call from her good friend Penelope Ann Miller who has run away from home and is stuck penniless in the Chicago bus terminal. Not to worry, but Elizabeth takes the family car of the parents she's babysitting for and the kids along with her to perform a mission of mercy. Another friend of Coogan's, Andrew Rapp a kid with some raging hormones invites himself along for the ride and before long all of them have a night's worth of Adventures In Babysitting.It's amazing the number of situations that this group can get into. Adventures In Babysitting is one of those Murphy's Law films in that everything that can possibly go wrong, does go wrong. This group gets in and out of trouble with such ease and aplomb that you kind of hope the film goes on a bit more. Probably just as well it didn't because it would get a bit much.I was really shocked at learning that 'Thor' was played by a young Vincent D'Onofrio. I've seen him in other things besides Criminal Intent, but this small part at the beginning of his career was a revelation.Calvin Levels who plays a street smart urban youth who's into carjacking should also get singled out for recognition. He feels kind of sorry for these fish out of their own comfort pond and tries to help them as best he can.Adventures In Babysitting is a pretty funny teen comedy and definitely a Blockbuster Night's entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious Comedy Thriller About A Babysitter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One disaster follows another disaster in "Adventures in Babysitting" when a babysitter discovers that the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. This is a hilarious comedy about a babysitter who finds herself and her brood up to their collective necks in trouble as they try to flee from a gang of desperate Chicago criminals. Future "Harry Potter" director Chris Columbus made his directorial debut with this roller-coaster 99-minute opus that never wears out its welcome. Similarly, Shue has her first starring role as the babysitter and the role fits her as snugly as a shoe. Not only is Shue sympathetic but she is also charismatic. Meanwhile, Columbus stages several exciting scenes in this Touchstone Films release that will have you on the edge of your seat. "Adventures in Babysitting" was one of the first major theatrical films to conclude its end credits with a scene related to the action.Everything starts innocently enough as our heroine, 17-year old Chris Parker (Elizabeth Shue of "Molly"), is waiting on her dream date and singing the song "And Then He Kissed Me." Chris worships the ground that her narcissistic boyfriend treads; the tag on the front of his Camaro reads: "So Cool." Nevertheless, she is crushed when Mike Todwell (Bradley Whitford) arrives and informs her that he has to cancel their date. According to Mike, he must stay at home with his sick sister. Reluctantly, Chris agrees to babysit a neighbor's children. Chris' best friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller) decides to run away from home and winds up trapped in a bus stop where homeless people terrorize her. Somebody steals Brenda's glasses, and she is absolutely destitute. She calls Chris from a pay phone and pleads with Chris to rescue her. Naturally, the Anderson kids that Chris is sitting, 15-year-old Brad (Keith Coogan of "Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead") and 8-year-old Sara (Maia Brewton of "Back to the Future"), are game for a road trip from their Oak Park suburbs into Chicago. Chris takes her mom's station wagon. Brad's best friend Daryl Coopersmith (Anthony Rapp), who has a crush on Chris, manages to persuade them to let him ride with them. No sooner do our heroes get into Chicago than they blow a tire. To make matters worse, Chris doesn't have a dime and they rely on the kindness of strangers, specifically "Handsome" John Pruitt (John Ford Noonan) who drives a wrecker with one hand. The kids freak out when they see his metal clipper of a fist. They also freak out when they look into the glove compartment and find a gun. Pruitt tells Chris that he will change her flat tire for free. On the way to Dawson's Garage, Pruitt receives a call on his CB about his wanton wife and cruises past his residence. Indeed, Pruitt discovers that his wife is cheating on him. While Pruitt storms the house, Chris and company leap into another car. They catch an African-American thief, Joe Gipp (Calvin Levels), as he is boosting the Cadillac. The villains lock the kids up for safekeeping in an upstairs room while they continue to plot their future crimes. When Daryl joined our heroes originally, he had a Playboy magazine with a centerfold layout that is the spitting image of Chris. The Playboy belonged to Daryl's father and he lost it. Miraculously, Daryl finds the same magazine and takes it. The catch is that the Playboy magazine that Daryl takes contains secret information about a car-hijacking schedule. Before the rollicking evening concludes, Chris and her charges wind up in a skyscraper where--as it turns--Sara's parents are attending a party. One of the funniest scenes shows Chris and the kids being pursued by bad guys after they escape from their garage. They get away by climbing into the rafters. Chris, Brad, Sarah, Daryl walk softly along I-beams as they pass over the villains as the bad guys have a heated discussion. Our heroes escape through a hole in the roof and the criminals spend the remainder of the film chasing them. This has got to be one of the most suspenseful scenes in the entire film. Later, our heroine and company duck into the nearest door, only to find themselves on stage at a blues music club called The Silver Dollar Room. According to the well-known blues musician Albert Collins, they must sing a blues song. The improvisation ranks as one of the highlights of the narrative.Interestingly enough, "Adventures in Babysitting" was the first PG-13 movie that Disney released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun for kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching this when I was in third grade at school and yet I used to love it that I also remember it coming on television that I had to go and watch it whenever it came on. The movie was funny and I could laugh at anything.Now, at 17, I couldn't remember much about this movie since I didn't watch it for the past years. So, when I borrowed it from the library, learning that it was about a woman who agrees to take care of three kids and must revenge to save her friend who has ran away and spend the whole night trying to find her, I found the movie to be O.K. overall.I remember how it used to be called, "A Night on the Town" and I was baffled by the change in the title.17-year-old Chris Parker (Elizabeth Shue) is stood up by her boyfriend (Bradley Whitford). She is then convinced to babysit. While taking care of three kids, Brad, the older brother of the Anderson family, Sara, the bratty and bossy younger sister, and Daryl, the vigorous high-school boy whom we know is the best friend of Brad. One of the kids are obsessed with the comic book, Thor, so the adventure may turn out to be rambunctious... and it does.With loads of laughter, scares and cliffhangers, this chilling adventure blended with all three action-packed dimensions turns it into a one big adventure for the whole family. Though, I'm going to have to say that the acting was pretty bad for an 80s film and could've used some work, the script was fairly entertaining for all and I think the whole movie was just fun, fun fun. The one thing I found annoying was the little girl, Sara. She was a bit of a self-centered kid at some points, but she turns out to be good and she learns to care and she also learns that it's better to let the big brother do what he does and what he wants.6.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I got the Babysittin Blues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this as a child too many times to count and I always thought it was fantastic. I just watched it again in my 30's and I have to say it is still a great movie. For the record I am a guy and it is probably not the most manly thing to say that I love a movie about babysitting.Watching it as an adult I have noticed that this movie is really a blues movie at heart. First and foremost the aspect of the movie that had the most heart and realism for me was the older brother Brad's infatuation with Chris the babysitter. He was always the one I identified with as a young boy. He is so enamored of her and is so awkward about it, but at the same time genuine. And yet, unlike most hokey Hollywood films he doesn't magically get the girl. This is what the blues are all about. You love a girl and she doesn't love you back. Elizabeth Shue is amazing as always and I just learned that this was her first movie. I guess as a kid you don't really realize that these people are acting or at least not in this movie because it all seems so natural. She then went on to star in Cocktail, Back to the Future II and II and then Leaving Las Vegas in 1995. Sara, the little girl was the part of this movie that is still enjoyable after all these years. It seems to me that lately children in movies are incredibly annoying or they make the movie dramatic and it isn't enjoyable. Yes, the movie is dated now, but I think gives a pretty good overall impression of what we all thought was going on in the 80's. I find the movie a little bittersweet as it reminds me of an innocent childhood that has passed. I always wonder how people who haven't seen movies like this or Princess Bride, Goonies, Stand by Me, etc... will think of them if they watch them for the first time when they are in their 20's. I just don't think movies have the same magic when you are an adult. Enough rambling, go watch the movie if you haven't seen it. And watch it again if you haven't seen it for years.</fullReview>

While she is an awesome actress in many serious award winning dramatic roles this is my favorite role for her and I love the beginning of the movie that hearkens backs to the 1950's teenage comedies. Her timing is perfect and my favorite scenes are her singing "The Babysitter Blues" and when she sees her boyfriend out on another date. I love it when she's says "Stephanie Plexar", its so classic. There are so many things to love about this movie especially if you grew up in a sheltered suburban town next to a large urban city that you really can relate to as you knew girls like Chris and Brenda and guys like Mike in High School.

		<shortDescription>I like this brand of 80s film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adventures in Babysitting opens with a scene of a standard 80s teenager, Elizabeth Shue, dancing in her bedroom with white floral wallpaper while she puts her clothes on to 'And then he kissed me' designed to make all male viewers recoil within the first 15 seconds of the film and think of movies where Shue engages in a sex scene. Shue, who plays Chris Parker, is then asked to babysit a young effeminate male with an attraction to older women and his younger sister who wears a distracting Thor helmet throughout the film only to be later joined by the young man's best friend, Dre-dog, who looks equally bi-curious but brings the funny. Chris's best friend Brenda, surprisingly not played by Joan Cusack, then calls Chris informing her that she ran away from home and is stuck in a Chicago bus terminal so Brenda and the kids hop into the car to pick her up and mayhem adequately ensues. The film follows a series of different comedic sequences familiar in 'fish out of water' stories where sheltered suburban kids experience the horrors of the city and the underclass while trying desperately to find Brenda and return home. There's some effectively directed scenes of suspense when the character's lives are threatened by local gangsters that involve some quite agile maneuvers of escape that make me wish I was young and athletic again. Other hijinks include a musical sequence in a blues club, the suburban answer to gang violence, double entendres, fainting, 'before they were famous' cameos and all the other staples of a solid 80s family film. I'm not sure if there's a moral to the story but it doesn't matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite the cult item often implied. More a diverting curio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Chris Columbus hit pay-dirt with Home Alone, he made a couple of lightweight comedies in the 80s. Adventures in Babysitting (or A Night On the Town as its known over here in the UK) was his directorial debut. Its not quite as polished as Home Alone, more like its Home Alone in an earlier, less developed form. But its not without real charm, and is even in some ways quite daring too.Its interesting to note that Chris Columbus would later collaborate with that king of the teen movies John Hughes, the man who redefined what films about teenagers could be all about. But Adventures in Babysitting was made without Hughes' involvement, and perhaps Columbus was trying to carve out a similar niche for himself.AIB is nowhere near as astute as Hughes' best work, even if Columbus has obviously been inspired by it. After all its set in Chicago, a place that has somehow inherited the mantle of teen capital of the world. And its a film that reminds considerably of Hughes' wonderfully spirited Ferris Bueller's Day Off, made the previous year.AIB doesn't match up to that superior film. In fact, a part of me wishes it had been directed by John Hughes. You can just imagine what he would have done with such a fascinating situation. Four suburban kids get hopelessly lost in downtown Chicago in the middle of the night. Hughes could have injected a real anarchic charge to the plot. But under Columbus' hand, AIB only emerges as likable fare when he could have had something really special here.Like I said though, its not a lost cause. It has some very entertaining moments. And the young cast are anything if not engaging. Elisabeth Shue, then only 24 and in her first starring role gives a very accomplished performance as Chris Parker, the babysitter forced to shepherd three kids while stranded on the inner city streets of Chicago.The film follows utterly formulaic routes, such as a steady stream of incidents and near disasters, but Shue's increasingly exasperated facial expressions are a joy. And she faints well too!Filling out the roles of her charges are Keith Coogan as Brad Anderson, Maia Brewton as his sister Sara, and the friend of the family who's tagged along, Anthony Rapp as Daryl Coopersmith.And they all give very gracious performances. Brad is endearingly dopey, and his unrequited crush on Chris is touching. Daryl's the smart alec who's curse is to see every situation as it actually is. But the shining light of the whole movie is 10 year old Maia Brewton as the Thor obsessed Sara. Her wide-eyed expressions are wonderfully charming. She has real magnetism as a young performer. And I love the part when she mistakes a mechanic for her idol Thor.The film's way of getting the kids into the city is quite slim. Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller), a friend of Chris's runs away from home and gets as far as a bus station before losing her bottle. Now she needs Chris to pick her up. Its pretty shallow motivation when examined closely. In fact, Miller's character doesn't get that much to do. She simply has to put up with vagrants, thieves and rats until Chris shows. Its a thankless role, but Miller approaches it with enthusiasm nonetheless.When looking at the kids misadventures in the city, Columbus deserves to be commended for trying out such a potentially offensive situation. But the film is still not as edgy as it could have been.There are times when it comes close to achieving real brilliance. There is one truly inspired scene when the kids end up in a blues club, and are forced to sing. The song they come up with, the 'Babysitting Blues' where Chris bemoans her bad luck is a scene that's downright hilarious. Its the one scene in the whole film where Columbus seems to realise the potential of the material. In fact its a scene that wouldn't have looked out of place in a John Hughes film. The one moment that stays in your memory long after the rest of the film has faded.But nowhere else is there the same invention. There are some moments that are quite daring like an encounter with rival street gangs fighting for turf. Daryl chatting up a prostitute. Ominous city streets filled with shootists and hook-handed tow-truck drivers. But it never pushes the envelope quite far enough. And then when it comes to the momentum that drives the film's dynamic, in this case a group of chop shop dealers after a work order the kids have inadvertently stolen, that seems slim motivation too. You can see some of the plot points here Columbus would explore in greater detail in Home Alone.And some scenes are borderline ludicrous. Sara trapped on the outside of a skyscraper is just too ridiculous. You can tell Columbus was running out of ideas at this late stage in the film. In fact all the scenes in the skyscraper are pointless and utterly unfocused.But still, Adventures in Babysitting is much too likable a film to be easily dismissed. Its just that it could have been so much more. Its only a diverting escalation of bad events when it could have been a blackly funny, even revolutionary teen movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great fun movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is hugely underrated, it's always surprised me that it isn't more widely acclaimed. The story follows a teenager babysitter who ends up, for one reason or another, taking her charges through the city and through a catalogue of incidents and accidents. It doesn't set out to be anything other than a fun movie and it succeeds admirably - it's simply great fun from start to finish.OK, it's not deep and meaningful but it has oodles of charm and is pacey and funny. There's also some very good set pieces, I particularly liked the scene in the club when they have to 'sing the blues'.The film is also well produced, directed and acted. The plot is not complicated but the script is tight and the dialogue believable. It's not a film that really needs analysing, just watching and enjoying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING, in my opinion, is an excellent comedy about surviving on your own when you're a minor! I thought that Daryl (Anthony Rapp) was absolutely annoying! You'd have to have seen this movie if you want to know why. Also, if you ask me, what Mike (Bradley Whitford) did to Chris (Elusabeth Shue) was absolutely cold! On the other hand, every mishap that occurred after Chris' car tire blew was absolutely hilarious. Also, what Chris did was absolutely brave, although Dan (George Newbern) was kind of creepy. If a friend of mine were in that kind of predicament, I'd probably do anything I could to help. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was ideally cast, the direction was flawless, and production design was spectacular, and the performances were top-grade. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent comedy about surviving on your own when you're a minor! I guarantee you you'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this on HBO or one of the movie channels when it first came to television and I knew nothing about and had never heard about. It's title sounded like a juvenile kids movie but I checked it out to see what it was about. I never expected to see more than a few minutes before I turned the channel but to my surprise I started liking it. It's a fast paced implausible story with a lot of adventure in it. A teenager on babysitting duty takes her charges and their neighbor friend from the suburbs to downtown Chicago to pick up her friend who's stranded at a bus depot. The simple plan soon goes awry and the adventures of their evening begin. Television writer David Simkins wrote the fun and imaginative script. In his directorial debut, Chris Columbus who would go on to direct the Home Alone and Harry Potter films as well as Mrs. Doubtfire, makes the leap from screenwriter of such films as Gremlins and Goonies to director. Elizabeth Shue in just her third film turns in a great comedic performance leading a cast of unknowns of which many would go on to successful film and television careers. Among the cast are Maia Brewton, Keith Coogan, Anthony Rapp, Penelope Ann Miller and Vincent D'Onofrio. Look for Lolita Davidovich, John Cusak and Andrew Shue in bit roles. Even the film's writer David Simkins shows up on screen. My favorite scene is with blues great Albert Collins when the kids get on stage in an uptown bar they have unknowingly fled into and are forced to improve a blues song so they break into Babysitter's Blues. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Adventures in Babysitting" is sort of ridiculous - maybe completely hokey - but harmless nonetheless. For the most part, this is one of those teen movies that they cranked out in the '80s. It has Chicago teenager Chris Parker (Elisabeth Shue) babysitting for some people, but a series of events lead her and the children on a wild goose chase all over the Windy City. I really liked the scene on the metro, and also the scene in the office building. Nothing special, but good for a few laughs.Who ever would have guessed that the director behind this would later helm the "Harry Potter" movies?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I quite like '80s US comedies as a whole but ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING left me cold. It's a little too kid-focused, for me, and the character that Elizabeth Shue plays is rather irritating throughout. While it's nice to see a movie that encapsulates plenty of popular culture from the era, the resultant adventure is rather silly and the direction from Chris Columbus more than a little lacking.In essence, a novice babysitter takes her various charges and goes on an adventure in downtown Chicago. The group get involved with various criminal types as well as various blossoming romances and the like, and there are nice supporting roles for actors like John Davis Chandler. Overall, though, this is supposed to be a comedy, and I'm afraid there was very little here that I laughed at.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chris Parker (Elisabeth Shue)'s big anniversary date gets canceled at the last minute by boyfriend Mike (Bradley Whitford). With nothing to do, she goes to babysit Thor obsessed little Sara Anderson (Maia Brewton). Her geeky brother Brad (Keith Coogan) is in love with Chris. His nerd friend Daryl Coopersmith (Anthony Rapp) comes over. Chris' friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller) tried to run away from home and is left penniless in downtown Chicago. Chris drives downtown and is forced to take along the three kids. She gets a flat tire and the adventures in babysitting begin.This is a second rate John Hughes wannabe movie. There's even a musical interlude although it's not really done right. It has the distinction of being Chris Columbus' first directing effort who would also direct similar movies like Home Alone. Elisabeth Shue is likable enough but she's not really America's sweetheart type. She's into her 20s by then and a bit too old to play a teen. It's basically a harmless kid movie playing up the suburb downtown divide. Shue is kind of broad with her naivety but there are a few chuckles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The correct way to sit on a baby.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adventures in Babysitting is one of those movies that all of the kids back in the day saw apart from me. No particular reason, I just never got around to it. With the new Blu-ray I figured now would be right time to catch up on what I missed.It's not a John Hughes movie, but it does have a similar aesthetic and is set in a cold, snowy Chicago (a common Hughes theme), and it's the director debut of Chris Columbus who worked with Hughes on the first two Home Alone movies. Babysitting is quite similar in that is has a bunch of kids/teens getting into all kinds of hi-jinks while evading and outsmarting crooked grown-ups.Elizabeth Shue plays Chris Parker (no relation to Jennifer Parker from BTTF) a girl who has been stood-up by her sleazeball boyfriend and ends up babysitting for a wealthy couple while they go hob-nobbing in the city. Though content to sit in the house all night she gets a frantic call from her friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller) who is trapped in an inner city bus station and needs rescued. Multiple detours and deviations make the rescue no easy task. I guess in this sense the movie feels a little bit like Planes, Trains and Automobiles.It's all inoffensive and good-natured, though I was surprised to hear a couple of F-bombs in there, and some of the dialogue is a little raunchy. Babysitting is no classic, but has lasting appeal and is a fun ride. Michael Kamen also provides a score which sounds like a Die Hard prototype, lending a little more weight to the adventure than would be typical. Stay watching until after the credits for an extra scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>for the genre, it's awfully good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1980s saw a proliferation of "teen movies". About 90% of them had nothing new to really say, starred teen "heart throbs" and were marketed ONLY to younger, dumber audiences. I was in my teens and twenties in this era, but even I thought these movies were awful==obviously I was the correct age but just "didn't get it". Uh, huh.Many of these movies featured crude and dumb humor, ample boobies (which is odd, considering the audience technically was too young to be admitted to many of these dreadful films) and low production values. As I said before, the movies seemed to be marketed to dumb people. Don't believe me?! Well think back to such films as the PORKY'S movies, Freddy Kruger films, HALLOWEEN, the later ROCKY films, etc. These films truly were awful.So, with all this dreck, it was nice to see a few teen-oriented films that didn't insult the audience or feature mind-rot. ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING (as well as films such as BETTER OFF DEAD) was a decent film that actually had something to say to teens--and it could be enjoyed by adults as well (what a concept). While the story does have its sexy jokes, teens who know more than adults and silly escapades, it manages some originality and some genuine laughs. It's cute how an innocent little trek into the city results in a long series of unbelievable and dangerous consequences--many of which are quite funny. Give it a try--it's not "rocket science" or Masterpiece Theatre, but it's good old fashioned silly fun.PS--watch ALL the movie--including the very end. Many times on TV they cut off the very end, but on video or DVD it's there. So, DON'T turn it off when the credits roll.</fullReview>

My daughter who was about 10 and born in the 90's, loved this movie. I bought the DVD and she watched over and over again.To me what was great about this movie is that it reminded me about high school and how stupid the high school scene could be. Kris was the popular beautiful senior girl and she was not supposed to talk to freshman boy. There are so many great quotes in this flick, but my favorite is at the end of the movie when after their "adventure", she says to the boy who is in love with her, "I don't ignore my friends!"</fullReview>

I'm 18, and I was fortunate enough to watch this movie even if it was yesterday.The movie is really fun to watch and there is suspense so cleverly set in the movie that the viewer is often in a false sense of security and suddenly it changes. This was not the first movie in which I fell in love with Elisabeth Shue, her parts in Back To The Future III and Hollow Man were quite impressive. OK, Alright, I admit she is 24 years older than me but she is still as beautiful as she ever was. Anyway, where was I?. Oh yes, the movie. People , you need to watch this for yourself and this is a must have for your DVD library, you'll never tire out by listening to the brilliant songs and the music. Psst, Elisabeth sings a song herself in the movie. Hope you enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Elisabeth Shue's suburban babysitting gig turns into a comedy of errors when her girlfriend Penelope Ann Miller places a frantic telephone call and begs Shue to rescue her where she is stranded in the bus station in downtown Chicago. Shue loads the two young kids in her charge into the family station wagon but the car breaks down and starts a series of mishaps. Adventures in Babysitting is Chris Columbus's (Mrs. Doubtfire) first film and a very early film for Shue as well. Shue is an absolute doll and her performance carries the film. Vincent D'Onofrio appears in an early role. He was also in Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket the same year this movie was released.Adventures In Babysitting is not a great film, just a light hearted film that is fun to watch, especially Shue's appealing character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adventures in Babysitting (1987) was another star vehicle for rising starlet Elisabeth Shue. The story follows Miss Shue as she is assigned to babysit a bunch of precocious kids. One of them is obsessed with the Marvel Comics comic book hero Thor whilst the oldest one thinks he's older than he is and tries to prove his "machismo" whenever the opportunity arises. The kids get into all sorts of misadventures with Elisabeth trying to keep them from getting into all sorts of trouble. Will Elisabeth keep the kids in line whilst the parents are out? Can she keep her job and her sanity? To find out you'll have to watch "The Adentures in Babysitting".An okay eighties film that was trying to make Elisabeth Shue into a Hollywood name. She has already made her big debut in The Karate Kid. It would been in the movie Cocktail that would solidify her career. Miss Shue could go nowhere but up from here!Mildy recommended,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a family comedy about Chris, a suburban babysitter who has to take her charges into Chicago at night to rescue a friend who ran away from home. In what should be a simple task, everything that could possibly go wrong does, with hilarious results. Elisabeth Shue does a wonderful job as the babysitter, and Maia Brewton will steal your heart as Sarah, the wise and resourceful little sister. Keith Coogan plays big brother Brad, and Anthony Rapp is fun as Darryl Coopersmith, Brad's fun-loving but short-on-brains buddy. A couple of highlights are when Brad makes an insulting comment about Sarah's favorite superhero, Thor. She demands that he take it back or she'll blab to Chris about his secret crush on her (Chris was standing within earshot the whole time). Another hilarious moment is when, while at the bus station, Chris' poor-sighted friend loses her glasses. She picks up and fondles what she believes is a kitten, but totally loses it when told that it is actually a giant rat. This is a fun movie that can be enjoyed by all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chris Columbus was never exactly God's gift to the world of directors, as shown with his work on "Harry Potter &amp; The Chamber of Secrets". As a writer of comedy he wasn't too bad, but as a director he was somewhat lacking. This, his first foray into the world of directing, isn't half bad and actually misleads the audience into thinking he had promise as a director.After playing the love interest in "The Karate Kid" and prior to playing Michael J. Fox's girlfriend in the sequels to "Back to the Future", Elisabeth Shue, clearly too old to be playing a teenager, agrees to babysit some neighbor's kids when her boyfriend (George Newbern, the future voice of Superman on "Justice League") calls off their date. When her best friend (Penelope Anne Miller) calls her up and asks her for a lift in the city, she drags the kids along when she tries to rescue her friend from the bus station, but a flat tire is the beginning of an adventure that leads to the Liz and the gang being chased by gangsters who want a Playboy magazine with important information written on it (and a woman who looks kind of like Liz).Liz herself isn't bad, and it's a bit of a shame that she didn't get the kind of career that Julia Roberts later racked up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Director of this Film is Stalking me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cuddly Kids Daytime Nursery in Aylesbury WON'T look after koalas. Even though the koala I took round was dressed as a baby and I think is between 2 and 5 years old, the staff refused to accept it saying something along the lines of ?dangerous animal' or ?health and safety' or some ridiculous nonsense.Of course then this woman started screaming and Rufus jumped on her face and wouldn't let go, or maybe he jumped on her face and she started screaming, I can't remember. Anyway, I'd managed to reach the bus stop before the police caught me and informed me that the RSPCA were on their way. I told them that I was being victimised and that it could have been any trouserless men in the area responsible letting a vicious animal loose in a childcare centre. But as always they didn't listen and I had ANOTHER lecture from Derek Palmers about animal welfare.Of course I might have guessed that the movie director (and I think stalker) Chris Columbus would have been responsible for yet again mirroring my actions in another one of his films, ?Adventures in Babysitting'. I still remember ?Mrs Doubtfire' Chris and let me tell you that you're lucky I didn't sue you over that! I could get better legal advice from a packet of cereal!*Like the outrageously libellous ?Mrs Doubtfire', ?Adventures in Babysitting' decides to give false information concerning what animals will and won't be looked after by people in the childcare industry. And yes, I do know that there are no koala's in this film but do they offer any advice on what exactly ?babysitting' involves? No they do not. Imagine if I'd hired a film out from the library entitled ?How to Trace your Family Tree' and all it contained was Elizabeth Shue climbing trees or something, I'd storm into the library and demand my money back! Well I would if it cost anything to hire out instructional videos from the library, and they hadn't banned me.Honestly, I swear that Columbus must follow me around and just makes his films to annoy me. In fact I've recently been taking a different route to Aylesbury Job Centre, occasionally stopping and spinning around, just in case. Chris, if you're reading this then I'll tell you now that I am looking forward to your new film ?NFL Dad', but if it's anything to do with the court injunction Shelly has taken out against me, then you'll be hearing from my solicitor.*The advice got me arrested, again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yesterday, I was walking through the local Zellers store, when I saw a copy of this film on DVD for only $11.00 cdn. Since it was one of my favorite movies as a kid, I decided to pick it up. And you know what? It is still very entertaining for the whole family.Elisabeth Shue plays Chris, a girl who is stood up by her boyfriend. Having nothing else to do, she decides to babysit for the Andersons. However, when she receives a call from her best friend who just ran away from home, she heads into the city...with the kids in tow.The film is geared towards a younger crowd, however, it will amuse older audiences. Especially those that grew up in the 80's (like me), and can relate to the styles and music of the era.Although it is geared towards children, there are a few scenes that you might want to cover up your childs ears. Especially the scene with the gang on the subway. I can't believe that this scene made it into the final cut.All in all...a good film. Pick it up if you haven't seen it, and enjoy the old 80's comedies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm so glad I did not waste my money to see this in the show. Unfortunately, I saw it on video. This movie never rises above the level of a mediocre made for TV movie. How many times have stories about babysitting teens been done? Did we really need to see one more? The plot also plays into the worst stereotypes about big cities vs. the supposedly pristine suburbs. A waste of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie under its Australian release title, "A Night On The Town". While the target audience members are the youngsters, adults will get some belly laughs too. My personal favourite is the "scrape scrap scrape!" horror story while driving, cashing the cheque, as well as the whole porn star bit. The kid actors are all likeable, and all up, this movie is one to see on a quiet night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this movie is fluff. But it's such pure, unadulterated fluff that it should be labeled as such by the Food and Drug Administration. I discovered this film on premium cable circa 1990, one night when I was feeling deeply depressed, and it revived my spirits instantly. Elizabeth Shue, back before she became (somewhat) famous, is the perfect sexually-nonthreatening sexpot and I fell instantly in love with her. The kids are well-cast and the youngest child is about as good as a central casting Cute Kid could possibly be. There's even an early performance by Penelope Anne Miller.If you're looking for more than fluff, look elsewhere. But AiBS is the quintessential cotton candy film. Come to it in the right spirits and you will go away with the wonderful taste of sugar in your mouth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic!! [spoilers]</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies of the 1980's. It's a hilarious adventure-comedy about a babysitter named Chris [Elisabeth Shue] who has to babysit Brad and Sara Anderson, but when she gets a call from a friend at the airport across town, asking her to pick her up, Chris takes Brad, Sarah, and Brad's friend Daryl on a little car trip. Instead of getting a little car trip, they encounter a series of problems such as getting involved in a stolen car ring. This was Chris Columbus' movie debut. In my opinion, it's his best movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comments on the characters; praising Anthony Rapp's performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely one of my all time favorite movies. It's plot --though somewhat, perhaps deliberately, unrealistic-- is engaging and thrilling to follow. The characters are well portrayed and endear themselves to the audience with their reactions to the different situations thrown their way. Hats off to Shue for her remarkable performance. My heart, however, belongs to Anthony Rapp, who's character I found both charming and exasperating; the perfect mix, if pulled off correctly, to create a loveable character. Rapp also provided the right amount of believability and humour to the movie, adding charisma to the requisite comedian of a group of people. Perhaps more than anyone, he kept the movie down to earth with his depiction of the typical, sex-crazed teenage boy who just wants a little adventure... and maybe a woman to go along with it. Adventures in Babysitting is a must see for anyone who wants to sit back, enjoy themselves, and have a good laugh. Not recommended for the serious movie go-er, however, as its light-hearted plot and tendency towards the far-fetched might put one who is looking for intensity off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Chris Parker comes to babysit for Sara Anderson things start to turn crazy. First Chris gets a call from her friend Brenda claiming that she "ran away from home". That's when Chris takes Sara (along with Sara's brother Brad and Brad's friend Daryl Coopersmith) to the bus stop because that's where Brenda is who also claims that she is in danger. On the way Chris gets a flat tire and she forgot her purse. Then she meets John Pruitt who said that he would help them get a new tire. John gets a phone call from Dawson (man who works at a garage) who said that (it was either John's wife or girlfriend) was with someone else. That's when John and this other man get into a fight and at the same time Joe Gipp steals the car that Chris Sara Brad and Daryl were in while they were in it. Unfortunately Joe's boss in "carthieving" wasn't very happy when he saw Chris Sara Brad and Daryl. That's when Joe's boss "took the brady bunch upstairs". Chris Sara Brad and Daryl escaped soon after that. They were then being chased by a bunch of car thieves and they ended up Running into the stage of a Blues concert. Since no one could leave without singing the blues Chris Sara, Brad, Daryl sung a song and got to leave (but they were still being chased by the mob who steals cars. This time Chris, Sara, Brad, and Daryl ended up on a subway train where two gangs were going to fight. Lets just say that Brad had to get rushed to the emergency room and get stitches on his foot. The chase finally ends on top of a big building which was ironically the same building where Brad and Sara's parents were. Sara was saved from falling off of the building. After that Chris rushed to get Sara, Brad, and Daryl home before Brad and Sara's parents got there (Chris got lucky and made it). So many cool and exciting things happen in this movie and I like it because since there ARE a lot of exciting scenes (to me) this movie keeps my eyes glued to the Television set. Adventures in Babysitting is a really cool movie.</fullReview>

I wouldn't call it fantastic flim making, but I would call it very entertaining. And you know what- sometimes that's all a movie needs to be. This film sets out to present an outrageous and comedic set of mishaps for four suburban kids, while keeping our attention and making us laugh. It works. The acting is adequate and the characters are fun. From a decade of ninety minute no-brainers, this movie is among the best and really is a lot of fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fun flick that is similar to the 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' formula, but provides its own laughs. Titled 'A Night Out on the Town' here, this film was also one of my favourites when I was younger.'Adventures in Babysitting' is Chris Columbus' first film as director and it stars Elizabeth Shue (Leaving Las Vegas), Keith Coogan (Toy Soldiers), Anthony Rapp (Dazed and Confused) and Penepole Anne Miller (Kindergarten Cop). The whole cast is good and provides sufficient laughs through a predictable but fun script; that has a formula similar to many comedies.The title of this film pretty much sums up the main plot, but it's a fun ride even after repeated viewings! Bradley Whitford (Scent of a Woman, Revenge of the Nerds 2) plays a schmuck yet again, and Lolita Davidovich has a minor role. Although similar to many 80s comedies, 'Adventures in Babysitting' still holds it own. A good family film to rent! **** out of *****!</fullReview>

However this is obvious a family movie, so all the adventure is mild mannered and, well, fun...Just set your mind to zero, expect harmless entertainment to kill some time, and watch it. It's not that bad. It's a bit like a comic book (actually, Thor-fans will like this movie even more).Elizabeth Shue is dependable, the kids are less obnoxious than you would expect, and there are some nice supporting roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Elisabeth Shue is incredibly winning in her first lead film role. The plot concerns Chris Parker (Shue) and her babysitting charges as they go into Chicago to pick up Shue's friend. Of course, this easy task becomes more and more complicated as disaster after disaster ensues. The film gets silly after a while and gets bogged down in a car stealing plot, but remains enjoyable. Shue is the reason to see this film, and she manages to hold it together and keep us interested.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven 'After Hours' for the pre-teen audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I though this film was pretty good about 13 years ago when it first came out, but seeing it now it was a lot easier to pick the faults. The story is uneven, and some of the sub-plots are just plain stupid. One that springs to mind was Dawson the mechanic as Thor, this was such a weak link and just did not fit in with the rest of the film. We all knew that Sarah was a bit Thor fan, but the scene with Dawson was cheesy, contrived and just plain stupid. Most of the other sub-plots were all O.K, in fact some were fairly amusing. I liked the singing the blues scene, the escape scene and the last 15-20 minutes were not too bad at all. But some of the dialogue seemed a bit contrived and it seemed like the writers were just missing the mark with a lot of things as they were treated on such a superficial level. Still Shue was appealing in one of her first lead roles, and I did like Miller in the understated role as Shue's best friend. The film does seem to have dated a bit due to the fashions adorned, especially Shues and the kids.</fullReview>

Obviously designed for the youth market, it is appealing for all ages. You don't have to think about this piece of mind candy, just sit back and enjoy it. Maia Brewton is precociously charming and Elizabeth Shue gives a fine and credible performance. Penelope Ann Miller is hysterical as the stranded and woe-begone Brenda. The plot, though contrived, leads you from one belly laugh to the next. The ad-libbed blues song is a highlight, as well as Brenda's efforts to help a baby "kitten".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Godfather, Casablanca...Adventures In Babysitting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every generation has its classics, and for those who grew up in the 80's "Adventures In Babysitting" is one of (if not the best) films of the decade...perhaps even of the century.Unfortunately, it was overlooked when the top 100 films of all-time were picked, but everyone knows it deserved a spot. Years from now, "Adventures In Babysitting" will be mentioned in the same breath as such great films as "The Godfather," "Citizen Kane," and "The Goonies" (another film that was erroneously snubbed when the top films were voted on).Sara, Kris, Daryl, Brad, Pruitt, Joe Gipp, and Brenda. It is nearly impossible to have a conversation about classic film characters without mentioning these 7 greats (often referred to by film historians as the "Magnificent Seven"). Some might argue that Vito Corleone or Charles Foster Kane, or Chunk from "Goonies" are the most unforgettable film characters, but I defy anyone to find as many classic characters in one film as there are in "AIB".Much like the name suggests, "Adventures In Babysitting" delivers heart-pounding excitement and gut-wrenching thrills, but there is so much more to this movie that many people simply can not understand how it was possible to create such a masterpiece. One moment we are worrying about Brenda while the "Fab 4" (Daryl, Kris, Sara, and Brad) are running for their lives while managing to provide us, the audience, with many moments of laughter and excitement.There are always those who fear change. When Hank Aaron challenged Babe Ruth's career home run record there were many people who opposed it, and as it goes there are those who will do anything to keep "AIB" from fulfilling its fate as the greatest film of all time, as voted by IMDB users. By giving it average or below average votes, a fickle attempt has been made by this "coup de etat" to keep "AIB" from the top. It has worked thus far, but even these AIB haters can not keep "Adventures In Babysitting" from becoming the undisputed top film of all-time.</fullReview>

"A Night on the Town" is Chris Columbus' directorial debut. The writer come director has made the movie work quite well, even if the 'fish out of water' situations are never riotous.

Unfortunately, such a film with such a lack of laughs and points to hold the viewer's interest winds up being not a very good way to make a starring debut.

		<shortDescription>A big guilty favorite!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A babysitter (Elisabeth Shue who's just fantastic) has 2 kids to take care of (and another kid who pops in). Then she gets a call from her best friend who's stranded in Chicago and needs a ride home. She goes to pick her up, with the 3 kids, and gets involved in some wild (and totally improbable) adventures while trying to find her friend.OK, this isn't a good movie--the plot is ridiculous, the kids act like adults (and vice versa) and most of the humor is pretty sophomoric. But, I love it! I laugh out loud at all the stupid jokes and find the film fast-paced and engaging. Also good use of music, beautiful shots of Chicago at night and good performances by everybody (especially Shue). Is this a good movie? No. Is it fun? Very! Well worth catching."Don't f**k with the babysitter!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Peak of the 1980s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chris Parker (Elisabeth Shue) agrees to babysit after her date stands her up. Expecting a dull evening, Chris settles down with three kids for a night of TV... and boredom. But when her frantic friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller) calls and pleads to be rescued from the bus station in downtown Chicago, the evening soon explodes into an endless whirl of hair-raising adventures! For whatever reason, this film is rated relatively low, even below the disappointing "Pretty in Pink" (easily the worst Hughes-related film). Why? This marks the pinnacle of 1980s coming-of-age films, with a plot similar to (yet completely different from) "Ferris Bueller's Day Off".How can anyone watch this and not think it was the best 90 minutes they can recall in recent memory?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adventures in babysitting is a cute film about a 17 year old named Chris Parker(Elizabeth Shue) who gets a slap in the face reject from her boyfriend( "My little sister got sick") that he couldn't make their anniversary dinner, and gets stuck with babysitting a little girl for the evening. The young girl, Sara, has an older brother Brad who is head over heels for Chris (He even writes love poems about her!) Chris'friend Brenda calls the Anderson house and pleads with Chris to pick her up from the Chicago bus station (DOWNTOWN).Brad and His friend Daryl end up going along for the ride, and it is one H*LL of a ride! This was one of my sister and I's favorite movies as kids. We end up burning up a VCR from rewinding and watching it so much ( we cried for a week). Thank goodness for DVD's! If you have pre-teens, kids 8-14, they will really appreciate this movie, because it empathizes with having to have a babysitter. The soundtrack is filled with 87' style songs and some oldies. It is a great Friday night watch for the whole family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly smart funny movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie when I was young and vaguely remember it being funny. I had a chance to see this movie again recently and was greatly surprised on how well the story and the characters were written. One would think by the title of the film that it would be another low-budget movie but it was not. It had a good story, well-developed characters, and good performance by young actors and actresses. *************POSSIBLE SPOILERS***************The movie stars the young Elizabeth Shue who portrays a senior in high school in a rich suburb of Chicago, where she has just been asked to babysit her neighbors children after her boyfriend just canceled an important date. The neighbors children consist of a young girl who is infatuated with the Marvel comic book hero Thor and a fifteen year old male teenager who has been in love with this babysitter since she began to babysit him at a young age.The children's parents leave for a party and the babysitter relaxes thinking this will be another boring night, however, she receives a call from her friend who just ran away from home and is at the train station in Chicago. She is scared and wants her to come and pick her up. The babysitter cannot leave the children alone and so she takes them and one of the teenagers' friend on a wild and crazy adventure.In her pursuit to pick up her friend, they have to deal with being in a love quarrel where pistol is being fired, and then, being in a stolen car that results in gangster-like characters chasing them because they posses information about their operation.The reason why this movie is so funny is that the characters are rich and come from a secluded suburban area who never had to deal with the hard life of the inner-city. Their reaction and the solution they come up with to resolve some of the conflicts that they encounter is truly funny. One scene I really enjoyed was when they were in a blues club and they were told they could not leave without singing the blues. Really funny!****************END POSSIBLE SPOILERS**************This is a good family movie for generally all family members to see. But don't be dissuaded by thinking that by being a family type movie that it will be boring to adults because the story and the characters will quickly disarm you with its surprisingly witty story and smart dialogue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dramatic Tale of A Babysitter, A City, and Three Kids With Attitude!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, it's not really a drama. This movie stars Elisabeth Shue, we all remember her from "The Karate Kid" and "Back to the Future IIand III." Elisabeth has a starring role in this film because in the Back to the Future films, her character was always unconscious.She was a really good looking teenager back in these days. Now, she's all grown-up. There's also Keth Coogan, grandson of Jackie Coogan from"The Addams Family". Anthony Rapp, who looks like the guy from "Pete &amp; Pete". Maia Brewton, she was in the first "Back to the Future". When Chris Parker (Shue) is dropped by her boyfriend, she agrees to babysit for the Andersons. There's Brad (Coogan) and Sara(Brewton). The evening looks boring, until Chris' friend, Brenda, calls from the bus station and says she ran away from home and is terrorized by weirdos at the station so Chris is asked to go into downtown Chicago and rescue her. Only problem: What to do with the kids? So they jump in the Parker family's station wagon when Brad's friend, Daryl (Rapp) pops up. So they take him too. Daryl brought along a Playboy magazine and one of the centerfold girls looks like Chris! Brad tosses the magazine out the window. En route to town, the tire blows out and there's no spare. Also, Chris forgot her purse. Soon a tow truck stops and who comes to the aide of the kids but Handsome John Pruitt! He's got a friendly face and a hook on his right hand. He takes them, and the car, to the garage to get a tire, when Pruitt races to his house because his wife is seeing another man. So Chris, Brad, Sara, and Daryl hide in some guy's car, which was being comendeered by a car theif! His name is Joe Gipp. Joe takes them to a warehouse where something big and unlawful is going on. The kids escape, by walking across the rafters over ameeting but before so, Daryl snatched a Play Boy from the office desk. The crooks soon find out and they chase the kids. They run into a blue's club and, well according to Albert Collins, "Nobody leaves withoutsinging the blues", so Chris takes the microphone and sings the ultimate song: "Babysittin' Blues"; Chris laughs when Brad says he's attracted to her. They race onto a subway, and a chain of events leads to Brad getting a switchblade in the foot. Daryl said they must take care of it immediately or he'd get "Lockjaw, rabies, scabies,emphysema." They go to the hospital where Brad get's 'one stitch'. At the bus station, Brenda loses her glasses, mistakes a rat for a cat, and tries to buy a hot dog with a check. And when she uses the phone booth, someone complains that she's in their house. The kids followed Daryl into a college frat party where Chris meets a handsome new beau; Then they go to Dawson's Garage. Sara claims that Dawson looks like The Mighty Thor! They get the station wagon back and en route to home, Chris finds her boyfriend's car at the restaurant they WERE going to eat at that night, only her boyfriend claimed his sister was sick and he had to stay home and help out. So while Chris, Brad and Daryl go in the restaurant, Sara runs to look in a toy store, but get's chased by the crooks (the rightful owners of the Play Boy Daryl had stolen and put in Sara's backpack). They all head for the giant building the Andersons were at aparty in. It even leads up to a rescue from the roof and Joe Gipp explains why the magazine was so important. The four kids drive to the bus station, rescue Brenda, then Chris cleans the Anderson house with extreme enginuity. Then everything was A-OKAY and Daryl thanks Chris for giving him the best night of his life. "So far". What was the "So far" thing for?? Anyway, the boy Chris met in town suddenly pulls up and says he's looking for a babysitter. For himself. It has a happy ending. Good acting. Great story! Also, earlier in the film, when Chris, Brad and Sara are in the living room watching TV, listen carefully and you can hear music from the movie "Halloween". This is probably because Debra Hill, who co-produced "Halloween" also worked on this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do places and events like this exist / happen?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One for the kids me thinks. Wow this is a dated movie that as a British person I find real hard to empathise with. Do we really have our own version of these white middle class suburbs where you just do not see poor or ethnic people (unless they are serving you at the mall!!). I am not sure we do (we are just too densely populated). Anyway the movie. What we have here is basically a baby sitting assignment gone wrong that forges friendship. Whilst not the greatest premise ever seen (even for a teen movie) is not bad and when you sew in the sub plot of the relationship of the lead character (Elizabeth Shue) and a couple of cameo's by future television stars Bradley Whitford and Vincent D'Onofrio (with a particularly funny take on Thor). Whilst babysitting after being stood up on a date Chris (a female Chris) gets a call from a friend stranded at the local bus station and has to take the kids she's sitting for into town to rescue her friends. All sorts of high jinks occur with no notable acting or direction (but then Chris Columbus never really improved there). With everything coming together pretty much as any seasoned viewer would expect. Nothing great but not harmful either. Would I watch it again? Probably not, unless I was holes up in a hotel on holiday and it was the only English speaking movie I could find. Then maybe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>5 out of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is too silly, unintelligent and childish for adults, and there is too much swearing for kids, so there really isn't an audience for it. The tv version that has the bad words dubbed out would be ok for kids, and I am sure they would enjoy the movie. I was neither for or against it, so it gets a middle of the road 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cool 80's adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW A girl is told by her jock boyfriend that he cant go out because his sister is ill, so the girl takes a job babysitting the Anderson kids. The oldest is a boy who is obsessed with Cris (the babysitter) and the youngest is a girl obsessed with superhero Thor. The boy is suppose to stay at his friends house but dares not move now that Cris is there. Soon Cris' best friend calls from the city needing help because she ran away from home. Against the rules and better judgment Cris goes to get her friend and has to take the boys friend Daryl along to keep him from telling on them. On the way there they have a blow-out and get rescued by a crazy tow-truck driver with a hook for a hand, he ends up at his house fighting a man who is sleeping with his wife. Shots are fired and they hide in a car which is being hijacked. The car thief takes them to a chop shop where they are held hostage and ultimately have to escape. Crazy Daryl stole a playboy from the chop shop guys and it had important info inside and now they are being chased by a gang of thugs. They go through one hell of an adventure trying to get their car back, get it fixed, pick up the runaway girl and try to get home and back to normal before mom and dad get home at 1.Pretty good story. I like these wacky comedies, but this one lacked so much. It was good, but I never was a huge fan of this film. It is very predictable at times, not very charming and just lacks the laughs for me.Chris Columbus made his directorial debut and although he did a good job, it wasn't outstanding. Actors all did a good job; Elisabeth Shue, Keith Coogan, Anthony Rapp, and Bradley Whitford. Debra Hill was one of the producers and there is a few inside jokes here referring to Halloween which is the film that made her famous.The film had some cheesy parts which really made me like the movie a lot less, the main cheese moment was a blues song the kids sung with the legendary Albert Collins. That was pushing it a bit too far right there.Fans of 80's comedies will love this. It does hold up pretty well even though its over 20 years old. I gave it 3/10 stars simply because it just wasn't great enough or funny enough to make me love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An attempt at a John Hughes movie without John Hughes -- it doesn't work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie but not in a single sitting. What happens it that it is playing on the TV, I watch for a few minutes, find that I have take all that I can take and then leave the room. During those few minutes I do not laugh once, experience no pleasure in what I am viewing, and find myself more depressed that angry. Interestingly, I am told the psychological states are incompatible, that is, one cannot be angry and depressed at the same time. This movie tests that theory.I think part of the problem is that I spent nearly ten years in Chicago so as I am watching the scenes I am thinking of my own experiences in that rotten town and thus I am clearly bringing a lot of my baggage to the piece. It is entirely possible, I am willing to concede, that if you are not a Chicago denizen you will find the piece amusing. If so, I envy you.And yet. John Hughes set his films in Chicago and those movies worked for me. I think the difference is that Hughes was a first rate writer. I think it obvious he knew how to comically balance his situations, as well as make his characters both sympathetic and believable. In a comedy (as distinguished from a farce) this balance vital. And it is not easy to achieve. If it was everyone would be making great movies and we would not have to fret as we do in the real world wondering when genius will ever appear. In "Adventures in Babysitting," it doesn't. I hated those characters. There is a difference, profound and real, between sympathetic and simply pathetic.For me every scene in this movie is a clunker. There is no humor, no humanity, no people one can recognize. Just actors reading their lines as if it all they can do to restrain themselves from screaming them out, certain that finally hilarity will ensue, this time for sure! It's like watching the antics of very bad comedians. It's embarrassing and after a while, usually at the point when I get up and leave, I start to feel pity for all concerned, which is a kind of emotional connection, I suppose. Elizabeth Shue is terrible. She doesn't act, certainly not act comically, and it's entirely possible she can't. But lord how she tries. She looks older than 17, and acts way younger like a seven-year old straining in a school play certain that this is how one gets an award. And she is not alone. It is as if everyone cannot relax and let the tale flow. As if everyone simply has no idea what they are doing. Now, this was an early effort for Chris Columbus and he clearly would improve and having better writers (e.g. John Hughes himself) certainly helped, so perhaps some forgiveness is in order. But the film just reeks of desperation. Yet like I said it may work for some. If any of the above appeals to you, and it clearly did some of the reviewers, then go get the DVD and knock yourself out. Otherwise, avoid this mess like you would a dark Chicago alley where as you hurry by you can only see shadows and hear muttered threats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guilty pleasure, worthless movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no idea why I watch this movie. I really don't. I love Chicago movies, so maybe that's why. Anyway, this movie would have been better if when those kids decided to travel into the city they were killed instead. That would have been better, that little girl is really annoying, and who the hell is into Thor that much? Surly not little girls.What this movie does really well is show exactly how people from the suburbs are. They're worthless, useless wastes of good organs. This movies hits the nail on the head when showing/describing surbanites. The people portrayed in this movie are EXACTLY how people from the suburbs are, even those this was made 20 years ago, they still are the same! It will never change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yikes, watch out, this kind of Adventure you can do without</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would not recommend this movie. Even though it is rated G and is clearly for kids there is quite a lot of swearing (including the dreaded 'F' and 'S' words). This kind of language doesn't offend me particularly but in a kids film? Come on.There was also quite a bit of implied sexual content, between one of the early adolescent male characters and any willing adult woman who came along - including a prostitute! The acting was as good as it gets in this genre of film but the story line was very very cheesy and even my four year old remarked that it was 'stupid'.Despite having Elizabeth Shue, this film is definitely not worth checking out if you haven't seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is offensive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To this day, I have never seen Elizabeth Shue in anything else because of the stench of this movie. Poorly acted, poorly plotted and racially Neanderthal, it took place in a Chicago where every black person apparently lived in a blues club. . SPOILER AHEAD. . . . . ..SPOILER: Her "blues" solo was even more painful to watch than her clueless acting and the intro into it - 'Nobody leaves without singing the blues' -- was as dumb as a post. The children her character was babysitting were insufferable and well before the movie's end I was wishing for something horrible to happen to all of them.I have to say though, there is one special thing about this movie; it takes a lot for a movie to offend me but this smoldering piece of tripe did what Chopper, the Phantom Menace and Catwoman could not -- make me sick to my stomach.</fullReview>
